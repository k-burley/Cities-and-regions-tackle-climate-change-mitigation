Several thermophilous representatives of the Cerithioidea, which indicate a warm subtropical climate, are absent from the extant Iberian fauna and restricted to North Africa, the SE Mediterranean and Asia Minor. The fossil record suggests that the different continental aquatic ecosystems were colonised at different times in the Cenozoic: distribution pattern of Melanoides palaeocommunities (Oligocene, Ebro Basin; Miocene, Albacete; Pliocene, Barcelona; Lower Pleistocene, Guadix Baza Basin) and Potamides palaeocommunities (Oligocene Ebro Basin; Miocene, Duero Basin, Ebro Basin; Early Pleistocene, Guadix Baza Basin) and their successive disappearance since the mid- to Late Miocene in the northern Spain basins reflect the global Late Cenozoic temperature cooling. Potamides palaeocommunities in playa lake-environments of the Guadix Baza Basin indicate a semi-arid climate context, similar to the modern North African climate. Humid intervals are indicated by syntopic Melanoides palaeocommunities that colonised hyposaline environments, similar to the colonisation of aquatic ecosystems during the Holocene more humid climate episodes in North Africa. Melanopsis palaeocommunities are characterised by a greater temperature tolerance compared to the investigated Melanoides and Potamides palaeocommunities. The extant species Melanopsispraemorsa is distributed in Spain south of the 42nd degree of latitude, roughly coinciding with the +10°C-January-Isotherme, while the area of distribution of the Miocene congeners extended the northern Spain basin systems.","Cenozoic; Continental molluscs; Palaeoclimate; Spain","Cenozoic; climate effect; colonization; fossil record; lacustrine environment; mollusc; paleobiogeography; paleoclimate; spatiotemporal analysis; Andalucia; Eurasia; Europe; Granada [Andalucia]; Guadix-Baza Basin; Iberian Peninsula; Southern Europe; Spain; Cerithioidea; Melanoides; Melanopsis; Mollusca; Potamides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847770491

These processes have led to a deep concern among the policy makers, scientists and public alike. For analysing causes and impacts of this complex problem, modelling has become increasingly more important, as evidenced by a plethora of models developed particularly during the last decade. This study reviews and synthesises the available models relating to land-use changes, forest/soil degradation and C sequestration in developing countries in general and the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region in particular. The major findings of these models in terms of factors affecting land-use changes especially, deforestation or agricultural expansion, are agricultural and timber prices, wage rates, risks in agriculture, population density in the rural areas, access to forestland, and titling security in frontier areas, and some of the government policies of economic reforms in the developing world. These findings, however, are space and time specific, and hence suggest for different policy options. A number of modelling techniques have been used in the past, such as, conceptual, analytical, empirical regression, and programming/simulation models. Both static and dynamic models have been used at different scales from household to global levels. Most studies in the HKH region are based on qualitative/descriptive methods using conceptual modelling techniques. Integrated models for analysing C sequestration dynamics as a function of land-use changes and forest/soil degradation in a holistic approach are emerging. Based on the review and synthesis of different techniques, a conceptual modelling framework is presented. This consists of a dynamic bio-economic modelling framework capable of capturing both socio-economic behaviour and bio-physical processes combined with geographical information systems/remote sensing techniques. Such modelling efforts have the potential of assisting policy makers and planners to identify and implement sustainable agriculture and forestry practices, leading to mitigation of CO2 emissions in developing countries in general and the HKH region in particular. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Etna during the 10-day July 2006 Strombolian-effusive eruption. This signal was compared with simultaneously acquired volcanic tremor and thermal radiance data. The onset of explosive activity and a lava fountaining episode were preceded by some hours with increases in radon soil emission by 4-5 orders of magnitude, which we interpret as precursors. Minor changes in eruptive behavior did not produce significant variations in the monitored parameters. The remarkably high radon concentrations we observed are unprecedented in the literature. We interpret peaks in radon activity as due primarily to microfracturing of uranium-bearing rock. These observations suggest that radon measurements in the summit area of Etna are strongly controlled by the state of stress within the volcano and demonstrate the usefulness of radon data acquisition before and during eruptions.

Here, it is found that aerosol particles, directly and through their enhancement of clouds, may reduce near-surface wind speeds below them by up to 8% locally. This reduction may explain a portion of observed ""disappearing winds"" in China, and it decreases the energy available for wind-turbine electricity. In California, slower winds reduce emissions of wind-driven soil dust and sea spray. Slower winds and cooler surface temperatures also reduce moisture advection and evaporation. These factors, along with the second indirect aerosol effect, may reduce California precipitation by 2-5%, contributing to a strain on water supply.

Twenty-eight ozone forecasts were generated over the Lower Fraser Valley, British Columbia, Canada, for the 5-day period 11-15 August 2004 and compared with 1-hour averaged measurements of ozone concentrations at five stations. The forecasts were obtained by driving the Community Multiscale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) model with four meteorological forecasts and seven emission scenarios: a control run, ±50% NOx, ±50% volatile organic compounds (VOC), and ±50% NOx, combined with VOC. Probabilistic forecast quality is verified using relative operating characteristic curves, Talagrand diagrams, and a new reliability index. Results show that both meteorology and emission perturbations are needed to have a skillful probabilistic forecast system: the meteorology perturbation is important to capture the ozone temporal and spatial distribution and the emission perturbation is needed to span the range of ozone concentration magnitudes. Emission perturbations are more important than meteorology perturbations for capturing the likelihood of high ozone concentrations. Perturbations involving NOx resulted in a more skillful probabilistic forecast for the episode analyzed, and therefore the 50% perturbation values appear to span much of the emission uncertainty for this case. All of the ensembles analyzed show a high ozone concentration bias in the Talagrand diagrams, even when the biases from the unperturbed emissions forecasts are removed from all ensemble members. This result indicates nonlinearity in the ensemble, which arises from both ozone chemistry and its interaction with input from particular meteorological models.

The present study describes the current status of agriculture and the need for climate forecasts in light of risk management in rainfed farming, competition for limited water resources, impacts of natural disasters and the multi-dimensional impacts of extreme variability. The short history of climate prediction science demonstrates the progress made in understanding climate variability and the reliability of the predictions in the tropical Pacific region. Several case studies of climate forecast applications are described, illustrating the wide interest in such applications to help the farm sector cope with climate variability. Despite the progress achieved, several challenges lie ahead in enhancing the wider applications of climate forecasts in the agricultural sector. These include the need for improvements in the accuracy of models; generating quantitative evidence about the usefulness of climate forecasts as tools for agricultural risk management; addressing the key issues for promoting beneficial use of forecasts; responding to diverse needs of the users and involving the stakeholders more actively in climate prediction applications; giving greater priority to extension and communication activities; learning from non-adoption situations; deriving more economic benefits through climate prediction applications to trade and storage; and improving the institutional and policy environment. © Inter-Research 2006.","Agriculture; Applications of forecasts; CLIMAG; Seasonal climate forecasts; User needs","Agriculture; Climate change; Risk management; Weather forecasting; climate prediction; climate variation; natural disaster; rainfed agriculture; risk assessment; tropical region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250738908

Climate information, including seasonal climate forecasts, has been heralded as a promising tool for early-warning systems and agricultural risk management in southern Africa. Nevertheless, there is concern that climate information, for example climate forecasts, are not realizing their potential value in the region. The present study considers the actual and potential roles played by climate information in reducing food insecurity in southern Africa from 2 perspectives. The first relates to improved understanding of the contextual environment in which end users operate and use information. Users, including farmers, usually operate in an environment of considerable uncertainty, reacting to and coping with multiple stressors whose impacts are not always clear or predictable. The second perspective relates to improving the current design and variety of mechanisms (e.g. climate outlook forums) for the dissemination and uptake of climate information. The first relates to improved understanding of the contextual environment in which end users operate and use information.

The second perspective relates to improving the current design and variety of mechanisms (e.g. climate outlook forums) for the dissemination and uptake of climate information. Climate information, it is argued, used in isolation (e.g. in 'stand alone' climate outlook forums) and undertaken in a traditional, linear fashion, where information is moved from producer to user, is divorced from the broader, complex social context in which such information is embedded. This current articulation of climate information flow represents an ineffective means of dealing with climate variability and food security. Alternative modes of interaction (e.g. using existing platforms to 'piggyback' information or seeking appropriate 'boundary organisations') should be found to sustainably manage climate risks in the region. © Inter-Research 2006.","Climate information; Food security; Mainstreaming climate information; Sustainable development","Agriculture; Climate change; Climatology; Information dissemination; Risk management; Sustainable development; Weather forecasting; agricultural management; climate prediction; climate variation; food security; regional climate; risk assessment; sustainable development; Africa; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250693577

The time of emergence (in relation to the growth stage of the parent plant) and phenological growth of lateral branches on cultivated plants under ambient and elevated CO 2, with or without nitrogen supply depending on plant nodulation state, were observed throughout the life span of the plants. Lateral branching was only evident in plants (nodulating or non-nodulating) supplied with mineral N and was more prominent (98-100%) in both nodulating and non-nodulating plants under elevated CO2. The higher incidence of lateral branching under elevated CO2 was linked to differential allocation of excess dry mass produced under elevated CO2 and a possible reduction in lateral bud growth inhibitor. Lateral branches attained full maturity (reproductive stage) only under elevated CO2 and where mineral N is supplied and nodules are absent. © 2006 Asian Network for Scientific Information.","Ambient CO2; Common pea; Elevated CO2; Lateral branches; Lateral branching; N; Nitrogen; Nodulating; Non-nodulating","Pisum sativum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845416298

This might be the principal reason why intended end users of climate information generally fail to embrace what the climate science community has to offer. The translation of climate information into real-life action requires 3 essential components: salience (the perceived relevance of the information), credibility (the perceived technical quality of the information) and legitimacy (the perceived objectivity of the process by which the information is shared). We explore each of these components using 3 case studies focused on dryland cropping in Australia, India and Brazil. In regards to 'salience' we discuss the challenge for climate science to be 'policy-relevant', using Australian drought policy as an example. In a village in southern India 'credibility' was gained through engagement between scientists and risk managers with the aim of building social capital, achieved only at high cost to science institutions. Finally, in Brazil we found that 'legitimacy' is a fragile, yet renewable resource that needs to be part of the package for successful climate applications; legitimacy can be easily eroded but is difficult to recover. We conclude that climate risk management requires holistic solutions derived from cross-disciplinary and participatory, user-oriented research. Approaches that combine climate, agroecological and socioeconomic models provide the scientific capabilities for establishment of 'borderless' institutions without disciplinary constraints. Such institutions could provide the necessary support and flexibility to deliver the social benefits of climate science across diverse contexts. Our case studies show that this type of solution is already being applied, and suggest that the climate science community attempt to address existing institutional constraints, which still impede climate risk management. © Inter-Research 2006.","Climate knowledge; Credibility; Dryland cropping; Legitimacy; Modelling; Risk management; Salience","Climate change; Climatology; Drought; Economic and social effects; Risk management; Societies and institutions; Weather forecasting; cropping practice; drought; risk assessment; social capital; Asia; Australasia; Australia; Brazil; Eurasia; India; South America; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646336944

Although the catalytic function and regulation of plant UCPs have been described, the physiological purpose of UCP in plants has not been established. Here, biochemical and physiological analyses of an insertional knockout of one of the Arabidopsis UCP genes (AtUCP1) are presented that resolve this issue. Absence of UCP1 results in localized oxidative stress but does not impair the ability of the plant to withstand a wide range of abiotic stresses. However, absence of UCP1 results in a photosynthetic phenotype. Specifically there is a restriction in photorespiration with a decrease in the rate of oxidation of photorespiratory glycine in the mitochondrion. This change leads to an associated reduced photosynthetic carbon assimilation rate. Collectively, these results suggest that the main physiological role of UCP1 in Arabidopsis leaves is related to maintaining the redox poise of the mitochondrial electron transport chain to facilitate photosynthetic metabolism. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Arabidopsis; Electron transport; Mitochondria; Photorespiration; Reactive oxygen species","adenosine triphosphate; carbon; glycine; mitochondrial protein; proton; uncoupling protein; vegetable protein; abiotic stress; Arabidopsis; article; carbon fixation; chemical analysis; controlled study; electron transport; energy metabolism; enzyme mechanism; gene; gene insertion; gene mutation; genotype phenotype correlation; knockout gene; mitochondrial membrane; mitochondrion; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidative stress; photorespiration; photosynthesis; plant metabolism; plant response; priority journal; protein function; protein localization; regulatory mechanism; UCP1 gene; Arabidopsis; Blotting, Western; Carbon; DNA Primers; Glycine; Ion Channels; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Proteins; Oxidative Stress; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Arabidopsis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845889254

For 60°S to 60°N zonal means, the average yearly change in the 0.7 to 0.1 hPa (∼50 to 65 km) region is -27 ± 3 pptv/year, or -0.78 ± 0.08 percent/year. This is consistent with surface abundance decrease rates (about 6 to 7 years earlier) in chlorine source gases. The MLS data confirm that international agreements to reduce global emissions of ozone-depleting industrial gases are leading to global decreases in the total gaseous chlorine burden. Tracking stratospheric HCl variations on a seasonal basis is now possible with MLS data. Inferred stratospheric total chlorine (ClTOT) has a value of 3.60 ppbv at the beginning of 2006, with a (2-sigma) accuracy estimate of 7%; the stratospheric chlorine loading has decreased by about 43 pptv in the 18-month period studied here. We discuss the MLS HCl measurements in the context of other satellite-based HCl data, as well as expectations from surface chlorine data. A mean age of air of ∼ 5.5 years and an age spectrum width of 2 years or less provide a fairly good fit to the ensemble of measurements.

These events have decreasing September ice extent trends that are typically 4 times larger than comparable observed trends. One event exhibits a decrease from 6 million km2 to 2 million km2 in a decade, reaching near ice-free September conditions by 2040. In the simulations, ice retreat accelerates as thinning increases the open water formation efficiency for a given melt rate and the ice-albedo feedback increases shortwave absorption. The retreat is abrupt when ocean heat transport to the Arctic is rapidly increasing. Analysis from multiple climate models and three forcing scenarios indicates that abrupt reductions occur in simulations from over 50% of the models and suggests that reductions in future greenhouse gas emissions moderate the likelihood of these events.

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) is a future NASA mission, which will use this technique to measure the column-averaged dry air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) with the precision and accuracy needed to quantify CO2 sources and sinks on regional scales (∼ 1000 × 1000 km2) and to characterize their variability on seasonal timescales. Here, we have used the OCO retrieval algorithm to retrieve XCO2 and surface pressure from space-based Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) measurements and from coincident ground-based Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) measurements of the O2 A band at 0.76 μm, and the 1.58 μm CO2 band for Park Falls, Wisconsin. Even after accounting for a systematic error in our representation of the O2 absorption cross sections, we still obtained a positive bias between SCIAMACHY and FTS XCO2, retrievals of ∼ 3.5%. Additionally, the retrieved surface pressures from SCIAMACHY systematically underestimate measurements of a calibrated pressure sensor at the FTS site. These findings lead us to speculate about inadequacies in the forward model of our retrieval algorithm. By assuming a 1% intensity offset in the O2 A band region for the SCIAMACHY XCO2 retrieval, we significantly improved the spectral fit and achieved better consistency between SCIAMACHY and FTS XCO2 retrievals. We compared the seasonal cycle of XCO2 at Park Falls from SCIAMACHY and FTS retrievals with calculations of the Model of Atmospheric Transport and Chemistry/ Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (MATCH/CASA) and found a good qualitative agreement but with MATCH/CASA underestimating the measured seasonal amplitude. Furthermore, since SCIAMACHY observations are similar in viewing geometry and spectral range to those of OCO, this study represents an important test of the OCO retrieval algorithm and validation concept using NIR spectra measured from space. Finally, we argue that significant improvements in precision and accuracy could be obtained from a dedicated CO2 instrument such as OCO, which has much higher, spectral and spatial resolutions than SCIAMACHY. These measurements would then provide critical data for improving our understanding of the carbon cycle and carbon sources and sinks.

It starts from regional climate properties to establish discriminating weather types for the chosen local variable, precipitation in this case. Intratype variations of the relevant forcing parameters are then taken into account by multivariate regression using the distances of a given day to the different weather types as predictors. The final step consists of conditional resampling. The methodology is evaluated in the Seine basin in France. Using reanalysis fields as predictors, satisfying results are obtained at daily timescale and concerning low-frequency variations, both for temperature and precipitation. The use of model results as predictors gives a realistic representation of regional climate properties. Nevertheless, as the validation of a statistical downscaling algorithm for present day climate conditions does not necessarily imply the validity of its climate change projections, the plausibility of the downscaled climate projections is assessed by verifying the consistency between spatially averaged downscaled results and direct model outputs for two climate change scenarios. Despite some discrepancies for precipitation with the more extreme scenario, the consistency is good for both local variables. This result reinforces the confidence in the use of the downscaling scheme in altered climates. Finally, it is shown that the intertype variations of the atmospheric circulation represent only a fraction of the climate change signal for the local variables. Thus a downscaling methodology based on weather typing should incorporate information concerning intratype modifications.

The dynamics of the locally accelerated evolution of a mesquite/coppice dune landscape and the undetermined spatial dependence of potential erosion by wind from a shear stress partition model were investigated. Sediment transport and dust emission processes are governed by the amount of protection that can be provided by roughness elements. Although shear stress partition models exist that can describe this, their accuracy has only been tested against a limited dataset because instrumentation has previously been unable to provide the necessary measurements. This study combines the use of meteorological towers and surface shear stress measurements with Irwin sensors to measure the partition of shear stress in situ. The surface shear stress within preferentially aligned vegetation (within coppice dune development) exhibited highly skewed distributions, while a more homogenous surface stress was recorded at a site with less developed coppice dunes. Above the vegetation, the logarithmic velocity profile deduced roughness length (based on 10-min averages) exhibited a distinct correlation with compass direction for the site with vegetation preferentially aligned, while the site with more homogenously distributed vegetation showed very little variation in the roughness length. This distribution in roughness length within an area, defines a distribution of a resolved shear stress partitioning model based on these measurements, ultimately providing potential closure to a previously uncorrelated model parameter. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Holocene loess-soil sequences on the gentle sloped lands were studied by measuring: magnetic susceptibility, particle-size distribution, CaCO3 and extraction and identification of the non-dust materials. The analytical results indicate that in the early Holocene soil erosion and redeposition by overland flow occurred, even on the loess lands with small ground gradient, in response to climatic amelioration linked to global climatic change. No obvious soil erosion and redeposition events were found to correspond with the climatic fluctuations recorded in the loess-soil sequence during the Holocene Climatic Optimum. The primary Neolithic farming did not cause apparent erosion and redeposition because the loess landscape was mantled by well-developed Ustic Luvisols and probably by forest vegetation, both provided adequate resistance to sheet erosion by overland flow. Enhanced soil erosion and redeposition are traceable back to ca. 4000 a B.P. It is attributed to intensified land use of arable farming and human settlement from the early Bronze Age onward. A major event of sheet erosion and redeposition by overland flow occurred in the loess landscape during 4000-3600 a B.P. in the Xia dynasty. Soil degradation and reduced resistance caused by climatic aridity and intensified dust accumulation may have played a secondary role in promoting soil erosion since 3100 a B.P. These results provide new insights into the history of soil erosion in the semi-arid and semi-humid loess regions and into the evaluation of human-induced accelerated soil erosion against the background of the Holocene natural erosion forced by monsoonal climatic fluctuation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The area concerned, located around Berre-Marseilles, is a Mediterranean region frequently subject to high ozone concentrations. The inventory has been developed using a fine scale land use database for the year 1999, forest composition statistics, emission potentials from individual plant species, biomass distribution, temperature and light intensity. The seasonal variations in emission potentials and biomass were also taken into account. Hourly meteorological data for 1999 were calculated from ALADIN data and these were used to predict the hourly isoprene, monoterpene and OVOC fluxes for the area on a 1 km × 1 km spatial grid. Estimates of annual biogenic isoprene, monoterpene and OVOC fluxes for the reference year 1999 were 20.6, 38.9 and 13.3 kt, respectively, Quercus pubescens, Quercus ilex, Pinus halepensis and garrigue vegetation are the dominant emitting species of the area.

Box 29, 425-600, South Korea","This paper shows an example of substantial increase in carbon emissions from forest fires after reforestation on a national scale. It is the first estimation of historical carbon emissions from forest fires in Korea during the last 40 years. Investigation was focused on the recent increase in large forest fires and its closely related factors. A simple modeling approach to estimate carbon emission was applied. The direct carbon emission from forest fires in 2000, ranging from 115 to 300 Gg C, corresponds to 1-3% of the annual carbon uptake by forests. The influence of forest fires on the carbon cycle in Korea is not so significant, but Korean forests have a large potential for generating severe local fires due to increasing forest carbon density and a high forest area ratio (forest area/total land area) of 65%. The carbon emission per area burned (Mg C ha- 1) clearly reflects the trend toward increases in the number of severe fires. Statistical analyses and the trends of annual temperature and precipitation show that the recent large increase in carbon emissions may be the negative consequences of intensive forest regrowth that is the product of successful reforestation and forest management programs rather than the effect of climate change. These results imply a need for further studies in other countries, where large-scale plantation has been conducted, to evaluate the role of plantation and forest fires on the global carbon cycle. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In order to examine the extent of clay increase and pedogenic carbonate enrichment in a precipitation gradient, ten soil profiles from three different precipitation regions were studied using micromorphological and mineralogical techniques. The precipitation gradient was divided into three groups: 400-550 mm, 550-750 mm, and 750-1100 mm regions. The objectives were to (1) understand the cause of clay orientation in clay-rich horizons (2) investigate the reasons for the clay increase, and (3) observe the interaction of clay and pedogenic carbonate accumulation features along a precipitation gradient in Kansas. Although clay films were identified in the field for soils in the 400-550 mm regions, illuvial clay films were not observed in thin section analysis. The clay accumulations mostly occurred as grain coatings. The rest of the clay accumulations observed were very thin, striated, and mostly associated with voids. The argillic horizons had a granostriated b-fabric, which indicates stress orientation of micromass caused by high shrink-swell activity. Thick and continuous illuvial coatings were observed in the buried horizons of paleosols. In the other two regions where precipitation exceeds 550 mm, illuvial clay coatings with strong orientation were observed along with thin and striated stress-oriented clay. Both types of clay orientations exceeded 1% of the cross-sectional area for the thin section. Although illuvial clay features and pedogenic carbonates were observed in all soils at approximately the same depth, complete obliteration of clay coatings was not observed in these horizons. In-situ weathering of biotite was one of the reasons for the clay increase in all soil profiles. In all soils studied, the clay increase and cause of clay orientation cannot be attributed to a single genetic process or event. Both illuviation and shrink-swell activity were involved in the orientation of clay. Although orientation of clay and pedogenic carbonates were observed in all soils at approximately the same depth, the decomposition of clay coatings was not observed in these horizons. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

On million-year timescales silicate weathering leads to the draw-down of carbon dioxide, and on millennial timescales chemical weathering affects the calcium carbonate saturation state of the oceans and hence their uptake of carbon dioxide. However, variations in chemical weathering rates over glacial-interglacial cycles remain uncertain. During glacial periods, cold and dry conditions reduce the rate of chemical weathering, but intense physical weathering and the exposure of carbonates on continental shelves due to low sea levels may increase this rate. Here we present high-resolution records of the lead isotope composition of ferromanganese crusts from the North Atlantic Ocean that cover the past 550,000 years. Combining these records with a simple quantitative model of changes in the lead isotope composition of the deep North Atlantic Ocean in response to chemical weathering, we find that chemical weathering rates were two to three times lower in the glaciated interior of the North Atlantic Region during glacial periods than during the intervening interglacial periods. This decrease roughly balances the increase in chemical weathering caused by the exposure of continental shelves, indicating that chemical weathering rates remained relatively constant on glacial-interglacial timescales. On timescales of more than a million years, however, we suggest that enhanced weathering of silicate glacial sediments during interglacial periods results in a net draw-down of atmospheric carbon dioxide, creating a positive feedback on global climate that, once initiated, promotes cooling and further glaciation. ©2006 Nature Publishing Group.",,"carbon dioxide; iron derivative; isotope; lead; silicate; carbon dioxide; chemical weathering; continental shelf; drawdown; glacial-interglacial cycle; global climate; article; Atlantic Ocean; atmosphere; chemical composition; cooling; exposure; feedback system; glacier; global climate; isotope analysis; priority journal; quantitative analysis; sediment; weathering; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845900442

The spatial evolution of the cluster components is simulated accounting for both scattering and Coulomb explosion. The former is calculated by means of the Monte Carlo method while the latter is computed by means of molecular dynamics. The charge state of the individual cluster components is calculated as a function of penetration depth, and is determined by the competition between electron ionization and recombination. The results of calculations of the effect of the neighbouring cluster components on the suppression of the values of the charge state are presented and compared to the experimental values of Brunelle et al. Charge state suppression calculations for the 2MeV/C clusters for both C10 and C5 agree well with the experimental results for penetration depths of less than about 500 and 250respectively, assuming the intracluster Coulomb potential is screened by four target valence electrons. At 4MeV/C the results are similar although less screening is required; a possible explanation is the inability of the plasma to completely screen the higher velocity projectiles.

Prosaposin demonstrates diffuse organ of Corti expression at birth, with gradual localization to the inner hair cells (IHCs) and its supporting cells, inner pillar cells, and synaptic region of the outer hair cells (OHCs) and Deiters' cells (DCs) by postnatal day 21 (P21). Microdissected OHC and DC quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR and immunohistology localizes prosaposin mRNA to DCs and OHCs, and protein predominantly to the apex of the DCs. Subsequent studies in a prosaposin knock-out (KO) (-/-) mouse showed intact but slightly reduced hearing through P19, but deafness by P25 and reduced distortion product otoacoustic emissions from P15 onward. Beginning at P12, the prosaposin KO mice showed histologic organ of Corti changes including cellular hypertrophy in the region of the IHC and greater epithelial ridge, a loss of OHCs from cochlear apex, and vacuolization of OHCs. Immunofluorescence revealed exuberant overgrowth of auditory afferent neurites in the region of the IHCs and proliferation of auditory efferent neurites in the region of the tunnel of Corti. IHC recordings from these KO mice showed normal I-V curves and responses to applied acetylcholine. Together, these results suggest that prosaposin helps maintain normal innervation patterns to the organ of Corti. Furthermore, prosaposin's overlapping developmental expression pattern and binding capacity toward the nAChR α10 suggest that α10 may also play a role in this function.

Our DFT calculations show that the reaction occurs through CO2 insertion into the Cu-B bond to give a Cu-OC(=O)-boryl species (i.e., containing Cu-O and C-B bonds), and subsequent boryl migration from C to O, followed by σ-bond metathesis between pinB-Bpin (B2pin 2, pin = pinacolate = OCMe2CMe2O) and (NHC)Cu(OBpin). The overall reaction is exergonic by 38.0 kcal/mol. It is the nucleophilicity of the Cu-B bond, a function of the very strong σ-donor properties of the boryl ligand, rather than the oxophilicity of boron, which determines the direction of the CO2 insertion process. The boryl migration from C to O, which releases the product CO, is the rate-determining step and involves the ""vacant"" orbital orbital on boron. The (NHC)Cu(boryl) complexes show unique activity in the catalytic process. For the analogous (NHC)Cu(alkyl) complexes, the CO2 insertion into the Cu-C bond giving a copper acetate intermediate occurs with a readily achievable barrier. However, the elimination of CO from the acetate intermediate through a methyl migration from C to O is energetically inaccessible. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Boron; Carbon monoxide; Chemical bonds; Complexation; Copper; Probability density function; Bond metathesis; Boryl ligand; Nucleophilicity; Carbon dioxide; alkyl group; boron derivative; carbenoid; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; copper acetate; copper derivative; heterocyclic compound; ligand; methyl group; article; catalysis; chemical bond; complex formation; crystal structure; density functional theory; elimination reaction; molecular interaction; reaction analysis; reduction; ring closing metathesis; stereospecificity; Boron; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Catalysis; Copper; Heterocyclic Compounds; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen Bonding; Ligands; Methane; Molecular Structure; Organometallic Compounds; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845382259

The experiments were monitored via an FTIR spectrometer (solid state) and a quadrupole mass spectrometer (gas phase). Combined with electronic structure calculations, this paper focuses on the identification of CHx(x = 1-4) and C2Hx (x = 2-6) species and also investigates their formation pathways quantitatively. The primary reaction step is determined to be the cleavage of a carbonhydrogen bond of the methane molecule to form a methyl radical (CH3) plus a hydrogen atom. Hydrogen atoms recombined to form molecular hydrogen, the sole species detected in the gas phase during the irradiation exposure. In the matrix two neighboring methyl radicals can recombine to form an internally excited ethane molecule (C2H6), which either can be stabilized by the surrounding matrix or was found to decompose unimolecularly to the ethyl radical (C2H5) plus atomic hydrogen and then to the ethylene molecule (C2H4) plus molecular hydrogen. The initially synthesized ethane, ethyl, and ethylene molecules can be radiolyzed subsequently by the impinging electrons to yield the vinyl radical (C 2H3) and acetylene (C2H2) as degradation products. Upon warming the ice sample after the irradiation, the new species are released into the gas phase, simulating the sublimation processes interstellar ices undergo during the hot core phase or comets approaching perihelion.

In a key section at Kalpi, pedogenic carbonates (nodules, rhizoconcretions, and powdery carbonate) are present within aggradational floodplain deposits, where they correspond to relatively high monsoonal precipitation and river discharge. In contrast, groundwater carbonate has cemented degradational surfaces (discontinuities), which correspond with periods of relatively low precipitation. Mixed groundwater and pedogenic calcretes are present in the deposits of small interfluve channels, and reworked nodules line degradational surfaces and locally fill channels. Most carbonates show alpha fabrics that include floating textures, shrinkage crack fills, and grain coatings. The predominance of alpha fabrics is unexpected, but is characteristic of calcretes across dryland and seasonal parts of northern India, where soil formation led to only weakly developed or poorly preserved beta fabrics. Interpretation of δ13C and δ18O values of bulk and microdrilled calcrete samples suggests relatively little variation in precipitation and vegetation types through the sampled interval at Kalpi. Floodplain deposits were vegetated with a mixture of C4 and C3 plants (predominantly C4), with a higher proportion of C3 plants associated with channel deposits. This apparent lack of variation is surprising because the sampled interval represents at least 60,000 years of Marine Isotope Stages 3-5, during which climate models suggest that Asia experienced radical fluctuations in monsoon intensity and precipitation. Some of the apparent lack of variation may be explained by preferential preservation of aggradational strata that represent relatively active monsoonal periods, as well as by the mixing of drier floodplain (C4) and riparian (C3) vegetation. However, local departures from the regionally based climate model cannot be ruled out. A modest upsection increase in C4 plants may represent increased aridity and lower atmospheric CO2. Isotopic analysis of organic matter from floodplain pedogenic nodules suggests a higher C3 plant contribution than carbonate-based data would suggest. The preserved organic matter may reflect the annual average biomass in the soil, whereas carbonate formation may have taken place mainly during the drier season when respiration of C4 plants was more important. In interfluve settings such as Kalpi, seasonality may strongly affect the C3-C4 system, with preferential preservation of only part of the biomass. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Deforestation emissions are partly offset by forest expansion and increases in growing stock primarily in the extra-tropical north. Innovative financial mechanisms would be required to help reducing deforestation. Using a spatially explicit integrated biophysical and socio-economic land use model we estimated the impact of carbon price incentive schemes and payment modalities on deforestation. One payment modality is adding costs for carbon emission, the other is to pay incentives for keeping the forest carbon stock intact. Results: Baseline scenario calculations show that close to 200 mil ha or around 5% of todays forest area will be lost between 2006 and 2025, resulting in a release of additional 17.5 GtC. Today's forest cover will shrink by around 500 million hectares, which is 1/8 of the current forest cover, within the next 100 years. The accumulated carbon release during the next 100 years amounts to 45 GtC, which is 15% of the total carbon stored in forests today. Incentives of 6 US$/tC for vulnerable standing biomass payed every 5 year will bring deforestation down by 50%. This will cause costs of 34 billion US$/year. On the other hand a carbon tax of 12 $/tC harvested forest biomass will also cut deforestation by half. The tax income will, if enforced, decrease from 6 billion US$ in 2005 to 4.3 billion US$ in 2025 and 0.7 billion US$ in 2100 due to decreasing deforestation speed. Conclusion: Avoiding deforestation requires financial mechanisms that make retention of forests economically competitive with the currently often preferred option to seek profits from other land uses. Incentive payments need to be at a very high level to be effective against deforestation. Taxes on the other hand will extract budgetary revenues from the regions which are already poor. A combination of incentives and taxes could turn out to be a viable solution for this problem. Increasing the value of forest land and thereby make it less easily prone to deforestation would act as a strong incentive to increase productivity of agricultural and fuelwood production, which could be supported by revenues generated by the deforestation tax. © 2006 Kindermann et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248361032

The measurement results indicated that the concentration ratio between the fuel-rich and fuel-lean streams changes greatly with the height of the collision block. The fuel-rich and fuel-lean streams do not mix together soon after leaving the burner; this leads to better ignition and combustion characteristics of the pulverized coal compared with an ordinary burner. A local zone of high fuel concentration can be achieved at the fuel-rich side, resulting in staged combustion, to control NOx emissions. A deviation between the jet direction and the nozzle axis was found, resulting from the velocity difference between the fuel-rich and fuel-lean streams, and a larger deviation in the profile of the solid phase was also observed.

The recent discovery of midlatitude tropospheric clouds on Titan has caused much excitement about the roles of surface sources of methane and the global circulation in forming clouds. Although localized surface sources, such as methane geysers or ""cryovolcanoes,"" have been invoked to explain these clouds, we find in this work that clouds appear in regions of convergence by the mean meridional circulation and over the poles during solstices, where the solar forcing reaches its seasonal maximum. Other regions are inhibited from forming clouds because of dynamical transports of methane and strong subsidence. We find that for a variety of moist regimes, i.e., with the effect of methane thermodynamics included, the observed cloud features can be explained by the large-scale dynamics of the atmosphere. Clouds at the solsticial pole are found to be a robust feature of Titan's dynamics, whereas isolated midlatitude clouds are present exclusively in a variety of moist dynamical regimes. In all cases, even without including methane thermodynamics, our model ceases to produce polar clouds ≈4-6 terrestrial years after solstices. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Atmospheres; Climate; Planetary science","methane; article; atmosphere; cloud; dynamics; model; priority journal; season; thermodynamics; vapor; volcano",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845480271

This increase is due to the high rate at which humans are burning fossil fuels. According to Robert R. Hitch from Florence, SC, local efforts at a state and national level to decrease fossil fuel use not only are ineffective but also are counterproductive. If an individual, state, country, or group of countries decides to use less fossil fuel, all that accomplishes is to lower demand so that other worldwide users can purchase and burn that fuel at a lower cost. In addition, since the annual rate of use of fossil fuels is still increasing worldwide, all current efforts are thus shown to be ineffective. No effort to date has decreased the global net annual rate of CO2 release into the planets atmosphere. Thus the California plan, the Kyoto protocol, and the Massachusetts case before the Supreme Court, while well-meaning, can have no positive effect on global warming. The only workable solution is a worldwide agreement to significantly reduce the rate of removal of fossil fuels from the ground (e.g., 5%/yr as a start). Then, the worlds users cannot burn what they cannot buy. The problem is deciding who will be allowed to remove and sell how much. The reduction in removal of fossil fuels is a real solution.",,,Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845604067

These latter aspects have therefore become the objectives of this research, which is based on new hydrogeological and geochemical investigations. The geological setting results in the coexistence of overlapped interacting aquifers.

To the west of Viterbo, vertical upflows of thermal waters of the sulphate-chloride-alkaline-earth type with higher gas contents, are due to the locally uplifted carbonate reservoir, the reduced thickness of the semiconfining layer and the high local geothermal gradient. The hot waters (30-60°C) are the result of deep circulation within the carbonate rocks (0.5-1.8 km) and have the same recharge area as the volcanic aquifer. The upward flow in the Viterbo thermal area is at least 0.1 m3/s.

Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is a vital enzyme in CH4 production, and the mcrA gene coding for a subunit of MCR has been employed as a specific marker for the detection and differentiation of methanogen communities. A critical step in assessing environmental mcrA diversity is the selection of PCR primers. The objective of this study was to compare the diversity coverage of three published mcrA primer sets MCR, ME and ML (also known as MCR and Luton-mcrA) and their ability to discern methanogen communities in a drained peatland. The primers were applied to DNA extracts from unfertilised and ash-fertilised peat from two different depths. Amplified mcrA communities were cloned and sequenced, and the sequences were divided into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and sequence analysis. All primers recovered characteristic OTUs associated with the peat depths and treatments and confirmed a previous observation of low methanogen diversity. The minor differences in OTU ranges of the primers did not greatly affect the observed community composition. However, as the proportions of several OTUs varied strongly, the primers provided different quantitative representations of mcrA communities. We concluded that the ML and MCR primers had better amplification ranges than the ME set, but the use of MCR with peat samples was problematic due to poor amplification. Consequently, the ML primers were best suited for mcrA analysis of peatland methanogen communities. © 2006 Elsevier SAS.

To evaluate the organic carbon balance and the roles played by planktonic communities in organic carbon consumption, two cruises with stations covering almost the entire shelf were conducted during the high productivity and high river flow season of the ECS in June (the early summer) and August (the middle summer) 2003. Results showed that biological activity was significantly higher in the early summer. To flourish in the early summer, plankton need a significant fluvial input of dissolved inorganic nutrients and organic matter from the Chinese coast, especially from the Changjiang (aka Yangtze River), might be one of the main driving forces. Further analysis showed that most planktonic community respiration (PCR) could be attributed to phytoplankton and bacterioplankton, which accounted for over 96% of the total planktonic biomass (in carbon units) in summer. This might partially explain why mean PCR was higher in June (∼114 mg C m-3 d-1), with higher phytoplankton biomass, than in August (∼40 mg m-3 d-1). The ratio of integrated primary production to PCR (i.e., the P/R ratio) was, however, less than 1, with a mean ± SD value of 0.35 ± 0.41 for all the pooled data. This indicates a significant amount of organic carbon has been regenerated through planktonic activity in the water column. The sea-air difference in fCO2, however, changed from a mean value of -64.5 ± 61.3 ppm in June to 10.0 ± 37.5 ppm in August. To explain the contradictory results between PCR and fCO2, we suggest that the dissolved inorganic carbon regenerated through planktonic respiration could be stored in the subsurface layer and may affect the fCO2 in the surface water, which is what controls the shelf sea either as an atmospheric CO2 Sink or as a source, depending on the prevailing physical forces. These results also suggest that the controversy between atmospheric CO2 sink or source in the ECS shelf needs further exploration.

When analysed with pollen data, inferences can be made about past vegetation dynamics and climate as well. The analysis of high-resolution charcoal records generally involves the decomposition of charcoal influx into (a) a slowly varying 'background' component that provides information about long-term changes in regional fire activity, biomass and/or depositional processes, and (b) a 'peaks' component that represents local fire events. In this study, 15 high-resolution charcoal records from the northwestern USA and associated pollen data were examined to describe the variations and controls of charcoal influx and background trends. Late-Holocene charcoal influx levels at each site were compared with late-Holocene sedimentation rates, vegetation and fire frequency, and with modern climate and physical site characteristics to better understand the spatial variability in charcoal abundance. Charcoal abundance was largely determined by physical site characteristics (eg, lake and watershed size) and the proportion of woody taxa. Background trends displayed regional similarities, and the subcontinental scale trend based on all records correlated closely with woody taxa proportions in the pollen spectra. Background charcoal and woody taxa proportions increased together from minima in the Late Glacial to maxima in the late Holocene. The strong similarity in these trends suggests that background charcoal influx is a function of fuel characteristics, which in turn are governed by climate and vegetation. Variations in sedimentation rate and fire frequency had little influence on background charcoal trends. © 2006 SAGE Publications.","Background charcoal; Charcoal analysis; Climate; Fire frequency; Fire history; Fuel; Holocene; Northwestern USA; Palaeofire; Pollen","bog; charcoal; climate; fire; fuel; Holocene; lacustrine deposit; late glacial; sedimentation rate; spatial variation; vegetation dynamics; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250680026

In southern Brazil, the adoption of a new management option has arisen most recently, with no-tillage as well as no burning of crops residues left on soil surface after harvesting, especially in sugar cane areas. Although such practice has helped to restore soil carbon, the tillage impact on soil carbon loss in such areas has not been widely investigated. This study evaluated the effect of moldboard plowing followed by offset disk harrow and chisel plowing on clay oxisol CO2 emission in a sugar cane field treated with no-tillage and high crop residues input in the last 6 years. Emissions after tillage were compared to undisturbed soil CO2 emissions during a 4-week period by using an LI-6400 system coupled to a portable soil chamber. Conventional tillage caused the highest emission during almost the whole period studied, except for the efflux immediately following tillage, when the reduced plot produced the highest peak. The lowest emissions were recorded 7 days after tillage, at the end of a dry period, when soil moisture reached its lowest rate. A linear regression between soil CO2 effluxes and soil moisture in the no-till and conventional plots corroborate the fact that moisture, and not soil temperature, was a controlling factor. Total soil CO2 loss was huge and indicates that the adoption of reduced tillage would considerably decrease soil carbon dioxide emission in our region, particularly during the summer season and when growers leave large amounts of crop residues on the soil surface. Although it is known that crop residues are important for restoring soil carbon, our result indicates that an amount equivalent to approximately 30% of annual crop carbon residues could be transferred to the atmosphere, in a period of 4 weeks only, when conventional tillage is applied on no-tilled soils. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Most envisage increasing the numbers of veterinarians in government employment. Why not at least combine this initiative, wherever possible, with far greater involvement of rural practitioners to deliver contractual public-practice services and provide an enhanced community interface? This could make the difference between having a local practice in a community or none at all, as well as promising to be more cost effective. The concept of rural community practice (RCP) envisages combining traditional services provided in a ""mixed-animal"" veterinary practice with an expanded portfolio of public-practice and communication services that meet the emerging animal, public, and ecosystem health needs of the collective community, not just those of animal owners. These services could include those involving active sentinel surveillance programs for both domestic animal and wildlife diseases; on-farm food safety; bio-security; traceability and export certification and audit programs; disease investigation, including foreign animal diseases; surge capacity emergency response,- managing for ecosystem health; and client and community education. An expanded practice team of animal-health professionals and technologists, led by veterinarians, would deliver these services. This RCP approach should have the potential to make rural practice more attractive from economic, lifestyle, and job-satisfaction perspectives; to enhance the visibility and recognition of the profession; and to respond to changing and new societal needs. It also promises to maintain a stable network of veterinary practices in rural communities.

It is shown that the oxygen budget is mainly governed by phytoplankton dynamics. The excessive growth of algae and the sudden break down of the resulting algal blooms may cause episodic DO depressions. Therefore, to stabilise the oxygen budget in a sustainable way, eutrophication has to be controlled within the central part of River Neckar and the upstream regions. The only feasible way to reach this goal appears to be a further drastic reduction of phosphorus emissions. In addition, it is indispensable to hold the very high standards of biochemical oxygen demand and ammonium retention at the wastewater treatment plants. A worse performance of the treatment plants would dramatically aggravate critical DO declines which may be caused by algae dynamics. As long as the oxygen budget is not completely stabilised, weir and turbine aeration can be used to mitigate DO depressions. It could be shown that the potentials of these measures suffice to keep DO at a tolerable level. However, due to the long travel times in River Neckar, it is important to start aeration up to several days before the DO minimum is reached. © 2006 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We present reservoir ages from dating 21 whales collected 1860-1901 and recalculating dates of 23 molluscs collected 1857-1926. Most of the whales were caught along the coast of Norway, but one is from France and one from Iceland. We assume the former mainly lived in the North and equatorial Atlantic and in the Norwegian Sea. Whales feed only on pelagic organisms and will provide the reservoir age for the open ocean surface water. However, they travel long distances and will integrate the reservoir ages of the different water masses along their way. Molluscs (dated from Norway, Spitsbergen and Arctic Canada) are stationary and monitor the sea water passing their dwelling site, but some also take up carbon from particulate food or sediment pore water. Coastal water also often contains some continental carbon. We present two different views on how to analyze and interpret the data. Mangerud recommends to use reservoir ages based on a combination of the whale and mollusc dates, i.e. 380±30 and 360±30 yr relative to Intcal04 and British oak, respectively, and a ΔR value of 20±30 for the surface water in the N-Atlantic and Norwegian Sea.

(Malvaceae) is rapidly becoming a serious weed of Australian farming systems. An understanding of the variability of its seed behaviour is required to enable the development of integrated weed management strategies. Mature M. parviflora seeds were collected from four diverse locations in the Mediterranean-type climatic agricultural region of Western Australia. All of the seeds exhibited physical dormancy at collection; manual scarification or a period of fluctuating summer temperatures (50/20°C or natural) were required to release dormancy. When scarified and germinated soon (1 month) after collection, the majority of seeds were able to germinate over a wide range of temperatures (5-37°C) and had no light requirement. Germination was slower for seeds stored for 2 months than seeds stored for 2 years, suggesting the presence of shallow physiological dormancy. Seed populations from regions with similar annual rainfall exhibited similar dormancy release patterns; seeds from areas of low rainfall (337-344 mm) were more responsive to fluctuating temperatures, releasing physical dormancy earlier than those from areas of high rainfall (436-444 mm). After 36 months, maximum seedling emergence from soil in the field was 60%, with buried seeds producing 13-34% greater emergence than seeds on the surface. Scanning electron microscopy of the seed coat revealed structural differences in the chalazal region of permeable and impermeable seeds, suggesting the importance of this region in physical dormancy breakdown of M. parviflora seeds. The influence of rainfall during plant growth in determining dormancy release, and hence, germination and emergence timing, must be considered when developing management strategies for M. parviflora. ©2006 Cambridge University Press.","Malva parviflora; Malvaceae; Physical dormancy; Seed coat; Water-impermeable","Magnoliophyta; Malva; Malva parviflora; Malvaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846816546

Ethanol production has more than tripled since 2000, with annual US production expected to exceed 7 billion gallons by 2007. Sales of biobased plastics are also expanding. The growing availability of economically competitive biobased alternatives to petroleum can be attributed in large part to advances in the production and processing of corn grain for industrial uses. Steady increases in corn yields made possible by agricultural biotechnology continue to expand the supply of available grainbased feedstock. Rapid advances in the field of industrial biotechnology are greatly enhancing the efficiency of ethanol production and making possible a range of new biobased polymers, plastics, and textiles from agricultural starting materials. In order to meet the US Department of Energy (DOE) goal of 60 million gallons of ethanol production and 30 percent displacement of petroleum by 2030, new feedstock sources will be required to supplement high-efficiency production from grain. A robust sustainable supply chain for cellulosic biomass from agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops will be needed within a few years.Nearly 1 billion dry tons of cellulosic biomass could be supplied by US agricultural lands in the form of crop residues and dedicated energy crops. A growing list of companies have announced intentions to begin construction of cellulosic biorefinerics. One challenge for the emerging cellulosic biomass industry is how to produce, harvest, and deliver this abundant feedstock to biorefineries in an economically and environmentally sustainable way. Corn stover and straw from cereals such as wheat and rice are the most likely cellulosic Feedstocks for commercial-scale production of ethanol in the near term, potentially supplying more than 200 million dry tons of feedstock annually within three to five years-enough to triple current ethanol production. Dedicated energy crops such as switchgrass will follow as a feedstock supplement once a market for cellulosic biomass develops further. Corn stover has the largest potential as a near-term biorefinery feedstock, given its high per-acre yields. Current cropping practices require that most or all stover remain on the field to maintain soil health. As biorefinery construction creates markets for crop residues, farmers will be more motivated to adopt practices that lead to economic and sustainable removal. An environmental and economic ""optimum"" removal will balance sufficient retention of residues to avoid erosion losses and maintain soil quality while using excess residue as biorefinery feedstocks. The impact of varying levels of stover and straw removal will depend considerably on local conditions and practices.Under a range of conditions, no-till cropping allows for substantially greater residue collection than current practice, enabling biorefinery siting in areas where suitable supplies are currently unavailable. Further evolution toward greater no-till cropping is needed in order to supply adequate feedstock while complying with erosion guidelines and maintaining soil quality. Lower operating costs and recent successes have spurred an increase in adoption of no-till, with 16 percent of wheat acreage and 20 percent of corn acreage now under no-till practice. However, no-till is not yet widely utilized in regions of the country with the greatest potential to supply biomass. Ultimately, growing demand for crop residues will likely prove a strong additional driver for the transition to more widespread no-till cropping. Once a market for agricultural residues develops, individual farmers or groups of farmers may elect to adopt no-till cropping to attract biorefineries to their area. Residue collection may also enable no-till cropping in wetter regions, such as the northern Com Belt, where excess residues currently hamper germination and reduce yields. While the economics depend on regional and local conditions, for those not currently practicing no-till, the benefits of converting may justiry the time to learn new methods and the $50,000-$100,000 investment in new planting equipment. For instance, a 1,000-acre farm could expect to recover the additional costs through revenue from residue sales in as little as two years. New markets that commoditize the environmental benefits of notill farming could provide even greater incentive to convert. Carbon credits for no-till transition currently sell for roughly $1 per acre on the voluntary Chicago Climate Exchange. If mandatory greenhouse gas limits are established in the United States, the carbon credit benefits of no-till adoption could exceed $10 per acre. In addition to economic benefits for farmers, sustainable production, and collection of agricultural residues has the potential to deliver substantial benefits for the environment, such as reduced runoff of soil and fertilizers. But the greatest environmental benefit may be to the global climate through reduced emissions of fossil carbon and enhanced sequestration of soil carbon. With no-till cropping, sustainable collection of 30 percent of current annual corn stover production would yield over 5 billion gallons of ethanol and reduce net US greenhouse gas emissions by 90 million to 150 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, if burned as E85 fuel. This would more than offset the net annual growth in emissions from all sectors of the US economy experienced in 2004. To realize these benefits, additional infrastructure in collection, storage, and transportation is needed to supply biorefineries. Rail transport greatly reduces transportation costs relative to trucking, allowing for a much larger collection area. One-pass harvest, in which grain and residues are collected simultaneously, also offers strong opportunities to lower cost.To facilitate development of the infrastructure necessary for sustainable production and collection of cellulosic agricultural feed-stocks, and to achieve the DOE goal of 30 percent displacement of petroleum with renewable biobased feedstocks by 2030, the US Congress should consider adopting supportive policy measures in the 2007 Farm Bill, including: Funding for accelerated development and production of onepass harvesting equipment Development and distribution of simple-to-use soil carbon models to allow farmers to compute how much crop residue can be collected without degrading soil quality Assistance to farmers to encourage the transition to no-till cropping for biomass production Incentives for the development and expansion of short-line and regional rail networks Funding for demonstration projects to streamline collection, transport, and storage of cellulosic crop residue feedstocks Development of a system to monetize greenhouse gas credits generated by production of ethanol and other products from agricultural feedstocks Funding for programs to help farmers identify and grow the most suitable crops for both food production and cellulosic biomass production Cellulosic biomass from agricultural residues and dedicated energy crops represents a highly promising new source of feedstock material for the production of ethanol, renewable chemicals, and a range of commercial biobased products.

A collaborative, interdisciplinary project involving government, universities, and the private sector examined the effect of this unusual warmth on cryospheric conditions and documented the responses, placing them in a 30-40 year context. This paper represents a synthesis of these results. 1998 was characterized by a melt season of exceptional length, having both an unusually early start and late finish. Extremes were noted for cryospheric variables that included ground thaw penetration, snow-free season, lake-ice-free season, glacier melt, and the duration and extent of marine open water. The warm conditions contributed to the break-up of two long-term, multi-year ice plugs in the north-west Canadian Arctic Archipelago, which allowed floe ice into the Northwest Passage. Synoptic events and preconditioning were observed to play an important role in governing the response of some variables to the warming. It was also noted that response was not uniform in all regions. This study provided an opportunity to examine possible cryospheric response to future, warmer conditions. It also provided a chance to assess the capability of current cryospheric monitoring networks in the Canadian Arctic.

Many of these adaptation options have substantial effects on greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. However, so far few studies have attempted to link the issue of adaptation and mitigation in agriculture.

It has been demonstrated that feedback regulation of ultraweak photon emission from the hand is detectable utilizing gelatin color filters in complete darkness. Color filters are commonly utilized in auriculomedicine diagnostic procedures based on the radial artery vascular autonomic signal. Objective: To evaluate the possibility of an effect by a dark-adapted red filter on (1) local ultraweak human photon emission using different anatomic locations, and (2) on systemic photon emission using one location for red filter exposure and another for photon emission recording. Design: Photon emission of abdomen, forehead, palm, and dorsum of the hand was recorded before and after the presence of a red filter. In addition, photon emission of forehead and dorsum of the hand was recorded before, during, and after the presence of the red filter close to the palm. In both instances, the filter was dark-adapted and placed in close proximity to, but not touching the skin of the dark-adapted subject. A low-noise, end window photomultiplier for recording ultraviolet and visible (200-650 nm) photon emission (with a very low background count rate) and designed for manipulation in three directions was situated in a dark room. The technology was utilized to record spontaneous photon emission of the abdomen, forehead, palm, and dorsum of the hand of one human male subject. Results: Data demonstrate that a dark-adapted subject responds in the total absence of light with a temporary increase in photon emission from the anatomic locations that had been exposed for 200 s at a distance of 3 cm to a dark-adapted red filter. Data from sequential time series suggest red filter initiation of a refractory emission reaction. Exposure of the palm to the red filter also evokes photon emission from the dorsum of the same hand and from the forehead. This response could be registered immediately after the beginning of the exposure. The stimulated emission is followed by a slow decrease of emission in the period after exposure to the filter. Conclusion: Data suggest that red filter-stimulated photon emission response is systemic and rapid. Data imply an exchange of information vis-à-vis light from both hand and red filter. The mechanism of such interaction is currently speculation only. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"gelatin; abdomen; anatomy; article; autonomic nervous system; color; diagnostic procedure; exposure; feedback system; filter; forehead; hand; hand palm; human; human experiment; photon; priority journal; radial artery; technology; Abdomen; Acupuncture, Ear; Biophysics; Circadian Rhythm; Darkness; Female; Forehead; Hand; Humans; Light; Luminescent Measurements; Male; Middle Aged; Photons; Spectrum Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846231879

These large-scale cyclone (LSC) events were identified as those periods for which the filtered geopotential height anomaly at a given analysis point was at least 100 m below its average for the date for at least 10 days. This study identifies a region of maximum frequencv of LSC events at 45°N, 160°W [key point 1 (KP1)] for the entire period. This point is somewhat to the east of regions of maximum height variability noted in previous studies. A second key point (37.5°N, 162.5°W) was defined as the maximum in LSC frequency for the period after November 1988. The authors show that the difference in location of maximum LSC frequency is linked to a climate regime shift at about that time. LSC events occur with a maximum frequency in the period from November through January. A composite 500-hPa synoptic evolution, constructed relative to the event onset, suggests that the upper-tropospheric precursor for LSC events emerges from a quasi-stationary long-wave trough positioned off the east coast of Asia. In the middle and lower troposphere, the events are accompanied by cold thickness advection from a thermal trough over northeastern Asia. The composite mean sea level evolution reveals a cyclone that deepens while moving from the coast of Asia into the central Pacific. As the cyclone amplifies, it slows down in the central Pacific and becomes nearly stationary within a day of onset. Following onset, at 500 hPa, a stationary wave pattern, resembling the Pacific-North American teleconnection pattern, emerges with a ridge immediately downstream (over western North America) and a trough farther downstream (from the southeast coast of the United States into the western North Atlantic). The implications for the resulting sensible weather and predictability of the flow are discussed. An adjoint-derived sensitivity study was conducted for one of the KP1 cases identified in the climatology. The results provide dynamical confirmation of the LSC precursor identification for the events. The upper-tropospheric precursor is seen to play a key role not only in the onset of the lower-tropospheric height falls and concomitant circulation increases, but also in the eastward extension of the polar jet across the Pacific. The evolution of the forecast sensitivities suggest that LSC events are not a manifestation of a modal instability of the time mean flow, but rather the growth of a favorably configured perturbation on the flow. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"Data reduction; Sea level; Storms; Troposphere; Weather forecasting; Cyclonic flow; Large-scale cyclone; Thermal trough; Upper-tropospheric precursor; Climatology; cyclogenesis; cyclone; sensitivity analysis; troposphere; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846204726

This is expected to affect health, mostly adversely. We need to compare the projected health effects in Australia arising from differing climate change scenarios to inform greenhouse gas emission (mitigation) policy. Methods: We estimated health effects in Australia (heatwave mortality, dengue transmission regions) around 2100 under various greenhouse gas scenarios: ""strong policy action"" (efforts made now to reduce emissions) and ""no policy action"" (emissions continue at present high levels with no climate change-specific policies). Results: Compared with no policy action, mitigation could reduce the number of deaths caused by hot temperatures among older Australians by 4,000-7,000 a year (range reflects likely population size at 2100). Under a scenario of ""no action"", the zone of potential transmission of dengue fever expands 1,800 kilometres (km) south, as far as Sydney. In contrast, by markedly constraining greenhouse gas emissions now, this southward extension could be limited to 600 km (to Rockhampton). The number of displaced people within the Asia-Pacific region could increase (by orders of magnitude) under the ""no action"" scenario because of adverse socio-ecological circumstances aggravated by climate change. Conclusions: Additional health effects will accrue as a result of the projected climate change throughout this century, and individuals and health systems should be prepared for some level of adaptation. However, timely and strong policy action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions would diminish the extent and severity of estimated future health effects.",,"article; Asia; Australia; climate change; community ecology; controlled study; dengue; environmental temperature; geographic distribution; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; health care policy; health care system; health hazard; heat stress; high temperature; human; incidence; mental health; mortality; Pacific islands; psychological well being; virus transmission; Australia; Dengue; Disease Outbreaks; Environmental Health; Forecasting; Greenhouse Effect; Health Promotion; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mortality; Public Health; World Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846149322

The H I line at 21 cm has been detected in the circumstellar shells of a variety of evolved stars: asymptotic giant branch stars, oxygen-rich and carbon-rich stars, semiregular and Mira variables, and planetary nebulae. The emissions are generally spatially resolved, i.e., larger than 4′, indicating shell sizes on the order of 1 pc, which opens the possibility of tracing the history of mass loss over the past ∼104-105 yr. The line profiles are sometimes composite. The individual components generally have a quasi-Gaussian shape; in particular, they seldom show the double-horn profile that would be expected from the spatially resolved optically thin emission of a uniformly expanding shell. This probably implies that the expansion velocity decreases outward in the external shells (0.1 -1 pc) of these evolved stars. The H I line profiles do not necessarily match those of the CO rotational lines. Furthermore, the centroid velocities do not always agree with those measured in the CO lines and/or the stellar radial velocities. The H I emissions may also be shifted in position with respect to the central stars. Without excluding the possibility of asymmetric mass ejection, we suggest that these two effects could also be related to a nonisotropic interaction with the local interstellar medium. H I was detected in emission toward several sources (ρ Per, α Her, δ2 Lyr, U CMi) that otherwise have not been detected in any radio lines. Conversely, it was not detected in the two oxygen-rich stars with substantial mass-loss rate, NML Tau and WX Psc, possibly because these sources are young, with hydrogen in molecular form, and/or because the temperature of the circumstellar H I gas is very low (&lt;5 K). © 2005.

However, it should be noted that uranium used for nuclear power generation is a limited natural resource, whose reserve-production ratio is less than 100 years. The author would like to insist that more attention should be given to hydraulic energy, which is clean, green, and moreover, recyclable. But at present, in order to generate a large amount of hydraulic power, it is necessary to use big rivers that run through less-populated, remote areas like the far-north regions and tropical rain forests. In hydraulic power projects, it takes very long time and enormous amount of funds to construct dams and power stations, as well as transmission lines for transporting electricity from power stations to urban areas. The ""Kyoto Mechanism"", which is stipulated in the ""Kyoto Protocol"" enacted on February 16, 2005, can be utilized in creating large-scale hydraulic power projects.

Current versus voltage characteristics of the present CNT emitters were found to be explicable on the basis of the Fowl er-Nordheim (F-N) formalism. Time trace of the FE current exhibited more than 30% fluctuation about the mean value, and the lifetime was less than 5 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation elucidated that the lengths of the CNTs were reduced after prolonged field emission, plausibly because of local heating induced by the large current density at the apex. To prolong the lifetime, we attempted a type of feedback system by inserting a high ohmic resistance between the electron emitter and the power supply. As a result, the current fluctuation decreased from ∼30% to 2% at 0.1 μA, and the lifetime increased from 5 to 50 h. Finally, an SEM was equipped with both the emitter systems, with and without resistance, which were designed for the CNT field emitter. The SEM images taken by using the emitter with resistance showed consistently brighter appearance, whereas those taken without the resistance exhibited fluctuations in the image brightness.

While clustering of diseases or a manifestation in community can cause great public alarm, similar unexplained clustering in hospital admissions has baffled clinicians. Objectives: (a) To determine whether perceived unexplained clustering of diseases and manifestations among hospital admissions is real or significant. (b) To look for possible explanations of such clustering. Design: One-year prospective observational and two-year retrospective study. Material and methods: Cases admitted under pediatric and neonatal services (excluding rooming in babies) from September 2002 to August 2003 formed material for prospective and cases admitted for 2 years prior for retrospective study. Whenever an unexplained cluster of disease/manifestation was perceived, case definition was finalized and cases recorded. Retrospective cluster analysis was done for some significant unexplained clusters detected prospectively. These clusters case rate were analyzed in relation to age, sex, climatic conditions, etiology of case, etc. to detect any correlation. Pearson correlation coefficient, chi-square test, centroid method and Z test of proportion were used for statistical significance. Results: Eight unexplained clusters were perceived in prospective study. 3 (hyperbilirubinemia in exchange range hypocalcemic seizures and vesicoureteric reflux) proved statistically not significant. 3 were small clusters of uncommon diseases / manifestations (biliary atresia, cardiomyopathy, and acral gangrene). Two large significant clusters, major non-traumatic bleeding manifestations (MNTBM) and acute renal failure (ARF) occurred to which retrospective study was extended. T max and Tmin (average maximum and minimum daily temperature) had statistically significant positive correlation with ARF (γ = + 0.83, P &lt;0.001 for Tmax and γ =+ 0.56, P = 0.002 for Tmin) and negative correlation with MNTBM (γ = -0.34, P = 0.040 for Tmax and γ = -0.59, P &lt;0.001 for T min). Barometric pressure has significant negative and positive correlation with MNTBM and ARF respectively (γ =+ 0.57, P &lt;0.001 for MNTBM and γ = -0.45,P = 0.006 for ARF). The clusters also had significant positive correlations with female sex and age under 1 year (Z = 2.48, P &lt;0.001, χ2=13.83, P&lt;0.001 for sex and age of MNTBM and Z =3.11, P &lt;0.001, χ2 =10.85, P &lt;0.001 for age and sex of ARF cases respectively). Three small clusters and a small subgroup of MNTBM (subcutaneous nodules as manifestations of bleeding disorders) occurred predominantly under one year and different sexes were involved. Conclusions: Several significant unexplained clustering were noted among hospital admissions. There was significant correlation with climatic conditions, age and sex. Larger, longer and multicentric studies in different geographical areas are required to investigate more plausible but complex biological phenomenon and associations related to diseases or manifestations. Cluster awareness has diagnostic and management implications for clinician as it also helps in early recognition of disease outbreak and dissemination of information and hospital staff to be prepared to handle increased number of cases and its treatment.","Children; Clustering; Disease; Hospital","acute kidney failure; adolescent; article; bile duct atresia; bleeding; cardiomyopathy; chi square test; child; climate; clinical feature; cluster analysis; controlled study; correlation coefficient; demography; female; gangrene; hospital admission; human; humidity; hyperbilirubinemia; hypocalcemia; major clinical study; male; newborn care; observational study; prospective study; rare disease; retrospective study; seizure; tertiary health care; vesicoureteral reflux; Adolescent; Biliary Atresia; Cardiomyopathies; Child; Child, Preschool; Cluster Analysis; Female; Gangrene; Hemorrhage; Humans; Hyperbilirubinemia; Hypocalcemia; India; Infant; Kidney Failure, Acute; Male; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Seasons; Vesico-Ureteral Reflux",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845899379

Two ADH isogenes, PaADH1 and PaADH2, and one PDC gene, PaPDC1, were amplified from genomic P. anomala DNA by a two-step PCR approach, using degenerated primers against conserved regions of the respective genes for cloning core regions, and PCR-based gene walking for cloning the respective 5′ and 3′-ends. According to sequence analysis, ADH1 and PDC1 are most likely cytoplasmatic proteins, while ADH2 is most probably localized in the mitochondria. PaADH1 was expressed during aerobic growth on glucose, ethanol and succinate, but was ninefold upregulated in response to oxygen limitation when grown on glucose. The gene seems to be involved in both production and consumption of ethanol. Only low expression of PaADH2 was detected during growth on glucose and ethanol, but it was highly expressed during growth on the non-fermentable carbon source succinate and repressed by the addition of glucose. PaPDC1 was expressed during aerobic growth on glucose and was upregulated four-fold in response to oxygen limitation. PaPDC1 expression was lower in cells grown on ethanol and succinate than on glucose and was up-regulated two- and four-fold, respectively, after glucose addition. Our results demonstrate that transcription of genes of the fermentative pathway is regulated by hypoxia and carbon source but posttranscriptional regulation may play a major role in regulating the metabolic flux.

Here we analyze the expression of the respective ramA gene and its regulation. Transcription was found to start 71 nucleotides upstream of the translational start codon and to be two- to threefold up-regulated in the presence of acetate in the growth medium. Accordingly, about twofold higher amounts of RamA were observed in C. glutamicum cells grown on acetate instead of glucose. Using cell extracts of C. glutamicum and employing DNA affinity chromatography, we found RamA itself as the main protein which binds to the ramA promoter region. By electrophoretic mobility shift analysis with the ramA promoter region and His-tagged RamA protein, multiple RamA-binding sites were identified in front of the ramA transcriptional start site. Transcriptional cat fusion experiments revealed that ramA promoter activity was about threefold higher in a RamA-deficient mutant of C. glutamicum than in the wild-type, however, acetate-dependent up-regulation of ramA expression was not affected in the RamA-negative mutant. These results indicate that RamA negatively controls the expression of its own gene, but is not involved in acetate-dependent up-regulation of ramA expression. Copyright © 2007 S.

In this study we compared the transcriptomes of Bacillus subtilis 168 and its ccpA deletion mutant during growth in glucose-containing rich medium. Although growth was similar, glucose was completely consumed by the wild-type strain in the stationary phase, while it was still present in the culture of the mutant. At that stage, direct and indirect effects on gene expression were observed. During exponential growth, CcpA mainly influences the carbohydrate and energy metabolism, whereas from transition phase onwards its function expands on a broader range of physiological processes including nucleotide metabolism, cell motility and protein synthesis. A genome wide search revealednew putative cre sites, which could function in vivo according to our transcriptome data. Comparison of our data with published transcriptome data of ccpA mutant analysis in the exponential growth phase confirmed earlier identified CcpA regulon members. It also allowed identification of potential new CcpA-repressed genes, amongst others ycgN and the ydh operon. Novel activated members include opuE andthe opuAABC, yhb and man operons, which all have a putative cre site that appears to be dependent on helical topology. A comparative analysis of these genes with the known activated genes i.e.ackA and pta revealed the presence of a possible upstream activating region (UAR) as has been shown to be functional for the activation of ackA. The data suggest that at later growth phases CcpA may regulate gene expression by itself or complexed with other, yet unknown cofactors. Copyright © 2007 S.

CcpA variants mutated at residues in the HPrSerP-binding region without allosteric functions are inactive. On the other hand, CcpA variants mutated at residues that change their conformation upon HPrSerP or CrhP binding regulate only ackA. Another set of mutants with alterations in the corepressor-binding region show glucose-independent regulation of xynP. The data presented here demonstrate the involvement of HPrSerP and/or CrhP in activation of ackA and alsS by CcpA.

In addition, sensitivity to reference rates was explored. RESULTS: On the basis of 47 lung cancer deaths, the SMRs were 1.62, 1.72, and 2.08 (local, state, and national rates, respectively). Adjustment for previous exposures and smoking yielded additional correction factors of 0.64 or 0.74, varying with the chosen reference. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer SMRs (95% confidence intervals) for the full cohort ranged from 1.20 (0.88-1.59) to 2.08 (1.53-2.77) in this sensitivity analysis.

Over the next 5 yr, CO2ReMoVe will evaluate a range of technologies to monitor the injection and storage of CO2 from gas streams at the Sleipner and Snøhvit fields in he Norwegian North Seam at In Salah in the southern Saharan desert in Algeria and in the German locality of Ketzin. The project aims to provide a second scientific basis for establishing guidelines for the certification of future sites for CO2 storage. Energy industry participants in the CO2ReMoVe project include BP, ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil, Schlumberger, Statoil, Total, Vattenfall, and Wintershall. CCS technology separates CO2 from a gas stream, compresses it to reduce volume, transports it by pipeline to a storage site, and sequesters it in geological formations. The technology could have a major impact on greenhouse gas emissions as it could be applicable to many large-emission sources of CO2.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845677292

In particular, the functional diversity (FD) or the presence of rare or endemic species in natural assemblages do not necessarily increase with species diversity. We studied if different components of plant species diversity (species richness, Simpson diversity, evenness) varied similarly to FD (measured as a generalization of the Simpson index) and rarity along grazing intensity and climatic gradients. Plots under different sheep grazing regimes (high and low intensity, abandonment) were surveyed in five locations along a climatic gradient in north-eastern Spain, from semi-arid lowland to moist upland locations. Variation in species diversity, functional diversity and rarity followed different patterns. Species diversity was lowest in water-stressed environments (arid locations and southern aspects) and increased with grazing more makedly in humid locations. The FD was comparable between the most species-poor and species-rich locations and decreased with grazing in the moistest location, i.e. where species diversity markedly increased. The FD did not show a strong correlation with species richness nor with the Simpson index and less specious communities could show the highest functional diversity. The rarest species in the region were more frequently found in the abandoned areas, which held the lowest species diversity. Consequently, the mechanisms that enhance the diversity of species do not necessarily support a functional differentiation among those species or the maintenance of rare species in a region. We hypothesize that the degree of dependence of functional diversity on species diversity might be mostly related to the amplitude of the species' traits pool and on how species partition the niche space available. © Ecography.",,"climate conditions; coexistence; endemic species; environmental gradient; grazing; niche partitioning; rare species; semiarid region; sheep; species diversity; species pool; species richness; Eurasia; Europe; Southern Europe; Spain; Ovis aries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845674735

Previously reported associations between ambient NO2 and children's respiratory health have been inconsistent, and independent effects of correlated pollutants hard to assess. The authors examined effects of NO2 on a spectrum of 11 respiratory symptoms, controlling for PM10 and SO2, using a large pooled dataset. Methods: Cross sectional studies were conducted in Russia, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, during 1993-99, contributing in total 23 955 children. Study-specific odds ratios for associations with ambient NO2 are estimated using logistic regressions with area-level random effects. Heterogeneity between study-specific results, and mean estimates (allowing for heterogeneity) are calculated. Results: Long term average NO2 concentrations were unrelated to prevalences of bronchitis or asthma. Associations were found for sensitivity to inhaled allergens and allergy to pets, with mean odds ratios around 1.14 per 10 μg/m3 NO2. SO2 had little confounding effect, but an initial association between NO2 and morning cough was reduced after controlling for PM10. Associations with reported allergy were not reduced by adjustment for the other pollutants. Odds ratios for allergic symptoms tended to be higher for the 9-12 year old children compared with the 6-8 year old children. Conclusions: Evidence for associations between NO2 and respiratory symptoms was robust only for inhalation allergies. NO2 most likely is acting as an indicator of traffic related air pollutants, though its direct effect cannot be ruled out. This remains important, as policies to reduce traffic related air pollution will not result in rapid reductions.",,"nitrogen dioxide; allergen; nitrogen dioxide; air pollutant; ambient air; article; asthma; bronchitis; child; controlled study; coughing; geographic distribution; human; human experiment; logistic regression analysis; prevalence; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; air pollutant; biological model; breathing disorder; chemically induced disorder; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; equipment; Europe; methodology; multicenter study; Air Pollutants; Allergens; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology); Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Humans; Models, Biological; Nitrogen Dioxide; Respiration Disorders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845656975

It also is the best single descriptor of wood: it correlates with numerous morphological, mechanical, physiological, and ecological properties. To explore the extent to which wood density could be estimated for rare or poorly censused taxa, and possible sources of variation in this trait, we analyzed regional, taxonomic, and phylogenetic variation in wood density among 2456 tree species from Central and South America. Wood density varied over more than one order of magnitude across species, with an overall mean of 0.645 g/cm3. Our geographical analysis showed significant decreases in wood density with increasing altitude and significant differences among low-altitude geographical regions: wet forests of Central America and western Amazonia have significantly lower mean wood density than dry forests of Central and South America, eastern and central Amazonian forests, and the Atlantic forests of Brazil; and eastern Amazonian forests have lower wood densities than the dry forests and the Atlantic forest. A nested analysis of variance showed that 74% of the species-level wood density variation was explained at the genus level, 34% at the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) family level, and 19% at the APG order level. This indicates that genus-level means give reliable approximations of values of species, except in a few hypervariable genera. We also studied which evolutionary shifts in wood density occurred in the phylogeny of seed plants using a composite phylogenetic tree. Major changes were observed at deep nodes (Eurosid 1), and also in more recent divergences (for instance in the Rhamnoids, Simaroubaceae, and Anacardiaceae). Our unprecedented wood density data set yields consistent guidelines for estimating wood densities when species-level information is lacking and should significantly reduce error in Central and South American carbon accounting programs. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Forest biomass estimation; Neotropics; Phylogeny; Tropical forests; Wood density","angiosperm; dry forest; genetic variation; geographical region; phylogenetics; phylogeny; population density; spatial variation; tropical forest; altitude; article; Central America; genetics; geography; phylogeny; South America; tree; tropic climate; wood; Altitude; Central America; Geography; Phylogeny; South America; Trees; Tropical Climate; Wood; Amazonia; Atlantic Forest; Central America; South America; Anacardiaceae; Magnoliophyta; Simaroubaceae; Spermatophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845473904

The CYP1A mRNA levels following 48h-treatment with CP[c]Ph or benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P; positive control) were determined and compared with incidences of clastogenic changes observed in the peripheral blood erythrocytes. We have found that the ability to induce CYP1A by these PAH compounds is positively correlated with the incidences of clastogenic changes in rainbow trout erythrocytes.","Clastogenic activity; Crystal structure; Cyclopenta[c]phenanthrene; CYP1A mRNA induction; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Rainbow trout",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845463948

Focal lesions of NK1R-ir neurons in the medullary raphe or the retrotrapezoid nucleus partially reduced the CO2 response in conscious rats. We ask if NK1R-ir cells and processes over a wide region of the ventral medulla are essential for central and peripheral chemoreception by cisterna magna injection of SSP-SAP, a high-affinity version of substance P-saporin. After 22 days, NK1R-ir cell loss was -79% in the retrotrapezoid nucleus and -65% in the A5 region, which lie close to the ventral surface, and -38% in the medullary raphe and -49% in the pre-Bötzinger complex/rostral ventral respiratory group, which lie deeper. Dorsal chemoreceptor sites, the caudal nucleus tractus solitarius and the A6 region, were unaffected. At 8 and 22 days, these lesions produced 1) hypoventilation during air breathing in wakefulness (∼8%) and in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) (∼9%) and rapid eye movement (∼14%) sleep, as measured over a 4-h period; 2) a substantially reduced ventilatory response to 7% CO2 by 61% in wakefulness and 46-57% in NREM sleep; and 3) a decreased ventilatory response to 12% O 2 by 40% in wakefulness and 35% in NREM sleep at 8 days, with partial recovery by 22 days.

Reduced sulfur dioxide emissions over the past several decades have resulted in increased pH and alkalinity in some areas of North America and Europe. However, biological recovery has lagged behind increases in lake pH. We propose that acidification-induced changes in predator assemblages can provide biological resistance to recovery of assemblages in lower trophic levels in lakes. Many recovering lakes remain fishless because of low colonization rates and, therefore, support a high abundance of macroinvertebrate predators that may have a large impact on zooplankton community structure. We assessed the distribution of water beetles in relation to pH and presence/absence of fish in 29 lakes on the Canadian Shield. We found that water beetle assemblage composition was not related to pH. However, the occurrence of fish was significantly negatively correlated with water beetle distribution, particularly for the predaceous diving beetle, Graphoderus liberus. Mesocosm experiments in Swan Lake, a fishless lake recovering from acidification, revealed that larval G. liberus can reduce total zooplankton abundance, species richness, and species diversity. In particular, the densities of 4 taxa (Leptodiaptomus minutus, Diaphanosoma birgei, Bosmina [Bosmina] spp., and calanoid copepodids) were reduced by larval G. liberus predation. The high abundance of G. liberus in the absence of fish and the impact of larval G. liberus predation on crustacean zooplankton in Swan Lake suggest that biological resistance may be an important impediment to the recovery of aquatic food webs, despite increasing pH. © 2006 by The North American Benthological Society.","Aquatic beetles; Biological resistance; Dytiscid larvae; pH; Predation; Recovery; Zooplankton","abundance; acidification; beetle; benthos; community composition; community structure; environmental restoration; fish; food web; lake ecosystem; pH; population distribution; predation; trophic structure; zooplankton; Canada; North America; Ontario [Canada]; Swan Lake; Bosmina; Calanoida; Coleoptera; Crustacea; Diaphanosoma birgei; Dytiscidae; Graphoderus liberus; Leptodiaptomus minutus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845340473

These have been applied to existing and new models for a range of climate-sensitive diseases in order to estimate the effect of global climate change on current disease burdens and likely proportional changes in the future. The comparative risk assessment approach has been used to assess the health consequences of climate change worldwide, to inform decisions on mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, and in a regional assessment of the Oceania region in the Pacific Ocean to provide more location-specific information relevant to local mitigation and adaptation decisions. The approach places climate change within the same criteria for epidemiologic assessment as other health risks and accounts for the size of the burden of climate-sensitive diseases rather than just proportional change, which highlights the importance of small proportional changes in diseases such as diarrhea and malnutrition that cause a large burden. These exercises help clarify important knowledge gaps such as a relatively poor understanding of the role of nonclimatic factors (socioeconomic and other) that may modify future climatic influences and a lack of empiric evidence and methods for quantifying more complex climate-health relationships, which consequently are often excluded from consideration. These exercises highlight the need for risk assessment frameworks that make the best use of traditional epidemiologic methods and that also fully consider the specific characteristics of climate change. These include the long-term and uncertain nature of the exposure and the effects on multiple physical and biotic systems that have the potential for diverse and widespread effects, including high-impact events.","Burden of disease; Climate change; National; Quantitative comparative risk assessment; Regional","article; climate change; communicable disease; diarrhea; disaster; environmental change; environmental health; environmental impact assessment; environmental temperature; health care planning; health care policy; human; malaria; malnutrition; mortality; outcome assessment; Pacific islands; priority journal; public health; risk assessment; risk factor; socioeconomics; Climate; Cost of Illness; Disease; Environmental Health; Humans; Public Health; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845329495

Here we have assessed the threats to endemic planktonic diatom species (through the development of empirical models), which form a major component of primary production within the lake. Multivariate techniques employed include redundancy analysis (RDA) and Huisman-Olff-Fresco (HOF) models. Our analyses suggest that eight environmental variables were significant in explaining diatom distribution across the lake, and in order of importance these are snow thickness on the ice, water depth, duration of days with white ice, suspended matter in the lake, days of total ice duration, temperature of the water surface in July, concentration of zooplankton and suspended organic matter. Impacts on dominant phytoplankton diatom species are highlighted using t -value biplots. Predictions of future climate change on Lake Baikal are likely to result in shorter periods of ice cover, decreased snow cover across the lake in spring, increased fluvial input into the lake, and an increase in the intensification of surface water stratification during summer months. All these factors are likely to impact negatively on the slow-growing, cold-water endemics such as Aulacoseira baicalensis and Cyclotella minuta, which currently dominate diatom assemblages. Instead, taxa that are only intermittently abundant, at present, in offshore areas (e.g. Stephanodiscus meyerii) are likely to become more frequent. However, given the climatic gradient across the lake, the timing and extent of changes in community structure are likely to vary. Moreover, palaeolimnological records show that Lake Baikal diatom assemblages have been dynamic throughout the Holocene, with both endemic and cosmopolitan species exhibiting periods of dominance. Effects of climate change on the entire lake ecosystem may yet be profound as the structure of the pelagic food web may change from one based on endemic diatom taxa to one dominated by nondiatom picoplankton, and as limnological functioning (e.g. stratification and mixing) affects deepwater oxygen availability, nutrient cycling and trophic linkages. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Endemic diatoms; Environmental controls; Future climate change; Lake Baikal; Multivariate analysis; Multivariate ordination; Surface sediments","climate change; community structure; diatom; endemic species; lake ecosystem; multivariate analysis; spatial variation; Eurasia; Lake Baikal; Russian Federation; Aulacoseira baicalensis; Bacillariophyta; Cyclotella minuta; Stephanodiscus meyerii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845255017

Its management has implications for landscape and environmental quality as well as agricultural production. The present paper reviews the key developments in grassland management, production and utilization during the 20th century, focusing primarily on the UK but drawing on research and practice from other areas. Increased production from grassland has arisen from improved understanding of soil and plant nutrition, plant physiology and cultivar improvement, while improved understanding of feed evaluation, ruminant nutrition, grazing management and silage technology have contributed to increased utilization of grassland under grazing and cutting. Permanent and long-term swards occupied most of the total grassland area at both the beginning and end of the century, but inputs of nitrogen resulted in greatly increased herbage production, particularly from the 1960s; this, combined with reseeding and early cutting for silage, led to reduced botanical diversity with ryegrass dominance in lowland areas. Forage legumes were highly regarded at the beginning of the century, then decreased in many areas, but are again recognized as having a key role in low- and medium-input systems. Recognition of the environmental implications of grassland management has increased since the 1980s. This includes the need to reduce nutrient emissions in grassland agriculture, and also the role of grassland in biodiversity protection, carbon sequestration and landscape quality. Research is increasingly focused on addressing these issues and on integrating agricultural management with environmental protection. Improved nutrient management, legume-based systems and agri-environmental schemes, as well as interest in the food quality attributes of particular systems and grassland communities, are important in the medium term. In the longer term the effects of population increase, competition for other land uses and the impacts of climate change could impact on global food supplies and affect future grassland management in the temperate zones. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.",,"agricultural soil; forage; grassland; grazing management; legume; nutrition; ruminant; silage; temperate environment; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Bovidae; Lolium",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845253850

Results of this study suggest that new methods for anchoring population response functions, and a multivariate approach for incorporating climate variables into a single model, considerably improve the reliability of these functions. These functions identified a small number of populations in central areas of the species distribution with greater growth potential over a wide range of mean annual temperature (MAT). Average productivity of lodgepole pine is predicted to increase (up to 7%) if moderate warming (∼2 °C MAT) occurs in the next few decades as predicted, although productivity would substantially decline in some SPUs in southern BC. Severe global warming (>3 °C MAT) would result in either a drastic decline in productivity or local populations being extirpated in southern SPUs. New deployment strategies using the best seed sources for future reforestation may not only be able to mitigate the negative impact of global warming, but may even be able to increase productivity in some areas. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change impacts; Facilitated migration; Forest productivity; Growth response function; Local adaptation; Pinus contorta; Seed deployment","climate change; coniferous tree; global warming; growth response; productivity; reforestation; British Columbia; Canada; North America; Pinus contorta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845247794

In this paper, we use the ecosystem demography (ED) model to quantify the contributions of disturbance history, CO2 fertilization and climate variability to the past, current, and future terrestrial carbon fluxes in the Eastern United States. The simulations indicate that forest regrowth following agricultural abandonment accounts for uptake of 0.11PgCyr-1 in the 1980s and 0.15PgCyr-1 in the 1990s, and regrowth following forest harvesting accounts for an additional 0.1PgCyr-1 of uptake during both these decades. The addition of CO2 fertilization into the model simulations increases carbon uptake rates to 0.38PgCyr-1 in the 1980s and 0.47PgCyr-1 in the 1990s. Comparisons of predicted aboveground carbon uptake to regional-scale forest inventory measurements indicate that the model's predictions in the absence of CO2 fertilization are 14% lower than observed, while in the presence of CO2 fertilization, predicted uptake rates are 28% larger than observed. Comparable results are obtained from comparisons of predicted total Net Ecosystem Productivity to the carbon fluxes observed at the Harvard Forest flux tower site and in model simulations free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments. These results imply that disturbance history is the principal mechanism responsible for current carbon uptake in the Eastern United States, and that conventional biogeochemical formulations of plant growth overestimate the response of plants to rising CO2 levels. Model projections out to 2100 imply that the carbon uptake arising from forest regrowth will increasingly be dominated by forest regrowth following harvesting. Consequently, actual carbon storage declines to near zero by the end of the 21st century as the forest regrowth that has occurred since agricultural abandonment comes into equilibrium with the landscape's new disturbance regime. Incorporating interannual climate variability into the model simulations gives rise to large interannual variation in regional carbon fluxes, indicating that long-term measurements are necessary to detect the signature of processes that give rise to long-term uptake and storage. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate variability; CO2 fertilization; CO2 fluxes; Disturbance history; Eastern United States; Ecosystem demography (ED) model; Forest harvesting; Land-use history; Regional-scale uptake; Terrestrial carbon sink","anthropogenic source; biogeochemistry; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sink; climate variation; land use change; net ecosystem production; Northern Hemisphere; terrestrial ecosystem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845245412

We found that Corynebacterium glutamicum utilizes myo-inositol as a carbon and energy source, enabling proliferation with a high maximum rate of 0.35 h-1. Whole-genome DNA microarray analysis revealed that 31 genes respond to myo-inositol utilization, with 21 of them being localized in two clusters of &gt;14 kb. A set of genomic mutations and functional studies yielded the result that some genes in the two clusters are redundant, and only cluster I is necessary for catabolizing the polyol. There are three genes which encode carriers belonging to the major facilitator superfamily and which exhibit a &gt;12-fold increased mRNA level on myo-inositol. As revealed by mutant characterizations, one carrier is not involved in myo-inositol uptake whereas the other two are active and can completely replace each other with apparent Kms for myo-inositol as a substrate of 0.20 mM and 0.45 mM, respectively. Interestingly, upon utilization of myo-inositol, the L-lysine yield is 0.10 mol/mol, as opposed to 0.30 mol/mol, with glucose as the substrate. This is probably not only due to myo-inositol metabolism alone since a mixture of 187 mM glucose and 17 mM myo-inositol, where the polyol only contributes 8% of the total carbon, reduced the L-lysine yield by 29%. Moreover, genome comparisons with other bacteria highlight the core genes required for growth on myo-inositol, whose metabolism is still weakly defined.

Although absolute measurements of OH(X) concentrations are well defined, there is no elementary relation between emission from the electronically excited state (OH*) and its absolute concentration. Thus, to enable quantitative emission measurements, a kinetics model has been assembled and optimized to predict OH* formation and quenching at combustion conditions. Shock-tube experiments were conducted in mixtures of H 2/O 2/Ar, CH 4/O 2/Ar, and CH 4/H 2/O 2/Ar with high levels of argon dilution (&gt;98%). Elementary reactions to model OH*, along with initial estimates of their rate coefficients, were taken from the literature. The important formation steps follow: CH + O 2 ⇆ OH* + CO (RO) H + O + M ⇆ OH* + M (RI) Sensitivity analyses were performed to identify experimental conditions under which the shape of the measured OH* profiles and the magnitude of the OH* emission would be sensitive to the formation reactions. A fitting routine was developed to express the formation rate parameters as a function of a single rate, k 1 at the reference temperature (1490 K). With all rates so expressed, H 2/CH 4 mixtures were designed to uniquely determine the value of k 1 at the reference temperature, from which the remaining rate parameters were calculated. Quenching rates were fixed at their literature values. The new model predicts the experimental data over the range of conditions studied and can be used to calibrate the emission diagnostic for other applications, such as measurements in real combustion environments, containing higher order hydrocarbon fuels and lower levels of dilution in air. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Argon dilution; Quenching rates; Rate coefficients; Rate parameters; Atmospheric pressure; Chemiluminescence; Concentration (process); High temperature operations; Quenching; Reaction kinetics; Hydrogen inorganic compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751567541

In many parts of the world, seagrasses are not well known, although they provide crucial functions and values to the world's oceans and to human populations dwelling along the coast. Established in 2001, SeagrassNet, a monitoring program for seagrasses worldwide, uses a standardized protocol for detecting change in seagrass habitat to capture both seagrass parameters and environmental variables. SeagrassNet is designed to statistically detect change over a relatively short time frame (1-2 years) through quarterly monitoring of permanent plots. Currently, SeagrassNet operates in 18 countries at 48 sites; at each site, a permanent transect is established and a team of people from the area collects data which is sent to the SeagrassNet database for analysis. We present five case studies based on SeagrassNet data from across the Americas (two sites in the USA, one in Belize, and two in Brazil) which have a common theme of seagrass decline; the study represents a first latitudinal comparison across a hemisphere using a common methodology. In two cases, rapid loss of seagrass was related to eutrophication, in two cases losses related to climate change, and in one case, the loss is attributed to a complex trophic interaction resulting from the presence of a marine protected area. SeagrassNet results provide documentation of seagrass change over time and allow us to make scientifically supported statements about the status of seagrass habitat and the extent of need for management action. © 2006 The Authors.

An excerpt from the Executive Summary of the Stern Review, concerned with the nature and magnitude of the deleterious economic consequences of anticipated climate change, is printed below. The principal scientific reviews of knowledge of climate change, its consequences, and mitigation strategies are the (roughly) quinquennial reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the work of hundreds of lead authors, subjected in turn to elaborate peer review and line-by-line scrutiny by interested governments. They represent a broad, though not total, expert consensus. The third IPCC assessment was issued in 2001; the fourth, already in draft, will be released next year. The Stern Review draws heavily on this scientific underpinning, but goes further than the IPCC exercise in computing economic values for the projected changes and costing out remedial policy responses. More forthright in style and emphatic in its conclusions, it reads as a resounding call to international action. The Review explores the implications of atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases being capped at 550ppm (parts per million), double the preindustrial level, an objective it argues is feasible. That concentration would be reached by 2050 at current emission rates, or by 2035 if emissions rise as expected. The resulting warming, it believes, would be 2-5°C, roughly in accord with the IPCC's third-assessment estimates (see the Documents section of PDR 27, no. 1 for the IPCC projections). The positive feedbacks identified in some recent studies, generated by processes such as release of methane from permafrost, could lead to still higher temperatures. The forecast effects described are by now familiar, though no less grim for being so: species extinctions, expanding disease zones, reductions in surface water availability, coastal flooding, ocean acidification, and so on. The Review translates these effects into economic losses, adjusting for risk, using Monte Carlo simulation applied to an integrated assessment model (the so-called PAGE 2002 model). The exercise, requiring many heroic - and often contestable - assumptions, produces the most quoted figures in the report: that climate change ""will reduce welfare by an amount equivalent to a reduction in consumption per head of between 5 and 20%"" - now and into the future. The absolute magnitude of those projected economic losses is made arbitrarily large by their permanence. Typical benefit-cost calculations applied to appraisal of development projects convert such long-term trajectories into a present value using a discount rate comparable to a market interest rate or some (lower) assumed rate of time preference. The Stern Review, however, argues that any discounting is ethically inappropriate for this global issue: ""if a future generation will be present, we suppose that it has the same claim on our ethical attention as the current one"" (p. 31). The only exception is an allowance for the possibility that future generations are not present - through human extinction - which is held to justify a minuscule discount rate of 0.1 percent per annum (p. 161). The percentage economic losses from climate change appear less daunting if set against the recent pace of expansion in the world economy. Real per capita income growth since 1990 has averaged about 1.5 percent per year worldwide, and about 3 percent in developing countries. In such a regime, a 5 percent one-time drop to a lower expansion path is no more than a two- or three-year delay in attaining a given income level. For China and India, whose economies are doubling in size each decade, even a 20 percent reduction in income would be a mere hiccough on the path to affluence - hardly enough to motivate major shifts in lifestyle ambitions. The dire repercussions on global environments of a greenhouse warming at the upper end of the forecast range are poorly captured by those percentages. Demography has a marginal place in the Review. The underlying IPCC emission scenarios incorporate expected population growth, using the UN medium projections. Many of the climate-change effects incur costs that are similarly magnified by population growth. One-sixth of the world's population is ""threatened"" by water scarcities; 1 in 20 people may be displaced by a rising sea level; mortality may increase from vector-borne diseases and from malnutrition linked to income losses. The later part of the Review is concerned with mitigation and adaptation strategies. It lays out an ambitious set of policies for transition to a low-carbon economy that could stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations over the next several decades. By 2050, emissions would have to be 25 percent below today's and emissions per unit of GDP 75 percent below. In perhaps the most problematic part of the exercise the Review asserts that such cuts could be achieved at a cost of only around 1 percent of annual global GDP - implying that investment in mitigation should be strongly favored on straightforward economic grounds. (This figure, like others in the Review, is acknowledged to lie within a substantial envelope of uncertainty - here a range of -1.0 percent to +3.5 percent of global GDP (p. 212), or, drawing on a wider range of models, -4 percent to +15 percent (p. 241).) In the decades before the investment pays off, adverse consequences of the warming trends already underway must be dealt with by adaptation, such as through better disaster preparedness, lessening the vulnerability of infrastructure, and risk-pooling measures.

The MELA model is based on integrated simulation and optimisation; in the simulation it utilises empirical tree-level models into which the impacts of climate change were introduced by transfer variables derived by using the physiological model FinnFor. Six scenarios with differences in climate and forest management were defined. In simulations, the accelerating tree growth caused by climate change resulted in an increase in maximum sustainable removal of trees at regional level. Changes in regionally optimized forest management were also detected during the analysis period of 30 years; the proportion of thinnings increased because the stands fulfilled the thinning requirements earlier than in the current climate. This study was the first attempt to solve endogenously maximum sustainable timber production and corresponding forest management at the regional level under different climate scenarios. When implemented in the MELA system, which is widely used in Finnish forestry, the transfer variables offer means of disseminating the results from physiological studies to planning of adjustment and mitigation measures under changing climate. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climate change; Computer simulation; Optimization; Regional planning; Forest region; MELA system; National Forest Inventory (NFI); Forestry; climate change; climate effect; forest inventory; forest management; simulation; thinning; Climates; Forest Management; Optimization; Planning; Simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751527545

On 21 September 2005, the European Commission published a new draft directive on air quality, as part of the Thematic Strategy on air pollution. This is a long-term plan on how to reduce air pollution in the European Union in the next 15 years. Immediately after its release, the Commission received criticism for not going far enough from various instances, such as research institutions and nongovernmental organizations concerned with health and environmental effects of air pollution. One policy argument for not taking full measures was the argument of scientific uncertainty. In light of this air quality strategy and the corresponding criticism which ensued, the present article discusses how the ambiguity of scientific uncertainty may contribute to impeding the process of translating scientific findings into concrete policy options. As complete certainty is likely to never be achieved, the question arises whether it is possible to determine and agree on clear and applicable definitions of certain levels of scientific certainty. The case referred to in this paper clearly demonstrates a situation with discordant views on the uncertainty of scientific findings. More discussion on how to define scientific uncertainty and how to deal with it would be beneficial for both the scientific and the political communities. Finally, it is important to recognize that scientific evidence is not the only driver influencing policy decisions. © 2006 Oxford University Press.","Air pollution; Health; Policy; Science; Uncertainty","benzene; carbon monoxide; dichloroethane; nitrogen dioxide; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality standard; article; carcinogenicity; cardiovascular disease; environmental exposure; environmental protection; European Union; exhaust gas; government regulation; health hazard; human; legal aspect; nonhuman; particulate matter; policy; pollution monitoring; respiratory tract disease; safety; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Attitude to Health; European Union; Public Opinion; Public Policy; Science; Uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751438298

During infection. P. marneffei yeast cells exist intracellularly in macrophages. To cope with nutrient deprivation during the infection process, a number of pathogens employ the glyoxylate cycle to utilize fatty acids as carbon sources. The genes which constitute this pathway have been implicated in pathogenesis. To investigate acetate and fatty acid utilization, the acuD gene encoding a key glyoxylate cycle enzyme (isocitrate lyase) was cloned. The acuD gene is regulated by both carbon source and temperature in P. marneffei, being strongly induced at 37°C even in the presence of a repressing carbon source such as glucose. When introduced into the non-pathogenic monomorphic fungus Aspergillus nidulans, the P. marneffei acuD promoter only responds to carbon source. Similarly, when the A. nidulans acuD promoter is introduced into P. marneffei it only responds to carbon source suggesting that P. marneffei possesses both cis elements and trans-acting factors to control acuD by temperature. The Zn(II)2Cys6 DNA binding motif transcriptional activator FacB was cloned and is responsible for carbon source-, but not temperature-, dependent induction of acuD. The expression of acuD at 37°C is induced by AbaA, a key regulator of morphogenesis in P. marneffei, but deletion of abaA does not completely eliminate temperature-dependent induction, suggesting that acuD and the glyoxylate cycle are regulated by a complex network of factors in P. marneffei which may contribute to its pathogenicity. © 2006 The Authors.",,"carbon; fatty acid; fungal protein; glucose; glyoxylic acid; isocitrate lyase; protein FacB; unclassified drug; zinc; acuD gene; article; Aspergillus nidulans; carbon source; controlled study; fatty acid metabolism; fungal gene; fungus growth; fungus hyphae; gene deletion; gene expression; gene induction; macrophage; molecular cloning; mycosis; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; pathogenicity; Penicillium marneffei; priority journal; promoter region; regulatory mechanism; temperature dependence; Acetates; Butyrates; Fungal Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Glucose; Glyoxylates; Humans; Isocitrate Lyase; Models, Biological; Mycoses; Penicillium; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Temperature; Trans-Activators; Emericella nidulans; Fungi; Penicillium marneffei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751375138

We find that in the room temperature as-implanted state in high-resistivity Si both Fe and Cu occupy mainly lattice sites displaced around 0.05 nm (0.5 Å) from substitutional positions. Both are released from these positions during annealing at temperatures between 300 °C and 600 °C. Fe is then found mainly on near-tetrahedral interstitial sites and further annealing causes it to be increasingly incorporated on ideal substitutional sites, on which it is stable to around 800 °C. We have strong indications that during annealing around 600 °C, along with the dominance of interstitial Fe, a redistribution towards the surface takes place, suggesting that the subsequent formation of ideal substitutional Fe may be related to the trapping of Fe at Rp/2, half of its implanted depth. Possible Rp/2 trapping might also have taken place in our Cu experiments but appears to be less efficient since Cu tended to escape to the bulk of the samples. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Design: Prospective study. Settings: University hospital operating room. Participants: Fourteen patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery using hypothermic hemodiluted CPB. Interventions: During moderate (28°-30°C) and tepid hypothermic (33°-34°C) hemodiluted CPB, RsO2 and SvO2 were continuously monitored with a cerebral oximeter via a surface electrode placed on the patient's forehead and with the mixed venous oximeter integrated in the CPB machine, respectively. Measurements and Main Results: Mean ± standard deviation of RsO2, SvO2, PaCO2, and hematocrit were determined prebypass and during moderate and tepid hypothermic phases of CPB while maintaining pump flow at 2.4 L/min/m2 and mean arterial pressure in the 60- to 70-mmHg range. Compared with a prebypass value of 76.0% ± 9.6%, RsO2 was significantly decreased during moderate hypothermia to 58.9% ± 6.4% and increased to 66.4% ± 6.7% after slow rewarming to tepid hypothermia. In contrast, compared with a prebypass value of 78.6% ± 3.3%, SvO2 significantly increased to 84.9% ± 3.6% during moderate hypothermia and decreased to 74.1% ± 5.6% during tepid hypothermia. During moderate hypothermia, there was poor agreement between RsO2 and SvO2 with a gradient of 26%; however, during tepid hypothermia, there was a strong agreement between RsO2 and SvO2 with a gradient of 6%. The temperature-uncorrected PaCO2 was maintained at the normocapnic level throughout the study, whereas the temperature-corrected PaCO2 was significantly lower during the moderate hypothermic phase (26.8 ± 3.1 mmHg) compared with the tepid hypothermic phase (38.9 ± 3.7 mmHg) of CPB. There was a significant and positive correlation between RsO2 and temperature-corrected PaCO2 during hypothermia. Conclusions: During moderate hypothermic hemodiluted CPB, there was a significant increase of SvO2 associated with a paradoxic decrease of RsO2 that was attributed to the low temperature-corrected PaCO2 values. During tepid CPB after slow rewarming, regional cerebral oxygen saturation was increased in association with an increase with the temperature-corrected PaCO2 values. The results show that during hypothermic hemodiluted CPB using the alpha-stat strategy for carbon dioxide homeostasis, cerebral oxygen saturation is significantly higher during tepid than moderate hypothermia. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The results show that during nitrification, N2O emissions are positively related to oxygenation (R 2 = 0.99). However, compared to the rates of ammonium oxidation, the percentage of emitted N2O is greater when oxygenation is low (0.5-1 mgO2 L-1), representing up to 1% of the oxidized ammonium (0.4% on average). During denitrification, the N2O emission reaches a significant peak when the quantity of methanol allows denitrification of between 66% and 88%. When methanol concentrations lead to a denitrification of close to 100%, the flows of N2O are much lower and represent on average 0.2% of the reduced nitrate.

This effect is enhanced by CO2 concentrating mechanisms that actively transport into cells for carbon fixation. CO2 concentrating mechanisms presumably developed in response to atmospheric decrease in CO2 and increase in O2 over geological timescales. In present-day cyanobacteria, CO 2 concentrating mechanisms are induced when the atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) falls below ∼0.4%. Reduction in pCO2 during the Proterozoic may have had two successive effects on cyanobacterial calcification. First, fall in pCO2 below ∼1% (33 times present atmospheric level, PAL) resulted in lower dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations that reduced pH buffering sufficiently for isolated CaCO3 crystals to begin to nucleate adjacent to cyanobacterial cells. As a result, blooms of planktic cyanobacteria induced precipitated 'whitings' of carbonate mud in the water column whose sedimentary accumulation began to dominate carbonate platforms ∼1400-1300 Ma. Second, fall in pCO2 below ∼0.4% (10 PAL) induced CO2-concentrating mechanisms that further increased pH rise adjacent to cells and promoted in vivo cyanobacterial sheath calcification. Crossing of this second threshold is indicated in the fossil record by the appearance of Girvanella 750-700 Ma. Coeval acquisition of CO2 concentrating mechanisms by planktic cyanobacteria further stimulated whiting production. These inferences, that pCO2 fell below ∼1% ∼1400-1300 Ma and below ∼0.4% 750-700 Ma, are consistent with empirical and modelled palaeo-atmosphere estimates. Development of CO 2 concentrating mechanisms was probably temporarily slowed by global cooling ∼700-570 Ma that favoured diffusive entry of CO2 into cells. Lower levels of temperature and DIC at this time would have reduced seawater carbonate saturation state, also hindering cyanobacterial calcification. It is suggested that as Earth emerged from 'Snowball' glaciations in the late Neoproterozoic, global warming and O2 rise reactivated the development of CO2 concentrating mechanisms. At the same time, rising levels of temperature, calcium ions and DIC increased seawater carbonate saturation state, stimulating widespread cyanobacterial in vivo sheath calcification in the Early Cambrian. This biocalcification event promoted rapid widespread development of calcified cyanobacterial reefs and transformed benthic microbial carbonate fabrics. © 2006 The Author.",,"air-sea interaction; biological uptake; calcification; Cambrian; carbon dioxide; carbon fixation; cyanobacterium; Proterozoic; Cyanobacteria; Girvanella; Merlangius merlangus; Sillaginidae",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751249585

We assume that mass-independent fractionation (MIF) of sulfur isotopes - characteristic of the Archean - was best preserved in sediments when insoluble elemental sulfur (S8) was an important product of atmospheric photochemistry. Efficient S8 production requires three things: (i) very low levels of tropospheric O2; (ii) a source of sulfur gases to the atmosphere at least as large as the volcanic SO2 source today; and (iii) a sufficiently high abundance of methane or other reduced gas. All three requirements must be met. We suggest that the disappearance of a strong MIF sulfur signature at the beginning of the Proterozoic is better explained by the collapse of atmospheric methane, rather than by a failure of volcanism or the rise of oxygen. The photochemical models are consistent in demanding that methane decline before O2 can rise (although they are silent as to how quickly), and the collapse of a methane greenhouse effect is consistent with the onset of major ice ages immediately following the disappearance of MIF sulfur. We attribute the decline of methane to the growth of the oceanic sulfate pool as indicated by the widening envelope of mass-dependent sulfur fractionation through the Archean. We find that a given level of biological forcing can support either oxic or anoxic atmospheres, and that the transition between the anoxic state and the oxic state is inhibited by high levels of atmospheric methane. Transition from an oxygen-poor to an oxygen-rich atmosphere occurs most easily when methane levels are low, which suggests that the collapse of methane not only caused the end of MIF S and major ice ages, but it may also have enabled the rise of O2. In this story the early Proterozoic ice ages were ended by the establishment of a stable oxic atmosphere, which protected a renewed methane greenhouse with an ozone shield. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"Archean; atmospheric chemistry; isotopic fractionation; methane; numerical model; photochemistry; Proterozoic; sulfur isotope; volcanic gas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751225049

Daytime visibility was observed around noon at two observation sites in metropolitan Kaohsiung, Taiwan in the years of 1999 and 2000. Both seasonal and diurnal variation patterns of visibility were observed in the region. Ambient aerosols were sampled and analyzed for 11 constituents, including water-soluble ionic species (Cl-, NO3-, SO4-2, NH4+, K+, Na+, Ca+2, and Mg+2) and carbonaceous contents (OC, EC, and TC), to characterize the chemical composition of Kaohsiung aerosols. Furthermore, a stepwise multiple linear regression model was developed to elucidate the influence of aerosol species on visibility impairments. The results showed that sulfate was the dominant species that affected both light scattering coefficient and visibility. On average, the percentage contributions of visibility degrading species to light scattering coefficient were 29% for sulfate, 28% for nitrate, 22% for total carbon, and 21% for PM2.5-remainder. An empirical regression model of visibility based on sulfate, nitrate, and relative humidity was also developed. The model showed that sulfate in PM2.5 was the most sensitive species to visibility variation, suggesting that the reduction of sulfate in PM2.5 could effectively improve the visibility of metropolitan Kaohsiung. During the investigation period, an event of Asian dusts intruded metropolitan Kaohsiung and dramatically increased the aerosol loadings, especially in the coarse particles. However, local visual air quality did not degrade accordingly during the Asian dust event because both visibility and light scattering coefficient are affected mainly by the fine particles.

Sample collection was performed in April-July 2003, after the Prestige oil spill (November 2002), to determine whether the hydrocarbons released into the water column as a consequence of the spill were accumulated by the planktonic communities during the subsequent spring and early summer blooms. Surface sediments were also collected to assess the presence of the spilled oil, removed from the water column by downward particle transport. Plankton concentrations of PAHs (Σ14 parent components) were in the range of 25-898 ng g-1 dw, the highest values being close to coastal urban areas. However, the individual distributions were highly dominated by alkyl naphthalenes and phenanthrenes, paralleling those in the water dissolved fraction. The detailed study of petrogenic molecular markers (e.g. steranes and triterpanes, and methyl phenanthrenes and dibenzothiophenes) showed the occurrence of background petrogenic pollution but not related with the Prestige oil, with the possible exception of the station off Costa da Morte in May 2003, heavily oiled after the accident. The dominant northerly wind conditions during the spring and early summer 2003, which prevented the arrival of fresh oil spilled from the wreck, together with the heavy nature of the fuel oil, which was barely dispersed in seawater, and the large variability of planktonic cycles, could be the factors hiding the acute accumulation of the spilled hydrocarbons. Then, with the above exception, the concentrations of PAHs found in the collected samples, mostly deriving from chronic pollution, can be considered as the reference values for the region. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Local authorities' responses to climate change have tended to concentrate on their role in reducing greenhouse gases. However, the scientific consensus is that we also need to adapt to unavoidable climate change. Spatial planning at a local level has a critical anticipatory role to play in promoting robust adaptation. This paper reviews the shift in local authorities' planning policies for climate change adaptation in the UK since 2000, and provides evidence of underlying attitudes amongst planning professionals to climate change. It shows that, while the issue of climate change is becoming recognized with respect to flood risk, the wider implications (for instance, for biodiversity and water resources) are not yet integrated into plans. The reasons for this lie in lack of political support and lack of engagement of the planning profession with climate change networks. But the paper also argues there are difficulties in acknowledging the need for adaptation at the local level, with the short-term horizons of local plans at odds with perceptions of the long-term implications of climate change.",,"climate change; greenhouse gas; local adaptation; local planning; policy strategy; spatial planning",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751096707

The Aptian stratigraphic record, represented in shallow-water, slope and deep-water deposits, provides a good opportunity to investigate the regional response to the worldwide documented climatic, biotic and palaeoceanographic changes related to Oceanic Anoxic Event 1a (OAE1a). A synthesis of data previously published (Ischitella and Coppitella sections), together with original data (Val Carbonara and Coppa della Guardia sections), from four stratigraphic sections from different depositional settings (proximal to distal) is provided, using an integrated, high-resolution micropalaeontological (planktonic foraminifera and calcareous nannofossils) and, for one section, geochemical (stable carbon and oxygen isotopes) approach. Organic matter preservation is confined to the more distal areas and consists of two thin intervals of black shales in the Aptian portion of the Marne a Fucoidi Formation. Biostratigraphic data assign the older black shale (5 cm thick) to the Selli Level equivalent (OAE1a, Lower Aptian); this carbon-rich interval is immediately followed by another black shale (7-10 cm thick) of early Late Aptian age. OAE1a is generally interpreted as a high-productivity event during a warming interval, followed by a cooling trend. In the Gargano Promontory, although the oxygen isotope curve indicates the above-mentioned climatic evolution, the micropalaeontological data do not support high fertility of the surface water, whereas micropalaeontological and geochemical data for the younger black shale do record high productivity (radiolarian increase in overall abundance, low nannofossil and foraminiferal species richness, increase in abudance of nannofossil fertility indices) associated with a cooling trend. The carbon and oxygen isotope record is in line with evidence from the curves documented elsewhere, whereas, among the biotic events, only the ""nannoconid crisis"" preceding OAE1a is revealed to be globally correlable. Environmental models for the two episodes of organic matter preservation are proposed, taking into account both global and local controlling factors. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is know about the change of carbon fluxes in lakes during such processes. We conducted a case study in Lake Biandantang to investigate the change of carbon fluxes during such a regime shift. Dissolved aquatic carbon and gaseous carbon (methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2)) across air-water interface in three sites with different vegetation covers and compositions were studied and compared. CH4 emissions from three sites were 0.62±0.36, 0.70±0.36, and 1.31±0.57 mg m-2 h-1, respectively. Correlation analysis showed that macrophytes, rather than phytoplankton, directly positively affected CH4 emission. CO2 fluxes of three sites in Lake Biandantang were significantly different, and the average values were 77.8±20.4, 52.2±14.1 and 3.6±26.8 mg m-2 h-1, respectively. There were an evident trend that the larger macrophyte biomass, the lower CO2 emissions. Correlation analysis showed that in different sites, dominant plant controlled CO2 flux across air-water interface. In a year cycle, the percents of gaseous carbon release from lake accounting for net primary production were significantly different (from 39.3% to 2.8%), indicating that with the decline of macrophytes and regime shift, the lake will be a larger carbon source to the atmosphere. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Though less seasonally variable than the grassland, shrubland NEE was more responsive to monsoon rains than anticipated. During the 2004-growing season we measured leaf gas exchange and collected leaf tissue for δ13C and nitrogen content analysis periodically among three size classes of the dominant woody-plant, Prosopis velutina and the dominant understory species, Sporobolus wrightii, a C4 bunchgrass, present at the shrubland. We observed size-class and plant functional type independent patterns of seasonal plant performance consistent with greater-than-anticipated sensitivity of NEE in the shrubland.

These inventories are particularly important to State Implementation Plans (SIP), the plan required for each state to file with the Federal government indicating how they will comply with the Federal Clean Air Act (FCAA). However, techniques for determining the fugitive dust contribution to over all PM10 emissions are still in their developmental stages. In the past, the methods have included field monitoring stations, specialized field studies and field wind-tunnel studies. The measurements made in this paper allow for systematic determination of PM10 emission rates through the use of an environmental boundary layer wind tunnel in the laboratory. Near surface steady-state concentration profiles and velocity profiles are obtained in order to use a control volume approach to estimate emission rates. This methodology is applied to soils retrieved from the nation's single largest PM10 source, Owens (dry) Lake in California, to estimate emission rates during active storm periods.

The biochemical interactions between these two pathways are not fully understood. In the Arabidopsis mutant shrunken seed 1 (sse1)/pex16, a reduced rate of fatty acid synthesis leads to starch accumulation. To further understand the metabolic impact of the decrease in oil synthesis, we compared soluble metabolites in sse1 and wild type (WT) seeds. Sugars, sugar phosphates, alcohols, pyruvate, and many other organic acids accumulated in sse1 seeds as a likely consequence of the reduced carbon demand for lipid synthesis. The enlarged pool size of hexose-P, the metabolites at the crossroad of sugar metabolism, glycolysis, and starch synthesis, was likely a direct cause of the increased flow into starch. Downstream of glycolysis, more carbon entered the TCA cycle as an alternative to the fatty acid pathway, causing the total amount of TCA cycle intermediates to rise while moving the steady state of the cycle away from fumarate. To convert the excess carbon metabolites into starch, we introduced the Escherichia coli starch synthetic enzyme ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) into sse1 seeds. Expression of AGPase enhanced net starch biosynthesis in the mutant, resulting in starch levels that reached 37% of seed weight. However, further increases above this level were not achieved and most of the carbon intermediates remained high in comparison with the WT, indicating that additional mechanisms limit starch deposition in Arabidopsis seeds. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Arabidopsis thaliana; Carbon metabolism; Metabolite profiling; Oil; Seeds; Starch; Storage","amino acid; Arabidopsis protein; carbon; fatty acid; glucose 1 phosphate adenylyltransferase; recombinant protein; starch; vegetable oil; Arabidopsis; article; biological model; carbohydrate metabolism; Escherichia coli; gene expression regulation; genetics; lipid metabolism; mass fragmentography; metabolism; physiology; plant seed; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; transgenic plant; Amino Acids; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Carbon; Escherichia coli; Fatty Acids; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Glucose-1-Phosphate Adenylyltransferase; Lipid Metabolism; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Models, Biological; Plant Oils; Plants, Genetically Modified; Recombinant Proteins; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Seeds; Starch; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Escherichia coli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750968505

Anklam Road, Tucson, AZ 85745, United States","Aim: The influence of anthropogenic climate change on organisms is an area of great scientific concern. Increasingly there is recognition that abrupt climate transitions have occurred over the late Quaternary; studies of these shifts may yield insights into likely biotic responses to contemporary warming. Here, we review research undertaken over the past decade investigating the response of Neotoma (woodrats) body size and distribution to climate change over the late Quaternary (the last 40,000 years). By integrating information from woodrat palaeomiddens, historical museum specimens and field studies of modern populations, we identify potential evolutionary responses to climate change occurring over a variety of temporal and spatial scales. Specifically, we characterize climatic thresholds in the past that led to local species extirpation and/or range alterations rather than in situ adaptation, and apply them to anticipate potential biotic responses to anthropogenic climate change. Location: Middens were collected at about 55 sites scattered across the western United States, ranging from about 34 to 46°N and about 104 to 116°W, respectively. Data for modern populations were drawn from studies conducted in Death Valley, California, Missoula, Montana and the Sevilleta LTER site in central New Mexico. Methods: We analysed faecal pellets from midden series collected at numerous cave sites across the western United States. From these we estimated body mass using techniques validated in earlier studies. We compared body size fluctuations at different elevations in different regions and integrated these results with studies investigating temperature-body size tradeoffs in modern animals. We also quantify the rapidity of the size changes over the late Quaternary to estimate the evolutionary capacity of woodrats to deal with predicted rates of anthropogenic climate change over the next century. Results: We find remarkable similarities across the geographical range to late Quaternary climate change. In the middle of the geographical range woodrats respond in accordance to Bergmann's rule: colder climatic conditions select for larger body size and warmer conditions select for smaller body size. Patterns are more complicated at range boundaries, and local environmental conditions influence the observed response. In general, woodrat body size fluctuates with approximately the same amplitude and frequency as climate; there is a significant and positive correlation between woodrat body size and generalized climate proxies (such as ice core records). Woodrats have achieved evolutionary rates of change equal to or greater than those needed to adapt in situ to anthropogenic climate change. Main conclusions: In situ body size evolution is a likely outcome of climate change, and such shifts are part of a normal spectrum of adaptation. Woodrats appear to be subject to ongoing body size selection in response to fluctuating environmental conditions. Allometric considerations suggest that these shifts in body size lead to substantial changes in the physiology, life history and ecology of woodrats, and on their direct and indirect interactions with other organisms in the ecosystem. Our work highlights the importance of a finely resolved and long-term record in understanding biotic responses to climatic shifts. © 2006 The Authors.","Adaptation; Body size; Darwins; Evolutionary change; Global climate change; Late Quaternary; Temperature; Western North America; Woodrat middens","anthropogenic effect; body size; climate change; environmental effect; geographical distribution; historical record; midden; rodent; warming; California; Death Valley; Missoula; Montana; New Mexico; North America; Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge; United States; Animalia; Neotoma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750949165

We have studied responses of soil microbial biomass C (MBC) concentrations and metabolic quotients (qCO2, CO2-C / biomass-C) to vegetations and temperature in temperate volcanic forest soils. Soils were sampled in April and October 2003 beneath four forest stands in close proximity (200 m apart) in central Japan: a Japanese cedar coniferous forest (CI), a pine coniferous forest (CII), and an oak-dominated hardwood on a grading and steep slope (DI and DII). The soil MBC concentrations and qCO2 values beneath each forest stand were measured under oxic conditions, along with the effect of temperature and the long-term storage at low temperature on both variables. Comparing different forest stands, it was indicated that the pine forest soil always showed the lowest MBC concentration relative to soil total C, and the largest qCO2 (P &lt; 0.05), suggesting that microbial communities in the soil were less efficient in C use than communities in the other forest soils. Under a same oak-dominated hardwood, a steep terrain induced a lower soil respiration and MBC concentration, but qCO2 values of both soils had no significant differences at 25 °C. The MBC concentration in the soils beneath each forest stand mostly had no differences during two sampling periods. The low-temperature storage induced an increase in soil MBC and a reduction of CO2 production, reducing the qCO2. There was a smaller MBC concentration in the CII soil than in the CI and DII soil within the range of 5 to 35 °C; the MBC concentration and qCO2 in the DI and CII soil appeared more sensitive at increasing temperature than those in the DII and CI soil. From the results obtained, it can be concluded that under similar climatic conditions and soil types, the MBC concentrations and qCO2 values of temperate volcanic forest soils vary with tree species and temperature, and that the high soil C-to-N ratios and low acidity can contribute to decreased soil MBC concentration and to increased qCO2. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Box 373, York YO10 5YW, United Kingdom","We investigated turnover of methane (CH4) in soils from a poorly drained UK forest. In situ, this forest exhibited a negligible soil-atmosphere CH4 flux, whereas adjacent grassland plots were sources of CH4. We hypothesised that the forest plots exhibited reduced anaerobic CH4 production through water-table draw down. Consequently, we exposed soil cores from under oak to high and low water-table conditions in the laboratory. Methane fluxes increased significantly in the high water-table (1925 ± 1702 μg CH4 m-2 h-1) compared to the low one (-3.5 ± 6.8 μg CH4 m-2 h-1). Natural abundance δ13C values of CH4 showed a strong depletion in high water-table cores (-56.7 ± 2.9‰) compared to methane in ambient air (-46.0‰) indicative of methanogenic processes. The δ13C values of CH4 from low water-table cores (δ13C-46.8 ± 0.2‰) was similar to ambient air and suggested little alteration of headspace CH4 by the soil microbial community. In order to assess the CH4 oxidizing activity of the two treatments conclusively, a 13CH4 spike was added to the cores and 13CO2 production was measured as the by-product of CH4 oxidation. 13CH4 oxidation rates were 57.5 (±12.7) and 0.5 (±0.1) μg CH4 m-2 h-1 for high and low water-tables, respectively. These data show that the lower water-table hydrology treatment impacted methanogenic processes without stimulating methanotrophy.","Carbon-13; Forest; Methane; Soil; Turnover; Water table","carbon; methane; water; ambient air; drawdown; forest soil; methane; soil chemistry; stable isotope; water table; article; chemistry; metabolism; soil; tree; Carbon Isotopes; Methane; Soil; Trees; Water; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750796462

The complex was stabilized by exploiting the ""glass transition"" in protein dynamics that occurs at around -53 °C (220 K). Substrate was flowed into the crystal in a cryoprotective solvent above this temperature, and then the crystal was rapidly cooled to a temperature below the transition to trap the species that formed. The use of a flow cell makes the experiment a kinetic one and means that the species prior to the rate determining transition state has a chance to accumulate. The resulting crystal structure shows an acyl-enzyme intermediate in which the leaving group is absent and the carbonyl carbon of the C-terminal alanine residue is covalently bound to the gamma oxygen of the active site serine. The ester carbonyl shows no significant distortion from planarity, with the carbonyl oxygen forming one hydrogen bond with the oxyanion hole. The tripeptide is bound in an extended antiparallel β-sheet with main chain residues of the enzyme. The geometry and interactions of this acyl-enzyme suggest that it represents a productive intermediate. To test this hypothesis, the same crystal was then warmed above the glass transition temperature and a second data set was collected. The resulting electron density map shows no sign of the substrate, indicating hydrolysis of the intermediate followed by product release. This experiment provides direct evidence for the importance of dynamic properties in catalysis and also provides a blueprint for the stabilization of other short-lived species for direct crystallographic observation. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The first conforms to the characters of Xenotheca devonica (Arber and Goode) Hilton and Edwards previously recognised from the Upper Devonian of North Devon, to which it is assigned. The Taffs Well specimens provide additional information on intraspecific variation within this morphospecies that is now known to possess 4-8 preintegumentary lobes in the distal 50-66% of preovule length. This represents the first occurrence of this morphospecies outside the type locality and highlights the morphological similarities observed in the morphogenera Xenotheca and Moresnetia and the genus Elkinsia. Cupules of the second kind occur terminally on a cruciately dichotomous branching system and have distinctive long and thin cupule tips. Cupules bear at least one asymmetric preovule that comprises an entire integument in the proximal 90% of preovule length and distally possess ca. 4 short and wide preintegumentary lobes. Features of its cupule and integument are distinct from all other recognised early seed plants leading to the establishment of Glamorgania gayerii gen. et sp. nov. Glamorgania shows that by the onset of the Carboniferous some seed plants had attained an almost complete integumentary surround. These records add to the growing body of data on the earliest seed plants and their initial phase of phenotypic radiation in the Upper Devonian.

In particular, the traffic emissions caused by acceleration and deceleration of vehicles are modelled based on an instantaneous emission model integrated with a microscopic traffic simulation model. The emission model is based on empirical measurements which relate vehicle emission to the type, the instantaneous speed and acceleration of the vehicle. The traffic model captures the second-by-second speed and acceleration of individual vehicles travelling in a road network based on their individual driving style, the vehicle mechanics, and their interaction with other traffic and with traffic control in the network. The integrated model is applied to test a new technology to actively manage the driving speed of the vehicles in an urban network. Their impacts on vehicle emission in the network are assessed to give an indication of the relative effectiveness of the different technological designs and different levels of driver responses. The results show that, while the speed management has effectively reduced the average speed of the traffic, their impact on vehicle emissions is complex. For the study network, the frequent acceleration and deceleration movements in the network has significantly reduced the effect of the reduced average speed on emission. The net results are that the active speed management has no significant impact on pollutant emissions.

Both gi and the stomatal conductance (g sc) of leaves were closely coupled to Vcmax, J max and An with all variables decreasing with increasing leaf age. Consequently, both Ci and Cc (chloroplastic CO2 concentration) remained largely conserved through successive growing seasons. The N content of leaves, as well as the amount of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and other sodium dodecyl sulfate-soluble proteins, increased during the first three growing seasons, then stabilized or decreased only slightly afterwards. Thus, the age-related photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (PNUE) decline of leaves was not a consequence of decreased allocation of N towards Rubisco and other proteins involved in bioenergetics and light harvesting. Rather, loss of photosynthetic capacity was the result of the decreased activation state of Rubisco and proportional down-regulation of electron transport towards the photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) and photorespiratory (PCO) cycles in response to a reduction of CO2 supply to the chloroplasts' stroma. This study emphasizes the regulatory potential and homeostaticity of C c - rather than photosynthetic metabolites or Ci - in relation to the commonly observed correlation between photosynthesis and g sc. © 2006 The Authors.","A-Ci curves; CO2 transfer conductance; Leaf ageing; Photosynthesis model Pseudotsuga menziesii; Rubisco activity","carbon; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; pigment; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; aging population; assimilation efficiency; bioenergetics; carbon dioxide; enzyme activity; evergreen tree; photosynthesis; stomatal conductance; article; catalysis; diffusion; Douglas fir; enzyme activation; enzymology; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; plant; plant leaf; regression analysis; time; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Isotopes; Catalysis; Diffusion; Enzyme Activation; Least-Squares Analysis; Nitrogen; Photosynthesis; Pigments, Biological; Plant Leaves; Plant Shoots; Pseudotsuga; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase; Time Factors; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750540172

In the present study, various physico-chemical parameters of the MSW were analyzed to characterize the waste dumped at Gazipur landfill site in Delhi, India, which shows that it contains a high fraction of degradable organic components. The decomposition of organic components produces methane, a significant contributor to global warming. Based on the waste composition, waste age and the total amount dumped, a first-order decay model (FOD) was applied to estimate the methane generation potential of the Gazipur landfill site, which yields an estimate of 15.3 Gg/year. This value accounts to about 1-3% of existing Indian landfill methane emission estimates. Based on the investigation of Gazipur landfill, we estimate Indian landfill methane emissions at 1.25 Tg/year or 1.68 Tg/year of methane generation potential. These values are within the range of existing estimates. A comparison of FOD with a recently proposed triangular model was also performed and it shows that both models can be used for the estimation of methane generation. However, the decrease of the emission after closure is more gradual in the case of the first-order model, leading to larger gas production predictions after more than 10 years of closure. The regional and global implications of national landfill methane emission are also discussed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Our interdisciplinary approach aims to better inform the policy process, by combining biogeochemical and socioeconomic components of managed realignment schemes. Adding 7494 ha of new intertidal area to the UK Humber estuary through managed realignment leads to the annual accumulation of a 1.2 × 105 t of 'new' sediment and increases the current annual sink of organic C and N, and particle reactive P in the estuary by 150%, 83% and 50%, respectively. The increase in intertidal area should also increase denitrification. However, this positive outcome is offset by the negative effect of enhanced greenhouse gas emissions in new marshes in the low salinity region of the estuary. Short-term microbial reactions decrease the potential benefits of CO2 sequestration through gross organic carbon burial by at least 50%. Net carbon storage is thus most effective where oxidation and denitrification reactions are reduced. In the Humber this translates to wet, saline marshes at the seaward end of estuaries. Cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was used to determine the economic efficiency of the Extended Deep Green managed realignment. When compared to a 'Hold-the-Line' future scenario, i.e. the present state/extent of sea defences in the estuary, the CBA shows that managed realignment is cost effective when viewed on &gt; 25 year timescales. This is because capital costs are incurred in the first years, whereas the benefits from habitat creation, carbon sequestration and reduced maintenance costs build up over time. Over 50- and 100-year timescales, the Extended Deep Green managed realignment scenario is superior in efficiency terms. The increased sediment accumulation is also likely to enhance storage of contaminant metals. In the case of Cu, a metal that currently causes significant water quality issues, Cu removal due to burial of suspended sediment in realigned areas translates to a value of approximately £1000 a- 1 (avoided clean up costs). Although this is not formally included in the CBA it illustrates another likely positive economic outcome of managed realignment. Although we focus on the Humber, the history of reclamation and its biogeochemistry is common to many estuaries in northern Europe. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Its rotation speed was from 6 000 r/min to 24 000 r/min, and the maximum flux was 0.1 kg/s. The structural design of the electric supercharger is novel, which makes it easier to set the lubricating installation and to assemble. The velocity distribution at the outlet of the electric supercharger is determined by hot-wire anemometry under various rotation speeds in steady state. Furthermore, the trends of the flux and charge rate with various speeds were analyzed. In addition, the transient response was detected from the motor setup to smooth running within 10 s, 15 s, 20 s and 25 s respectively, and the characteristic of the transient flux is under pilot study. Research results indicate that the electric supercharger can respond rapidly with the great flux, and it is independent of the operating conditions of a diesel engine.

Particular attention has been devoted to the analysis of the possible existence of a linear trend in the climatic signal. The long-term aspects of drought over the globe during the last forty years have been evaluated by computing the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) on 24-month time scale. The SPI, in fact, seems to be a useful tool for monitoring dry and wet periods on multiple time scales and comparing climatic conditions of areas governed by different hydrological regimes. To unveil possible discrepancies between the analyses carried out with the two data sets, we studied the leading space-time variability of drought by applying the principal component analysis (PCA) to the SPI time series. Results suggest that on the global scale, the two re-analyses agree in their first principal component score, but not in the associated loading: both re-analyses capture a linear trend, though the areas where this feature should be most likely observed are not uniquely identified by the two data sets. Moreover, while the ERA-40 unveils the presence of a weak net 'global' trend towards wet conditions, the NCEP/NCAR re-analysis suggests that the areas in the world characterised by positive/negative trends balance to zero. At large regional scale, a good agreement of the results with those obtained from the observations are found for the United Stated, while for the European sector the two re-analyses show remarkable differences both in the first loading and in representing the timing of the wet and dry periods. Also for these areas a linear trend, superposed on other short-term fluctuations, is detectable in the first principal component of the SPI field. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.","Drought assessment; Large-scale variability; Principal component analysis; Re-analysis data; Standardized precipitation index","Climate change; Data reduction; Hydrology; Precipitation (meteorology); Principal component analysis; Time series analysis; Drought assessment; Hydrological regimes; Large-scale variability; Standardized precipitation index; Drought; Climate change; Data reduction; Drought; Hydrology; Precipitation (meteorology); Principal component analysis; Time series analysis; climate conditions; climate variation; data assimilation; drought; precipitation assessment; principal component analysis; regional climate; trend analysis; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750406202

The time for cleaning and rinsing was reduced to 2 min for 0.13 μm features. The vias and trenches were cleaned with a hydrocarbon surfactant, polyoxyethylene 2,6,8-triethyl-4-nonyl ether (5b-C12E8), in water solution to provide detergency, followed by emulsification with the addition of pure CO2. The post-etch and post-ash residues were removed from the vias and trenches both as a suspension and in a dissolved state in microemulsions and/or macroemulsions of water and carbon dioxide. The surfactant is ambidextrous in that it is interfacially active in fundamentally different types of interfaces: the solid-water, solid-CO2, and water-CO2 interfaces. The residues, water and surfactant were displaced from the cleaning vessel with CO2 assisted by gravity to reduce the rinse time from well over 10 min to approximately 1 min. The low interfacial tension produced by surfactant and supercritical CO2 is beneficial in reducing the Laplace pressure to facilitate both penetration and removal of the cleaning solution.

Experimental data are then used to estimate the odour emission factors (OEFs) relevant to single-process steps. An OEF is a representative value that relates the quantity of odour released to the atmosphere to a specific activity index, which may be for example the waste treatment capacity, the gross weight production, the site surface or a time unit. In this study, the OEFs were calculated as a function of the plant capacity, and expressed in ouE t-1, because of the existence of a proportionality between plant capacity and odour emissions. The results show that the major odour source of a waste MBT plant is represented by the aerobic biological treatment (with an OEF equal to 1.40×108 ouE t-1).

Due to these interactions, the statistical characterization of rainfall alone is a poor characterization of agricultural yield. Using a simple linear model of human population dynamics, we show that the observed yield variation can affect long-term population growth substantially.

Spinetto 785, 6300 Santa Rosa, La Pampa, Argentina","The Western Pampas consists of a large and complex sand dune system that originated during the last Pleistocene glaciations and was reworked during later semi-desertic episodes. Humans only colonized the region during the last century, but their action was powerful enough to produce two catastrophic events: one during the first half of the century, and the other one during the second half. Deforestation, over grazing, over cropping plus a non-suitable tillage technology in interaction with extremely dry and windy conditions of the 1930s and 1940s, caused a large dust-bowl episode that triggered severe dust storms, cattle mortality, crop failure, farmer bankruptcy and rural migration. During the second half of the century, improved rainfall conditions favored the conversion of abandoned lands into grazing lands and croplands. At the same time, recurrent episodes of flooding affected the area between 1970 and 2002, more drastically in the highly productive lowlands of the Río Quinto Watershed. The configuration of dunes with respect to the slope, and the lack of a suitable infrastructure, impeded water removal and favored its accumulation. High cultivation rates dramatically increased the severity of floods during such humid periods. The ecological catastrophes of the Western Pampas during the 20th century were the result of a complex interaction involving the geological configuration, climate variability and human intervention. Over cropping has probably surpassed critical ecological thresholds and this, in turn, triggered both the dust-bowl and the flooding events. On the other hand, natural feed-back mechanisms were probably activated allowing a later stabilization and recovery of the affected lands. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"anthropogenic effect; catastrophic event; deforestation; dune; farming system; flooding; land degradation; rainfall; Argentina; Pampas; South America; Bos taurus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750085556

Energy-intensive industries may be particularly vulnerable to higher energy costs caused by climate policy. If companies cannot offset rising energy costs and would face increased competition from countries without climate policy, they may decide to relocate their industrial production to the countries without climate policy. The resulting net effect of climate policy on GHG emissions in foreign countries is typically referred to as ""carbon leakage"". Carbon leakage may lead to higher global GHG emissions due to the use of less advanced technology in less developed countries. Based on a literature review of climate policy, earlier environmental policy and analyses of historical trends, this paper assesses the carbon leakage effects of climate policy for energy-intensive industries. Reviews of past trends in production location of energy-intensive industries show an increased global production share of Non-Annex 1 countries. However, from empirical analyses we conclude that the trend is primarily driven by regional demand growth. In contrast, climate policy models show a strong carbon leakage. Even though future climate policy may have a more profound impact than environmental policies in the past, the modelling results are doubtful. Leakage generally seems to be overestimated in current models, especially as potential positive spillovers are often not included in the models. The ambiguity of the empirical analyses and the modelling results warrants further research in the importance of production factors for relocation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Since its intentional introduction to the Jiuduansha Island in the Yangtze River estuary, Spartina alterniflora community has become one of the dominant vegetation types. We investigated the soil carbon in the Spartina alterniflora community and compared it with that of the native C3 Scirpus mariqueter community by measuring total soil carbon (TC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil nitrogen (TN), and the stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of various fractions. TC and SOC were significantly higher in Spartina alterniflora in the top 60 cm of soil. However, there was no significant difference in soil inorganic carbon (IC) between the two communities. Stable carbon isotopic analysis suggests that the fraction of SOC pool contributed by Spartina alterniflora varied from 0.90% to 10.64% at a soil depth of 0-100 cm with a greater percentage between 20 and 40 cm deep soils. The δ13C decreased with increasing soil depth in both communities, but the difference in δ13C among layers of the top 60 cm soil was significant (p &lt; 0.05), while that for the deeper soil layers (&gt;60 cm) was not detected statistically. The changes in δ13C with depth appeared to be associated with the small contribution of residues from Spartina alterniflora at greater soil depth that was directly related to the vertical root distribution of the species. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Such analysis enables key variables that instigate CO2 emission intensity to be identified while at the same time providing opportunities to verify the mitigation and adaptation capacities of countries. However, most CO2 decomposition analysis has been conducted for the developed economies and little attention has been paid to sub-Saharan Africa. The need for such an analysis for SSA is overwhelming for several reasons. Firstly, the region is amongst the most vulnerable to climate change. Secondly, there are disparities in the amount and composition of energy consumption and the levels of economic growth and development in the region. Thus, a decomposition analysis of CO2 emission intensity for SSA affords the opportunity to identify key influencing variables and to see how they compare among countries in the region. Also, attempts have been made to distinguish between oil and non-oil-producing SSA countries. To this effect a comparative static analysis of CO2 emission intensity for oil-producing and non oil-producing SSA countries for the periods 1971-1998 has been undertaken, using the refined Laspeyres decomposition model. Our analysis confirms the findings for other regions that CO2 emission intensity is attributable to energy consumption intensity, CO2 emission coefficient of energy types and economic structure. Particularly, CO2 emission coefficient of energy use was found to exercise the most influence on CO2 emission intensity for both oil and non-oil-producing sub-Saharan African countries in the first sub-interval period of our investigation from 1971-1981. In the second subinterval of 1981-1991, energy intensity and structural effect were the two major influencing factors on emission intensity for the two groups of countries. However, energy intensity effect had the most pronounced impact on CO2 emission intensity in non-oil-producing sub-Saharan African countries, while the structural effect explained most of the increase in CO2 emission intensity among the oil-producing countries. Finally, for the period 1991-1998, structural effect accounted for much of the decrease in intensity among non-oil-producers, while CO2 emission coefficient of energy use was the major force driving the decrease among oil-producing countries. The dynamic changes in the CO2 emission intensity and energy intensity effects for the two groups of countries suggest that fuel switching had been predominantly towards more carbon-intensive production in oil-producing countries and less carbon-intensive production in non-oil-producing SSA countries. In addition to the decomposition analysis, the article discusses policy implications of the results. We hope that the information and analyses provided here would help inform national energy and climate policy makers in SSA of the relative weaknesses and possible areas of strategic emphasis in their planning processes for mitigating the effects of climate change. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In the White Paper it was recognised that such a dramatic reduction in emissions will require significant changes in the way in which energy is produced and used. However there has been a general failure to recognise the fact that in order to meet emissions targets, the UK will have to significantly reduce its energy consumption; this is not helped by the general misconception in the UK that reductions in CO2 emissions will occur simply by increasing the production of electricity from renewable sources. Specifically, this paper highlights the current trends in renewables deployment and energy demand, with a specific focus on Scotland, where the authorities have set more ambitious renewables targets than the rest of the UK. As will be demonstrated in this paper, without energy demand reduction, the deployment of renewables alone will not be sufficient to curtail growth in UK CO2 emissions. This is illustrated using a case study of the Scottish housing sector; whilst this case study is necessarily local in scope, the results have global relevance. The paper will also address the magnitude of energy savings required to bring about a reduction in emissions and assesses the status of the policies and technologies that could help bring such reductions about. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In Sweden, only about one third of the demand for district heat (DH) is supplied from CHP. This share could be significantly larger if the profitability of CHP generation increased. The objective of this study was to analyse the extent to which the profitability for investments in new CHP plants in the Swedish DH sector have changed thanks to the recently implemented trading schemes for green certificates (TGCs) and CO2 emissions (TEPs). The analysis was carried out using a simulation model of the Swedish DH sector in which the profitability of CHP investments for all DH systems, with and without the two trading schemes applied, is compared. In addition, a comparison was made of the changes in CHP generation, CO2 emissions, and operation costs if investments are made in the CHP plant shown to be most profitable in each system according to the model. The study shows that the profitability of investments in CHP plants increased significantly with the introductions of TGC and TEP schemes. If all DH utilities also undertook their most profitable CHP investments, the results indicate a major increase in power generation which, in turn, would reduce the CO2 emissions from the European power sector by up to 13 Mton/year, assuming that coal condensing power is displaced. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

These models usually do not address the subgrid-scale effects associated with emissions from large elevated point sources. This can lead to errors in the calculation of PM2.5 concentrations downwind of these sources because of unrealistic representations of the dispersion and transformation processes that govern PM2.5 formation. Here, we describe the development, application and evaluation of a plume-in-grid (PiG) model for PM. The model, based on an existing PiG model for ozone, is extended to include in the plume component state-of-the-science treatments of aerosol chemistry and dynamics as well as aqueous chemistry that are consistent with the treatments used in the host grid model. Application of this model to several SO2 and NOx emitting power plants in the southeastern United States shows that the PiG treatment leads to significant differences in sulfate and total inorganic nitrate concentrations. Comparisons of model results, with and without PiG treatment, against measurements characterizing specific plume events, show that the PiG treatment captures the plume events more often and generally better than the standard grid-based approach. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A climate change IPCC-A2 scenario run with an atmosphere regional climate model is used to force a Mediterranean Sea high-resolution ocean model over the 1960-2099 period. For comparison, a control simulation as long as the scenario has also been carried out under present climate fluxes. This control run shows air-sea fluxes in agreement with observations, stable temperature and salinity characteristics and a realistic thermohaline circulation simulating the different intermediate and deep water masses described in the literature. During the scenario, warming and saltening are simulated for the surface (+3.1°C and + 0.48 psu for the Mediterranean Sea at the end of the twenty-first century) and for the deeper layers (+1.5°C and + 0.23 psu on average). These simulated trends are in agreement with observed trends for the Mediterranean Sea over the last decades. In addition, the Mediterranean thermohaline circulation (MTHC) is strongly weakened at the end of the twenty-first century. This behaviour is mainly due to the decrease in surface density and so the decrease in winter deep-water formation. At the end of the twenty-first century, the MTHC weakening can be evaluated as -40% for the intermediate waters and -80% for the deep circulation with respect to present-climate conditions. The characteristics of the Mediterranean Outflow Waters flowing into the Atlantic Ocean are also strongly influenced during the scenario. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",,"air-sea interaction; climate change; computer simulation; oceanic general circulation model; thermohaline circulation; Atlantic Ocean; Mediterranean Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749660579

Since the majority of NH3 emissions come from agriculture, measures may need to be implemented by the farming industry. Member states of the EU will, by 2010, require large pig and poultry production units to reduce NH3 emissions to comply with the integrated pollution prevention and control directive (IPPC). The NARSES model uses a mass-flow method to estimate NH3 emission from UK agriculture and to identify the most cost-effective means of reducing NH3 emissions. Model runs were carried out to assess the likely impact of the IPPC Directive on UK NH3 emissions and the sensitivity of model output to input data on the costs and abatement efficiencies of proposed abatement measures. The impact of the IPPC Directive is likely to be small, offering a reduction of c. 8700 t, 3.5% of total UK agricultural NH3 emissions. Even large (30%) changes in our estimates of cost or changes of 10% in our estimates of abatement efficiency will make little difference to the ranking of abatement techniques according to cost-effectiveness. The most cost-effective reductions may be achieved by replacing urea fertilizer with ammonium nitrate, immediate incorporation of manures and slurries to tillage land by discs, storing all FYM and poultry manures before spreading to land and applying slurries to grassland by trailing shoe. © 2006.","Abatement; Cost-curves; IPPC; Sensitivity analysis","Ammonia; Cost effectiveness; Sensitivity analysis; Abatement; Cost curves; NARSES model; Agriculture; ammonia; ammonium nitrate; fertilizer; urea; agriculture; air quality; ammonia; assessment method; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; international agreement; model; pollutant source; pollution policy; sensitivity analysis; agriculture; air pollution control; air quality control; article; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; farming system; grassland; manure; pig farming; poultry farming; priority journal; tillage; United Kingdom; Agriculture; Ammonia; Cost Effectiveness; Sensitivity; Eurasia; Europe; European Union; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Sus scrofa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749446693

The study was set up as a substance flow analysis to analyse trends in uses and emissions of lead in Europe between 2000 and 2030. The study showed among others that the flow to (final) landfill of lead is declining from about 290 ktpa in 2000 to 220 ktpa in 2003 for the EU15. Alloys, or more specifically lead in electronic equipment, contribute to about 5% of these flows. The study also compared current actual exposures in the environment, of workers, and the general public (adults and young children) to authoritative limit values set in the EU. From this, it appeared that under unfavorable conditions (high dust/soil intake via hand-mouth behavior) young children may exceed their tolerable daily intake (TDI). The study hence concluded that for children, there is a need for further information and/or testing. It has to be stressed, however, that this purely risk based approach leaves several questions about sustainable lead management unanswered. It gives a 'picture' at a given moment in time. Successes in lowering exposure were mainly reached by reducing direct emissions from various sources (e.g. emissions to air via leaded gasoline). However, it is also clear that the use and hence the economical stock of lead is growing, as is the stock in landfills and certain residues from Municipal Solid Waste Incinerators (MSWIs), which might be re-used. This led to a discussion driven by the fear for slow 'enrichment' of the economical and ecological system with lead, and hence a possible higher exposure in future. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

To evaluate the implications for human inhalation exposure resulting from a shift toward DG, we combined Gaussian plume modeling and a GIS-based inhalation exposure assessment of existing and hypothetical power-generation facilities in California. Twenty-five existing central stations (CSs) were analyzed and compared with hypothetical DG technologies deployed in the downtown areas of the 11 most populous cities in California. The intake fraction (iF) for primary pollutants was computed for populations living within 100 km of each source, using meteorological conditions typical of the long-term observational record and population, lifetime-average breathing rates. The iF (a dimensionless term representing the proportion of pollutant mass emitted by a source that is eventually inhaled) concisely expresses the source-to-intake relationship, is independent of the emissions characteristics of the plants assessed, and normalizes for the large scale differences between the two paradigms of electricity generation. The median iF for nonreactive primary pollutants emitted from the 25 CSs is 0.8 per million compared to 16 per million for the 11 DG units. The difference is partly attributable to the closer proximity of DG sources to densely populated areas as compared to typical CS facilities. In addition, the short stacks of DG sources emphasize near-source population exposure more than traditional CSs, and increase exposures during periods of low wind speed, low mixing height and stable atmospheric conditions. Strategies that could reduce the potential increase in air pollutant intake from DG include maximally utilizing waste heat in combined heat and power operations, increasing the release height of DG effluents and deploying DG technologies that do not emit air pollutants. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

[2005. The atmospheres of Saturn and Titan in the near-infrared: First results of Cassini/VIMS. Earth, Moon, and Planets, 96, 119-147]. in Cassini/VIMS spectral imagery. We identify these emission features as the P and R branches of the 1-0 vibrational band of carbon monoxide (CO) near 4.65 μm. For CH3D, the prominent Q branch of the ν2 fundamental band of CH3D near 4.55 μm is apparent. CO2 emissions from the strong v3 vibrational band are virtually absent, indicating a CO2 abundance several orders of magnitude less than CO, in agreement with previous investigations. Analysis of CO emission spectra obtained over a variety of altitudes on Titan's nightside limb indicates that the stratospheric abundance of CO is 32±15 ppm, and together with other recent determinations, suggests a vertical distribution of CO nearly constant at this value from the surface throughout the troposphere to at least the stratopause near 300 km altitude. The corresponding total atmospheric content of CO in Titan is ∼2.9±1.5×1014 kg. Given the long lifetime of CO in the oxygen-poor Titan atmosphere (∼0.5-1.0 Gyr), we find a mean CO atmospheric production rate of 6±3×105 kg yr-1. Given the lack of primordial heavy noble gases observed by Huygens [Niemann et al., 2005. The abundances of constituents of Titan's atmosphere from the GCMS on the Huygens probe. Nature, 438, 779-784], the primary source of atmospheric CO is likely surface emissions. The implied CO/CH4 mixing ratio of near-surface material is 1.8±0.9×10-4, based on an average methane surface emission rate over the past 0.5 Gyr of 1.3×10-13 gm cm-2 s-1 as required to balance hydrocarbon haze production via methane photolysis [Wilson and Atreya, 2004. Current state of modeling the photochemistry of Titan's mutually dependent atmosphere and ionosphere. J. Geophys. Res. 109, E06002 Doi:10.1029/2003JE002181]. This low CO/CH4 ratio is much lower than expected for the sub-nebular formation region of Titan and supports the hypothesis [e.g., Atreya et al., 2005. Methane on Titan: photochemical-meteorological-hydrogeochemical cycle. Bull. Am. Astron. Soc. 37, 735] that the conversion of primordial CO and other carbon-bearing materials into CH4-enriched clathrate-hydrates occurs within the deep interior of Titan via the release of hydrogen through the serpentinization process followed by Fischer-Tropsch catalysis. The time-averaged predicted emission rate of methane-rich surface materials is ∼0.02 km3 yr-1, a value significantly lower than the rate of silicate lava production for the Earth and Venus, but nonetheless indicative of significant active geological processes reshaping the surface of Titan. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A split plot design with four replications was laid-out on a loamy-sand Ferric Lixisol with till and no-till as main treatments and fertiliser types as sub-treatments. Soil was fractionated physically into coarse (0.250-2 mm), medium (0.053-0.250 mm) and fine fractions (&lt; 0.053 mm). Particulate organic carbon (POC) accounted for 47-53% of total soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration and particulate organic nitrogen (PON) for 30-37% of total soil nitrogen concentration. The POC decreased from 53% of total SOC in 2000 to 47% of total SOC in 2001. Tillage increased the contribution of POC to SOC. No-till led to the lowest loss in SOC in the fine fraction compared to tilled plots. Well-decomposed compost and single urea application in tilled as well as in no-till plots induced loss in POC. Crop N uptake was enhanced in tilled plots and may be up to 226 kg N ha-1 against a maximum of 146 kg N ha-1 in no-till plots. Combining crop residues and urea enhanced incorporation of new organic matter in the coarse fraction and the reduction of soil carbon mineralisation from the fine fraction.

It was then applied to estimate the heating loads of two typical office buildings in a windy city located at 57.2North, with and without a shelterbelt. Firstly, the statistical analysis of weather data was carried out to identify the prevailing wind direction during a typical winter heating season in the location. It was to ensure the windbreak planted rightly to maximise its sheltering benefits for the buildings in its leeward. This analysis, which revealed the main weather features in the location, would help to better comprehend the results of the thermal modelling and gain insight of how the load responses to the climate. In the second part, CFD modelling predicted wind reduction due to the shelterbelt under various wind directions. The predicted data were then used to prepare two sets of weather data, the original weather file and the revised one, in which the wind data had taken into account the reduction effect of the windbreak. The third part was a dynamic thermal modelling study where two types of office buildings were selected as the representative offices in Edinburgh for the assessment of sheltering effect on energy saving and CO2 reduction. The predicted savings over a heating season due to the shelterbelt were in a range of 16-42% and the actual values in space heating were about 2.2 kWh m-2 for new office buildings and 14.5 kWh m-2 for offices converted from conventional houses without insulation improvement. These significant savings were due to the local weather that is typically known as long windy winter with many cloudy days. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, our interest will be focused on the micro-cogeneration, MCHP (electric power ≤15 kW), which represents a valid and interesting application of this technology which refers, above all, to residential and light commercial users [M. Dentice d'Accadia, M. Sasso, S. Sibilio, Cogeneration for energy saving in household applications, in: P. Bertoldi, A.

In particular, our work group started a R&amp;D programme on micro-cogeneration in 1995: a laboratory, equipped with the most common appliances (washing-machine, dishwasher, storage water heater, ...), has been built and some MCHP prototypes have been tested too. In this article, the results of an intense experimental activity on three different micro-cogenerators, one of them made in Japan and in a pre-selling phase, are reported. In a previous paper a detailed analysis of the test facility, with the description of the equipments and the data acquisition systems, can be found [M. Dentice d'Accadia, M. Sasso, S. Sibilio, R.

A typical 3-E (Energetic, Economic and Environmental) approach has been performed to compare the proposed energy system, MCHP, to the conventional one based on separate ""production"". In the energetic analysis the amount of primary energy savings provided by micro-cogeneration unit has been evaluated for different types of MCHP units and at various working conditions. Furthermore the evaluation of the equivalent CO2 emissions of the compared systems, MCHP and conventional systems, allows to calculate the MCHP potentials to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Finally the Simple Pay Back approach has been considered to define the economic feasibility of cogeneration in small size applications with the varying of some economic variables (first cost, gas price, operating hours per year ...). © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Several studies of the Linköping utility are reviewed. These indicate that the marginal heat cost is lower in summer; a new waste or wood fired cogeneration plant is more profitable than a natural-gas-fired combined cycle; material recycling of paper and hard plastics is preferable to waste incineration from an energy-efficiency viewpoint; and considering external costs enhances wood fuel use.

As a result, a wide variety of policy instruments is currently implemented and hence the question arises: how can these instruments be designed in a way to reach the maximum policy target with the minimum public money spent? The objective of this paper is to derive a methodology for obtaining efficient policy portfolios promoting sustainable energy systems depending on the policy target and show corresponding results from case studies in Austria, Germany and Poland. The investigations were carried out by application of Invert simulation tool, a computer model developed for simulating the impacts of various promotion schemes for renewable and efficient energy systems. With this tool, the CO2 reductions and related public expenses have been calculated for various policy mixes. In the building-related energy sector, it turned out that in all investigated regions support schemes for supply side measures are the most cost-efficient instruments. However, their potential is restricted and for achieving higher levels of CO2 reduction, promotion of demand side measures is indispensable. The paper shows that for a comprehensive comparison of policy portfolios, there are always two dimensions to be considered: efficiency and effectiveness. The more effective, i.e. the higher the implementation rate of a scheme, the more essential becomes the efficiency criteria. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper considers fibre optics technology as a means of supplementing the daylight received at the rear of rooms and the subsequent integration of the total daylight received with a controlled artificial lighting system. Such an approach would contribute not only to energy savings but also to a reduction in environmental pollution. The evaluation took place using the climatic data from seven cities in Brazil and one in the UK. Results showed that by effectively integrating daylight from windows in buildings with the artificial lighting system, energy savings ranging from 17.7% to 92.0% could be achieved in the seven cities in Brazil and savings ranging from 10.8% to 44.0% could be achieved in the UK.

It is necessary to take the microbial respiration into account when considering an extensive growth of microorganisms on fresh-cut vegetables during shelf life. Therefore the respiration of Pseudomonas fluorescens (due to its frequent occurrence on vegetables) was determined under solid-state conditions. A lettuce-juice agar was chosen to provide similar conditions for the microorganisms. Incubated agar plates were stored in air-tight glass jars at 7 °C for 8 days. The change in gas composition was measured and the data were examined by fitting them to Michaelis-Menten equations. All glass jars were filled with air initially; some of them additionally contained sodium hydroxide to bind the carbon dioxide. In other jars, 26.3% carbon dioxide was added after 4 days of storage whereas the rest of the glass jars were used without any modification. The data were successfully fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation for substrate limitation (neglecting the influence of CO2) for the three different experiments. The fit with the Michaelis-Menten equation for competitive inhibition was only successful for the respiration experiments with carbon dioxide added. The order of magnitude of the maximum respiration rate (rmax = 0.289-0.305 mL/(incubated plate (1.7 × 107 cfu) · h)) shows by comparing it with reported respiration rates for fresh-cut vegetables, that the influence of microbial respiration should not be neglected, particularly at the end of the shelf life, where the amount of microorganisms may increase to 107 cfu/g. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

During the experimental tests, engine efficiency, in terms of fuel consumption, and pollutant emissions, in terms of nitric oxides, opacity, carbon monoxide and total hydrocarbons, have been measured. The tested multiple injection strategy consisted of the simultaneous use of early and pilot injections. This strategy has been compared with the more traditional techniques based on the use of either pilot or early injections. During the tests, the effects of several injection parameters were analysed, like duration and timing of early, pilot and main injections. Results show that, mainly for medium values of engine torque and speed, the injection of a small fuel quantity during the early stage of the compression stroke, coupled with the pilot injection, may be effective in reducing specific fuel consumption if compared to the only pilot or only early injection strategies. Furthermore, this result is obtained whit a simultaneous reduction in nitric oxides and particulate. However, unburned hydrocarbons levels remain constant or usually increase. Early injection is in effect a way to obtain a very lean premixed charge, both globally and locally, inside the combustion chamber. Therefore, it has been shown that nitric oxides and soot, deriving respectively from an inhomogeneous distribution of temperatures and a locally rich mixture, both decrease performing the early and pilot before the main injection. Concerning the natural gas addition, it has been premixed with the engine intake air before the turbocharger and used in small percentages, in order to improve the engine combustion and to reduce pollutant emissions, in particular the soot produced during the mixing-controlled combustion phase. Experiments underlined that, using the natural gas as an additive fuel, while performing the Diesel fuel main injection, leads to keep practically unchanged engine efficiency with respect to the traditional Diesel fuel operation mode.

The models are driven by three emission scenarios: (1) current air quality legislation (CLE); (2) an optimistic case of the maximum emissions reductions currently technologically feasible (MFR); and (3) the contrasting pessimistic IPCC SRES A2 scenario. An extensive evaluation of the present-day deposition using nearly all information on wet deposition available worldwide shows a good agreement with observations in Europe and North America, where 60-70% of the model-calculated wet deposition rates agree to within ±50% with quality-controlled measurements. Models systematically overestimate NHx deposition in South Asia, and underestimate NOy deposition in East Asia. We show that there are substantial differences among models for the removal mechanisms of NOy, NHx, and SOx, leading to ±1 σ variance in total deposition fluxes of about 30% in the anthropogenic emissions regions, and up to a factor of 2 outside. In all cases the mean model constructed from the ensemble calculations is among the best when comparing to measurements. Currently, 36-51% of all NOy, NHx, and SOx is deposited over the ocean, and 50-80% of the fraction of deposition on land falls on natural (nonagricultural) vegetation. Currently, 11% of the world's natural vegetation receives nitrogen deposition in excess of the ""critical load"" threshold of 1000 mg(N) m-2 yr-1. The regions most affected are the United States (20% of vegetation), western Europe (30%), eastern Europe (80%), South Asia (60%), East Asia (40%), southeast Asia (30%), and Japan (50%). Future deposition fluxes are mainly driven by changes in emissions, and less importantly by changes in atmospheric chemistry and climate. The global fraction of vegetation exposed to nitrogen loads in excess of 1000 mg(N) m-2 yr-1 increases globally to 17% for CLE and 25% for A2. In MFR, the reductions in NOy are offset by further increases for NHx deposition. The regions most affected by exceedingly high nitrogen loads for CLE and A2 are Europe and Asia, but also parts of Africa.

Analysis is made of the five key issues relating to these current and potential climate action associations: the extent of the total and individual state mitigation cost-savings across all sectors from potential emission permit trading coalitions; the size of permit markets associated with the various coalitions; the relative advantages of joining various coalitions for swing states such as Pennsylvania; the implications of the exercise of market power in the permit market; and the total and individual state/country cost-savings from extending the coalition beyond US borders.

Here we adopt a modeling approach using CMAQ with a direct sensitivity technique, DDM-3D, to quantify how emissions reductions from different sources impacted ozone and particulate matter. Simulated air quality fields were able to reproduce both the regular surface observations and airborne measurements before and during the blackout. Sensitivity results show that blackout-linked power plant SO2 emissions reductions led to a sulfate concentration reduction of 22% at Selinsgrove, Pennsylvania, while power plant NOx emissions reductions had very limited (∼4%) impacts on O3. These results are lower than the estimates presented in previous studies. Results also suggest that over much of the region, on-road mobile NOx emissions reductions linked to the blackout had a larger impact on O3.

Biosphere-atmosphere transfer models are sensitive to input vegetation parameters, and the degree to which parameter estimates rely on the definition of the land cover type varies with models. In this study we use the simple biosphere model (SiB2) to evaluate uncertainties associated with misclassification of the land cover type and how they propagate to surface climate variables. We estimate that in regions with heterogeneous landscapes, the aggregation of land cover types from 1 × 1 km to 100 × 100 km horizontal resolution overestimates the area of the dominant type by up to 70%. The largest uncertainties associated with land cover misclassification are found in leaf area index and roughness length both of which have significant impact on the fluxes of carbon, water and energy at the earth surface. Other important uncertainties occur when the misclassification confuses plants with different carbon pathways. An assessment of the uncertainties is obtained comparing outcomes resulting from a choice of a dominant type in a 100 × 100 km area to those obtained using a mosaic of land cover composition weighted by its fractional cover. The difference shows the choice of the dominant type to be cooler by 0.6°C than the average of the mosaic at local noon, while at night it is warmer by 1.7°C. Our results indicate that the diurnal temperature range (dtr) varies from 13°C for the dominant type to 15°C for the weighted average. The difference in the dtr is due to higher minimum temperature simulated with the dominant type. The choice of a dominant type also results in a daily carbon assimilation loss of 28,000 gC compared to the average.

Model results have been compared with the observed monthly soil temperature and snow water equivalent from several weather stations in east Siberia and west Russia. Our study shows that the seasonal cycle of soil temperature is reasonably well reproduced by both versions of the model. HIRHAM4-ECHAM4-LSM produces cold soil temperature bias during winter, and the use of HIRHAM4-NCAR-LSM reduces such bias because of its more advanced land surface schemes. Insulation by snow on the ground surface is one of the main controlling factors of soil temperature, and the increased association between snow and soil temperature in HIRHAM4-NCAR-LSM has led to the improvement in winter soil temperature. We further established that the influences of land surface schemes and their coupling on the atmospheric conditions not only affect climate simulations on land but also in remote Arctic Ocean regions. Similarly as for the present day climate, two different land surface schemes can have significant influences on the simulated future climate. These influences imply an additional uncertainty in future climate projections.

The photophysical properties depend on the conjugation length of the thiophene-based ligand, and in each case, dual emission is observed. The two emitting states reside in thermal equilibrium at ambient temperature and can be resolved by emission spectral curve-fitting routines. This allows the properties of the two states to be evaluated in both fluid butyronitrile solution and a transparent KBr disk. It is concluded that both emitting states are of metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) character, and despite the presence of conjugated thiophene residues, there is no indication for a low-lying π,π*-triplet state that promotes nonradiative decay of the excited-state manifold. A key feature of these systems is that the conjugation length imposed by the thiophene-based ligand helps to control the rate constants for both radiative and nonradiative decay from the two MLCT triplet states. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846035867

All methods show statistically significant negative ozone trends from 1970 to 1995 in the upper stratosphere (above 32.6 km) throughout the course of the year as well as in the lower stratosphere (below 23.5 km) mainly during winter to spring, which can be partially attributed to dynamical changes. Over the recent period (1996-2004) the year-round trends in the lower stratosphere become positive and are more positive during the winter to spring period. The results also show changes in upper stratospheric ozone trends after 1996, which are, however, not statistically significant at 95% if aerosol correction is applied on the retrieved data. This lack of significant trend changes during the recent period in the upper stratosphere is regionally coherent with recent results derived from upper stratospheric ozone data recorded by lidars, microwave radiometers, and satellite instruments at an adjacent location. Although the positive change in trends after 1996 both for upper and lower stratospheric ozone is in line with the reduction of the emissions of ozone-depleting substances from the successful implementation of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments, we recommend, because of lack of significance for the upper stratospheric trends, repeating this analysis in a few years in order to overcome ambiguous results for documentation of the turnaround of upper stratospheric ozone.

Main sources of CH4 and N2O emissions are agriculture-related activities such as enteric fermentation, paddy rice cultivation, soil management. A recursive dynamic CGE (Computer General Equilibrium) model has been developed to analyze greenhouse gas reduction options including non-CO2 gas abatement technologies. Multi-regional, multi-sectoral and multi-gas CGE model and simple climate change model simulated long-term climate stabilization emission path. Preliminary results showed that multi gas mitigation options including CH4 and N2O abatement technologies will reduce GDP loss more than CO2 only mitigation options for long-term climate stabilization, even though CO2 mitigation options will reduce not only CO2 emissions but non-CO2 gas emissions simultaneously. It is necessary to collect regional non-CO2 gas data (emission, technology options, and so on) and conduct more sensitivity analysis with computer simulation model to reduce uncertainty of non-CO2 gas.

We suggest in this paper that technologies and technology policies exist which could reduce carbon emissions enough to achieve stabilization targets at relatively modest costs given the size of the world economy. This can be accomplished largely through harnessing market forces and creating incentives with the use of efficient prices on greenhouse gas emissions, combined with complementary programs and policies to reduce marketfailures and to promote new technology improvements and investments.

This paper investigates the long-term economic consequences of both climate change impacts and mitigation efforts by applying the multi-regional, multi-sectoral integrated assessment model WIAGEM based on GTAP-EL coupled with the reduced-form multi-gas climate model ICM. We investigate emissions reduction paths to reach a radiative forcing target of 4.5 W/m2. Economic impacts are studied and compared with and without the inclusion of all GHG gases. We find that multi-gas emissions reduction causes less economic losses compared with a case where only CO2 emissions reductions would be considered. Copyright © 2006 by the IAEE.

The future state of Indian economy in the next 30-years has been broadly visualized under four scenarios proposed as combinations of market integration (extent of liberalization, globalization and integration with the world markets) and nature of governance (centralization vs. decentralization). The methodology chosen for the development of these scenarios draws mainly from the IPCC SRES methodology. The paper presents CH4 and N2O emissions for each of the scenarios for all the major emitting sectors. The major sources of Methane emissions are livestock and paddy contributing to about 65% of the total emissions in 2000. The share of emissions from Municipal Solid Waste is also expected to rise with increasing urbanization. Nitrous Oxide emissions arise chiefly from synthetic fertilizer use (contributing 67% of total emissions) and from field burning of agricultural residue.

These carbon price scenarios cover a range typically seen in global integrated assessment models. The world forest sector was disaggregated into ten regions, four largely temperate, developed regions: the European Union, Oceania, Russia, and the United States; and six developing, mostly tropical, regions: Africa, Central America, China, India, Rest of Asia, and South America. Three mitigation options-long- and short-rotation forestry, and the reduction of deforestation - were analyzed using a global dynamic partial equilibrium model (GCOMAP). Key findings ofthis work are that cumulative carbon gain ranges from 50.9 to 113.2 Gt C by 2100, higher carbon prices early lead to earlier carbon gain and vice versa, and avoided deforestation accounts for 51 to 78% of modeled carbon gains by 2100. The estimated present value of cumulative welfare change in the sector ranges from a decline of $158 billion to a gain of $81 billion by 2100. The decline is associated with a decrease in deforestation. Copyright © 2006 by the IAEE. All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47249111482

Mitigation costs of non-CO2 greenhouse gases are integrated into a multi-region multi-country CGE model of the world economy. Calibrations are based on GHG emissions projections from, and marginal abatement cost curves provided by, the EMF21 working group for the six greenhouse gases. We find that the introduction of non- CO2 GHGs in the mitigation strategy reduces significantly the wetrare cost of a long term emissions stabilization policy but that benefits vary across regions. We also find that the various possible rules of emission quotas allocation may have large effects on the burden sharing among regions. Copyright © 2006 by the IAEE.

In recent years, however, increasing attention has been dedicated to the benefits of reducing emissions of non-CO2 GHGs such as methane and nitrous oxide. Increased attention to the potential role of these gases in a GHG reduction policy increased the need for better data on the costs of non-CO2 GHG abatement for countries and regions outside of the US and the European Union (EU). Using a net present value calculation, this analysis develops regionally adjusted costs per mitigation option and marginal abatement cost curves by region for use in economic models. The result is worldwide cost estimates for methane and nitrous oxide from waste, energy and the industrial sectors. This paper also demonstrates the ability to significantly reduce greenhouse gases from these sectors with current technologies and the low cost of methane and nitrous oxide relative to CO2 reductions.

Based on a dynamic model and the control demand, a cascade control strategy is designed. The master controller imposes a change of cell current representing a change in power demand and sets the amount of fuel gas, the steam-to-carbon ratio, the air number and the cathode gas recycle ratio to their corresponding conditions for optimal steady state electric efficiency. Two feedback PID controllers are in the inner loop, one guarantees the solid temperature not to exceed a maximum temperature by changing the air number around the default set by the master controller; the other controls the maximum temperature difference by adjusting the steam-to-carbon ratio. Step response tests show that this control strategy works well when the cell current changes. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Non-CO2 greenhouse-gas forcing is dominated by methane and tropospheric ozone. Assumptions about the prevalence of methane recovery and local air pollution controls in the no-policy cases are a critical determinant of methane and ozone-precursor emissions. When these factors are considered, emissions are substantially reduced relative to earlier estimates. This reduces their potential as climate mitigation agents through specific climate policies. Nevertheless, the addition of non-CO2 greenhouse gas and ozone precursor abatement options significantly reduces mitigation costs in the first half of the 21st century (by up to 40%) compared to the case where only CO2 abatement options are pursued. While the influences of aerosols are small by the end of the century, there is a significant interaction in the early 21st century between policies to reduce CO2 emissions and SO2 emissions, even in the presence of SO2-related pollution control policies. The attendant reduced aerosol cooling can more than offset the reduction in warming that accruesfrom reduced CO2. When non-CO2 gases are included in the policy, the net effect is that global-mean climate change to 2050 is practically unaffected by mitigation policy. Copyright © 2006 by the IAEE.

This method is called hybrid reverse Monte Carlo (HRMC), since it combines the features of the Monte Carlo and reverse Monte Carlo methods. The use of the energy constraint term helps alleviate the problem of the presence of unrealistic features (such as three- and four-membered carbon rings), reported in previous RMC studies of carbons, and also correctly describes the local environment of carbon atoms. The HRMC protocol is used to develop molecular models of saccharose-based porous carbons in which hydrogen atoms are taken into account explicitly in addition to the carbon atoms.

Background: Controversies about the effectiveness of molecular therapies for cardiovascular disease have prompted the need for more powerful noninvasive imaging techniques. Methods: In a model of regional adenoviral transfer of the VEGF121 gene to myocardium of healthy pigs, PET-CT using multiple molecular-directed radiotracers was employed. Results: Two days after gene transfer, successful transgene expression was noninvasively confirmed by a reporter probe targeting co-expressed HSV1-sr39tk reporter gene. The CT-derived ventricular function and morphology remained unaltered (left ventricular ejection fraction 57 ± 5% in adenovirus-injected animals vs. 53 ± 5% in controls; p = 0.36). Increased regional perfusion was identified in areas overexpressing VEGF (myocardial blood flow during adenosine-induced vasodilation 1.47 ± 0.49 vs. 1.14 ± 0.27 ml/g/min in remote areas; p = 0.01), corroborating in vivo effects on microvascular tone and permeability. Finally, regional angiogenesis-associated αvβ3 integrin expression was not enhanced, suggesting little contribution to the perfusion increase. Fusion of CT morphology and tracer-derived molecular signals allowed for accurate regional localization of biologic signals. Findings were validated by control vectors, sham-operated animals, and ex vivo tissue analysis. Conclusions: Integrated PET-CT has the potential to dissect cardiovascular biologic mechanisms from gene expression to physiologic function and morphology. The VEGF overexpression in healthy myocardium increases myocardial perfusion without significant up-regulation of αvβ3 integrin adhesion molecules early after the intervention. © 2006 American College of Cardiology Foundation.",,"beta3 integrin; CD51 antigen; cell adhesion molecule; thymidine kinase; vasculotropin 121; angiogenesis; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; ex vivo study; gene expression; gene transfer; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart muscle blood flow; heart muscle perfusion; heart ventricle function; in vivo study; morphology; nonhuman; positron emission tomography; priority journal; reporter gene; upregulation; vasodilatation; Animals; Coronary Circulation; Feasibility Studies; Gene Expression; Gene Transfer Techniques; Genes, Reporter; Heart; Herpesvirus 1, Human; Integrin alphaVbeta3; Mutation; Myocardial Contraction; Myocardium; Positron-Emission Tomography; Swine; Thymidine Kinase; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Transgenes; Up-Regulation; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750940935

A patchy, east-west band of increasing NPP is identified, with several hotspots showing large increases. The total rate of NPP change for the Sahel is estimated to be 51.0 Mt C year-1 over the 18-year period, yielding an absolute net gain of 918.0 Mt C. This increase is associated with a decrease in the inter-annual variability of NPP for the 1990s compared to the 1980s.

The effects of total mass flux, Thiele modulus, porous medium geometry on front behavior parameters such as width, velocity and residual porosity are presented as semi-analytical correlations.

Iron sulfides have the ability to chemically reduce many common CAH compounds including PCE, TCE, DCE, similar to zero valent iron (Fe0). Results of a field test at Dover Air Force Base, Dover, Delaware, are given in this paper. BiRD was stimulated by direct injection of Epson salt (MgSO4·7H2O) and sodium (L) lactate (NaC3H5O3) in five injection wells. Sediment was sampled before and 8 months after injection. Significant iron sulfide minerals developed in the sandy aquifer matrix. From ground water analyses, treatment began a few weeks after injection with up to 95% reduction in PCE, TCE, and cDCE in less than 1 year.

Box 80023, Wilmington, DE 19805, United States","The long-term (1950-2050) global fate of perfluorooctanoate (PFO) is investigated using the global distribution model, GloboPOP. The model is used to test the hypotheses that direct PFO emissions can account for levels observed in the global oceans and that ocean water transport to the Arctic is an important global distribution pathway. The model emission scenarios are derived from historical and projected PFO emissions solely from direct sources. Modeled ocean water concentrations compare favorably to observed PFO concentrations in the world's oceans and thus ocean inventories can be accounted for by direct sources. The model results support the hypothesis that long-range ocean transport of PFO to the Arctic is important and estimate a net PFO influx of approximately 8-23 tons per year flowing into the model's Northern Polar zone in 2005, an amount at least 1 order of magnitude greater than estimated PFO flux to the Arctic from potential indirect sources such as atmospheric transport and degradation of fluorotelomer alcohols. Modeled doubling times of ocean water concentrations in the Arctic between 1975 and 2005 of approximately 7.5-10 years are in good agreement with doubling times of PFO in Arctic biota estimated from monitoring data. The model is further applied to predict future trends in PFO contamination levels using forecasted (2005-2050) direct emissions, including substantial reductions committed to by industry. Modeled ocean water concentrations in zones near to sources decline markedly after 2005, whereas modeled concentrations in the Arctic are predicted to continue to increase until approximately 2030 and show no significant decrease for the remaining 20 years of the model simulation. Since water is the primary exposure medium for Arctic biota, these model results suggest that concentrations in Arctic biota may continue to rise long after direct emissions have been substantially reduced or eliminated. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Concentration (process); Esters; Mass transfer; Mathematical models; Particulate emissions; Water; Global distribution model; Ocean water; Perfluorooctanoate (PFO); Marine pollution; alcohol derivative; fluorotelomer alcohol; perfluorooctane; sea water; unclassified drug; Concentration (process); Esters; Marine pollution; Mass transfer; Mathematical models; Particulate emissions; Water; long range transport; modeling; ocean; seawater; simulation; transport process; water pollution; acidity; analytic method; Arctic; article; computer program; degradation; environmental monitoring; model; ocean environment; prediction; sea; simulation; water pollutant; water pollution; Arctic Regions; Environmental Monitoring; Fluorocarbons; Forecasting; Models, Theoretical; Oceans and Seas; Octanoic Acids; Water Movements; Water Pollutants; Arctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751120169

A small number have been found with dual NADPH/NADH specificity, usually preferring NADPH, but none are exclusive for NADH. Crystal structures of the dual-specificity enzyme xylose reductase (AKR2B5) indicate that NAD+ is bound via a key interaction with a glutamate that is able to change conformations to accommodate the 2′-phosphate of NADP +. Sequence comparisons suggest that analogous glutamate or aspartate residues may function in other AKRs to allow NADH utilization. Based on this, nine putative enzymes with potential NADH specificity were identified and seven genes were successfully expressed and purified from Drosophila melanogaster, Escherichia coli, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Sulfolobus solfataricus, Sinorhizobium meliloti and Thermotoga maritima. Each was assayed for co-substrate dependence with conventional AKR substrates. Three were exclusive for NADPH (AKR2E3, AKR3F2 and AKR3F3), two were dual-specific (AKR3C2 and AKR3F1) and one was specific for NADH (AKR11B2), the first such activity in an AKR. Fluorescence measurements of the seventh protein indicated that it bound both NADPH and NADH but had no activity. Mutation of the aspartate into an alanine residue or a more mobile glutamate in the NADH-specific E. coli protein converted it into an enzyme with dual specificity. These results show that the presence of this carboxylate is an indication of NADH dependence. This should allow improved prediction of co-substrate specificity and provide a basis for engineering enzymes with altered co-substrate utilization for this class of enzymes. © 2006 Biochemical Society.","Aldo-keto reductase; Candida tenuis; Co-substrate recognition; NADH; Sequence homology; Xylose reductase","Alcohols; Conformations; Crystal structure; Escherichia coli; Fluorescence; Genes; Aldo-keto reductase; Co-substrate recognition; Sequence homology; Xylose reductase; Enzymes; aldo keto reductase; aspartic acid; carboxylic acid; glutamic acid; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; oxidoreductase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; unclassified drug; article; crystal structure; enzyme activity; enzyme kinetics; fluorescence; mutational analysis; nonhuman; priority journal; purification; site directed mutagenesis; steady state; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Catalysis; Drosophila melanogaster; Escherichia coli; Kinetics; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; NAD; NADP; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Schizosaccharomyces; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Sinorhizobium meliloti; Substrate Specificity; Sulfolobus solfataricus; Thermotoga maritima; Candida tenuis; Drosophila melanogaster; Escherichia coli; Schizosaccharomyces pombe; Sinorhizobium meliloti; Sulfolobus solfataricus; Thermotoga maritima",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751111433

The present study was focused on understanding the primary mechanism responsible for the suppressant effect of SO2 on total PCDD/F formation and toxic equivalent (TEQ) emissions. The addition of SO 2, simulating the effect of coal addition on the flue gas composition, resulted in significant reductions in the TEQ emissions due to reactions involving SO2 in the postcombustion zone. However, emissions of total PCDDs/Fs, unlike the TEQ value, were dependent upon the Cl2 and SO2 injection temperatures due to increases in non-TEQ correlated isomers. The conversion of metal chlorides in the fly ash to sulfates, thus reducing the sites responsible for chlorination/oxidation reactions, was concluded to be the main suppressant mechanism; proposed reactions for copper and iron are presented. This mechanism was found to be independent of combustion conditions and could have prolonged effects on PCDD/F emissions from deposits formed with high flue gas S/Cl ratios. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Combustion; Composition; Concentration (process); Fly ash; Isomers; Sulfur dioxide; Combustion conditions; Metal chlorides; Toxic equivalent (TEQ); Particulate emissions; chloride; coal; copper; dibenzofuran derivative; iron; metal derivative; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; Combustion; Composition; Concentration (process); Fly ash; Isomers; Particulate emissions; Sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; coal; domestic waste; emission control; incineration; solid waste; sulfur dioxide; waste management; article; chemical composition; chemical reaction; chlorination; combustion; concentration (parameters); ecotoxicity; flue gas; fly ash; gas; incineration; isomer; municipal solid waste; oxidation; solid; solid waste management; temperature dependence; toxic equivalent; Air Pollution; Benzofurans; Coal; Gases; Incineration; Refuse Disposal; Sulfur Dioxide; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751077501

KIEs were measured on the arsenolysis of 5′-methylthioadenosine (MTA) catalyzed by MTAP and were corrected for the forward commitment to catalysis. Intrinsic KIEs were obtained for [1′-3H], [1′-14C], [2′- 3H], [4′-3H], [5′-3H2], [9-15N], and [Me-3H3] MTAs. The primary intrinsic KIEs (1′-14C and 9-15N) suggest that MTAP has a dissociative SN1 transition state with its cationic center at the anomeric carbon and insignificant bond order to the leaving group. The 9-15N intrinsic KIE of 1.039 also establishes an anionic character for the adenine leaving group, whereas the α-primary 1′- 14C KIE of 1.031 indicates significant nucleophilic participation at the transition state. Computational matching of the calculated EIEs to the intrinsic isotope effects places the oxygen nucleophile 2.0 Å from the anomeric carbon. The 4′-3H KIE is sensitive to the polarization of the 3′-OH group. Calculations suggest that a 4′-3H KIE of 1.047 is consistent with ionization of the 3′-OH group, indicating formation of a zwitterion at the transition state. The transition state has cationic character at the anomeric carbon and is anionic at the 3′-OH oxygen, with an anionic leaving group. The isotope effects predicted a 3′-endo conformation for the ribosyl zwitterion, corresponding to a H1′-C1′-C2′-H2′ torsional angle of 33°. The [Me-3H3] and [5′-3H2] KIEs arise predominantly from the negative hyperconjugation of the lone pairs of sulfur with the σ* (C-H) antibonding orbitale.

Air pollution from the gasoline engine is reduced to levels far below current best available technology in the snowmobile industry. The four-stroke engine's closed-loop EFI system maintains stoichiometric combustion while dual three-way catalysts reduce NOx, HC and CO emissions by up to 94% from stock. In addition to the use of three way catalysts, the fuel injection strategy has been modified to further reduce engine emissions from the levels measured in the CSC 2004 competition.

This problem is mainly caused by traffic jam and arising from this are two particularly interesting environmental issues: pollution and noise [1]. Use of two wheeler vehicles does not represent the final solution to these problems, nevertheless they can supply a useful aid to ease them. Recently, two stroke engines are being replaced with four stroke engines. For small capacity engines this means a true reduction in exhaust emissions, especially unburned hydrocarbons (HC), but, on the other hand it involves a performance reduction, particularly for sudden accelerations, which constitute an essential requirement for these vehicles [2, 3, 4, 5]. Hybridisation can help to fill the gap between two stroke engines and cleaner, but less performing four stroke engines [6]. At the same time, it can help to lower fuel consumption, by means of a reduction in the revolution speed [2, 5]. This paper presents a study on a parallel hybrid scooter prototype from the point of view of a better matching between the characteristics of the internal four stroke combustion engine and of the electric motor. Wave fluiddynamic 1D code was used in order to create a model of the internal combustion engine. The model validation was carried out by the comparison between the simulation results and the experimental data obtained with the roller test bench. Then, some modifications were analysed in order to optimise the behaviour of the engine at a lower revolution speed of the engine, thus diminishing the specific fuel consumption of the vehicle. Finally, such modifications were introduced in a Simulink (Matlab) model to evaluate their influence on the behaviour of the whole hybrid vehicle when running on different road cycle tests.

This book highlights new approaches that Arizona has pioneered for managing its water needs. The state has burgeoning urban areas, large agricultural regions, water dependent habitats for endangered fish and wildlife, and a growing demand for water-based recreation. A multi-year drought and climate-related variability in water supply complicate the intense competition for water. Written by well-known Arizona water experts, the essays in this book address these issues from academic, professional, and policy perspectives that include economics, climatology, law, and engineering. Among the innovations explored in the book is Arizona?s Groundwater Management Act. Arizona is not alone in its challenges. As one of the seven states in the Colorado River Basin that depend heavily on the river, Arizona must cooperate, and sometimes compete, with other state, tribal, and federal governments. One institution that furthers regional cooperation is the water bank, which encourages groundwater recharge of surplus surface water during wet years so that the water remains available during dry years. The Groundwater Management Act imposes conservation requirements and establishes planning and investment programs in renewable water supplies. The essays in Arizona Water Policy are accessible to a broad policy-oriented and nonacademic readership. The book explores Arizona?s water management and extracts lessons that are important for arid and semi-arid areas worldwide. © 2007 by Resources for the Future.

The development of smart devices such as smart meters is giving the consumers up-to-the-minute information on the energy use. The meters will also send information directly to the electricity supplier via an Ethernet-like link that allow them to bill customers accurately rather than sending them estimated bills.

Deposits of this unit exposed on the eastern margin of the Grajaú Basin include gypsum, bituminous black shales and limestones. These lithologies were formed in a low energy, well stratified, anoxic and hypersaline lake system developed in a dominantly arid/semi-arid climate. This lacustrine succession is internally organized into three categories of shallowing-upward cycles, with the first- and second-order cycles being related to seismic activity associated with fault reactivations, and the third-order cycles recording climatic fluctuations. Studies emphasizing petrography and analysis of the geochemical tracers Fe, Mg, Sr, Mn, Na and Ca helped to identify the sedimentary facies that kept a primary signal, which were thus appropriate for isotopic investigations aiming paleoenvironmental and paleohydrologic reconstructions. The results of this study revealed a wide distribution of dominantly low carbon and oxygen isotope values in carbonates, ranging from - 5.69‰ to - 13.02‰ and from - 2.71‰ to - 10.80‰, respectively. This paper demonstrates that at least in the particular case of oxygen, the isotope ratios vary according to seismically-induced shallowing-upward cycles, with values in general lower at their bases, where central lake deposits dominate, and progressively higher upward, where marginal lake deposits are more widespread. In addition to confirming a depositional signature for the analysed samples, this behavior allowed the development of a seismic-induced isotope model. The lighter isotope ratios appear to be related to flooding events promoted by subsidence, which resulted in the development of a perennial lake system, while heavier isotope values are related to ephemeral lake phases favored by uplift and/or increased stability. Furthermore, the results show that a closed lake system dominated, as indicated by the overall good positive covariance (i.e., + 0.42 to + 0.43) between the carbon and oxygen isotopes, though open phases are also recorded by negative covariance values of - 0.36. During closed phases, the δ18O displayed the highest range of variation (i.e., - 3.63‰ to - 4.89‰) due to increased residence time, while this variation was low (i.e., - 0.09‰ to - 1.87‰) during open lake phases, when there was a balance in the water isotope composition maintained by continuous basin inflow. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The sedimentary package of this cycle starts with transgressive marginal shallow marine (intertidal to subtidal) bioclastic sands grading upwards to black mudstone, rich in organic matter (T.O.C. up to 1.3%) deposited within a lagoon protected from the sea by Upper Pleistocene lithified sand spits. The uppermost part of the cycle is represented by oobioclastic carbonate sands covered with dead biodegraded microbial mats and/or reddish sands of aeolian origin deposited in intertidal to supratidal environments. The facies arrangement, particularly the spatial distribution of the ancient and the more recent microbial mats, records the progressive infilling of the lagoon as well as the progradation of the shoreline during the last 2000 years. The organic-rich facies which provide an age varying between 4130 and 6800 yr B.P. were deposited when the Boujmel lagoon started to be progressively separated from the Mediterranean Sea. The main factors controlling the facies and the thickness variation are the local topographic sea-floor irregularities most likely controlled by the inheritance morphology resulting from an important fluviatile digging that occurred during the last glacial maximum, the relative sea-level fluctuations, the hydro-isostatic rebound and the climate. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Is sustainability a realistic goal in a world in which many key process controls are directionally changing? To address this issue, we integrate several disparate sources of theory to address sustainability in directionally changing social-ecological systems, apply this framework to climate-warming impacts in Interior Alaska, and describe a suite of policy strategies that emerge from these analyses. Climate warming in Interior Alaska has profoundly affected factors that influence landscape processes (climate regulation and disturbance spread) and natural hazards, but has only indirectly influenced ecosystem goods such as food, water, and wood that receive most management attention. Warming has reduced cultural services provided by ecosystems, leading to some of the few institutional responses that directly address the causes of climate warming, e.g., indigenous initiatives to the Arctic Council. Four broad policy strategies emerge: (i) enhancing human adaptability through learning and innovation in the context of changes occurring at multiple scales; (ii) increasing resilience by strengthening negative (stabilizing) feedbacks that buffer the system from change and increasing options for adaptation through biological, cultural, and economic diversity; (iii) reducing vulnerability by strengthening institutions that link the high-latitude impacts of climate warming to their low-latitude causes; and (iv) facilitating transformation to new, potentially more beneficial states by taking advantage of opportunities created by crisis. Each strategy provides societal benefits, and we suggest that all of them be pursued simultaneously. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Adaptability; Alaska; Climate change; Resilience; Vulnerability","article; climate change; ecology; ecosystem; environmental sustainability; forest; policy; priority journal; United States; Acclimatization; Alaska; Cold Climate; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Public Policy; Social Environment; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750959070

Computations on a set of titanium-based molecular models that were presumably able to present α- and β-like bonding showed a clear distinction between α- and β-bonding schemes. In view of the geometric, energetic, and electronic data of these molecules, we concluded that the geometries presenting a Ti⋯H approximation similar to α bonding are not the result of a bonding attraction. On the contrary, their origin arises from a short-range repulsion between the metal core and the lone pairs of the alkylidene group, the latter pivoting in its own plane around carbon and thereby allowing simultaneously a closer approach between the Ti and the C atoms and indirectly resulting in a short Ti⋯H distance. Additionally, we found that the electronic and geometric distortion of the C-H bond present in the agostic bonding are not univocally linked to this kind of bonding; instead, this originates in the close distance of the C-H bond and any metal center, independently of whether it is due to an agostic bond or not. Therefore, the lengthening of the C-H bond and the reduction of its electron density at the bond critical point should not be considered as indication of agostic bonding but as a side effect. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Approximation theory; Carrier concentration; Chemical bonds; Computational methods; Quantum theory; Titanium compounds; Agostic bonds; Electron localization function (ELF); Electronic distortions; Geometric distortions; Organometallics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751351321

Eddy covariance technology was applied to investigate the long-term carbon exchange over a 200 year-old Chinese broad-leaved Korean pine mixed forest in the Changbai Mountains (128°28′E and 42°24′N, Jilin Province, P. R. China) since August 2002. On the data obtained with open-path eddy covariance system and CO2 profile measurement system from Jan. 2003 to Dec. 2004, this paper reports (i) annual and seasonal variation of FNEE, FGPP and RE; (ii) regulation of environmental factors on phase and amplitude of ecosystem CO2 uptake and release Corrections due to storage and friction velocity were applied to the eddy carbon flux. LAI and soil temperature determined the seasonal and annual dynamics of FGPP and RE separately. VPD and air temperature regulated ecosystem photosynthesis at finer scales in growing seasons. Water condition at the root zone exerted a significant influence on ecosystem maintenance carbon metabolism of this forest in winter. The forest was a net sink of atmospheric CO2 and sequestered -449 g C·m-2 during the study period; -278 and -171 gC·m-2 for 2003 and 2004 respectively. FGPP and FRE over 2003 and 2004 were -1332, -1294 g C·m-2. and 1054, 1124 g C·m-2 respectively. This study shows that old-growth forest can be a strong net carbon sink of atmospheric CO2. There was significant seasonal and annual variation in carbon metabolism. In winter, there was weak photosynthesis while the ecosystem emitted CO2. Carbon exchanges were active in spring and fall but contributed little to carbon sequestration on an annual scale. The summer is the most significant season as far as ecosystem carbon balance is concerned. The 90 days of summer contributed 66.9, 68.9% of FGPP, and 60.4, 62.1% of RE of the entire year. © Science in China Press 2006.","Carbon metabolism; Eddy-covariance; Old-growth forest; Seasonal and annual dynamics References","Air temperature; Annual dynamics; Atmospheric CO; Carbon accounting; Carbon balance; Carbon exchange; Carbon fluxes; Carbon metabolism; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sink; Changbai Mountains; Changing climate; Eddy covariance; Eddy covariance systems; Environmental factors; Friction velocity; Growing season; Jilin Province; Long-term measurements; Mixed forests; Old-growth forest; Open-path; Profile measurement; Root zone; Seasonal variation; Soil temperature; Water conditions; Climate change; Computer crime; Ecosystems; Environmental regulations; Measurements; Metabolism; Photosynthesis; Uncertainty analysis; Forestry; Pinus koraiensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62849089743

Qianyanzhou planted forest is affected by typical subtropical continental monsoon climate. It has plentiful water and heat resource but is in inconsistency of its seasonal distribution in the mid-subtropical region, thus seasonal drought frequently occurs in this planted forest. In this study, seasonal drought effect on ecosystem carbon sequestration was analyzed based on net ecosystem productivity (NEP), ecosystem respiration (RE) and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) at the month scale in 2003 and 2004. In this drought-stressed planted forest, ecosystem carbon sequestration showed a clear seasonality, with low rates during seasonal drought and in winter. The declining degree of ecosystem carbon sequestration under the seasonal drought condition was determined by the accumulation of soil moisture deficits and a co-occurrence of high temperatures. Different drought effects are expected for RE and GEP. The net effect of ecosystem carbon balance depends on how these two quantities are affected relatively to each other. Summer drought and heat wave are two aspects of weather that likely play an important part in the annual NEP of forest in this region. © Science in China Press 2006.","Ecosystem respiration; Eddy covariance; Gross ecosystem productivity; Seasonal drought; Subtropical planted forest","Carbon balance; Carbon dioxide exchange; Carbon sequestration; Co-occurrence; Continuous measurements; Drought conditions; Ecosystem productivity; Ecosystem respiration; Eddy covariance; Gross ecosystem productivity; Heat waves; Heat-resource; High temperature; Low rates; Monsoon climate; Net ecosystem productivities; Net effect; Qianyanzhou; Seasonal distributions; Seasonality; Soil moisture deficits; Southeastern china; Subtropical regions; Summer droughts; Carbon dioxide; Climatology; Drought; Forestry; Groundwater; Productivity; Soil moisture; Tropics; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47949126513

A refined protocol of the spectrophotometric Winkler approach is presented, where a continuous-flow analyzer is coupled with a custom-made autosampler holding up to 30 oxygen bottles. The time required for analysis is 2 min per sample, and the precision is 0.05% at ~200 mmol O2 m-3. Thus, analysis speed and quality are significantly improved compared to the classic Winkler titration approach to determine O2 concentrations. The accuracy of the method is 99.7% ± 0.2% as determined by comparing the measured versus the theoretical oxygen concentration of saturated seawater at 20°C. The measured absorbance of the iodine at 460 nm wavelength was linear up to an equivalent of 320 mmol O2 m-3, which is within the range of open-ocean oxygen concentrations. The instrument was tested on a cruise in the subtropical North Atlantic where community respiration (CR) and bacterial respiration (BR) were determined. Both CR and BR decreased by ~85% from the Mauritanian upwelling region and the oligotrophic gyre. Along this transect, the contribution of BR to CR increased from 36% to 76%. The instrument proved highly suitable for work at sea and should allow more rapid and precise oxygen concentration measurements under open-ocean conditions. © 2014, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",,"Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649120833

Agricultural practices typically reduce soil carbon through the action of soil disturbance and mineralization. In the Brigalow (Acacia harpophylla) landscape we studied, soil carbon levels in pellic vertisols were significantly lower in the agricultural matrix of cropping and grasslands than in remnant Brigalow vegetation. There was no detectable gradient of soil carbon across Brigalow/matrix boundaries. Uncultivated grasslands showed significantly higher carbon levels than currently and previously cultivated grasslands. Regenerating grasslands showed no significant recovery of soil carbon over 15 years. Total, organic and labile soil carbon fractions were used to indicate different aspects of soil function, with the more active (labile) components reacting more sensitively to changes in land management. The carbon management index (CMI) was used to combine the active and passive components of soil carbon to provide a sensitive indicator of the rate of change of carbon dynamics in response to changes in land management at local-scales.

This paper aims to review the most recent literature on the sensitivity to climate change of agricultural systems by considering four hierarchical levels: (i) crops and grasslands, (ii) cropping systems, (iii) livestock systems, and (iv) farming systems. The available information suggests that a significant rise in mean temperature is likely to reduce crop yields in many areas, with the most threatened systems located in areas with decreasing rainfall. In cooler regions, more favourable mean temperatures and the extension of the growing season may stimulate potential productivity. More frequent dry spells in a warmer climate are likely to increase the risk of crop failure, unless irrigation can be expanded and be combined with improved water retention and water yield. In grasslands, the sensitivity may be larger in extensively than in intensively managed systems because of the lack of adaptive management interventions. Finally, climate change could seriously alter the productivity of animal systems, both through direct effects on the animal well-being and indirect effects via diet quality and forage availability. Overall, there is ample evidence that agricultural systems are sensitive to climate change, and that effects on potential productivity ranges from being extremely negative in already water-limited areas to more favourable in currently temperature-limited regions. © CABI Publishing 2006.","Agriculture; Climate change; Climate variability; Crop yield; Sensitivity",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36549083778

A quantitative approach with an exploratory and descriptive design encompassing the survey method was used. A questionnaire was applied as the data collection instrument and was distributed to 140 respondents. The results indicated that the nursing management and the nursing staff were content with the intrinsic factors of their jobs, but were dissatisfied with the extrinsic factors of the organisational climate.

In order to ascertain carbon surplus for growth and reproduction and the contribution to carbon and nitrogen recycling of these two species, we also determined their basal metabolism and excretion rates. The experiments conducted during summers 2002, 2003, and 2004 indicate that P. avirostris grazed mostly upon small flagellates, dinoflagellates, and diatoms, whereas O. nana had a narrower prey range, selecting motile organisms such as ciliates and occasionally dinoflagellates. The grazing impact of both species accounted, on average, for <10% of the standing stock of the microbial groups considered. In spite of the oligotrophic conditions, the feeding activity of P. avirostris is in general sufficient to compensate basal metabolism and allows a surplus for growth and reproduction. This was not the case for O. nana, its daily rations being often lower than the carbon basal demands. Regarding excretion rates, both species presented different N:P excretion ratios, the ones of O. nana falling within values typical for copepods, whereas the absence of detectable phosphorus excretion by P. avirostris implied an unbalance recycling with respect to typical Redfield ratio composition of marine seston. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.",,"carbon cycle; coastal water; crustacean; excretion; feeding; grazing pressure; metabolism; microbial community; nitrogen cycle; prey availability; trophic structure; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (Northwest); Bacillariophyta; Ciliophora; Copepoda; Cyclopoida; Dinophyceae; Mastigophora (flagellates); Oithona nana; Penilia avirostris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947176533

In order to make assessments about the role of vegetation and soil in forest carbon models, one should also take into account the uncertainties in models. In this study, first, we tested the aggregate effect of uncertainties in input data and vegetation on the uncertainties of soil carbon sink and stock. Secondly, we tested how much the uncertainties of soil model parameters add up to the uncertainty of soil carbon sink and stock. According to the results, the soil model parameters dominated the uncertainty of forest carbon estimates, especially that of the soil carbon stock.

This plant is considered an important agricultural weed because it can reduce agricultural yields by 90% at high densities and becomes problematic under low-tillage agriculture. Seed production is robust with an estimated 200,000 seeds produced per plant, and seed dispersal is wind-assisted. The confirmation of glyphosate-resistant horseweed in Delaware in 2001 and the rapid spread of the resistant biotype, currently covering more than 44,000 ha, has necessitated a change in the discussion about weed dispersal. Large radiocontrolled airplanes were used to sample the lower atmosphere for the presence of horseweed seeds during a 3-d period in early September 2005 in southern Delaware. The collection of multiple seeds at heights ranging from 41 to 140 m above ground level strongly suggests that horseweed seeds are entering the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) of the atmosphere, where long-ranged transport of aerial biota frequently occurs. With wind speeds in the PBL frequently exceeding 20 m s-1, seed dispersal can easily exceed 500 km in a single dispersal event.","Aerial sampling; Glyphosate-resistant; Long-range dispersal","anemochory; annual plant; boundary layer; glyphosate; long range transport; pesticide resistance; seed collection; seed production; weed; Delaware; North America; United States; Conyza; Conyza canadensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846099174

Interactions of climatic variables, such as temperature and precipitation, with freshwater ecosystems are highly complex and can propagate through the ecosystem in ways that are difficult to project. This is partly due to a poor understanding of arctic freshwater systems and their basic interrelationships with climate and other environmental variables, and partly due to a paucity of long-term freshwater monitoring sites and integrated hydro-ecological research programs in the Arctic. The papers in this special issue are an abstraction of the analyses performed by 25 international experts and their associated networks on Arctic freshwater hydrology and related aquatic ecosystems that was initially published by the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA) in 2005 as ""Chapter 8 - Freshwater Ecosystems and Fisheries"". The papers provide a broad overview of the general hydrological and ecological features of the various freshwater ecosystems in the Arctic, including descriptions of each ACIA region, followed by a review of historical changes in freshwater systems during the Holocene. This is followed by an assessment of the effects of climate change on broad-scale hydro-ecology; aquatic biota and ecosystem structure and function; and arctic fish and fisheries. Potential synergistic and cumulative effects are also discussed, as are the roles of ultraviolet radiation and contaminants. The nature and complexity of many of the effects are illustrated using case studies from around the circumpolar north, together with a discussion of important threshold responses (i.e., those that produce stepwise and/or nonlinear effects).

To celebrate the 20th anniversary of Chinese National Committee for World Climate Research Programme (WCRP), this paper is devoted to reviewing the main results of these studies. First, CNOP represents the initial perturbation that has largest nonlinear evolution at prediction time, which is different from linear singular vector (LSV) for the large magnitude of initial perturbation or/and the long optimization time interval. Second, CNOP, rather than linear singular vector (LSV), represents the initial anomaly that evolves into ENSO events most probably. It is also the CNOP that induces the most prominent seasonal variation of error growth for ENSO predictability; furthermore, CNOP was applied to investigate the decadal variability of ENSO asymmetry. It is demonstrated that the changing nonlinearity causes the change of ENSO asymmetry. Third, in the studies of the sensitivity and stability of ocean's thermohaline circulation (THC), the nonlinear asymmetric response of THC to finite amplitude of initial perturbations was revealed by CNOP. Through this approach the passive mechanism of decadal variation of THC was demonstrated; Also the authors studies the instability and sensitivity analysis of grassland ecosystem by using CNOP and show the mechanism of the transitions between the grassland and desert states. Finally, a detailed discussion on the results obtained by CNOP suggests the applicability of CNOP in predictability studies and sensitivity analysis.","Climate; Optimal perturbation; Predictability; Weather",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845923592

As an attempt to review these academic activities, we emphasize that vegetation and ocean feedbacks can amplify East Asian climate response to the Earth's orbital parameters and atmospheric CO2 concentration at the mid-Holocene. At the Last Glacial Maximum, additional cooling in interior China is caused by the feedback effects of East Asian vegetation and the ice sheet over the Tibetan Plateau, and the regional climate model RegCM2 generally reduces data-model discrepancies in East Asia. The simulated mid-Pliocene climate is characterized by warmer and drier conditions as well as significantly weakened summer and winter monsoon systems in interior China. On a tectonic timescale, both the Tibetan Plateau uplift and the Paratethys Sea retreat play important roles in the formation of East Asian monsoon-dominant environmental pattern during the Cenozoic.","Cenozoic; Last Glacial Maximum; Mid-Holocene; Mid-Pliocene; Modelling; Paleoclimate",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845920495

One of these methods is the 'contraction and convergence' approach, which defines emission permits on the basis of converging per capita emissions under a contracting global emission profile. The approach is unique in its simplicity. Only two major issues need to be negotiated and agreed upon: the target atmospheric concentration of CO2 and the date when the entitlements are to converge at equal per capita allocations. According to the contraction and convergence approach, developing countries can continue their current emission trends, whereas industrialized countries should reduce their emissions quite dramatically. This regime represents a shift away from the current approach towards defining commitments for all parties and their evolution over the long term. This article analyses how allocation schemes determined by the contraction and convergence approach might affect certain OECD and non-OECD countries. Results for eleven countries selected for analysis (United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Japan, China, Venezuela, Thailand, Brazil, India and Indonesia) reveal that trends observed in the past few decades in most industrialized countries will lead to the contraction and convergence target. © 2006 The Authors.

To improve silencing by expressed antisense RNAs (asRNAs), we systematically altered several design parameters and targeted multiple reporter and essential genes in Escherichia coli. A paired termini (PT) design, where flanking inverted repeats create paired dsRNA termini, proved effective. PTasRNAs targeted against the ackA gene within the acetate kinase-phosphotransacetylase operon (ackA-pta) triggered target mRNA decay and a 78% reduction in AckA activity with high genetic penetrance. PTasRNAs are abundant and stable and function through an RNase III independent mechanism that requires a large stoichiometric excess of asRNA. Conditional ackA silencing reduced carbon flux to acetate and increased heterologous gene expression. The PT design also improved silencing of the essential fabI gene. Full anti-fabI PTasRNA induction prevented growth and partial induction sensitized cells to a FabI inhibitor.

Analyses of the communities were based on a gridded sample of ca. 140,000 points, while those for the species used presence-absence data from ca. 120,000 locations. Independent variables included 35 simple expressions of temperature and precipitation and their interactions. Classification errors for community models averaged 19%, but the errors were reduced by half when adjusted for misalignment between geographic data sets. Errors of omission for species-specific models approached 0, while errors of commission were less than 9%. Mapped climate profiles of the species were in solid agreement with range maps. Climate variables of most importance for segregating the communities were those that generally differentiate maritime, continental, and monsoonal climates, while those of importance for predicting the occurrence of species varied among species but consistently implicated the periodicity of precipitation and temperature-precipitation interactions. Projections showed that unmitigated global warming should increase the abundance primarily of the montane forest and grassland community profiles at the expense largely of those of the subalpine, alpine, and tundra communities but also that of the arid woodlands. However, the climate of 47% of the future landscape may be extramural to contemporary community profiles. Effects projected on the spatial distribution of species-specific profiles were varied, but shifts in space and altitude would be extensive. Species-specific projections were not necessarily consistent with those of their communities. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.

The vulnerability map, according to the parametric method SINTACX for assessing intrinsic aquifer vulnerability, was validated in a case study with chlorofluorocarbon tracer technologies (CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-113) of groundwater. The tested area was the 1,295 km2 volcano-sedimentary area of San Miguel de Allende (SMA), Mexico. From the results of this area, it appears that the vulnerability map is in parts inconsistent with the underlying groundwater flow system. Thus, the vulnerability map was corrected with tracer information. The validated vulnerability map indicates that the degree of vulnerability varies from low to moderate-high. Low vulnerability values are found in the graben extending from north to south along the SMA fault system and high values in recharge areas southeast and northwest of the study area. The investigation is a demonstration that the scientific reliability of results of the parametric method can be improved by validation with tracer techniques representing the groundwater dynamics. The flexible structure of SINTACX allows revising and adjusting scores and weights of the parameter maps to rebuild a new vulnerability map consistent with the hydrological system. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","Aquifer vulnerability; Chlorofluorocarbons; Guanajuato; Mexico; Semi-arid regions; SINTACX","Chlorofluorocarbons; Environmental impact; Hydrology; Parameter estimation; Risk assessment; Water pollution; Aquifer vulnerability; Guanajuato; Mexico; Semi-arid regions; SINTACX; Aquifers; aquifer pollution; CFC; groundwater flow; model validation; pollution monitoring; tracer; vulnerability; Guanajuato; Mexico [North America]; North America; San Miguel de Allende",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845653493

The mid-IR application space is summarized, and the current practice based on the optical parametric oscillators and solid state Raman lasers is discussed. Relevant properties of silicon are compared with popular Raman crystals, and linear and nonlinear transmission measurements of silicon in the mid-IR are presented. It is shown that the absence of the nonlinear losses, which severely limit the performance of the recently demonstrated silicon lasers in the near IR, combined with unsurpassed crystal quality, high thermal conductivity and excellent optical damage threshold render silicon a very attractive Raman medium, even when compared to the very best Raman crystals. In addition, silicon photonic technology, offering integrated low-loss waveguides and microcavities, offers additional advantages over today's bulk crystal Raman laser technology. Using photonic crystal structures or microring resonators, the integrated cascaded microcavities can be employed to realize higher order Stokes emission, and hence to extend the wavelength coverage of the existing pump lasers. Exploiting these facts, the proposed technology can extend the utility of silicon photonics beyond data communication and into equally important applications in biochemical sensing and laser medicine. © 2006 IEEE.","Er:YAG and erbium-based solid-state lasers; Mid-IR silicon lasers; Midwave infrared (MWIR) silicon laser; Silicon raman lasers; Two-photon absorption (TPA)","Er:YAG and erbium-based solid-state lasers; Mid-IR silicon lasers; Midwave infrared (MWIR) silicon lasers; Silicon raman lasers; Two-photon absorption (TPA); Infrared devices; Integrated optics; Light transmission; Optical properties; Photons; Raman scattering; Solid state lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845638658

Exceedance of the proposed National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for PMcoarse is expected within the Columbia Plateau of the Pacific Northwest United States based on the high frequency of dust storms and the large contribution of crustal material to fugitive dust in the region. The objective of this study was to explore the implication of the proposed NAAQS for PMcoarse on air quality. Concurrent observations of both PM10 (particulate matter ≤10 μm in diameter) and PMfine (particulate matter ≤2.5 μm in diameter) were made at Kennewick, WA from 1999 through 2005. Daily PMcoarse concentration was determined as the difference between PM10 and PMfine concentrations. The number of exceedances of the proposed USEPA NAAQS for PMcoarse was determined for various levels of the standard (the proposed daily level is 70 μg m -3). Over the 7 yr of this study, the PM10 standard was exceeded on 16 d with PMfine constituting 4 to 7% of PM10. The proposed PM coarse standard would have been exceeded on 35 d and represents a 120% increase in the number of exceedances over the current PM10 standard. Changing the level of the proposed PMcoarse standard to that of the current PM10 standard (150 μg m-3) would result in a 20% decrease in the number of exceedances of the PM standard. The results of this study suggest that the proposed NAAQS for PMfine and PMcoarse will be exceeded more frequently than the current PMfine and PM10 standard in a region subject to seasonal dust storms. © ASA, CSSA, SSSA.",,"Air quality; Concentration (process); Dust; Environmental engineering; Storms; Dust storms; Particulate matter concentration; Windblown dust; Particles (particulate matter); air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; ambient air; article; concentration (parameters); dust; environmental protection; particle size; particulate matter; pollution control; pollution transport; quality control; seasonal variation; standard; United States; Air Pollutants; Dust; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Meteorological Factors; Particulate Matter; Quality Control; United States; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845340447

Given sufficient time, the change will be recorded in the total (live+dead) seafloor assemblage, from which valuable information regarding environmental trends can be obtained by re-sampling assemblages at the decadal scale. The seafloor assemblage in the 5 km × 6 km Ibis Field, off southeast Trinidad, first surveyed in 1953, was re-examined in 2005. The fauna had changed markedly between the surveys. Overall increases in the proportional abundances of Uvigerina subperegrina, Ammonia pauciloculata/ Rolhausenia rolhauseni and Pseudononion atlanticum indicate an increase in nutrient supply that apparently killed off Cibicidoides pseudoungerianus and Miliolinella subrotunda, and reduced the relative abundance of Hanzawaia concentrica, but did not affect the relative abundance of Cancris sagrai. As shown by similar 1953 and 2005 planktonic/benthonic foraminiferal ratios, the increased nutrient supply impacted on both surface and bottom waters. Of the six most abundant species in 2005, five showed the same general biogeographical distributions within the field in 1953 and 2005. However, whereas the proportional abundance of Uvigerina subperegrina in 1953 increased southwards, in 2005 it increased northwards. Trinidad cannot be the source for the nutrient enrichment: the island lies down-current from the Ibis Field. Sources must therefore be sought up-current and to the southeast, in the Amazon, Essequibo and Orinoco river basins, or along the South American shoreline. It is speculated that the nutrient enrichment may be a consequence of increased phytoplankton primary production associated with nitrogen-rich run-off from South American sugarcane plantations, or from flushing of organic carbon from poorly regulated sewage systems or shrimp farms in South America. © 2006 The Micropalaeontological Society.","Amazon; Caribbean; Orinoco; Pseudononion; Uvigerina","benthic foraminifera; biogeography; fossil assemblage; relative abundance; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Islands; Cancris; Cibicidoides; Decapoda (Crustacea); Hanzawaia; Ibis; Miliolinella subrotunda; Pseudononion; Uvigerina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845301195

Gas-expanded liquids, such as CO2 in methanol, provide a flexible solvent whose properties can be adjusted by changing the pressure. When the reaction is over, the pressure is released, allowing the CO2 to separate from the methanol. Supercritical fluids, such as CO2 under high pressure, simplify separation processes.

The study is based on models derived from MERGE, a well established integrated assessment model (IAM). We discuss first the introduction in MERGE of a set of ""tolerable window"" constraints which limit both the temperature change and the rate of temperature change. These constraints, obtained from ensemble simulations performed with the Bern 2.5-D climate model, allow us to identity a domain intended to preserve the Atlantic thermohaline circulation. Next, we report on experiments where a two-way coupling is realized between the economic module of MERGE and an intermediate complexity ""3-D-"" climate model (C-GOLDSTEIN) which computes the changes in climate and mean temperature. The coupling is achieved through the implementation of an advanced ""oracle based optimization technique"" which permits the integration of information coming from the climate model during the search for the optimal economic growth path. Both cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis modes are explored with this combined ""meta-model"" which we refer to as GOLDMERGE.

In the first part we show the potential impact of R&amp;D policies or demonstration and deployment (D&amp;D) programs in the context of stringent stabilization scenarios. In the second part we show how game-theoretic methods can be implemented in climate change economic models to take into account three types of strategic interactions: (i) the market power of the countries benefiting from very low abatement costs on international markets for CO2 emissions, (ii) the strategic behavior of governments in the domestic allocation of CO2 emissions quotas, and (iii) the non-cooperative behavior of countries and regions in the burden sharing of CO2 concentration stabilization. The two topics of endogenous learning and game-theoretic approach to economic modeling are two manifestations of the need to take into account the strategic behavior of agents in the evaluation of climate change policies. In the first case an R&amp;D policy or a demonstration and deployment (D&amp;D) program are put in place in order to attain a cost reduction through the learning effect; in the second case the agents (countries) reply optimally to the actions decided by the other agents by exploiting their strategic advantages.

The paper aims to (i) describe observed trends and scenarios for summer heat waves, windstorms and heavy precipitation, based on results from simulations with global circulation models, regional climate models, and other downscaling procedures, and (ii) discuss potential impacts on agricultural systems and forests in Switzerland. Trends and scenarios project more frequent heavy precipitation during winter corresponding, for example, to a three-fold increase in the exceedance of today's 15-year extreme values by the end of the 21st century. This increases the risk of large-scale flooding and loss of topsoil due to erosion. In contrast, constraints in agricultural practice due to waterlogged soils may become less in a warmer climate. In summer, the most remarkable trend is a decrease in the frequency of wet days, and shorter return times of heat waves and droughts. This increases the risk of losses of crop yield and forage quality. In forests, the more frequent occurrence of dry years may accelerate the replacement of sensitive tree species and reduce carbon stocks, and the projected slight increase in the frequency of extreme storms by the end of the century could increase the risk of windthrow. Some possible measures to maintain goods and services of agricultural and forest ecosystems are mentioned, but it is suggested that more frequent extremes may have more severe consequences than progressive changes in means. In order to effectively decrease the risk for social and economic impacts, long-term adaptive strategies in agriculture and silviculture, investments for prevention, and new insurance concepts seem necessary. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.","Agriculture; Climate change; Extreme events; Forests; Society; Switzerland","Agriculture; Drought; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Flood control; Forestry; Risk assessment; Weather information services; Wind effects; Downscaling procedures; Global climate change; Summer heat waves; Windstorms; Climate change; agriculture; climate change; climate effect; extreme event; flooding; forest; soil erosion; Agriculture; Climates; Ecosystems; Forests; Risk Assessment; Silviculture; Switzerland; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751516467

Satellite-based canopy water measurements closely tracked variations in leaf area index, and the remotely sensed photochemical and carotenoid reflectance indices (PRI, CRI) indicated variations in upper-canopy leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid content during a climatological transition. The PRI and CRI were related to differences in light-use efficiency of each species, as indicated by field measurements of leaf electron transport rate. The suite of hyperspectral metrics indicated maximum differences in the structure, biochemistry, and physiology of Myrica and Metrosideros when canopy vapor pressure deficit was high during hotter and drier periods. These satellite data, combined with the Carnegue-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) carbon cycle model, suggested that Myrica growth rates were 16-44% higher than Metrosideros, with relative differences between species closely linked to climate conditions.

Crucially, rocketing crude oil prices since 2004 have further heightened interest in fuel ethanol, making the biofuel markedly more competitive as against gasoline than ever before. An emerging interface between ethanol and the sugar market has seemingly become a key new strategic driver for the world sugar market. Whilst the dynamics and potency of this interface are still to be fully understood, in part being driven by future oil price levels and the extent to which sugar producing industries around the globe diversify into fuel ethanol production, a key question is could ethanol begin to destabilise the world sugar market over the longer term. The implications of Brazil's rapidly expanding flex-fuel vehicle fleet is a central focus because it is leading to a profound change in Brazil's ability to alter its ethanol/sugar product mix.

Numerous studies have estimated the potential supply schedules at which agriculture and forestry could produce greenhouse gas offsets. However, such studies vary widely in critical assumptions regarding economic market adjustments, allowed scope of mitigation alternatives, and region of focus. Here, we examine the effects of using different assumptions on the total emission mitigation supply curve from agriculture and forestry in the United States. To do this we employ the U.S.-based Agricultural Sector and Mitigation of Greenhouse Gas Model and find that variations in such factors can have profound effects on the results. Differences between commonly employed methods shift economic mitigation potentials from -55 to + 85%. The bias is stronger at higher carbon prices due to afforestation and energy crop plantations that reduce supply of traditional commodities. Lower carbon prices promote management changes with smaller impacts on commodity supply. © 2006 International Association of Agricultural Economists.","Agriculture; Economic potential; Forestry; Greenhouse gas emission mitigation","agricultural economics; agricultural emission; emission control; forestry practice; greenhouse gas; North America; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751231428

However, this information is also crucial for decision makers aiming at further reduction of the environmental loading of these substances on a regional scale. In this study, we identify and discuss specific POP emission inventory features that are deemed essential to understand, predict and control the behaviour of such substances on a European scale. It is shown that the scientific value of official emission data is limited (e.g. for deriving source-receptor relationships on a European scale), as there is insufficient information on spatial, temporal and compound coverage. Likewise, we argue that non-official emission data (i.e. research-driven emission inventories), which are based on aggregated statistics, may be of limited value for the identification of further emission control strategies. It is thus argued that future emission inventories should be developed in a format that is suitable to serve both policy- and research-oriented applications. Further improvement of official emission data with respect to research-driven features seems to be the most sensible way to proceed. Finally, the empirical basis of current emission inventories remains weak, and further research on emission identification and characterisation seem needed (a) to gain confidence in predicted source-receptor relationship as well as (b) for the development of sound control strategies. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

DWHI ratios were combined with interpolated estimates of mean annual precipitation to develop pollen-based precipitation transfer functions. The optimal regression model, with a predictive range of 960-2600 mm, was applied to 10 Holocene lake sediment records distributed across a ∼150 km long coastal-inland precipitation gradient. Predicted precipitation was spatially modelled in a geographic information system to examine the spatio-temporal history of precipitation from this representative portion of the coastal temperate rainforest (CTR) complex of western North America. The reconstructions show widespread early Holocene dry conditions coupled with a steep east-west precipitation gradient. Thereafter, the modern precipitation gradient established 7000 years ago, illustrating that the CTR complex has experienced marked short-distance east-west changes in precipitation in the past. Changes in the abundance of arboreal and non-arboreal vegetation, as well as fire disturbance, are often concomitant with changes in Holocene precipitation. Given the precipitation and vegetation history of the region, conservation initiatives should focus on the moist outer coastal zone since it appears to have the greatest amount of resilience to perturbations in precipitation, whereas monitoring programs for signs of climate change should be initiated in central and eastern areas as they appear sensitive to changes in the moisture regime. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The selective growth of the CNTs was achieved with a two-step microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition process involving a pre-growth hydrogen plasma treatment. Without plasma pretreatment, CNTs were found to grow along edges of the sandwiched tri-metal layer including the anode. Interestingly, with plasma pretreatment, CNTs grew selectively near the sharp tip region. Moreover, specific CNTs could be selectively synthesized on the tip region by optimizing the plasma pretreatment and the growth time.

The methodology was applied to an actual karstic aquifer on the Siou-Blanc Plateau (France). For the recharge study, it was observed that the average yearly rainfall value and α18O measurements in springs can be considered as good descriptors of climatic variations observed in the Mediterranean area. They can be used to estimate the intake area and the infiltration coefficient. A comparison with a numerical (double permeability) flow model (MODFLOW) on the Siou-Blanc karst improves these exponential relations between effective rainfall and α18O measurements. Infiltrated water, which flows though different rock types, induces contrasts in the water chemistry. An instantaneous physical and chemical analysis of all the springs of the Siou-Blanc aquifer displays the same expected functioning and variations as had been forecast using the conceptual scheme. Thus, it can be applied to wide areas associated with a northeastern Mediterranean climate for a first approach of a karst study; such a model enables a useful estimation of recharge and behavior with few simple data. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Ground water recharge; Karst; Mediterranean climate; Toulon; Water chemistry","aquifer; climate variation; flow modeling; groundwater; karst; recharge; water chemistry; Eurasia; Europe; France; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur; Toulon; Var; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751204476

The long-term effect of afforestation on the role of soil as C sink was investigated in a chronosequence of 18-, 29-, 64-, 73-, and 91-year-old Picea abies stands, established on former agricultural soils in southwestern Sweden.The forest floor was sampled both as a whole and in the three horizons (unaltered, semialtered, and altered organic horizons), whereas the mineral soil was sampled at 0 to 5, 5 to 15, and 15 to 30 cm depth. The physicochemical characterization of soil, C and nitrogen content, and lignin characterization by the cupric oxide oxidation method was conducted.Within the first decades of afforestation, the soil properties reflected the former soil management, and C accumulation involved mainly the organic layer (3.41-5.92 Mg C ha), where the new litter was accumulating, and coniferous lignin showed a low degree of degradation. Meanwhile, the mineral soil behaved as a C source (95.5-80.2 Mg C ha), loosening the C inherited from the previous land use probably because of the nutrient needs of the growing trees that accelerated organic matter mineralization. Vanillyl moieties were almost absent, and the syringyl units, derived from angiosperms, were considerably oxidized, indicating a low C input from the conifer litter and high degradation of the inherited organic material.With age, the C stock started to increase both in the organic and mineral layers, reaching 191.5 Mg ha in 91 years. The accumulation in organic soil was accompanied by a litter nitrogen impoverishment and decrease of soil pH, which probably limited the microbial community to fungi, able to degrade lignin. In the oldest stands, the lignin material seemed to be intensively altered, mainly in the deeper organic horizons, where aromatic, mobile, acidic compounds were produced and/or translocated down in the profile. This could contribute to organic matter incorporation into mineral layers and to mineral weathering, driving the soil toward the restarting of the podzolization process.From these results, it seemed that even if the previous land use caused an initial acceleration of organic matter mineralization, soil started to accumulate C when the influence of the new vegetation dominated. The soil became a major C sink with a long forest growth of about a century. The accumulation was strongly affected by litter composition, which changed with spruce age. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","C/N ratio; Carbon accumulation; Decomposition; Lignin; Plant age","afforestation; agricultural soil; carbon sequestration; chronosequence; evergreen tree; forest floor; lignin; mineralization; physicochemical property; podzolization; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; soil property; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden; Coniferophyta; Fungi; Magnoliophyta; Picea; Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751188308

It is aimed to reduce the fading rate and to enhance the electrochemical performance, particularly at high C rate. In this study, microstructure, valence change and variation of bonding state in the surface-modified LiMn2O4 were examined and probed. Both the LiCuxMn2-xO4-coated LiMn2O4 and Li2O-2B2O3 (LBO)-coated LiMn2O4 were synthesized by chemical solution method in this study. Field-emission SEM plan-view observation revealed the particles with the size of 7-8 μm for both LiCuxMn2-xO4-coated LiMn2O4 and LBO-coated LiMn2O4, exhibiting a well-developed octahedral structure with sharp edges. Nevertheless, from the cross-section view of both LiCuxMn2-xO4-coated LiMn2O4 and LBO-coated LiMn2O4, it was observed that the lager particles consisted of many smaller ones in the sub-micrometer range. It was demonstrated that LiCuxMn2-xO4-coated LiMn2O4 and LBO-coated LiMn2O4 exhibited two distinct types of surface modification on the basis of the detailed analysis of FESEM and HRTEM. The XANES of Cu and Mn K-edge spectrum for LiCuxMn2-xO4-coated LiMn2O4 showed that the valence of Cu and Mn was close to Cu2+ and Mn4+. Furthermore, the oxidation state of Mn was reversibly increased and decreased during charge. It was further revealed in this study that the trend of the variation for the bonding length of Mn-O and Mn-M (M = Mn or Cu) was in agreement with the oxidation state of Mn, which was decreased with Li deintercalation while increased with Li intercalation during cycling. On the basis of the in situ XAS data, it was evidenced that Mn transferred toward Mn4+ to minimize the Jahn-Teller distortion, and thus the electrochemical property was improved. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Considering results of all methods used, the following palaeoclimate estimates seem to be most likely: mean annual temperature ∼15-16°C (MAT), coldest month mean temperature ∼7°C (CMMT), warmest month mean temperature between 25 and 26°C, and mean annual precipiation ∼1,300 mm, although CMMT values may have been colder as indicated by the disappearance of the crocodile Diplocynodon and the temperature thresholds derived from modern alligators. For most palaeoclimatic parameters, estimates derived by CLAMP significantly differ from those derived by most other methods. With respect to the consistency of the results obtained by CA, LMA and ELPA, it is suggested that for the Schrotzburg locality CLAMP is probably less reliable than most other methods. A possible explanation may be attributed to the correlation between leaf physiognomy and climate as represented by the CLAMP calibration data set which is largely based on extant floras from N America and E Asia and which may be not suitable for application to the European Neogene. All physiognomic methods used here were affected by taphonomic biasses. Especially the number of taxa had a great influence on the reliability of the palaeoclimate estimates. Both multivariate leaf physiognomic approaches are less influenced by such biasses than the univariate LMA. In combination with previously published results from the European and Asian Neogene, our data suggest that during the Neogene in Eurasia CLAMP may produce temperature estimates, which are systematically too cold as compared to other evidence. This pattern, however, has to be further investigated using additional palaeofloras. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Leaf physiognomy; Nearest living relatives; Neogene; Palaeoclimate; Taphonomy","data set; flora; fossil assemblage; Miocene; multivariate analysis; Neogene; paleoclimate; physiology; taphonomy; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Alligatorinae; Diplocynodon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751078547

Therefore, any change in SOC pool of these soils would not only impact the regional and global carbon cycle, but also affect the release and immobilization of nutrients. In this study, we reviewed the research progress on SOC storage, budget, variation, and fertility under different scenarios. The results showed that the organic carbon storage of black soils was 646.2 TgC and the most potential sequestration was 2887.8 g m-2. According to the SOC budget, the net carbon emission of black soils was 1.3 TgC year-1 under present soil management system. The simulation of CENTURY model showed that future climate change and elevated CO2 concentration, especially the increase of precipitation, would increase SOC content. Furthermore, fertilization and cropping sequence obviously influenced SOC content, composition, and allocation among different soil particles. Long-term input of organic materials such as manure and straw renewed original SOC, improved soil structure and increased SOC accumulation. Besides, soil erosion preferred to transport soil particles with low density and fine size, decreased recalcitrant SOC fractions at erosion sites and increased activities of soil microorganism at deposition sites. After natural grasslands were converted into croplands, obvious variation of soil chemical nutrients, physical structure, and microbial activities had taken place in surface and subsurface soils, and represented a degrading trend to a certain degree. Our studies suggested that adopting optimal management such as conservation tillage in black soil region is an important approach to sequester atmospheric CO2 and to slow greenhouse effects. © 2006 The Ecological Society of Japan.","Black soils; Northeast China; Soil carbon budget; Soil fertility; Soil organic matter","carbon budget; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; conservation tillage; fertilizer application; manure; soil carbon; soil fertility; soil management; soil organic matter; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751054126

The model specifically focuses on predicting a weighted energy use index (EUI) by taking into consideration various building variables, such as plug load density, lighting type and hours of operation, air conditioning equipment type and efficiency, etc. Data collected from laboratory, office and classroom-type buildings and mixed use buildings in Hawaii are used to present the ANN-based benchmarking technique. The developed model successfully predicted the benchmarking EUI for the buildings considered in the study. The model coefficient of correlation was 0.86 for the whole building benchmarking analysis, indicating a good correlation between the measured EUI and the ANN predictions. Additionally, the use of ANN benchmark model for predicting potential energy savings from retrofit projects was evaluated. Some of the benchmarking input variables were modified to reflect a potential energy savings from a retrofit project and the new input set was simulated with the ANN model. The preliminary results show that the developed ANN model can be used to predict energy savings from retrofit projects.

In a Pinus tabulaeformis plantation and an adjacent Quercus aliena var. acuteserrata shrub, which are located in a dry-hot valley region of Minjiang River in the Southwest of China, the daily soil CO2 emission dynamics was measured in August 2004 and in May, July, and October 2005. The results showed that the soil CO2 emission in the oak shrub was significantly higher than the pine plantation in each measurement period. Additionally, soil organic matter, microbial biomass carbon, and the leaf litter decomposition rate in the two vegetations differed significantly from each other. The variation of soil organic matter and microbial biomass carbon partially contributed to the evident difference in soil CO2 emission. Moreover, the correlations between soil CO2 emission, soil temperature, and soil water content were evaluated in this study. The soil temperature positively controlled soil CO2 emission in the pine plantation and the oak shrub, while the soil water content negatively influenced soil CO2 emission in the two vegetation types. However, the soil temperature and soil water content played varied roles in the different vegetation types. By the means of stepwise regression, the soil temperature more significantly influenced the dynamics of soil CO2 emission for the plantation than the soil water content; oppositely, the soil water content was the more significant controlling factor for the shrub. Based on the exponent model between the soil CO2 emission and soil temperature, the Q 10 values were estimated, which was 1.7 in the pine plantation and 3.0 in the oak shrub. The former was lower than the global average level of 2.0, whereas the latter was higher than the global average level. © 2006 The Ecological Society of Japan.","Controlling factors; Dynamics; Oak shrub; Pine plantation; Soil CO2 emission","carbon dioxide; coniferous tree; decomposition; leaf litter; shrub; soil emission; soil organic matter; soil temperature; soil water potential; vegetation type; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Min River; Sichuan; Pinus tabuliformis; Quercus aliena",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751028855

The ANME-1b community was found in the sulfate-methane interface, where undersaturated methane concentrations of ca. 100 to 250 μM coexist with sulfate concentrations around 10 mM. Clone libraries of dsrAB genes and bacterial 16S rRNA genes show diversified sulfate-reducing communities within and above the sulfate-methane interface. Their phylogenetic profiles and occurrence patterns are not linked to ANME-1b populations, indicating that electron donors other than methane, perhaps petroleum-derived hydrocarbons, drive sulfate reduction.

During the R/V SONNE expedition ""GAP-Gibraltar Arc Processes (SO-175)"" in December 2003, several mud volcanoes were surveyed for gas seepage and associated microbial methane turnover. Pore water analyses and methane oxidation measurements on sediment cores recovered from the centres of the mud volcanoes Captain Arutyunov, Bonjardim, Ginsburg, Gemini and a newly discovered, mud volcano-like structure called ""No Name"" show that thermogenic methane and associated higher hydrocarbons rising from deeper sediment strata are completely consumed within the seabed. The presence of a distinct sulphate-methane transition zone (SMT) overlapping with high sulphide concentrations suggests that methane oxidation is mediated under anaerobic conditions with sulphate as the electron acceptor. Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and sulphate reduction (SR) rates show maxima at the SMT, which was found between 20 and 200 cm below seafloor at the different mud volcanoes. In comparison to other methane seeps, AOM activity (&lt;383 mmol m-2 year-1) and diffusive methane fluxes (&lt;321 mmol m-2 year-1) in mud volcano sediments of the Gulf of Cadiz are low to mid range. Corresponding lipid biomarker and 16S rDNA clone library analysis give evidence that AOM is mediated by a mixed community of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea and associated sulphate reducing bacteria (SRB) in the studied mud volcanoes. Little is known about the variability of methane fluxes in this environment. Carbonate crusts littering the seafloor of mud volcanoes in the northern part of the Gulf of Cadiz had strongly 13C-depleted lipid signatures indicative of higher seepage activities in the past. However, actual seafloor video observations showed only scarce traces of methane seepage and associated biological processes at the seafloor. No active fluid or free gas escape to the hydrosphere was observed visually at any of the surveyed mud volcanoes, and biogeochemical measurements indicate a complete methane consumption in the seafloor. Our observations suggest that the emission of methane to the hydrosphere from the mud volcano structures studied here may be insignificant at present. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Consequently, standard fMRI cannot map continuous activations in conditions like tinnitus without an ON-OFF paradigm. We present a novel approach to fMRI that allows mapping of continuous neuronal activation. Compared with standard fMRI, we introduced the application of CO2 as potent vasodilator. CO2 induces a 'global' blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response. The neurovascular coupling in conjunction with the limited cerebral vasodilation implies a limitation or ceiling of the BOLD response. We hypothesize that active areas exhibit a reduced CO2-induced ΔBOLD due to pre-existing 'local' task-induced BOLD response. This putative reduction in ΔBOLD might be exploited for mapping of continuous neuronal activation. BOLD ceiling fMRI was tested in the auditory system. Six healthy subjects performed three runs: only continuous monaural auditory; only 10% CO2; simultaneous auditory and CO 2 stimulation. First, we demonstrated the ceiling of ΔBOLD during continuous auditory activation. According to the known predominantly contralateral auditory processing, monaural auditory stimulation reduced predominantly contralateral (0.41 ± 0.13%; P &lt; 0.00001) and significantly less (P &lt; 0.0001) ipsilateral ΔBOLD (0.33 ± 0.17%; P &lt; 0.00001). The non-auditory area was not affected. Second, this BOLD ceiling was exploited to generate an initial activation map of continuous auditory activation (ON period). In contrast to standard fMRI, an OFF period without neuronal activation was not required. BOLD ceiling fMRI is proposed as a complement to standard fMRI for those conditions where ON-OFF paradigms are impossible. © The Authors (2006).","Auditory system; Carbon dioxide; Neuroimaging; Neurovascular coupling","carbon dioxide; article; auditory cortex; auditory stimulation; blood oxygenation; brain blood flow; brain function; brain mapping; carbon dioxide tension; comparative study; functional magnetic resonance imaging; monaural hearing; priority journal; standard; statistical significance; Acoustic Stimulation; Adult; Auditory Cortex; Brain Mapping; Carbon Dioxide; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neurons; Oxygen; Vasodilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750896633

In the present study, we added nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) to inhibit NO2- accumulation and evaluated its effect on N2O emission in a laboratory-scale composting experiment. Mature pig manure compost (MPMC) containing NOB at 106 MPN g-1 WM or cultured MPMC (cul-MPMC) NOB at 1011 MPN g-1 WM was added after the thermophilic phase of composting. The addition of these materials prevented NO2- accumulation, promoting oxidation to nitrate (NO3-), whereas the accumulation of NO2- occurred in the material to which NOB was not added as the result of the delayed growth of indigenous NOB compared with that of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). The pattern of NO 2- in the material agreed with that of N2O emission; therefore, N2O emission ceased rapidly when NOB was added. Emission rates of N2O were 88.5 (no addition), 17.5 (MPMC addition), and 20.2 (cul-MPMC addition) g N-N2O kg-1 TN initial, respectively.

Box 9518, 2300 RA, Leiden, Netherlands","Embodied greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and their structure of inducement by the supply-chain networks of 480 goods and services in the United States are analyzed for 44 GHGs. Producing a dollar of a product or service generates an average of 0.36 kg of CO2 equivalent GHGs onsite, increasing to 0.83 kg when supply-chain-induced emissions are taken into account. Services produce less than 5% of total U.S. GHG emissions directly, and their direct GHG emission intensities per dollar output are much less (0.04 kg CO2 equiv/$) than those of physical products, even when supply-chain-induced emissions are included (0.47 kg CO2 equiv/$). When both supply-chain effects and the volume of household expenditures are taken into account, however, household consumption of services excluding electric utilities and transportation services proves to be responsible for 37.6% of total industrial GHG emissions in the United States, almost twice the amount due to household consumption of electric utility and transportation services. Given the current structure of GHG emissions, a shift to a service-oriented economy is shown to entail a decrease in GHG emission intensity per unit GDP but an increase, by necessity, in overall GHG emissions in absolute terms. The results are discussed in the context of U.S. climate change policy. © 2006 Amarican Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Greenhouse effect; Particulate emissions; Public policy; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Service oriented economy; Transportation services; Mass transportation; carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Greenhouse effect; Mass transportation; Particulate emissions; Public policy; carbon dioxide; climate change; emission; greenhouse gas; industrial emission; utility sector; air pollution; article; climate change; cost; economic aspect; electricity; greenhouse gas; household; industry; policy; traffic and transport; United States; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Ecosystem; Energy-Generating Resources; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Statistical; Refuse Disposal; Risk Assessment; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750862310

However, lack of adequate air monitoring data has limited understanding of the effects of airborne PAHs on fetal growth. To address this gap in knowledge, we examined the association between prenatal exposure to airborne PAHs and birth weight, birth length, and birth head circumference, respectively, in Krakow, Poland, and New York City (NYC). Methods: The parallel prospective cohort studies enrolled nonsmoking, healthy, and nonoccupationally exposed women and their newborns. Personal air monitoring of pregnant women was conducted over 48 hr. To control for maternal environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure, we excluded those with umbilical cord plasma cotinine concentrations &gt; 25 ng/mL. Mean cord plasma cotinine concentrations in both ethnic groups were ≤ 0.5 ng/mL. Results: Prenatal PAH exposure was 10-fold higher in Krakow than in NYC. Prenatal PAH exposure was associated with significantly reduced birth weight in both Krakow Caucasians (p &lt; 0.01) and in NYC African Americans (p &lt; 0.01), controlling for known and potential confounders, but not in NYC Dominicans. Within the lower exposure range common to the two cities (1.80-36.47 ng/m3), the effect per unit PAH exposure on birth weight was 6-fold greater for NYC African Americans than for Krakow Caucasians (p = 0.01). Conclusions: These results confirm the adverse reproductive effect of relatively low PAH concentrations in two populations and suggest increased susceptibility of NYC African Americans. Fetal growth impairment has been linked to child developmental and health problems. Thus, substantial health benefits would result from global reduction of PAH emissions.","Birth outcomes; Birth weight; Fetal toxicity; Personal air monitoring; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Prenatal","carcinogen; chemical mutagen; cotinine; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative; air monitoring; air pollutant; article; birth weight; body height; child development; controlled study; ethnic group; female; fetus growth; gestational age; head circumference; human; low birth weight; newborn; Poland; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; prenatal exposure; priority journal; risk factor; self report; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Air Pollutants; Birth Weight; Body Height; Female; Fetal Development; Head; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maternal Exposure; New York City; Poland; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Pregnancy; Nicotiana tabacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750848774

In the present application, the mixing matrix is parametrized in terms of the spectral indices of Galactic synchrotron and thermal dust emissions, while the free-free spectral index is prescribed by basic physics, and is thus assumed to be known. We consider simulated observations of the microwave sky with angular resolution and white stationary noise at the nominal levels for the Planck satellite, and realistic foreground emissions, with a position-dependent synchrotron spectral index. We work with two sets of Planck frequency channels: the low-frequency set, from 30 to 143 GHz, complemented with the Haslam 408 MHz map, and the high-frequency set, from 217 to 545 GHz. The concentration of intense free-free emission on the Galactic plane introduces a steep dependence of the spectral index of the global Galactic emission with Galactic latitude, close to the Galactic equator. This feature makes difficult for the CCA to recover the synchrotron spectral index in this region, given the limited angular resolution of Planck, especially at low frequencies. A cut of a narrow strip around the Galactic equator (|b| < 3°), however, allows us to overcome this problem. We show that, once this strip is removed, the CCA allows an effective foreground subtraction, with residual uncertainties inducing a minor contribution to errors on the recovered CMB power spectrum. © 2006 RAS.","Cosmic microwave background; Methods: data analysis; Techniques: image processing",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750838445

Although the ocean within each EEZ is undoubtedly an anthropogenic CO2 sink, it has been over-looked within international climate policy. In this paper I use an area-weighted scaling argument to show that the inclusion of the EEZ CO2 sink within national carbon accounts would have significant implications in tracking national greenhouse commitments to any future climate change policy initiative. The advantages and disadvantages for inclusion of the EEZ CO2 sink into global climate change policy are also explored. The most compelling argument for including the EEZ CO2 sink is that it would enhance the equity and resources among coastal nations to combat and adapt against future climate change that will inherently impact coastal nations more so than land locked nations. If included, the funds raised could be used for either monitoring or adaptive coastal infrastructure among the most vulnerable nations. On the other hand, the EEZ anthropogenic CO2 sink cannot be directly controlled by human activities and could be used as a disincentive for some developed nations to reduce fossil-fuel related greenhouse gas emissions. This may therefore dampen efforts to ultimately reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. In consideration of these arguments it is therefore suggested that an ""EEZ clause"" be added to Kyoto and any future international climate policy that explicitly excludes its use within national carbon accounts under these international climate frameworks. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly we hypothesized that a reduction of brain perfusion or a reduced cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 would lead to hyperventilation and an increased ventilatory responsiveness to CO2. We used oral indomethacin to reduce the cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 and tested the steady-state hypercapnic ventilatory response to CO2 in nine normal awake human subjects under normoxia and hyperoxia (50%O2). Ninety minutes after indomethacin ingestion, cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in the middle cerebral artery decreased to 77 ± 5% of the initial value and the average slope of CBFV response to hypercapnia was reduced to 31 of control in normoxia (1.92 versus 0.59 cm-1 s-1 mmHg-1, P &lt; 0.05) and 37%; of control in hyperoxia (1.58 versus 0.59 cm-1 s-1 mmHg-1, P &lt; 0.05). Concomitantly, indomethacin administration also caused 40-60%, increases in the slope of the mean ventilatory response to CO2 in both normoxia (1.27 ± 0.31 versus 1.76 ± 0.37 l min-1 mmHg-1, P &lt; 0.05) and hyperoxia (1.08 ± 0.22 versus 1.79 ± 0.37 l min-1 mmHg-1, P &lt; 0.05).

The problem is more complicated, especially, for urban areas located not far from these activities, due to additional contribution from the urban pollution sources. Knowledge of the distribution of airborne particulate matter into size fraction has become an increasing area of focus when examining the effects of particulate pollution. On the other hand, airborne particle concentration measurements are useful in order to assess the air pollution levels based on national and international air quality standards. These measurements are also necessary for developing air pollutants control strategies or for evaluating the effectiveness of these strategies, especially, for long periods. In this study an attempt is made in order to investigate the particle size distribution of fly ash and fugitive dust in a heavy industrialized (mining and power stations operations) area with complex terrain in the northwestern part of Greece. Parallel total suspended particulates (TSP) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μ (PM10) concentrations are analyzed. These measurements gathered from thirteen monitoring stations located in the greater area of interest. Spatial, temporal variation and trend are analyzed over the last seven years. Furthermore, the geographical variation of PM10 - TSP correlation and PM10/TSP ratio are investigated and compared to those in the literature. The analysis has indicated that a complex system of sources and meteorological conditions modulate the particulate pollution of the examined area. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.","Air quality; Lignite; Particlesize distribution; PM10; PM10/TSP ratio; Power plant; TSP","Air pollution; Air quality; Lignite; Particle size analysis; Particulate emissions; Pollution control; Airborne particulate matter; Lignite mining operations; Lignite-fired power stations; Parallel total suspended particulates (TSP); Environmental impact; lignite; air quality; atmospheric pollution; dust; fly ash; lignite; pollutant source; pollution control; rural area; suspended particulate matter; urban area; urban pollution; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality standard; article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; correlation analysis; dust; electric power plant; environmental monitoring; fly ash; geography; Greece; industrialization; meteorology; mining; particle size; particulate matter; rural area; suspended particulate matter; urban area; Air Pollutants; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Greece; Mining; Particulate Matter; Power Plants; Rural Population; Time Factors; Urban Health; Urban Population; Eurasia; Europe; Greece; Southern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750634120

In late 1970's, air quality monitoring activities were started in some major cities by individual researchers in Turkey. It was just around the 1990's that a countrywide program on continuous air pollution monitoring in major province centers and selected large towns was launched. The impact of air pollution on people depend on various factors, such as existence and magnitude of coal powered energy generation plants, type of urban heating and their efficiency, and the numbers and specifications of vehicles. In this study, current Turkish urban air quality over the turn of the Millennium (1992-2001) is studied in the light of the country's worst cities in terms of outdoor air quality, the number of upper respiratory diseases, sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia cases in these provinces reported by the state medical treatment facilities in 2001. The population that is under outdoor urban air pollution hazard was computed. A comparative analysis between the provinces that use natural gas and others that use fossil fuels was also completed in order to project monetary gains if the studied provinces will transform their indoor heating and industrial operations to be run by natural gas or other cleaner energy sources. If natural gas use in air polluted urban centers could be realized in the near future, approximately 212 to 350 million US dollars per annum could to be saved just by reducing health related problems caused by outdoor air pollution. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.","Air quality related diseases; Airquality improvement; Bronchitis; Economicgain; Pneumonia; Sinusitis; Turkishurban air","Air pollution control; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Pulmonary diseases; Respiratory system; Air pollution hazard; Air quality improvement; Air quality monitoring; Environmental quality; Urban air quality; Air quality; fossil fuel; natural gas; air quality; atmospheric pollution; environmental assessment; pollution monitoring; respiratory disease; urban pollution; air pollution; air quality; article; bronchitis; energy resource; environmental impact assessment; health care facility; health hazard; human; industry; pneumonia; population research; respiratory tract disease; sinusitis; Turkey (republic); upper respiratory tract; urban area; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Time Factors; Turkey; Urban Health; Eurasia; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750629019

While silicon technology continues to scale, researchers are investigating other novel materials, structures, and devices to introduce into future technology generations, if necessary, to extend Moore's law. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been explored as a possibility due to their excellent carrier mobility. The authors studied and compared different carbon-nanotube-based field-effect transistors (CNFETs) including Schottky-barrier (SB) CNFETs, MOS CNFETs, and state-of-the-art Si MOSFETs systematically from a circuit/system design perspective. Parasitics play a major role in the performance of CNT-based circuits. The data in this paper show that CNFET design's performance is limited by the gate overlap capacitance and the quality of nanocontacts to these promising transistors. Transient analysis of high-performing single-tube SB CNFET transistors and circuits revealed that 1-1.5 nm is the optimum CNT diameter resulting in best power-performance tradeoff for high-speed digital applications. The authors determined optimal spacing and layout of CNT arrays, an architecture that is most likely required for driving capacitive loads and interconnects in digital applications. CNTs have an intrinsic capability to improve performance, but many serious technological and experimental challenges remain that require more research to harvest their potential. © 2006 IEEE.","Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNFETs); High-performance circuits; Packing density; Parasitic resistance and capacitance; Transient analysis","Carrier mobility; CMOS integrated circuits; Digital circuits; Electric contacts; MOS devices; MOSFET devices; Schottky barrier diodes; Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors; Gate overlap capacitance; High-performance digital circuits; Packing density; Parasitic resistance; Transient analysis; Field effect transistors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750594849

We then estimated the effects of local emissions in China on the chemical budgets in other regions of the world. Likewise, we also investigated the effects of air pollution from other regions on the chemical budget over eastern China. The study shows that the column CO and NOx concentrations are also high in eastern China. The high CO and NOx concentrations produce modest levels of O3 concentrations during summer (about 40 to 50 ppbv) and very low O3 during winter (about 10 to 20 ppbv) in eastern China. The calculated NO2 column is fairly consistent from the GOME measurement. The calculated CO column is underestimated from the MOPITT measurement. One of the reasons of the underestimation of the predicted CO is due to a fact that the CO emissions were taken without considering the rapid increase of emissions from 1990 to 2000. The calculated surface O3 is consistent with the measured values, with strong seasonal variations. However, the measurement is very limited, and more measurements in eastern China will be needed. The column NO2 has a very strong seasonal variation in eastern China, with the highest concentrations during winter and the lowest concentrations during summer. The cause of this seasonal variability is mainly due to the seasonal changes in the chemical loss of NOx, which is very high in summer and very low during winter. The effects of the local emissions in China and long-range transport from other regions on the chemical distributions in eastern China are studied. The results show that NOx concentrations in eastern China are mostly caused by the local emissions in China, especially during the winter. The CO concentration over eastern China is from both the local emissions (30% to 40%) and the transport from other regions. Likewise, the CO emissions in China have an important effect on the other regions of the world, but the effect is limited in the northern hemisphere. The local emissions in China also have an important effect on surface O3 concentrations. During winter, the local emissions reduce the surface O3 concentrations by 30 to 50%. During summer, the local emissions produce about 50 to 70% of the O3 concentration in eastern China. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.","Air quality; MOZART; Ozone","carbon monoxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; chemical composition; emission; GOME; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; pollutant transport; satellite data; aerosol; air pollution; air quality; article; calculation; chemical composition; China; exhaust gas; prediction; seasonal variation; summer; telecommunication; winter; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750581620

Many methods of analgesia have been used to reduce this pain, including analgesic drugs, intraperitoneal local anesthetic, intraperitoneal saline, a gas drain, heated gas, low-pressure gas, and nitrous oxide pneumoperitoneum. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of combined low-pressure CO2 pneumoperitoneum and intraperitoneal infusion of normal saline in reducing the incidence of postoperative shoulder-tip pain. Methods: Altogether, 109 patients undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy were randomized prospectively into three groups. Patients in group A (n = 34) underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with 14 mmHg CO2 pneumoperitoneum; patients in group B (n = 37) underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with 10 mmHg CO2 pneumoperitoneum; and those in group C (n = 38) underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with 10 mmHg CO2 pneumoperitoneum in addition to intraperitoneal normal saline infusion in the right hemidiaphragmatic area. Shoulder-tip pain was recorded on a verbal rating scale 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after operation. Results: Twelve patients in group A (35.2 percent), six in group B (16.2 percent), and seven in group C (18.4 percent) complained of shoulder-tip pain. Hence, there was a significant decrease in the frequency of shoulder-tip pain in groups B and C in relation to group A, but there was no significant difference between groups B and C. The postoperative shoulder-tip pain scores were significantly reduced in group C at 6, 12, and 24 hours. The number of patients who required additional analgesics was also reduced in group C. Conclusions: Low-pressure CO2 pneumoperitoneum reduces the number of patients complaining of shoulder-tip pain and the intensity of the pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The addition of intraperitoneal normal saline infusion to low-pressure CO2 pneumoperitoneum seems to reduce the intensity but not the frequency of shoulder-tip pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. © 2006 Société Internationale de Chirurgie.",,"analgesic agent; carbon dioxide; ketoprofen; pethidine; sodium chloride; adult; aged; article; cholecystectomy; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; human; infusion; laparoscopic surgery; male; pneumoperitoneum; postoperative pain; randomized controlled trial; rating scale; shoulder pain; Adult; Aged; Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Humans; Infusions, Parenteral; Male; Middle Aged; Pain, Postoperative; Pneumoperitoneum, Artificial; Prospective Studies; Sodium Chloride",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750472379

Although biofilms are known to be less susceptible to antimicrobial drugs, little is known about their susceptibility to antimicrobial molecules produced by the innate immune system. In this study, we investigated the susceptibility of C. neoformans cells in biofilm and planktonic states to oxidative and nonoxidative antimicrobial molecules produced by phagocytic cells. The effects of various immune effector molecules on the fungal mass, metabolic activity, and architecture of C. neoformans biofilms were measured by colony counts, 2,3-bis(2-methosy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino) carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide reduction, and confocal microscopy, respectively. Biofilms were more resistant than planktonic cells to oxidative stress but remained vulnerable to cationic antimicrobial peptides. However, melanized biofilms were significantly less susceptible to antimicrobial peptides than nonmelanized biofilms. These results suggest that the biofilm phenotype increases resistance against host immune mechanisms, a phenomenon that could contribute to the ability of biofilm-forming microbes to establish persistent infections.

This system was used for the functional analysis of the A. vinelandii isc genes, whose products are involved in the maturation of [Fe-S] proteins. For this analysis, the scrX gene, contained within the sucrose catabolic regulon, was replaced by the contiguous A. vinelandii iscS, iscU, iscA, hscB, hscA, fdx, and iscX genes, resulting in duplicate genomic copies of these genes: one whose expression is directed by the normal isc regulatory elements (Pisc) and the other whose expression is directed by the scrX promoter (PscrX). Functional analysis of [Fe-S] protein maturation components was achieved by placing a mutation within a particular Pisc-controlled gene with subsequent repression of the corresponding PscrX-controlled component by growth on glucose as the carbon source. This experimental strategy was used to show that IscS, IscU, HscBA, and Fdx are essential in A. vinelandii and that their depletion results in a deficiency in the maturation of aconitase, an enzyme that requires a [4Fe-4S] cluster for its catalytic activity. Depletion of IscA results in a null growth phenotype only when cells are cultured under conditions of elevated oxygen, marking the first null phenotype associated with the loss of a bacterial IscA-type protein. Furthermore, the null growth phenotype of cells depleted of HscBA could be partially reversed by culturing cells under conditions of low oxygen. Conserved amino acid residues within IscS, IscU, and IscA that are essential for their respective functions and/or whose replacement results in a partial or complete dominant-negative growth phenotype were also identified using this system.

Location: Amazon Basin, South America. Methods: The Lund-Potsdam-Jena model (LPJ) was employed to determine responses in net primary production (NPP), heterotrophic respiration (RH), vegetation carbon (CV), soil carbon (CS), and plant functional type (PFT) composition to variations in temperature (±9 °C relative to the control), precipitation (up to 80% reduction in rainfall relative to the control) and atmospheric CO2 (± 100 p.p.m.v. relative to the control). Results: Our modelling experiments show that increases in temperature result in lower and steeper NPP and RH curves, indicating a thermal threshold at current temperature conditions. Under a combination of temperature and precipitation change, CV responds more to precipitation, while CS closely follows temperature gradients. Ecosystem thresholds, measured in terms of PFT composition stability, are surprisingly few. Simulations indicate an ecosystem threshold occurring at 80% reduction in rainfall; however, due to modelling limitations, this threshold is likely to occur at earlier drought stress conditions. Further empirical research on abiotic stress tolerance levels in tropical ecosystems must be performed in order to refine PFT descriptions used in DGVMs. Main conclusion: In evaluating simulation scenarios that promote major changes in PFT assemblage, we conclude that the 'natural' Amazonian rain forest is resilient to environmental change, particularly to decreases in temperature and precipitation. Determining to what extent anthropogenic pressures have altered this resiliency is of utmost importance in predicting the future fate of the Amazon Basin. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Amazon; Atmospheric CO2 change; Carbon storage; Climate change; Dynamic global vegetation model; Ecological thresholds; LPJ; Plant functional types; Tropical forests","carbon dioxide; climate change; ecosystem modeling; environmental effect; precipitation (climatology); temperature effect; tropical forest; Amazonia; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750376153

Based on case studies in the Netherlands, obstacles are identified in the context of urban renewal that need to be overcome if energy efficiency measures are to be implemented and space heating replaced with low-carbon technologies. The current free-market public policy instruments have not managed to address the obstacles identified in the case studies due to poor market signals, costs and payback periods, risks, and a lack of leadership on environmental targets and policies on sustainable urban renewal. The potential for stronger government intervention is examined for the effectiveness in reducing both energy consumption and CO2 generation. Legislation could produce a certain policy outcome in terms of CO2 reduction in urban renewal in the Netherlands if compliance and legitimacy are ensured, but policy consideration is also required to account for the dilemma of low-income households and the rebound effects associated with occupant behaviours.","Building stock; Carbon reduction; Energy efficiency; Housing; Public policy; Renovation; The Netherlands; Urban renewal","Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Housing; Public policy; Sustainable development; Building stocks; Carbon reduction; Renovation; The Netherlands; Urban renewal; Urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750330523

Transformation of Hg species in sediment in sites over 60 km from the mine, including marine sites in the Adriatic Sea, was measured to determine the ability of the system to transform and mobilize Hg and to produce methylmercury (MeHg). Cores from a freshwater impoundment, a brackish estuarine site, and three marine sites in the Gulf of Trieste were sectioned anaerobically, and Hg methylation and MeHg demethylation activities determined using radio-techniques (203Hg for methylation and 14C-MeHg for demethylation). Total and dissolved Hg and MeHg were determined as were other geochemical parameters. In addition, rates of SO4 reduction were determined in marine sediment using a 35S technique. Mercury was readily methylated and demethylated at all sites. Marine sediment was investigated in winter and summer with rates of Hg transformation and SO4 reduction corresponding only in winter. Methylation of Hg in summer displayed subsurface peaks that may have been influenced by bioturbation. Total Hg and MeHg were most abundant in the freshwater, estuarine, and near-shore marine sites, but dissolved pore water Hg and MeHg were highest in the estuarine region where S cycling appeared ideal for the mobilization of Hg. The impoundment sediment also seemed to be a 'hotspot' of Hg transformations. MeHg demethylation occurred via the oxidative demethylation pathway (CO2 produced from MeHg), except in surficial sediment offshore in the Gulf during winter, where sediment was more oxidizing and significant amounts of CH4 were liberated during MeHg degradation via reductive demethylation.

These changes in traits of invasive plants may also affect ecosystem processes. We conducted an outdoor pot experiment with Chinese tallow tree (Sapium sebiferum, Euphorbiaceae) seedlings from its native (Jiangsu, China, native ecotype) and introduced ranges (Texas, USA, invasive ecotype) to compare their relative performances in its native range and to examine ecotype effects on soil processes with and without fertilization. Consistent with predictions, plant (shoot and root) mass was significantly greater and leaf defoliation tended to be higher, while the root:shoot ratio was lower for the invasive ecotype relative to the native ecotype. Seasonal amounts of soil-plant system CO 2 and N2O emissions were higher for the invasive ecotype than for the native ecotype. Soil respiration rates and N2O emission increases from fertilization were also greater for the invasive ecotype than for the native ecotype, while shoot-specific respiration rates (g CO2-C g-1 C day-1) did not differ between ecotypes. Further, soil inorganic N (ammonium and nitrate) was higher, but soil total N was lower for soils with the invasive ecotype than soils with the native ecotype. Compared with native ecotypes, therefore, invasive ecotypes may have developed a competition advantage in accelerating soil processes and promoting more nitrogen uptake through soil-plant direct interaction. The results of this study suggest that soil and ecosystem processes accelerated by variation in traits of invasive plants may have implications for their invasiveness. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","CO2; Ecosystem process; EICA; Invasion; N2O; Soil-plant interaction","carbon dioxide; fertilizer; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; carbon; comparative study; defense mechanism; defoliation; ecotype; experimental study; growth rate; herbivore; invasive species; nitrogen; ornamental species; seasonal variation; seedling; soil respiration; article; comparative study; drug effect; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant; plant root; Sapium; soil; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Sapium; Soil; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Jiangsu; North America; Texas; United States; Euphorbia; Euphorbiaceae; Sapium; Triadica sebifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750209166

In order to detect the influence and context of these changes on coastal aquatic ecosystems we examined lake sediment cores from three lakes in the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica; Beall Lake, Holl Lake and 'Lake M'. Cores were sectioned at 2.5 mm intervals. Their diatom species composition was examined to detect changes in lake salinity using a diatom-salinity transfer function, and their algal pigment content was examined to detect photoautotrophic community responses to environmental change. Results showed that Holl Lake originated in a depression exposed by Holocene recession of the continental ice sheet and that Beall Lake and Lake M originated as isolated marine basins formed by changes in relative sea level. A general late Holocene trend of declining lake salinity was evident in all three lakes, interrupted by one short-term high salinity event in Beall Lake. This is consistent with a long-term positive moisture balance. This general decline in salinity has been followed by a remarkable recent rapid increase in salinity in all three lakes in the last few decades. We speculate that this rapid increase in salinity might be linked to changes taking place in the region including feedbacks resulting from decreasing sea ice extent as recorded in the nearby Law Dome ice core, and positive feedbacks in the catchments whereby reduced snow cover has led to decreased albedo, which in turn has caused increased evaporation and sublimation. Collectively these changes have shifted the lakes across a threshold from positive to negative moisture balance. A minor, but not rapid shift in the abundance of diatom pigments relative to pigments from green algae and cyanobacteria was also detected suggesting that some changes in photoautotrophic community composition have occurred. Measurements of modern nutrient levels are also higher than would be expected in Beall Lake and Holl Lake, given the extremely low sediment accumulation rates. This may be associated with a c. 300% increase in the population of Adélie penguins in the Windmill Islands recorded since the 1950s, or may a first signs of a rapid increase in catchment development and associated lake productivity as experienced in Antarctic and Arctic lakes subject to recent rapid regional warming. The most marked feature of the records is the rapid increase in salinity in all three lakes in the last few decades, which has occurred in lakes both with and without resident penguin populations. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Climate change; Diatoms; Palaeolimnology; Penguins; Pigments; Salinity; Windmill Islands","alga; climate change; core analysis; diatom; environmental change; Holocene; lacustrine deposit; lacustrine environment; nutrient; paleolimnology; photoautotrophy; pigment; salinity; sediment core; waterfowl; Antarctica; East Antarctica; Windmill Islands; algae; Bacillariophyta; Chlorophyta; Cyanobacteria; Pygoscelis adeliae; Spheniscidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750189863

Experimental melting temperature (Tm) data are presented for the aliphatic polyesters, polycaprolactone (PCL) and poly(butylene succinate) (PBS), as a function of the applied pressure of carbon dioxide. The characteristic features of the Tm versus P curve - a linear regime at modest P, followed by an abrupt transition to a second regime where Tm changes little with P - are interpreted using the Clapeyron equation for two-component, three-phase equilibrium. For PCL and PBS, as well as for other polymers, the slope of the lower pressure linear regime can be quantitatively estimated from the normal Tm, the enthalpy of fusion of the polymer, and the Henry's law coefficient for CO2 dissolved in the melt. The location of the abrupt change in slope is correlated with equivalence of the molar volumes of the compressed fluid and the Kuhn monomer unit of the polymer crystal. The method is also applicable to non-polymeric compounds which have high critical points and low solubility in the compressed fluid. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies have investigated the relationship between air pollution and preterm birth, a primary cause of infant mortality and morbidity. This analysis examined the effect of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) on preterm birth in a matched case-control study. PM2.5 and CO monitoring data from the California Air Resources Board were linked to California birth certificate data for singletons born in 1999-2000. Each birth was mapped to the closest PM monitor within 5 miles of the home address. County-level CO measures were utilised to increase sample size and maintain a representative population. After exclusion of implausible birthweight-gestation combinations, preterm birth was defined as birth occurring between 24 and 36 weeks' gestation. Each of the 10 673 preterm cases was matched to three controls of term (39-44 weeks) gestation with a similar date of last menstrual period. Based on the case's gestational age, CO and PM2.5 exposures were calculated for total pregnancy, first month of pregnancy, and last 2 weeks of pregnancy. Exposures were divided into quartiles; the lowest quartile was the reference. Because of the matched design, conditional logistic regression was used to adjust for maternal race/ethnicity, age, parity, marital status and education. High total pregnancy PM2.5 exposure was associated with a small effect on preterm birth, after adjustment for maternal factors (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.15, [95% CI 1.07, 1.24]). The odds ratio did not change after adjustment for CO. Results were similar for PM2.5 exposure during the first month of pregnancy (AOR = 1.21, 95% CI [1.12, 1.30]) and the last 2 weeks of pregnancy (AOR = 1.17, 95% CI [1.09, 1.27]). Conversely, CO exposure at any time during pregnancy was not associated with preterm birth (AORs from 0.95 to 1.00). Maternal exposure to PM2.5, but not CO, is associated with preterm birth. This analysis did not show differences by timing of exposure, although more detailed examination may be needed.","Air pollution; Carbon monoxide; Fine particulates; Preterm birth","carbon monoxide; air pollution; article; case control study; controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; human; infant; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; particulate matter; premature labor; risk factor; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Air Pollution; California; Carbon Monoxide; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Logistic Models; Maternal Exposure; Particle Size; Pregnancy; Premature Birth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750085577

However, such studies have yet to yield finer-scale, regional fluxes over the continent that can be linked to ecosystem processes and ground-based observations. The reasons for this gap are twofold: lack of atmospheric observations over the continent and model deficiencies in interpreting such observations. This paper describes a series of intensive atmospheric sampling field programmes designed as pilot experiments to bridge the observational gap over the continent and to help test and develop models to interpret these observations. We summarize recent results emerging from this work, outlining the role of the intensive atmospheric programmes in collecting CO2 data in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions. These data: (1) quantitatively establish the spatial variability of CO2 and the associated errors from neglecting this variability in models; (2) directly measure regional carbon fluxes from airmass-following experiments and (3) challenge models to reduce and account for uncertainties in atmospheric transport. We conclude with a look towards the future, outlining ways in which intensive atmospheric sampling can contribute towards advancing carbon science.

Direct budgeting puts a control volume on top of North America, balances air mass in- and outflows into the volume and solves for the surface fluxes. The flows are derived from the observations through a geostatistical interpolation technique called Kriging combined with transport fields from weather analysis. The use of CO2 vertical profiles simulated by the atmospheric transport model MOZART-2 at the planned 19 stations of the NACP network has given an estimation of the error of 0.39 GtC yr-1 within the model world. Reducing this error may be achieved through a better estimation of mass fluxes associated with convective processes affecting North America. Complementary stations in the north-west and the north-east are also needed to resolve the variability of CO2 in these regions. For instance, the addition of a single station near 52°N; 110°W is shown to decrease the estimation error to 0.34 GtC yr-1. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Munksgaard.",,"atmospheric modeling; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sink; kriging; source-sink dynamics; North America",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750048711

Estimates of dust deposition generated under four climate states provide a large range in total deposition with spatially realistic patterns; transient ocean model experiments are conducted by applying a step-function change in deposition from a current climate control. Relative to current conditions, higher dust deposition increases diatom and export production, nitrogen fixation and oceanic net CO2 uptake from the atmosphere, while reduced dust deposition has the opposite effects. Over timescales less than a decade, dust modulation of marine productivity and export is dominated by direct effects in high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll regions, where iron is the primary limiting nutrient. On longer timescales, an indirect nitrogen fixation pathway has increased importance, significantly amplifying the ocean biogeochemical response. Because dust iron input decouples carbon cycling from subsurface macronutrient supply, the ratio of the change in net ocean CO2 uptake to change in export flux is large, 0.45-0.6. Decreasing dust deposition and reduced oceanic CO2 uptake over the next century could provide a positive feedback to global warming, distinct from feedbacks associated with changes in stratification and circulation. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2006.",,"air-sea interaction; carbon dioxide; decadal variation; deposition; dust; gas exchange; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen fixation; Bacillariophyta",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750038242

In Bacillus subtilis, this pathway is positively regulated by CcpA, a global regulator of carbon metabolism genes. Transcription of the acetate kinase gene (ackA) proved to be activated as well by a second global regulatory protein, CodY. Expression of an ackA-lacZ fusion was reduced in a codY mutant strain. CodY was found to bind in vitro to two sites in the ackA promoter region and to stimulate ackA transcription in a run-off transcription assay. This is the first known case of direct positive regulation by CodY. CodY and CcpA were found to bind to neighbouring sites and their effects were additive both in vivo and in vitro. Surprisingly, positive regulation by CodY, unlike repression, responded primarily to only one type of effector molecule. That is, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) served as more potent co-activators of CodY-dependent ackA transcription than did GTP. Given the roles of CcpA and CodY in regulating genes whose products determine the metabolic fate of pyruvate, these two proteins may act together to mediate a hierarchical conversion of pyruvate to its many potential products. © 2006 The Authors.",,"acetate kinase; acetic acid; branched chain amino acid; carbon; gene product; nitrogen; phosphate acetyltransferase; protein CcpA; protein CodY; pyruvic acid; regulator protein; unclassified drug; ackA gene; amino acid metabolism; article; Bacillus subtilis; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterium culture; bacterium mutant; carbon metabolism; culture medium; enzyme activity; enzyme regulation; fusion gene; gene activation; gene control; gene expression; gene fusion; lacZ gene; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein binding; transcription regulation; Acetate Kinase; Amino Acids, Branched-Chain; Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Carbon; Deoxyribonuclease I; DNA Footprinting; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Promoter Regions, Genetic; Pyruvic Acid; Repressor Proteins; Transcription, Genetic; Bacillus subtilis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750002507

Conclusions drawn from experimental works differ when the data are grouped in a way such that the relative frequency of test conditions does not determine the emerging trends, for instance unrealistically strong CO 2-'fertilization' effects, which are in conflict with some basic ecological principles. I suggest separating three test conditions: uncoupled systems (plants not depending in a natural nutrient cycle) (I); expanding systems, in which plants are given ample space and time to explore otherwise limited resources (II); and fully coupled systems in which the natural nutrient cycling governs growth at steady-state leaf area index (LAI) and fine root renewal (III). Data for 10 type III experiments yield rather moderate effects of elevated CO2 on plant biomass production, if any. In steady-state grassland, the effects are water-related; in closed tree stands, initial effects decline rapidly with time.

Although the majority of the CDM actions which have been developed to date in Brazil are in the energy sector, an analysis of Brazil's emissions profile demonstrates that the energy sector does not have a significant share of the country's emissions. Rather that 25% and 56% of the emissions stem from Agriculture and Land Use activities, respectively. In the light of this profile, this paper re-evaluates Brazil's national Green House Gas (GHG) matrix, and attempts to highlight the potential of the Land Use and Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) CDM projects. An analysis of potential actions for improved penetration of LULUCF projects is presented, alongside key recommendations for future actions. This paper outlines how and why LULUCF projects can become the cornerstone of sustainable development policy in the North and North East region of Brazil, two of the main less developed regions in the country, totalling 62% of the country's land mass. A focus is made on three A/R projects recently development in Brazil. Through these case studies, an attempt is made to outline potential guidelines for future actions. This paper demonstrates that A/R projects have a significant potential impact on local and rural development in Brazil today. They have the potential to promote the sustainable use of forestry and soil resources. From the analysis it is clear that satisfying local community needs and commitments is a necessary prerequisite to achieving a situation where the risks associated with the issuing of the CER's (Certified Emission Reductions) could be better managed and also in line with enhanced support from the national authorities (as part of local development plans). The paper concludes that Brazil has significant potential to develop LULUCF CDM projects and that these projects can promote sustainable development through direct impact on the sustainable livelihoods of local communities over the long-term. It is recommended, in line with Brazil's current emission profile, that to realise this potential it is necessary to design a new relationship model between the key players involved in the CDM process: government agents, local stakeholders, national academia and private parties. Further it is necessary for the Federal Government to foster the LULUCF projects. Supporting actions include defining clear policies that minimise risk and/or reduce perceived risk and the promotion of multi-stakeholder involvement in the CDM project development process. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Abundant mid-trophic pelagic fish often play a central role in marine ecosystems, both as links between zooplankton and top predators and as important fishery targets. In the North Sea, the lesser sandeel occupies this position, being the main prey of many bird, mammal and fish predators and the target of a major industrial fishery. However, since 2003, sandeel landings have decreased by > 50%, and many sandeel-dependent seabirds experienced breeding failures in 2004. 2. Despite the major economic implications, current understanding of the regulation of key constituents of this ecosystem is poor. Sandeel abundance may be regulated 'bottom-up' by food abundance, often thought to be under climatic control, or 'top-down' by natural or fishery predation. We tested predictions from these two hypotheses by combining unique long-term data sets (1973-2003) on seabird breeding productivity from the Isle of May, SE Scotland, and plankton and fish larvae from the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey. We also tested whether seabird breeding productivity was more tightly linked to sandeel biomass or quality (size) of individual fish. 3. The biomass of larval sandeels increased two- to threefold over the study period and was positively associated with proxies of the abundance of their plankton prey. Breeding productivity of four seabirds bringing multiple prey items to their offspring was positively related to sandeel larval biomass with a 1-year lag, indicating dependence on 1-year-old fish, but in one species bringing individual fish it was strongly associated with the size of adult sandeels. 4. These links are consistent with bottom-up ecosystem regulation and, with evidence from previous studies, indicate how climate-driven changes in plankton communities can affect top predators and potentially human fisheries through the dynamics of key mid-trophic fish. However, the failing recruitment to adult sandeel stocks and the exceptionally low seabird breeding productivity in 2004 were not associated with low sandeel larval biomass in 2003, so other mechanisms (e.g. predation, lack of suitable food after metamorphosis) must have been important in this case. Understanding ecosystem regulation is extremely important for predicting the fate of keystone species, such as sandeels, and their predators. © 2006 The Authors.","Ammodytes marinus; Ecosystem function; Sandeel; Seabirds; Trophic structure","bottom-up control; food web; marine ecosystem; pelagic fish; predator-prey interaction; reproductive success; seabird; top-down control; animal; article; Atlantic Ocean; biomass; bird; copepod; diatom; fish; food chain; physiology; plankton; predation; time; Animals; Biomass; Birds; Copepoda; Diatoms; Fishes; Food Chain; North Sea; Plankton; Predatory Behavior; Time Factors; Eurasia; Europe; Fife; Isle of May; Scotland; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Ammodytes marinus; Aves; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749657228

Harvest residues were formed into windrows to prevent nitrogen (N) losses through volatilisation and erosion that occurred following pile and burn operations in hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii Aiton ex A. Cunn.) plantations of subtropical Australia. We selected second rotation (2R) hoop pine sites where the windrows (10-15 m apart) had been formed 1, 2 and 3 years prior to sampling in order to examine soil carbon (C) and N in the areas beneath and between the windrows. Methods. We used conventional chemical methods, anaerobic incubation assay, 13C and 15N natural abundance analyses and, solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Results. Percent mineralisable N (PCMN) was the only parameter in the underneath windrow position at the Year 1 site that did not show a significant difference to the rest of the positions along the transect. However, positions adjacent to windrows did have significantly greater PCMN at the Year 1 site than other positions along the transect. PCMN, total N and total C were significantly greater underneath the windrows at the Year 3 site, whilst δ13C was significantly more negative in the underneath windrow positions. Discussion. PCMN was the most sensitive biological indicator of the changes occurring in the soil due to decomposition of the windrows, with the beneath-windrow position having a significantly higher PCMN than the inter-windrow position (p&lt;0.001) at the Year 3 site. Isotopic natural abundance for both 13C and 15N was able to detect the influx of labile materials from new residues. Solid-state 13C NMR was able to detect inputs of labile C from the windrows at the Year 1 site, whilst the increase in aromatic C at the Year 3 site was indicative of the more advanced stages of windrow decomposition. Conclusions. Decomposition of windrowed residues had a beneficial effect on soil N and C pools. However, the effect remained localised after 3 years, indicating that trees needed to be planted close to the windrows to gain any benefit from residue decomposition. Recommendations and Perspectives. The use of windrows allows a clear planting area and provides a good barrier against soil erosion. However, trees can only gain access to the nutrients from the decomposing residues if they are planted close to the windrows. Limiting the width of the cleared areas to allow for only 2 planting rows will give the maximum benefit to the developing trees. © 2006 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Australia; Hoop pine; Plantations; Residue management; Soil C and N; Subtropical; Windrows","bioindicator; decomposition; plantation forestry; soil carbon; soil erosion; soil nitrogen; subtropical region; Australasia; Australia; Araucaria cunninghamii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749638553

The model is then estimated on the panel data of China's 29 provinces' industrial SO2 emission. Result shows that, exerting through different channels, the total impact of FDI on industrial SO2 emission is very small. With 1% increase in FDI capital stock, industrial SO2 emission will increase by 0.098%, in which the emission increase caused by impact of FDI on economic growth and composition transformation cancels out the emission reduction result due to FDI's impact in reinforcing environmental regulation. By introducing to the simultaneous system the recursive dynamism that supposes FDI entry decision to depend on last period's economic growth and environmental regulation stringency, our model also provides convincing supportive evidences for 'pollution haven' hypothesis. Although FDI enterprises in China generally produce with higher pollution efficiency, the rise in environmental regulation stringency still has modest deterrent effect on FDI capital inflow. Furthermore, the composition transformation impact of FDI in China seems to be dominated by the inflow of foreign capital pursuing a 'production platform' that provides lower pollution regulation compliance cost. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The housing data sets, which describe trends in housing demolition, rehabilitation, window replacement, and lead paint, are the American Housing Survey, the Residential Energy Consumption Survey, and the National Lead Paint Survey. Blood lead data are principally from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. New data now make it possible to validate the midpoint of the forecast time period. For the year 2000, the model predicted 23.3 million pre-1960 housing units with lead paint hazards, compared to an empirical HUD estimate of 20.6 million units. Further, the model predicted 498,000 children with elevated blood lead levels (EBL) in 2000, compared to a CDC empirical estimate of 434,000. The model predictions were well within 95% confidence intervals of empirical estimates for both residential lead paint hazard and blood lead outcome measures. The model shows that window replacement explains a large part of the dramatic reduction in lead poisoning that occurred from 1990 to 2000. Here, the construction of the model is described and updated through 2010 using new data. Further declines in childhood lead poisoning are achievable, but the goal of eliminating children's blood lead levels ≥10 μg/dL by 2010 is unlikely to be achieved without additional action.

The high-cell density reactor steady-state levels of carbon source (glycerol), biotransformation substrate (crotonobetaine), acetate (anaerobiosis product) and fumarate (as an electron acceptor) were pulsed by increasing them fivefold. Following the pulse, the evolution of the enzyme activities involved in the biotransformation process of crotonobetaine into l(-)-carnitine (crotonobetaine hydration), in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA (ACS: acetyl-CoA synthetase and PTA: ATP: acetate phosphotransferase) and in the distribution of metabolites for the tricarboxylic acid (ICDH: isocitrate dehydrogenase) and glyoxylate (ICL: isocitrate lyase) cycles was monitored. In addition, the levels of carnitine, the cell ATP content and the NADH/NAD+ ratio were measured in order to assess the importance and participation of these energetic coenzymes in the catabolic system. The results provided an experimental demonstration of the important role of the glyoxylate shunt during biotransformation and the need for high levels of ATP to maintain metabolite transport and biotransformation. Moreover, the results obtained for the NADH/NAD+ pool indicated that it is correlated with the biotransformation process at the NAD+ regeneration and ATP production level in anaerobiosis. More importantly, a linear correlation between the NADH/NAD+ ratio and the levels of the ICDH and ICL (carbon and electron flows) and the PTA and ACS (acetate and ATP production and acetyl-CoA synthesis) activity levels was assessed. The main metabolic pathway operating during cell metabolic perturbation with a pulse of glycerol and acetate in the high-cell density membrane reactor was that related to ICDH and ICL, both regulating the carbon metabolism, together with PTA and ACS enzymes (regulating ATP production). © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Important results in terms of XRD, SEM, absorption spectra, PL and EL spectra, voltage and frequency dependence of EL brightness are presented. Also, EL brightness waves, EL decay and dependence of EL brightness on nature of electrode material are presented and discussed. SEM studies show best growth conditions in the presence of CdCl2. Results of XRD studies are associated to ZnS and CdS. Both the studies show average particle sizes to be in the nano order. PL and EL emissions from different films show emission peaks in the blue-green region. Results of absorption spectra show a slight change in band gaps owing to the addition of impurities. Voltage dependence of EL brightness shows effectiveness of acceleration-collision mechanism. Frequency dependence of EL brightness first shows an increase in brightness in the lower frequency range, followed by saturation at higher frequencies. Brightness waves consist of primary and secondary waves, which depend on voltage and frequency of excitation. EL cells with Al electrode give better brightness compared with cells with Ag electrodes. The lifetimes of EL emission are found to be of the order of microseconds.","Blue emission; Chemical deposition; Nanocrystalline; Spray-pyrolysis; Thin film; Zinc sulfide","Blue emission; Chemical deposition; Spray pyrolysis; Electroluminescence; Metallic films; Photoluminescence; Pyrolysis; Thin films; Zinc sulfide; Nanostructured materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749467986

Predicted changes in climate point to a continuation of the recent observed trends in increased precipitation and high-flow events in Northern Europe. 2 The study focused on the dispersal characteristics of M. guttatus, and especially the roles of vegetative fragmentation with increasing water velocities, subsequent fragment survival, regeneration and colonization, as well as the buoyancy, survival and germination success of seeds. 3 M. guttatus was found to fragment readily under velocities typical of high flow conditions and even small fragments had high survival, regeneration and colonization capacity. 4 Large numbers of small (< 0.02 mg) seeds are produced; however, seeds have a short buoyancy period so the timing and magnitude of high-flow events is crucial in determining potential dispersal distances. Seeds germinate readily both in water and on sand with an average 33% germination within 9 days. 5 The dual strategy of dispersal by vegetative fragments and seeds, together with the opportunity of dispersing the two types of propagules during different periods of the year, facilitates local dominance by M. guttatus as well as long-distance colonization. As a result, the rate of spread of M. guttatus into inundation communities along rivers is likely to increase with more frequent high-flow events, especially if these coincide with the growing season. Thus, predicting the response of riparian invasive species to environmental change requires not only an understanding of the role of climate in plant demography but also the impact of changes in hydrology on rates of spread. © 2006 The Authors.","Biological invasion; Climate change; Flooding; Fragment; Regeneration; Riparian; Spread","climate change; dispersal; invasive species; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Mimulus guttatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749452147

The stratigraphic section has 10 zones of pedogenesis that are distinguishable by pedogenic humus and other features, and consequently by the character of ancient soil forming processes. We found that most of the sediments accumulated in an environment where serozem soils form, that is, in an arid subtropical landscape (desert-steppe zone). The scheme of the altitudinal landscape sequence and the structure of the soil cover also changed according to climatic changes, and regular displacements of the altitude zones occurred. When analogs of modern dark serozems dominated near the site, the altitude sequence was characterized by the most complexity, with humid as well as arid landscapes occupying areas of the slopes. Climatic change trends both to humidity and to aridity simplified the altitude scheme: when climate was arid, humid landscapes were ousted (mountain brown forest soils occurred only on the slope tops). In contrast, when climate was humid, arid landscapes disappeared from the altitude sequence, and forest and meadow zones were dominant. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"climate change; humus; paleoclimate; pedogenesis; Pleistocene; proxy climate record; sediment property; Asia; Eurasia; Tien Shan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749432598

Thus, an exact correlation between the CO2 mass signal and the current density in the voltammogram corresponding to the formic acid oxidation has been obtained. On palladium modified Pt(100) electrodes and in the potential region below 0.3 V, the currents in the positive scan are higher than those recorded in the negative scan. This diminution on the signal in the negative scan has been associated with CO2 reduction to CO on the palladium adlayer.

With these ligands, three series of lanthanide(III) complexes were prepared: [Ln(L1)2(NO3)2]NO3, [Ln(L2)2(NO3)2(H2O)2]NO3·H2O and [Ln(L3)2(NO3)2(H2O)2]NO3·H2O (Ln = La, Sm, Eu, Gd).

In this study, we use the remote sensing model C-Fix at the local stand scale to improve the integration of algorithms for water and temperature limitation. These new algorithms are applied to estimate net ecosystem productivity in a fully water limited mode. Four different C-Fix scenarios (partially and fully water limited, partially and fully water limited with temperature conversion), to obtain net ecosystem productivity of European forests, were compared with EUROFLUX measurements using different statistics. In the first scenario (i) C-Fix is partially water limited since the NDVI is used as indicator for the fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (fAPAR). The NDVI depends on plant water availability at the long term (months). In the fully water limited C-Fix scenario (ii) short-term water availability is included taking into account soil moisture content. The third (iii) and fourth (iv) scenarios are respectively the partially and fully water limited scenarios wherein canopy and soil temperature, derived from the atmospheric temperature, are incorporated to account for the temperature driven processes of vegetation and soil. The error propagation by C-Fix was also analysed. Introducing water limitation and converting atmospheric temperature to apparent canopy and soil temperatures, significantly improves validation results based on EUROFLUX data. For pooled data, a final slope, intercept and correlation coefficient of the linear regression between C-Fix and EUROFLUX NEP values is 0.86, 0.09 and 0.64, respectively. When implementing full water limitation a reduction of 42% of the estimated NEP is obtained with respect to partially limited NEP. The error propagation by C-Fix for the partially and fully water limited cases and when applying temperature buffering, are similar. Respectively, an average daily NEP of 0.69 ± 0.4 and 0.40 ± 0.3 g C m-2 d-1. Due to the combination of simple semi-empirical approaches, inclusion of full water limitation into C-Fix enhances the application field of a remote sensing based model with potential in regional, continental and global dry matter estimations and in carbon uptake/release studies, although a more physically based support is recommended to convert atmospheric temperature to soil and canopy temperature and to estimate fAPAR. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, mono- and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (MAHs and PAHs, respectively) emission tests were performed with a heavy-duty diesel engine, fueled with pure diesel (D) and biodiesel blends (v/v) of 2% (B2), 5% (B5) and 20% (B20%). The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of the biodiesel addition on the emission profile of MAHs and PAHs. The tests were conducted using a six cylinder heavy-duty engine, typical of the Brazilian fleet of urban buses, in a steady-state condition under 1500 rpm. The PAHs were sampled with Teflon filters and XAD-2 cartridges and were identified by gaseous chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC/MS) and quantified by flame ionization detection (GC/FID). The MAHs were sampled with active charcoal cartridges and analyzed by GC/FID. Both MAHs and PAHs filters and cartridges were extracted with dichloromethane in an ultrasonic bath. Ten PAHs and eight MAHs were identified and the average reduction of MAHs was 4.2% (B5), 8.2% (B5), and 21.1% (B20). The average reduction for PAHs was 2.7% (B2), 6.3% (B5), and 17.2% (B20). However, some PAHs and MAHs emissions increased because of/due to the biodiesel blends like phenanthrene, ethyl benzene, and trimethyl benzenes. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We previously showed that AhR localizes predominantly in the cytoplasm under high cell densities of a keratinocytes cell line, HaCaT, but accumulates in the nucleus at low cell densities. In the current report, we show that the Slug, which is a member of the snail/slug family of zinc finger transcriptional repressors critical for induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT), is activated transcriptionally in accordance with nuclear accumulation of AhR. By reporter assay of the promoter of the Slug gene, gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed AhR directly binds to xenobiotic responsive element 5 at - 0.7 kb of the gene. AhR-targeted gene silencing by small interfering RNA duplexes led to the abolishment of not only CYP1A1 but also Slug induction by 3-methycholanthrene. The Slug was co-localized to the AhR at the wound margins of HaCaT cells, where apparent nuclear distribution of AhR and Slug was observed. The induced Slug was associated with reduction of an epithelial marker of cytokeratin-18 and with an increase in the mesenchymal marker, fibronectin. Taken together, these findings suggest that AhR participated in Slug induction, which, in turn, regulates cellular physiology including cell adhesion and migration. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

It is especially the case in many developed countries, where the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for this change are mainly concentrated. For the first time, the Kyoto Protocol includes an international agreement for the reduction of the net emissions of these gases. To fulfil this agreement measures designed to reduce or limit current emissions have to be brought into force. Consequently, fears have arisen about possible consequences on competitiveness and future development of manufacturing activities and the need for support mechanisms for the affected sectors is obvious. In this paper, we carry out a study of the emissions of gases responsible for climate change in Asturias (Spain), a region with an important economic presence of sectors with intensive emissions of CO2, the chief greenhouse gas. To be precise, in the first place, the volumes of direct emissions of the said gases in 1995 were calculated, showing that the sectors most affected by the Kyoto Protocol in Asturias are iron and steel and electricity production. Secondly, input-output analysis was applied to determine the direct and indirect emissions and the direct, indirect and induced emissions of the different production sectors, respectively. The results derived from the direct and indirect emissions analysis and their comparison with the results of the former allow us to reach some conclusions and environmental policy implications. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, a waste treatment structure should be designed for an efficient saving of fossil primary energy in terms of maximal primary energy savings or minimal costs per unit of primary energy savings. However, this is a complex task, given the large number of technologies, recycling options and their logistic consequences, that necessitate an integrated analysis. Also, on longer term various new and improved technologies become available which can affect performances for options from an economic and/or energy point of view. For that reason, an optimisation tool, that optimises a biomass and waste treatment system for a given amount of biomass and waste, is developed in this study. This optimal biomass and waste treatment system is composed of several treatment installations, that are characterised by scale, location and kind of technology. Important aspects that are taken into account in the analysis are heat distribution, biomass and waste transport and economies of scale. A broad variety of technologies for material recycling, conversion of biomass and/or waste to heat, electricity or transportation fuel are included in the optimisation tool. Performance data of these technologies are based on an extensive review. Examples of included technologies comprise: integrated gasification with combined cycle, waste incineration, pyrolysis, digestion, co-firing in fossil power plants, biomass incineration, hydro-thermal upgrading, paper recycling and chipboard production. A comparison of the different technologies in relation to scale shows that primary energy savings and costs per unit of primary energy savings diverge significantly. In general, the optimisation tool developed here is suitable for analyses of optimal biomass and waste treatment structures in different regions with regard to primary energy savings and their costs. By means of scenario analysis, robust optimal solutions in terms of primary energy savings and their costs can be identified and the influence of important parameters can be analysed. A case study of the Dutch biomass and waste treatment systems has been carried out with the optimisation tool and is presented in part two of this article. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This study evaluated the vertical distribution and overall sequestration of SOC and total nitrogen (N) under warm-season native grasses (WSNGs) planted 6-8 years earlier relative to a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.) crop sequence, and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) relative to tall mixed grasses of big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi), indiangrass (Sorghastrum nutans), and little bluestem (Andropogon scoparius). Paired soil samples from 0-15, 15-30, 30-60 and 60-100 cm depth increments were taken from WSNGs and adjoining croplands at 10 locations, and from switchgrass and adjoining tall mixed grasses at four locations in three major soil types of alfisols, mollisols, and entisols in Montgomery County, Indiana. Significant differences in SOC and N concentrations of WSNGs and croplands were limited to the surface 30 cm. On average, SOC concentrations in the surface 15 cm depth were higher in WSNGs than croplands (average: 22.4 and 19.8 g kg-1 C, respectively) but significant differences were observed in just 4 of 10 locations. Similarly, surface soil SOC concentrations were not different for switchgrass (22.1 g kg-1) relative to tall mixed grasses (21.4 g kg-1). Soil N concentrations never differed significantly among land use treatments. On average, SOC mass calculated to 1.0 m depth was 9.4% higher under WSNGs than cropland (P &lt; 0.058), and 8.1% higher in switchgrass relative to tall mixed grass (P &lt; 0.054), but soil N mass was the same for both WSNGs and cropland. Vertical distribution under WSNGs of SOC mass was 26, 21, 28, and 25%, and of total N mass was 31, 25, 28 and 16%, in the 0-15, 15-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm depth intervals, respectively. Even though we acknowledge the potential influence of soil variability or prior landscape processes on our results at some locations, we estimated that WSNGs sequestered an average 2.1 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 more than the corn-soybean sequence. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The target AQM stations were selected to represent both highly urbanized locations in seven major cities (i.e., urban traffic (A) and urban background (B)) and relatively remote locations in nine major provinces (suburban background (C) and rural background (D)) in Korea. As such, the mean concentrations of SO2 were clearly distinguished both between the A- and B-type stations and between the C- and D-type stations. The mean concentration levels of SO2 in the A-type stations were approximately 18% higher than those of the B-type stations; it was found that the concentration of the former ranged from 7.94 ppb (Seoul) to 14.2 ppb (Ulsan), and the latter from 5.43 ppb (Gwangju) to 12.8 ppb (Ulsan). Likewise, there were many distinctions between the C-and D-type stations. The mean concentrations of the C-type stations varied from 3.88 ppb (Jeju) to 8.50 ppb (Jeonnam), while those of the D-type stations from 1.47 ppb (Jeju) to 4.76 ppb (Gangwon). Comparison of seasonal patterns indicated that the SO2 values tend to peak consistently during the winter (or spring) months, regardless of station types. When the SO2 data were compared on a long-term basis throughout the whole study period, the patterns generally exhibited a gradual and systematic decrease for most study sites. However, the patterns for such annual changes tended to differ between major urban (A and B) and suburban station pairs (C and D). It was found that such decreasing trends were more clear in the former pair than in the latter. The overall results of our analysis from diverse AQM station types indicate that the distribution characteristics of SO2 may have been controlled rather sensitively through time by social and environmental changes which forced the reduction of SO2 emissions. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Once applied, biosolids are incorporated into soils by disking and the aerosols produced during this process may pose an airborne toxicological and infectious health hazard to biosolids workers and nearby residents. Field studies at a Central Arizona biosolids land application site were conducted to characterize the physical, chemical, and biological content of the aerosols produced during biosolids disking and the content of bulk biosolids and soils from which the aerosols emanate. Arrayed samplers were used to estimate the vertical source aerosol concentration profile to enable plume height and associated source emission rate calculations. Source aerosol concentrations and calculated emission rates reveal that disking is a substantial source of biosolids-derived aerosols. The biosolids emission rate during disking ranged from 9.91 to 27.25 mg s-1 and was greater than previously measured emission rates produced during the spreading of dewatered biosolids or the spraying of liquid biosolids. Adding biosolids to dry soils increased the moisture content and reduced the total PM10 emissions produced during disking by at least three times. The combination of bulk biosolids and aerosol measurements along with PM10 concentrations provides a framework for estimating aerosol concentrations and emission rates by reconstruction. This framework serves to eliminate the difficulty and inherent limitations associated with monitoring low aerosol concentrations of toxic compounds and pathogens, and can promote an increased understanding of the associated biosolids aerosol health risks to workers and nearby residents. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The primary breakdown product of metam sodium in soil is methyl isothiocyanate (MITC), an active pesticidal agent with a high toxicity and a great potential for volatilization. Reducing atmospheric emissions of MITC is therefore critical to maintain air quality. The objective of this study was to examine the rate and efficiency of conversion of metam sodium to MITC in soil and to investigate the potential of using surface water sealing to reduce MITC emissions. The conversion of metam sodium to MITC was a rapid abiotic decomposition process. At typical field application rates, the conversion efficiency depended on the initial content of metam sodium in soil, but was independent of soil moisture, soil type, and soil atmospheric conditions. A soil column system was used to measure the emission and distribution of MITC after subsurface and surface application of metam sodium. Volatilization flux and cumulative emission loss of MITC was substantially reduced with surface water sealing compared to uncovered soil columns after subsurface application of metam sodium. When metam sodium was surface applied in simulated chemigation, surface water sealing was ineffective, suggesting the need for additional emissions reduction practices when metam sodium is broadcast. Overall, the results of the column experiment indicate that surface water sealing with subsurface application of metam sodium may be an effective and economical strategy to reduce MITC emissions while maintaining pest control efficacy. © 2006.","Conversion; Emission reduction; Fumigant; Metam sodium; MITC; Surface water sealing","Decomposition; Particulate emissions; Surface waters; Toxicity; Vaporization; Conversion; Emission reduction; Fumigant; Metam sodium; MITC; Surface water sealing; Fumigation; metham sodium; methylisothiocyanate; pesticide; surface water; unclassified drug; air quality; decomposition; fumigant; soil column; soil emission; soil moisture; toxicity; volatilization; air pollution; air temperature; article; atmospheric deposition; decomposition; environmental impact; experimentation; pest control; priority journal; productivity; soil; soil analysis; soil moisture; soil pollution; surface property; volatilization; water treatment; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748778203

The LF sites investigated in this study are distinguished in that the young LF (namely, YLF) was selected to represent a site of active RSC emissions, while the old LF (namely, OLF) was selected for its weak RSC emissions. The LFG composition, when analyzed for a number of RSCs (hydrogen sulfide (H2S), methyl mercaptan (CH3SH), dimethyl sulfide ((CH3)2S), carbon disulfide (CS2) and dimethyl disulfide ((CH3)2S2)), was consistently predominated by H2S from both sites. The mean and SD value of H2S in the YLF were measured to be 139,070±144,340 ppb, while its counterparts in the OLF being 3.86±3.41 ppb. The emission concentration levels of H2S were found to be distinguished from those of the other RSCs, depending on the LF aging. The H2S results for both LF sites, when compared across seasons, were generally characterized as notable enhancement during summer relative to other seasons. The comparative analysis of relative composition between RSCs and other LFG constituents (such as CH4, CO2, and VOC) consistently indicate that the relative proportion of RSCs is substantially larger during the active LF stage (YLF) than in the inactive one (OLF). © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This work examines several different strategies for improving bearing performance. The first strategy was fibre steering (directed fibre placement). Three different methods were used to determine the trajectories for the steered fibres, referred to as the principal stress method, the load path method and the genetic algorithm method. In the principal stress method the fibre trajectories were determined from the major (tensile), s11, and minor (compressive), s22, principal stresses. An improvement of 36% in bearing strength was obtained using a modified principal stress pattern in which the s11 trajectories were displaced 5 mm away from the bearing-loaded hole to reduce fibre waviness which resulted from local overcrowding of the s11 and s 22 tows directly beneath the bearing surface. In the load path method, the steered fibre trajectories followed the dominant load path. A similar improvement in bearing strength of 33% was obtained using this method. Moreover, it was found that the load path method provided surplus reinforcement against net section failure and it was possible to more than double the efficiency of carbon laminate joints by reducing the ratio of joint width to bolthole diameter w/d from the standard value of 5 to a more compact 2.5, while simultaneously maintaining the bearing strength of the laminate. The third method employed an optimisation technique in which a genetic algorithm was used to determine the trajectories for the steered fibres. The trajectories obtained were intermediate between those from the principal stress method and those from the load path method. Matrix stiffening using nanoreinforcement was also examined. In this part of the work montmorillonite clay at loadings of 7.5 and 12.5 parts per hundred resin was incorporated into the matrix resin. While the addition of the clay nanoparticles substantially stiffened the neat resin, its incorporation into the composite laminates did not increase the bearing strength due to the introduction of an alternative, premature failure mode. The incorporation of the nanoparticles did however stiffen the bearing response, indicating that the method could produce improved bearing strength if premature failure could be avoided. Through thickness reinforcement using z-pins was also examined by inserting carbon fibre z-pins, at an aerial density of 4%, locally in the vicinity of the bearing-loaded hole. This technique increased the ultimate bearing load by 7%. However this did not translate into improved bearing strength because of local thickening of the laminate in the z-pinned region due to the presence of surplus resin displaced by the z-pins. It is considered that local thickening could be readily avoided by using a caul plate in the vicinity of the z-pinned region, thereby allowing the potential of this technique to be realised. © 2006.","Bearing; Directed fibre placement; Fibre steering; Genetic algorithm; Nanocomposites; z-Pinning","Bearing capacity; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Compressive stress; Genetic algorithms; Nanostructured materials; Optimization; Stiffness matrix; Tensile stress; Directed fibre replacement; Fibre steering; Laminated composites; carbon fiber; fiber reinforced composite; laminate; mathematical analysis; methodology; nanocomposite; strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747851334

This paper presents three alternative methods for answering this question, each of which is conceptually sound and sums to the same national total, yet each produces very different estimates of individual state emissions. These differences result from alternative assumptions taken to account for emissions associated with interstate electricity trade-power, and hence emissions, produced in one state but consumed in another. The methods described here demonstrate large effects that alternative methodological choices can have on our understanding of a state's carbon emissions levels, and on the incentive structures for states to enact supply and/or demand-side carbon reduction policies. Of the three methodologies, one is characteristic of standard carbon emissions accounting practice, one of life-cycle assessment, and one is an integrated approach, of which I argue that it is superior because it registers state carbon emissions change arising from change in both electricity production and consumption, thus creating incentive for states to enact a full range of progressive energy policies. Though developed here at the state scale, the issues engaged are relevant to carbon analysis and policy formation at scales ranging from the local to the international. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

PAGE2002 considers the possibility of large-scale discontinuities, a major concern in the IPCC TAR. PAGE2002 estimates the mean value of the marginal impact for CO2 under scenario A2 to be $19 per tonne of carbon (tC), equivalent to $5 per tonne of CO2. The 95% and 5% values for the marginal impact are $49/tC and $5/tC. The mean value under scenario B2 is estimated to be $14/tC, with 95% and 5% points as $41/tC and $3/tC, respectively. The marginal impact is sensitive to the pure rate of time preference, and doubles for a 1% reduction from 3% to 2%. Additionally, adaptation policy affects the marginal impact estimates; they increase by 50% if no adaptation policy is implemented. Benefits from reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will affect the globe as a whole, but with various regions being more affected than others. Developing countries would receive about 50% of the benefit, whereas the European Union's benefits would be about 7%; only about 2% of the benefits would be felt in the USA. Benefits from an immediate reduction in CO2 emissions peak around the year 2100. About 60% of the benefits from reducing greenhouse gas emissions are non-economic, with economic and large-scale discontinuities being about 20% each. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite its considerable scope, the authors found that officially sponsored research and academic efforts in support of ETS were surprisingly limited. Importantly, in advance of implementation, a definitive consensus on both the potential economic impact and the usefulness of the Scheme in reducing the GHG emissions had not been reached. Reviewing the literature, the authors encountered varying and, at times, conflicting viewpoints, officially and in academic research, on the potential economic impact of the Scheme. These included attempts to quantify its benefits and costs, raising concern that this huge and encompassing multi-national policy initiative may have been launched with inadequate intellectual ground-work. According to the authors consistency between the ETS and other EU policies, such as those relating to energy, should have been a key concern, but such aspects have received only minimal attention in both official and academic research. The European Commission has promoted open and competitive markets for gas and power across member states, but the record in achieving such conditions is relatively poor and the authors argue that, as a result, the environmental objectives of the EU Scheme may not be thwarted. In addition, continuing disagreement over the Kyoto Agreement itself-especially with regard to its potential costs and benefits-further frustrates efforts to rigorously justify a policy in support of reducing GHG emissions. The authors argue that, given the scope of the EU Scheme, the paucity of research evidencing that it is likely to succeed in reducing GHG emissions in the form of CO2 is surprising and should be of concern to those affected by it along with environmental campaigners, many of whom are enthusiastic supporters. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Typically, the AEEI rate is set to 0.5-1.5% improvement per annum. Here, we study historic aggregate energy intensity trends for the US from 1954 to 1994. We show that the historic trends are inconsistent with an autonomous model of improved energy efficiency-especially when the model is used to inform policies that impact energy prices. As an alternative we propose a model of price-induced efficiency, π, in which aggregate energy intensity trends respond to changes in energy prices beyond price elasticity of demand ε. Our exercise reveals that the aggregate price elasticity of energy demand of the US economy has declined by roughly 15% over the past four decades. But beyond this decline, bringing our simulations and historical data into close correspondence requires π to change sign before and after 1974. Before 1974, after accounting for price elasticity of demand, the economy was growing less energy efficient. After 1974, after accounting for the price elasticity of demand, the economy was growing more energy efficient. Furthermore, since 1984, the rate of energy efficiency gain has been declining. When projections of long-term energy use are compared, those with a price-induced energy efficiency formulation generate significantly more price sensitive energy use and emissions trajectories. When in the business as usual scenario energy prices are expected to be rising, climate policies involve lower shadow carbon prices with π than with AEEI formulations. In scenarios where energy prices are relatively flat, energy intensity rises leading to CO2 emissions far higher than standard business as usual projections utilizing AEEI assumptions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of the survey was to clarify the status of energy consumption and to estimate emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants in rural areas of China, from the environmental perspective of climate change and indoor to continental scale air pollution. In rural areas of China, biomass (wood and agricultural waste, such as stalks, corn canes and twigs, branches of wood) is the type of fuel most commonly used. It emits several air pollutants: particulate matter (PM), CO, NMHCs, CH4 and high levels of black carbon (BC) - a greenhouse effect aerosol, and organic carbon (OC) - a cooling effect aerosol. However, CO2 emissions from biomass burning are assumed to be zero because of carbon neutrality.

In a typical FC system, various alloys are used in hydrogen environments and are subjected to cyclic loading due to pressurization, mechanical vibrations, etc. The materials investigated were three austenitic stainless steels (SUS304, SUS316 and SUS316L), one ferritic stainless steel (SUS405), one martensitic stainless steel (0.7C-13Cr), a Cr-Mo martensitic steel (SCM435) and an annealed medium-carbon steel (0.47C). In order to simulate the pick-up of hydrogen in service, the specimens were charged with hydrogen. The fatigue crack growth behavior of charged specimens of SUS304, SUS316, SUS316L and SUS405 was compared with that of specimens which had not been hydrogen-charged. The comparison showed that there was a degradation in fatigue crack growth resistance due to hydrogen in the cases of SUS304 and SUS316 austenitic stainless steels. However, SUS316L and SUS405 showed little, if any, degradation due to hydrogen. The results of S-N testing showed that in the cases of the 0.7C-13Cr stainless steel and the Cr-Mo steel a marked decrease in fatigue resistance due to hydrogen occurred. In the case of the medium carbon steel hydrogen did not cause a reduction in fatigue behavior. Examination of the slip band characteristics of a number of the alloys showed that slip was more localized in the case of hydrogen-charged specimens. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Four orthogonal canonical discriminant functions were used to describe the realized climate space for British Columbia's ecosystems and to model portions of the realized niche space for tree species under current and predicted future climates. This conceptually simple model is capable of predicting species ranges at high spatial resolutions far beyond the study area, including outlying populations and southern range limits for many species. We analyzed how the realized climate space of current ecosystems changes in extent, elevation, and spatial distribution under climate change scenarios and evaluated the implications for potential tree species habitat. Tree species with their northern range limit in British Columbia gain potential habitat at a pace of at least 100 km per decade, common hardwoods appear to be generally unaffected by climate change, and some of the most important conifer species in British Columbia are expected to lose a large portion of their suitable habitat. The extent of spatial redistribution of realized climate space for ecosystems is considerable, with currently important sub-boreal and montane climate regions rapidly disappearing. Local predictions of changes to tree species frequencies were generated as a basis for systematic surveys of biological response to climate change. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Bioclimatic analysis; British Columbia; Climate change; Climate envelope; Predictive vegetation mapping; Spatial predictions; Species distributions and ranges","canonical analysis; climate change; community structure; environmental effect; habitat availability; niche; population distribution; spatial resolution; tree; article; biological model; Canada; climate; demography; discriminant analysis; ecosystem; physiology; tree; weather; British Columbia; Climate; Demography; Discriminant Analysis; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Trees; Weather; British Columbia; Canada; North America; Coniferophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746040671

The adoption of carbon/pollution taxes both internationally and regionally has been fueled by global climate change and fuel security risks, with a significant portion of such policy interventions directed at the electric power industry. The general framework that we develop allows for three distinct types of carbon taxation environmental policies, beginning with a completely decentralized scheme in which taxes can be applied to each individual power generator/power plant in order to guarantee that each assigned emission bound is not exceeded, to two versions of a centralized scheme, one which assumes a fixed bound over the entire electric power supply chain in terms of total carbon emissions and the other which allows the bound to be a function of the tax. The behavior of the various decision-makers in the electric power supply chain network is described, along with the three taxation schemes, and the governing equilibrium conditions, which are formulated as finite-dimensional variational inequality problems. Twelve numerical examples are presented in which the optimal carbon taxes, as well as the equilibrium electric power flows and demands, are computed. The numerical results demonstrate, as the theory predicts, that the carbon taxes achieve the desired goal, in that the imposed bounds on the carbon emissions are not exceeded. Moreover, they illustrate the spectrum of scenarios that can be explored in terms of changes in the bounds on the carbon emissions; changes in emission factors; changes in the demand price functions, etc. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

One such technology is the O2/CO2 combustion process (also termed oxy-fuel combustion) that combines a conventional combustion process with a cryogenic air separation process so that the fuel is burned in oxygen and recycled flue gas, yielding a high concentration of CO2 in the flue gas, which reduces the cost for its capture. In this work, the O2/CO2 process is applied using commercial data from an 865 MWe lignite fired reference power plant and large air separation units (ASU). A detailed design of the flue gas treatment pass, integrated in the overall process layout, is proposed. The essential components and energy streams of the two processes have been investigated in order to evaluate the possibilities for process integration and to determine the net efficiency of the capture plant. The electricity generation cost and the associated avoidance cost for the capture plant have been determined and compared to the reference plant with investment costs obtained directly from industry. Although an existing reference power plant forms the basis of the work, the study is directed towards a new state of the art lignite fired O2/CO2 power plant. The boiler power of the O2/CO2 plant has been increased to keep the net output of the capture and the reference plant similar. With the integration possibilities identified, the net efficiency becomes 33.5%, which should be compared to 42.6% in the reference plant. With a lignite price of 5.2 $/MW h and an interest rate of 10%, the electricity generation cost increases from 42.1 to 64.3 $/MW h, which corresponds to a CO2 avoidance cost of 26 $/ton CO2. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

While ecological indicators are used to assess ecosystem health, vulnerability, risk and damage to ecosystems, their primary focus has been on changes to the mean of the ecological state or process. Little work has been done on incorporating variability into ecological indices. The methodology developed here is based on the Modified Levene's test of variance and a moving block where an initial time period (block) of ecosystem behavior is compared to the moving block. This allows for the detection of not only shifts in variance but also the magnitude of the shift on a continuous basis. Our results compared well with the benchmarked results from the Centered Cumulative Sum of Squares Algorithm (CUSUM) for detection of variance changes in fixed time series. The output from this methodology is a continuous stream of parameters (significant variance shift, magnitude of the shift, and the direction of the variance shift) suitable for indexing variance or integrating into an index measuring ecosystem change. Results suggest that the block interval widths should be at least 50 and that a smoothing factor of five be used to avoid false positives. We used modeled vegetation carbon output to analyze the utility of the methodology, illustrating that different model assumptions and CO2 regimes affect the variability of the ecological response. The degree of risk resource managers may want to explore can be altered by choices in the block length, the length of the string used to smooth variance shifts, the assumption that the initial period has constant variance and the alpha levels used to determine statistical significance.","Change point detection; Cumulative sum of squares; Indexing variance; Moving block methodology; Variance shift","Algorithms; Carbon; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Statistical methods; Change point detection; Cumulative sum of squares; Ecological indicators; Ecosystem health; Indexing variance; Moving block methodology; Variance shift; Climate change; carbon dioxide; climate change; ecosystem health; statistical analysis; variance analysis; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745814434

Measurements of local instantaneous and average temperatures, heat fluxes and gas composition at several locations inside the furnace were carried out. It was observed that the HiTAC flame with highly reduced temperature fluctuations, turbulent intensity and combustion intensity have a larger reaction zone than a conventional flame. This large flame emits more thermal radiation in spite of its uniform and reduced temperature. Furthermore, the convective heat transfer was found to be uniform and as high as 30% of the total heat transfer to an object surface in the furnace. On the other hand, the very high reduction of NOx emission is a consequence of the low temperature and temperature fluctuation levels of the HiTAC flames.

The government attempts to use three regulation measures to protect air quality from transportation emission. The measures include the aggregate limit (bubbles), the vehicle emission standard, and the fuel quality standard. Especially, we focus on the economic impact of reducing sulfur content in diesel fuel quality standard. Sulfur content in diesel fuel is one of the main factors in worsening local air quality. The emission from diesel vehicle accounts for 51.8% of total vehicle emission in Korea. If sulfur content reduction regulation is implemented, then the petroleum industry should build more facility to produce low sulfur content diesel, leading to additional production costs and increasing prices and decreasing outputs. We use computable general equilibrium model to analyze how the sulfur reduction regulation affects economic activities and trace out local emission reduction cost and GDP loss. And we suggest the tax-recycling mechanism to mitigate the negative economic costs due to the sulfur reduction regulation. © 2004.","Regulation on fuel quality and emission; Transportation","Diesel fuels; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Fuel purification; Petroleum transportation; Quality function deployment; Economic impact; Fuel quality; Regulation-reducing sulfur content; Regulatory compliance; air quality; diesel; economic impact; emission control; pollution policy; traffic emission; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646934096

It is observed that under natural exposure environments, the carbonation rate is the highest when specimens are exposed in the city. The decreased ratio of water to binder and fly ash content leads to a better carbonation resistance. For the same fly ash content, specimens of high-CaO fly ash show a better carbonation resistance than those of low CaO fly ash. However, when compared at an equal strength, the effect of the type of fly ash on carbonation becomes insignificant. When comparing the carbonation results of concrete and mortar specimens, results of mortar show similar trends as those of concrete. However, the test results on mortar are worse by the use of fly ash than those of concrete. In addition, the carbonation tests in an accelerated environment are also conducted. It is found that there exist strong relations between carbonation depths of concrete exposed in natural and in accelerated environments.

This study investigated the effects of soil structure and its interaction with soil water content on C mineralization. Dry aggregate samples (0-2, 2-4, 4-8, 8-16 mm) obtained from agricultural field (AGRIC) and an adjacent less-disturbed area maintained under prairie vegetation (PRAIRIE) were subjected to a short-term incubation where soil water was maintained at four gravimetric water contents ranging from 5% to 50%. More water was needed to maximize C mineralization in larger sized aggregates supporting the notion that biological activity is located at the surface of aggregates or within pores located adjacent to their surface. Mean C mineralization rate was 54% greater from the PRAIRIE than the AGRIC soils, which contained 66.1 and 24.9 mg SOC g- 1 soil, respectively. However, mean specific C mineralization rates (mg C-CO2 / mg-SOC ) were 45% lower from the PRAIRIE than from the AGRIC treatment, suggesting that physical protection of SOC was greater in that soil. The greater volume of macropores (&gt; 300 μm) in the PRAIRIE aggregates may have contributed to its accumulation of humified SOC by limiting microbial usage of C in air filled pores. The volume of water holding pores (&lt; 30 μm), which was lower in the aggregates from the PRAIRE than AGRIC treatment, was saturated in the PRAIRE aggregates at the wettest treatment. As a result, localized anaerobism restricted C mineralization in the PRAIRE but not in the AGRIC aggregates where water holding pores were not yet saturated. Differences in size distribution of pores in aggregates collected from the two soils considered affected the physical availability of substrates and optimum soil water conditions for biological activity. By considering macropores as regions of where C decay is restricted and by assessing the status of pores &lt; 30 μm (water held at - 10 kPa), we can better understand spatial constraints on C mineralization. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

In the present work, the mabA-encoded MabA has been cloned, expressed, and purified to homogeneity. Initial velocity studies, product inhibition, and primary deuterium kinetic isotope effects suggested a steady-state random bi-bi kinetic mechanism for the MabA-catalyzed reaction. The magnitudes of the primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect indicated that the C4-proS hydrogen is transferred from the pyridine nucleotide and that this transfer contributes modestly to the rate-limiting step of the reaction. The pH-rate profiles demonstrated groups with pK values of 6.9 and 8.0, important for binding of NADPH, and with pK values of 8.8 and 9.6, important for binding of AcAcCoA and for catalysis, respectively. Temperature studies were employed to determine the activation energy of the reaction. Solvent kinetic isotope effects and proton inventory analysis established that a single proton is transferred in a partially rate-limiting step and that the mechanism of carbonyl reduction is probably concerted. The observation of an inverse D2OV/K and an increase in D2OV when [4S-2H]NADPH was the varied substrate obscured the distinction between stepwise and concerted mechanisms; however, the latter was further supported by the pH dependence of the primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect. Kinetic and chemical mechanisms for the MabA-catalyzed reaction are proposed on the basis of the experimental data. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Activation energy; Bacteria; Catalysis; Deuterium; Fatty acids; Reaction kinetics; Reduction; Acyl carrier protein (ACP); Elongation systems; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Nucleotides; Enzyme kinetics; 3 hydroxyacyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase; 3 oxoacyl acyl carrier protein reductase; bacterial enzyme; deuterium; DNA fragment; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; unclassified drug; article; bacterial gene; catalysis; enzyme activity; enzyme assay; enzyme kinetics; gene expression; molecular cloning; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; tuberculosis; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Molecular Structure; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Oxidation-Reduction; Substrate Specificity; Temperature; Mycobacterium tuberculosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751103454

The results confirm the large uncertainty in climate change scenarios and freshwater impacts due to the choice of general circulation model (GCM). This uncertainty is shown to be greatest during summer months as evidenced by large variations between GCM-derived projections of future low river flows, deployable yield from groundwater, severity of nutrient flushing episodes, and long-term trends in surface water quality.

While the former is perhaps better known and more commonly taught in school, we now know that comet and asteroid dust deliver tons of organics to the Earth every day, therefore this flux of reduced carbon from space probably also played a role in making the Earth habitable. We will compare and contrast the types and abundances of organics from on and off the Earth given standard assumptions. Perhaps each process provided specific compounds (amino acids, sugars, amphiphiles) that were directly related to the origin or early evolution of life.

In order to quantitatively assess the contributions of various sources to carbonaceous aerosol in Hong Kong, a chemical mass balance (CMB) receptor model in combination with organic tracers was employed. Organic tracers including n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), steranes, hopanes, resin acids, cholesterol, levoglucosan, and picene in PM2.5 collected from three air monitoring sites located at roadside, urban, and rural areas in Hong Kong are quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in the present study. Analyses of some overlapping species from two separate laboratories will be compared for the first time. Spatial and seasonal source contributions to organic carbon (OC) in PM2.5 from up to nine air pollution sources are assessed, including diesel engine exhaust, gasoline engine exhaust, meat cooking, cigarette smoke, biomass burning, road dust, vegetative detritus, coal combustion, and natural gas combustion. Diesel engine exhaust dominated fine organic carbon in Hong Kong (57 ± 13% at urban sites and 25 ± 2% at the rural site). Other sources that play an important role are meat cooking and biomass burning, which can account for as much as 14% of fine organic carbon. The primary sources identified by this technique explained 49%, 79%, and 94% of the measured fine organic carbon mass concentration at the rural, the urban, and the roadside sites, respectively. The unexplained fine OC is likely due to secondary organic aerosol formation.

Coastal development and ecosystems in the Pacific Islands region are particularly vulnerable to climate change effects. We investigated the capacity of Pacific Island countries and territories to assess mangrove vulnerability to the effects of climate change, and their capacity to adapt to mangrove responses to these forces. Technical and institutional capacity-building priorities include: (1) strengthening management frameworks to conduct site-specific assessment of mangrove vulnerability and incorporate resulting information into land-use plans to prepare for any landward mangrove migration and offsetting anticipated losses; (2) reducing and eliminating stresses on and rehabilitating mangroves, in part, to increase mangrove resilience to climate change effects; and (3) augmenting abilities to establish mangrove baselines, and monitor gradual changes using standardized techniques through a regional network to distinguish local and climate change effects on mangroves. Other priorities are to: (4) assess how mangrove margins have changed over recent decades; (5) determine projections of trends in mean relative sea level and trends in the frequency and elevation of extreme high water events; (6) measure trends in changes in elevations of mangrove surfaces; and (7) incorporate this information into land-use planning processes. Also in (8) some locations require spatial imagery showing topography and locations of mangroves and coastal development. Land-use planners can use information from assessments predicting shoreline responses to projected sea level rise and other climate change effects to reduce risks to coastal development, human safety, and coastal ecosystems. This advanced planning enables coastal managers to minimize social disruption and cost, minimize losses of valued coastal ecosystems, and maximize available options. © Inter-Research 2006.","Climate change; Land-use planning; Mangrove; Pacific Islands; Sea level rise","Climate change; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Land use; Planning; Sea level; Vegetation; climate change; climate effect; coastal development; land use planning; mangrove; marine ecosystem; sea level change; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751562565

The analysis of the electroabsorption spectra indicates that the dipole moment in the first exciton state becomes larger with increasing particle size. The presence of the large dipole moment following photoexcitation into the first exciton band suggests that the CdS nanoparticles have large CT character in the first exciton state. The quantum yields both of the exciton emission and of the trap emission are markedly reduced by application of an electric field. On the basis of the direct measurements of the field-induced change in emission decay profile, it is suggested that the field-induced de-enhancement of these emission yields results from the field-induced decreases both in lifetime and in initial population of each emitting state. It is also found that the emission intensity of CdS nanoparticles increases under the UV light irradiation in air and decreases in a vacuum condition and that fluorescence lifetime in the former case is longer than that in the latter. This enhancement and de-enhancement process in emission intensity is almost reversible at least in several cycles. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Cadmium sulfide; Doping (additives); Electric field effects; Emission spectroscopy; Excitons; Plastic films; Electric field modulation spectroscopy; Electroabsorption spectra; Nanoparticles; Photoexcitation; Nanostructured materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751296475

Why is the sky blue? Why do people react favorably to mountain or sea air? How does desert air differ from the air of California's Central Valley? How is air pollution affecting plants and animals? This book is a unique guide to the air we breathe in California. More than a natural history guide, it approaches this fascinating topic by recognizing the overwhelming role played by humans in the story of California's air. In a highly engaging style, David Carle explains daily weather patterns, seasonal climate, characteristic winds, and sky phenomena. He explores air as the gases in our atmosphere, but also considers the aspects of air that influence all of our senses-its taste, smell, feel, and look. The guide discusses California's history of air quality management, air pollution and its effect on humans and the environment, and the technological and individual measures needed to address these challenges. The book also functions as a handbook for more environmentally conscious living by providing information on alternative energy sources for consumers and tips for cleaner running cars.

Here, we evaluate the reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions that can be achieved by improving heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) technologies. Results: The Climate Change Research Hall (CCRH) of the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) is used as a case study. CCRH was built in line with the ""Green Government Buildings"" program of the Government Buildings Department at the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport in Japan. We have assessed the technology used in this building, and found that there is a possibility to reduce energy consumption in the HVAC system by 30%. Conclusion: Saving energy reduces CO2 emissions in the commercial sector, although emission factors depend on the country or region. Consequently, energy savings potential may serve as a criterion in selecting HVAC technologies with respect to emission reduction targets. © 2006 Yoshida; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248382838

N.E., Atlanta, GA 30322, United States","The RNA-binding protein CsrA (carbon storage regulator) of Escherichia coli is a global regulator of gene expression and is representative of the CsrA/RsmA family of bacterial proteins. These proteins act by regulating mRNA translation and stability and are antagonized by binding to small noncoding RNAs. Although the RNA target sequence and structure for CsrA binding have been well defined, little information exists concerning the protein requirements for RNA recognition. The three-dimensional structures of three CsrA/RsmA proteins were recently solved, revealing a novel protein fold consisting of two interdigitated monomers. Here, we performed comprehensive alanine-scanning mutagenesis on csrA of E. coli and tested the 58 resulting mutants for regulation of glycogen accumulation, motility, and biofilm formation. Quantitative effects of these mutations on expression of glgCA'-'lacZ, flhDC'-'lacZ, and pgaA'-'lacZ translational fusions were also examined, and eight of the mutant proteins were purified and tested for RNA binding. These studies identified two regions of the amino acid sequence that were critical for regulation and RNA binding, located within the first (β1, residues 2-7) and containing the last (β5, residues 40-47) β-strands of CsrA. The β1 and β5 strands of opposite monomers lie adjacent and parallel to each other in the three-dimensional structure of this protein. Given the symmetry of the CsrA dimer, these findings imply that two distinct RNA binding surfaces or functional subdomains lie on opposite sides of the protein. © 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Glycogen accumulation; Mutant proteins; RNA binding; Escherichia coli; Molecular structure; Monomers; RNA; Mutagenesis; alanine; beta galactosidase; glycogen; monomer; mutant protein; protein csra; RNA binding protein; unclassified drug; amino acid sequence; article; biofilm; controlled study; Escherichia coli; mutagenesis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein purification; protein structure; quantitative analysis; RNA binding; Amino Acid Sequence; beta-Galactosidase; Escherichia coli Proteins; Glycogen; Kinetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis; Mutation; Protein Biosynthesis; Protein Folding; Protein Structure, Secondary; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Repressor Proteins; RNA; RNA-Binding Proteins; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Yersinia enterocolitica; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846009817

This study focuses on double-layered ejecta (DLE) craters. To date, over 100 DLE craters have been examined using mainly THEMIS VIS data. Our observations suggest that emplacement of DLE crater ejecta occurred in two stages, with the inner ejecta layer emplaced similar to single-layered ejecta (SLE) crater ejecta. This may have involved both ballistic and flow processes. In contrast, the outer ejecta layer of DLE craters appears to have been emplaced through the high-velocity outflow of materials from tornadic winds generated by the advancing ejecta curtain or base surge. Remarkably, DLE craters lack secondary craters, which suggests that the large ejecta blocks that normally produce such craters may have either been entrained and/or crushed by these winds or fragmented as a result of the presence of water in the target materials. These observations suggest that volatiles (either trapped in the subsurface or in the atmosphere) have played a key role in the emplacement of the ejecta of DLE craters and leaves open the question as to what role volatiles play in the emplacement of ejecta of other types of fluidized ejecta craters (i.e., SLE and MLE craters). Because DLE craters are found in many different regions of Mars, often in close proximity to other types of craters, conditions (e.g., atmospheric density) that produce DLE craters must fluctuate or the Martian crust must be unexpectedly heterogeneous (laterally and vertically). While the degree of heterogeneity has yet to be recognized, recent suggestions about possible Martian climate change raises the possibility of impact into target materials that are periodically wet or that a significantly higher atmospheric pressure may be periodically present.

Available climate observations and information are also changing as technological advances take place. Accordingly, an overview is given of a much-needed potential climate information system that embraces a comprehensive observing system to observe and track changes and the forcings of the system as they occur, and that develops the ability to relate one to the other and understand changes and their origins. Observations need to be taken in ways that satisfy the climate monitoring principles and ensure long-term continuity, and that have the ability to discern small but persistent signals. Some benchmark observations are proposed to anchor space-based observations and trends, including a much-needed step forward in the quality of water vapor observations. Satellite observations must be calibrated and validated, with orbital decay and drift effects fully dealt with if possible, and adequate overlap to ensure continuity. The health of the monitoring system must be tracked and resources identified to address issues. Fields must be analyzed into global products and delivered to users while stakeholder needs are fully considered. Data should be appropriately archived with full and open access, along with metadata that fully describe the observing system status and environment in which it operates. Reanalysis of the records must be institutionalized along with continual assessment of impacts of new observing and analysis systems. Some products will be used to validate and improve models, as well as initialize models and predict future evolution on multiple time scales using ensembles. Attribution of changes to causes is essential, and it is vital to fully assess past changes and model performance and results in making predictions to help appraise reliability and assess impacts regionally on the environment, human activities, and sectors of the economy. In particular, a revolution in the way developing countries use and apply climate information is expected. Such a system will be invaluable and further provides a framework for setting priorities of new observations and related activities.

Boren Blvd., Norman, OK 73072-7304, United States","Since the late 1960s, the West African Sudan-Sahel zone (10°-18°N) has experienced persistent and often severe drought, which is among the most undisputed and largest regional climate changes in the last half-century. Previous documentation of the drought generally has used monthly, seasonal, and annual rainfall totals and departures, in a standard ""climate"" approach that overlooks the underlying weather system variability. Most Sudan-Sahel rainfall occurs during June-September and is delivered by westward-propagating, linear-type, mesoscale convective systems [disturbance lines (DLs)] that typically have much longer north-south (102-103 km) than east-west (10-102 km) dimensions. Here, a large set of daily rainfall data is analyzed to relate DL and regional climate variability on intraseasonal-to-multidecadal time scales for 1951-98. Rain gauge-based indices of DL frequency, size, and intensity are evaluated on a daily basis for four 440-km square ""catchments"" that extend across most of the West African Sudan-Sahel (18°W-4°E) and are then distilled into 1951-98 time series of 10-day and seasonal frequency/magnitude summary statistics. This approach is validated using Tropical Applications of Meteorology Using Satellite Data (TAMSAT) satellite IR cold cloud duration statistics for the same 1995-98 DLs. Results obtained for all four catchments are remarkably similar on each time scale. Long-term (1951-98) average DL size/organization increases monotonically from early June to late August and then decreases strongly during September. In contrast, average DL intensity maximizes 10-30 days earlier than DL size/organization and is distributed more symmetrically within the rainy season for all catchments except the westernmost, where DL intensity tracks DL size/organization very closely. Intraseasonal and interannual DL variability is documented using sets of very deficient (8) and much more abundant (7) rainy seasons during 1951-98. The predominant mode of rainfall extremes involves near-season-long suppression or enhancement of the seasonal cycles of DL size/ organization and intensity, especially during the late July-late August rainy season peak. Other extreme seasons result solely from peak season anomalies. On the multidecadal scale, the dramatic decline in seasonal rainfall totals from the early 1950s to the mid-1980s is shown to result from pronounced downtrends in DL size/organization and intensity. Surprisingly, this DL shrinking-fragmentation-weakening is not accompanied by increases in catchment rainless days (i.e., total DL absence). Like the seasonal rainfall totals, DL size/organization and intensity increase slightly after the mid-1980s. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"Catchments; Climate change; Drought; Rain; Statistics; Weather forecasting; Cloud duration statistics; Shrinking-fragmentation-weakening; Weather system variability; West African Sudan-Sahel zone; Meteorology; catchment; climate change; climate variation; drought; rainfall; satellite data; satellite imagery; trend analysis; Africa; East Africa; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; Sub-Saharan Africa; Sudan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750812762

The ecohydrology of rangelands is defined by the interaction of soils, plants and climate occurring on a topographic surface. While these interactions have been studied for subtle terrain, little is known about the controls exerted by terrain position, in particular terrain aspect, on ecosystem processes. Furthermore, differential plant establishment can lead to measurable differences in rates of soil development, which in turn can affect soil hydraulic properties and the surface water balance. In this study, we outline the physical mechanisms affecting plant establishment, soil development and hydrologic fluxes in semiarid complex terrain. We illustrate the interactions between vegetation, root zone water fluxes and soil development using, as an example, a small drainage basin in the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge (SNWR), New Mexico. In the study basin, opposing hillslopes are characterized by marked differences in ecosystem composition and soil profile properties, with the north-facing hillslope dominated by one seed juniper (Juniperus monosperma) and the south-facing slope consisting of creosote bush (Larrea tridentata). We assess the effect of terrain aspect on root zone hydrologic fluxes and soil development in the two ecosystems by using soil observations, hydraulic properties from pedotransfer functions (PTFs), and numerical modelling of vadose zone fluxes. Modelling results show marked differences in root zone fluxes in the north-facing juniper and south-facing creosote ecosystems. Differences in the amplitude and frequency of soil water content and pressure correspond to changes in soil profile and vegetation characteristics. For example, soil properties of the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) horizons and differential plant water uptake impact the simulated soil water pressure over an 8-year period in the opposing ecosystems. It is believed that these variations in water fluxes reinforce the development of CaCO3 horizons present in the soil profiles, leading to a feedback between vegetation establishment, soil water fluxes and geomorphic processes in the catchment. Our results also indicate that soil properties and water fluxes compensate for large differences in evaporative demand and lead to similar actual evapotranspiration (AET) in the opposing slopes.

Allen Road, Tucson, AZ 85719, United States","Key to evaluating the consequences of woody plant encroachment on water and carbon cycling in semiarid ecosystems is a mechanistic understanding of how biological and non-biological processes influence water loss to the atmosphere. To better understand how precipitation is partitioned into the components of evapotranspiration (bare-soil evaporation and plant transpiration) and their relationship to plant uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) as well as ecosystem respiratory efflux, we measured whole plant transpiration, evapotranspiration, and CO2 fluxes over the course of a growing season at a semiarid Chihuahuan Desert shrubland site in south-eastern Arizona. Whole plant transpiration was measured using the heat balance sap-flow method, while evapotranspiration and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 were quantified using the Bowen ratio technique. Before the summer rainy season began, all water and CO2 fluxes were small. At the onset of the rainy season, evapotranspiration was dominated by evaporation and CO2 fluxes were dominated by respiration as it took approximately 10 days for the shrubs to respond to the higher soil moisture content. During the growing season, periods immediately following rain events (&lt;2 days) were dominated by evaporation and respiration while transpiration and CO2 uptake peaked during the interstorm periods. The surface of the coarse, well-drained soils dried quickly, rapidly reducing evaporation. Overall, the ratio of total transpiration to evapotranspiration was 58%, but it was around 70% during the months when the plants were active. Peak respiration responses following rain events generally lagged after the evaporation peak by a couple of days and were better correlated with transpiration. Transpiration and CO2 uptake also decayed rather quickly during interstorm periods, indicating that optimal plant soil moisture conditions were rarely encountered. NEE of CO2 was increasingly more negative as the growing season progressed, indicating a greater net uptake of CO2 and greater water use efficiency due mainly to decreases in respiration.

One of the precursors used is tributylphosphine sulfide; the other one is elemental sulfur. The growth kinetics is studied at various temperatures to estimate the activation energy for the formation of CdS nanocrystals from the temperature dependence of model kinetic parameters. The different sulfur precursors lead to different trends in the limiting nanocrystal radii and the time-constant of growth. The obtained nanocrystals are characterized by UV-absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy, electrophoresis, X-ray powder diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. The nanocrystals prepared from tributylphosphine sulfide have fewer surface defects and their spectra exhibit a band-edge emission only. In this case the limiting radii of the nanocrystals increase with increasing the temperature of growth. The nanocrystals synthesized from elemental sulfur show in addition a trap-state emission due to much more surface defects. Here the limiting radii of nanocrystals decrease with increasing temperature in contrast to the previous case. In both cases, the semiconductor nanocrystals can be sterically and electrostatically stabilized in non-polar organic solvents by post-capping with tributylphosphine. Our findings are important for the controlled manufacturing of CdS nanocrystals with pre-determined properties and their utilization in a variety of optical devices. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This information was then used as a basis for Hg emission scenario development until the year 2020. Combustion of coal in power plants and residential heat furnaces generates about half of the European emissions being 239 tonnes. The coal combustion is followed by the production of caustic soda with the use of the Hg cell process (17%). Major points of mercury emission generation in the mercury cell process include: by-product hydrogen stream, end box ventilation air, and cell room ventilation air. This technology is now being changed to other caustic soda production technologies and further reduction of Hg emissions is expected in this connection. The third category on the list of the largest Hg emitters in Europe is cement production (about 13%). The largest emissions were estimated for Russia (the European part of the country), contributing with about 27% to the European emissions, followed by Poland, Germany, Spain, Ukraine, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. Most of these countries use coal as a major source of energy in order to meet the electricity and heat demands. In general, countries in the Central and Eastern Europe generated the main part of the European emissions in 2000. Emission reductions between 20% and 80% of the 2000 emission amounts can be obtained by the year 2020, as estimated by various scenarios. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

It was found that the ambient O3 concentration levels had little effect on stomatal conductance. However, the accumulated stomatal uptake of O3, upon reaching a threshold value on any given day, appears to reduce the rate of further O3 uptake substantially. This may explain why the maximum O3 deposition velocity often appeared in the early morning hours over some forest canopies. Substantially reduced CO2 fluxes over wet canopies compared to dry canopies suggest that stomata were likely partially or totally blocked by water droplets or films when canopies were wet. By using a big-leaf dry deposition model, measured O3 fluxes were separated into stomatal and non-stomatal portions. It was estimated that stomatal uptake contributed 55-75% of the total daytime O3 fluxes and 40-60% of the total daytime plus nighttime fluxes, depending on canopy type. This suggests that about half of the total O3 flux occurred through the non-stomatal pathway. At three locations (deciduous forest, corn and soybean sites), O3 concentrations of 30-60 ppb and of 60-85 ppb contributed equally to the accumulated stomatal fluxes, while at the other two locations (mixed coniferous-deciduous forest and pasture sites), concentrations of 30-60 ppb contributed twice as much as those from 60 to 85 ppb. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The dendrimers consist of a substituted PA core surrounded by meta-branched PA arms. The total number of PA moieties ranges from 3 (first generation) to 63 (fifth generation). By using an alcohol/ketone substituent at the dendrimer core, we avoid through-space Forster transfer from the peripheral PA donors to the core acceptor (in this case, the carbonyl group), which simplifies the analysis of these molecules relative to the perylene-terminated molecules studied previously. The delocalized excited states previously identified in smaller dendrons are seen in these larger dendrimers as well, and their influence on the intersite electronic energy transfer (EET) is analyzed in terms of a point-dipole Forster model. We find that these new delocalized states can both enhance EET (by decreasing the spatial separation between donor and acceptor) and degrade it (by lowering the emission cross section and shifting the energy, resulting in poorer spectral overlap between donor and acceptor). The combination of these two effects leads to a calculated intersite transfer time of 6 ps, in reasonable agreement with the 5-17 ps range obtained from experiment. In addition to characterizing the electronic states and intersite energy transfer times, we also examine how the overall light-harvesting efficiency scales with dendrimer size. After taking the size dependence of other nonradiative processes, such as excimer formation, into account, the overall dendrimer quenching rate kQ is found to decrease exponentially with dendrimer size over the first four generations. This exponential decrease is predicted by simple theoretical considerations and by kinetic models, but the dependence on generation is steeper than expected based on those models, probably due to increased disorder in the larger dendrimers. We discuss the implications of these results for dendrimeric light-harvesting structures based on PA and other chemical motifs. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Alcohols; Energy transfer; Excitons; Light; Molecular structure; Substitution reactions; Delocalized excited states; Light harvesting structures; Phenylacetylene dendrimers; Photophysics; Dendrimers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750353924

The approaches include simple extrapolation with elevation from the nearest climate station; nine variations of weighted-average methods employing three approaches to calculate lapse rates, two methods for station selection and three approaches for weight calculation; multiple linear regression using station coordinates as predictor variables; a method combining multiple regression and weighted averaging. Cross-validation for years with different densities and elevational distribution of climate stations showed varied mean prediction errors, which also depended on elevation and month. Methods that compute local lapse rates from the control points performed better for years for which there were a greater number of higher-elevation stations, which allowed for better estimation of lapse rates. The methods that involved specified lapse rates all performed similarly, indicating that the method for selecting control stations and for calculating weights have less effect on predictive accuracy than the method for accounting for elevation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

With 1/12° resolution, these model climatologies begin to resolve the coastal circulation and it is appropriate to ask whether they are adequate to replace observational climatologies. We compare circulation climatologies derived from a z coordinate 36 vertical layer model, run with three different diffusivities with an observational climatology (CSIRO Atlas of Regional Seas, CARS), and with surface velocities derived from Lagrangian drifters deployed under the Global Drifter Program (GDP). All the climatologies capture the major features in the mean circulation. South of the Chatham Rise, and east of New Zealand, the model climatologies agree better with GDP than does CARS. North of the Chatham Rise, the models overestimate the strength of the East Cape Eddy. Wave number spectra from the models suggest that instability processes which are important in the mean are captured with diffusion less than 25 m2 s-1. The model with lowest diffusion may be providing the best estimate of the mean circulation, but at the expense of numerical instability.

The primary mover of this generator is a carbonate fuel cell. The fuel cell uses alkali metal carbonate mixtures as electrolyte and operates at ∼650 °C. Corrosion of the cell hardware and stability of the ceramic components have been important design considerations in the early stages of development. The material and electrolyte choices are founded on extensive fundamental research carried out around the world in the 60s and early 70s. The cell components were developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The present day carbonate fuel cell construction employs commonly available stainless steels. The electrodes are based on nickel and well-established manufacturing processes. Manufacturing process development, scale-up, stack tests, and pilot system tests dominated throughout the 1990s. Commercial product development efforts began in late 1990s leading to prototype field tests beginning in the current decade leading to commercial customer applications. Cost reduction has been an integral part of the product effort. Cost-competitive product designs have evolved as a result. Approximately half a dozen teams around the world are pursuing carbonate fuel cell product development. The power plant development efforts to date have mainly focused on several hundred kW (submegawatt) to megawatt-class plants. Almost 40 submegawatt units have been operating at customer sites in the US, Europe, and Asia. Several of these units are operating on renewable bio-fuels. A 1 MW unit is operating on the digester gas from a municipal wastewater treatment plant in Seattle, Washington (US). Presently, there are a total of approximately 10 MW capacity carbonate fuel cell power plants installed around the world. Carbonate fuel cell products are also being developed to operate on coal-derived gases, diesel, and other logistic fuels. Innovative carbonate fuel cell/turbine hybrid power plant designs promising record energy conversion efficiencies approaching 75% have also emerged. This paper will review the historical development of this unique technology from milliwatt-scale laboratory cells to present megawatt-scale commercial power plants. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The thin film was deposited onto the glass by magnetron-sputtering using carbon steel targets in an Ar atmosphere. The physical properties of fabricated thin films were investigated by the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, adhesion test and Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). To ensure that the thin film could replicate the corrosion behavior of a bulk steel, the electrochemical polarization tests were performed. It was revealed that the adhesion strength and the electrochemical behaviors of thin films were comparable to those of the bulk steel by controlling the oxygen level in the films during the deposition process. A sensitive thin film electrical resistance (TFER) sensor could be fabricated with this film and the enhanced sensitivity enables quick measurement of the corrosion rate. The TFER sensor with the multiple-line pattern showed the enhanced sensitivity to localized corrosion phenomena. It was demonstrated that this method could be a reliable tool for corrosion monitoring. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report that male mice lacking transaldolase (TAL)-/- are sterile because of defective forward motility. TAL-/- spermatozoa show loss of Δψm and mitochondrial membrane integrity because of diminished NADPH, NADH, and GSH. Mitochondria constitute major Ca2+ stores; thus, diminished mitochondrial mass accounts for reduced Ca2+ fluxing, defective forward motility, and infertility. Reduced forward progression of TAL-deficient spermatozoa is associated with diminished mitochondrial reactive oxygen intermediate production and Ca2+ levels, intracellular acidosis, and compensatory down-regulation of carbonic anhydrase IV and overexpression of CD38 and γ-glutamyl transferase. Microarray analyses of gene expression in the testis, caput, and cauda epididymidis of TAL+/+, TAL+/-, and TAL-/- littermates confirmed a dominant impact of TAL deficiency on late stages of sperm-cell development, affecting the electrontransport chain and GSH metabolism. Stimulation of de novo GSH synthesis by oral N-acetyl-cysteine normalized the low fertility rate of TAL+/- males without affecting the sterility of TAL-/- males. Whereas TAL-/- sperm failed to fertilize TAL+/+ oocytes in vitro, sterility of TAL-/- sperm was circumvented by intracytoplasmic sperm injection, indicating that TAL deficiency influenced the structure and function of mitochondria without compromising the nucleus and DNA integrity. Collectively, these data reveal an essential role of TAL in sperm-cell mitochondrial function and, thus, male fertility. © 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",,"acetylcysteine; calcium ion; carbonate dehydratase IV; CD38 antigen; DNA; gamma glutamyltransferase; glutathione; pyridine nucleotide; reactive oxygen metabolite; transaldolase; acidosis; animal cell; animal experiment; article; calcium cell level; calcium transport; cell nucleus; controlled study; down regulation; enzyme regulation; epididymis tail; female; fertilization in vitro; gene expression profiling; glutathione metabolism; intracytoplasmic sperm injection; male; male sterility; membrane potential; microarray analysis; mitochondrial membrane; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oocyte; oxidation reduction state; priority journal; respiratory chain; spermatozoon; spermatozoon motility; testis; Animals; Calcium Signaling; Epididymis; Fertility; Gene Expression; Gene Silencing; Heterozygote; Homozygote; Infertility, Male; Male; Membrane Potentials; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Membranes; Molecular Sequence Data; NAD; Reactive Oxygen Species; Recombination, Genetic; Sperm Motility; Spermatozoa; Sugar Phosphates; Transaldolase",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749536915

The GHG emissions continue to increase, despite the fact that there is an overwhelming consensus that they must be drastically reduced. The environmental information is mostly focused on the impacts in an inter-generational perspective. Economic analyses of intra-generational impacts would probably shift focus also for many third world countries. In these countries there are often important co-benefits of reduced CO2 emissions due to reduced health damages and increased life expectancy. An example from China shows that the local health benefits from CO2 abatement options could be 4-5 higher than the costs to reduce the emissions. If such socioeconomic consequences are included in environmental information, decision makers will probably feel they have more support for a proactive environmental policy. © 2006, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

Biomass-based energy sources can offset, or displace, some amount of fossil-fuel use. Energy derived from biomass provides 2 to 3% of the energy used in the U.S.A.; but, with the exception of corn-(Zea mays L.)-to-ethanol, very little energy is currently derived from dedicated energy crops. In addition to the fossil-fuel offset, energy cropping might also mitigate an accentuated greenhouse gas effect by causing a net sequestration of atmospheric C into soil organic C (SOC). Energy plantations of short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) or herbaceous crops (HC) can potentially be managed to favor SOC sequestration. This review is focused primarily on the potential to mitigate atmospheric CO2 emissions by fostering SOC sequestration in energy cropping systems deployed across the landscape in the United States. We know that land use affects the dynamics of the SOC pool, but data about spatial and temporal variability in the SOC pool under SRWC and HC are scanty due to lack of well-designed, long-term studies. The conventional methods of studying SOC fluxes involve paired-plot designs and chronosequences, but isotopic techniques may also be feasible in understanding temporal changes in SOC. The rate of accumulation of SOC depends on land-use history, soil type, vegetation type, harvesting cycle, and other management practices. The SOC pool tends to be enhanced more under deep-rooted grasses, N-fixers, and deciduous species. Carbon sequestration into recalcitrant forms in the SOC pool can be enhanced with some management practices (e.g., conservation tillage, fertilization, irrigation); but those practices can carry a fossil-C cost. Reported rates of SOC sequestration range from 0 to 1.6 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 under SRWC and 0 to 3 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 under HC. Production of 5 EJ of electricity from energy crops-a perhaps reasonable scenario for the U.S.A.-would require about 60 Mha. That amount of land is potentially available for conversion to energy plantations in the U.S.A. The land so managed could mitigate C emissions (through fossil C not emitted and SOC sequestered) by about 5.4 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. On 60 Mha, that would represent 324 Tg C yr-1-a 20% reduction from current fossil-fuel CO2 emissions. Advances in productivity of fast-growing SRWC and HC species suggest that deployment of energy cropping systems could be an effective strategy to reduce climate-altering effects of anthropogenic CO2 emissions and to meet global policy commitments.

Diversity within the cosmopolitan carnivorous plant genus Drosera (Droseraceae) is focused within Mediterranean climate regions. We explore whether this diversity is temporally linked to Mediterranean-type climatic shifts of the mid-Miocene and whether climate preferences are conservative over phylogenetic timescales. Phyloclimatic modeling combines environmental niche (bioclimatic) modeling with phylogenetics in order to study evolutionary patterns in relation to climate change. We present the largest and most complete such example to date using Drosera. The bioclimatic models of extant species demonstrate clear phylogenetic patterns; this is particularly evident for the tuberous sundews from southwestern Australia (subgenus Ergaleium). We employ a method for establishing confidence intervals of node ages on a phylogeny using replicates from a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. This chronogram shows that many clades, including subgenus Ergaleium and section Bryastrum, diversified during the establishment of the Mediterranean-type climate. Ancestral reconstructions of bioclimatic models demonstrate a pattern of preference for this climate type within these groups. Ancestral bioclimatic models are projected into palaeo-climate reconstructions for the time periods indicated by the chronogram. We present two such examples that each generate plausible estimates of ancestral lineage distribution, which are similar to their current distributions. This is the first study to attempt bioclimatic projections on evolutionary time scales. The sundews appear to have diversified in response to local climate development. Some groups are specialized for Mediterranean climates, others show wide-ranging generalism. This demonstrates that Phyloclimatic modeling could be repeated for other plant groups and is fundamental to the understanding of evolutionary responses to climate change.

The LCA includes the inputs and outputs of energy and materials from (i) extraction and manufacturing of materials, (ii) construction, (iii) occupancy (including heating and cooling energy use), and (iv) maintenance over a 100-year life. The houses were modeled in five cities representing a range of U.S. climates: Miami, Phoenix, Seattle, Washington, and Chicago.

The reduction in environmental impacts provided by the ICF house compared to the wood-frame house varied from 3% to 6%, depending on climate. Furthermore, the most significant environmental impacts are not from construction products but from the production and household use of electricity and natural gas. Since the ICF walls are more highly insulating and energy efficient than the wood-frame walls, the ICF house has lower impacts.

Ice concentrations in the Labrador Sea increase as the oceanic surface heat fluxes are displaced by the adjustment. Downstream, in the Nordic Seas, the subsurface ocean responds favorably to this adjustment, as the vertical profiles of potential temperature and salinity converge towards the observations.

The influence of the through resonance effect on νCO was found to be important in the case of +R para substituents in the benzoyl part of phenyl benzoates as well. The carbonyl stretching frequencies of ortho derivatives in phenoxy part were shown to correlate with the inductive substituent constant σI only. In the benzoyl part of the esters the carbonyl stretching frequencies of cis and trans conformers (relative to the carbonyl group) of ortho derivatives were nicely described by dual parameter equations: (νCO)cis = (νCO)o + C1σI + c 3 EsB and (νCO)trans = (νCO)o + C1σp+ + c3 EsB (R = 0.99). The trans isomers of phenyl esters of ortho-substituted benzoic acids showed direct resonance similar to that for para derivatives. The positive steric term found for both the cis and trans conformers could be considered as measure of the steric inhibition of resonance between the phenyl ring and the carboxy-group caused by bulky ortho substituents. The existence of cis/trans conformations was supported by frequency calculations with Density Functional Theory (DFT) method at B3LYP/6-311+G** level for the ortho-substituted benzoates. In the case of alkyl benzoates good correlations of νCO values were obtained when both the Taft σ* and the steric Es B constants were used.

We used helioseismic holography to image the source of seismic waves emitted into the solar interior from the site of the flare. Acoustic egression power maps at 3 and 6 mHz with a 2 mHz bandpass reveal a compact acoustic source strongly correlated with impulsive hard X-ray and visible-continuum emission along the penumbral neutral line separating the two major opposing umbrae in the δ-configuration sunspot that predominates AR10720. The visible continuum emission is estimated at 2.0 × 1023 J, approximately 500 times the seismic emission of ∼ 4×l020 J. The flare of 2005 January 15 exhibits the same close spatial alignment between the sources of the seismic emission and impulsive visible continuum emission as previous flares, reinforcing the hypothesis that the acoustic emission may be driven by heating of the low photosphere. However, it is a major exception in that there was no signature to indicate the inclusion of protons in the particle beams thought to supply the energy radiated by the flare. The continued strong coincidence between the sources of seismic emission and impulsive visible continuum emission in the case of a proton-deficient white-light flare lends substantial support to the ""backwarming"" hypothesis, that the low photosphere is significantly heated by intense Balmer and Paschen continuum-edge radiation from the overlying chromosphere in white-light flares.","Flares; Helioseismology; Oscillations","Acoustic waves; Electromagnetic wave emission; Maps; Particle beams; Protons; Seismology; Acoustic egression power maps; Helioseismic holography; Helioseismology; Solar flare; Sunquakes; Sunspot; Solar radiation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847378102

There is limited evidence of the community effectiveness of interventions for reducing IAP exposure. We conducted a community-based intervention study of stove and health education interventions in four low-income Chinese provinces: Gansu, Guizhou, Inner Mongolia, and Shaanxi. Separate townships in one county in each province were assigned to stove plus behavioral interventions, behavioral interventions alone, and control. Data on household fuel and stove use, and on concentrations of respirable particles (RPM), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide (SO 2), were collected in peak and late heating seasons before and after interventions. The effectiveness of interventions was evaluated using difference-in-difference analysis. Pollutant concentrations were also measured in controlled tests, in which stoves were operated by expert users. In controlled tests, there was consistent and substantial reduction in concentrations of RPM (&gt;88%) and CO (&gt;66%); in the two coal-using provinces, SO2 concentrations declined more in Shaanxi than in Guizhou. In community implementation, combined stove and behavioral interventions reduced the concentrations of pollutants in rooms where heating was the main purpose of stove use in the peak heating season, with smaller, non-significant, reduction in late heating season. Gansu was the only province where combined stove and behavioral interventions led to pollution reduction where cooking was the primary purpose of stove use. Compared to the control group, no significant IAP reductions were seen in groups with health education alone. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Biomass; Carbon monoxide; China; Coal; Global health; Household energy; Indoor air pollution; Intervention study; Particulate matter; Stove; Sulfur dioxide","Biomass; Carbon monoxide; Coal; Developing countries; Fuels; Health; Heating; Indoor air pollution; Pollution; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; China; Global health; Household energy; Intervention studies; Particulate Matter; Stoves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846608660

A combination of model simulations and observational studies of a recent wide-scale drought, suggested that the drought induced substantial terrestrial ecosystem carbon loss, but hypothesized mechanisms could not be evaluated via comparison to a control. Here, we investigated carbon-cycle responses to climate changes by combining results from a controlled 15-year ecosystem warming experiment in montane grassland with observational data from before and during the recent drought. We found that both experimental warming and real-world drought induced substantial soil carbon loss in our study system, and that the same mechanism, a drying-induced shift in plant species composition and an associated decline in community productivity, provides a common explanation for these declines in soil carbon. © IOP Publishing Ltd.","Carbon; Climate; Drought; Feedback; Vegetation","Carbon; Climate change; Computer simulation; Ecosystems; Feedback; Vegetation; Climate; Climate feedbacks; Global climate changes; Model simulation; Observational data; Observational study; Plant species composition; Terrestrial ecosystems; Drought",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846591426

The emphasis is on electron transport through PSII and PSI and on the modeling of Chl fluorescence and 810 nm absorptance signals. Non-photochemical quenching of PSII excitation is controlled by lumenal pH. Alternative electron transport is modeled as the Mehler type O2 reduction plus the malate-oxaloacetate shuttle based on the chloroplast malate dehydrogenase. Carbon reduction enzymes are redox-controlled by the ferredoxin-thioredoxin system, sucrose synthesis is controlled by the fructose 2,6-bisphosphate inhibition of cytosolic FBPase, and starch synthesis is controlled by ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Photorespiratory glycolate pathway is included in an integrated way, sufficient to reproduce steady-state rates of photorespiration. Rate-equations are designed on principles of multisubstrate-multiproduct enzyme kinetics. The parameters of the model were adopted from literature or were estimated from fitting the photosynthetic rate and pool sizes to experimental data. The model provided good simulations for steady-state photosynthesis, Chl fluorescence, and 810 nm transmittance signals under varying light, CO2 and O2 concentrations, as well as for the transients of post-illumination CO2 uptake, Chl fluorescence induction and the 810 nm signal. The modeling shows that the present understanding of photosynthesis incorporated in the model is basically correct, but still insufficient to reproduce the dark-light induction of photosynthesis, the time kinetics of non-photochemical quenching, 'photosynthetic control' of plastoquinone oxidation, cyclic electron flow around PSI, oscillations in photosynthesis. The model may find application for predicting the results of gene transformations, the analysis of kinetic experimental data, the training of students. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Light reactions; Mathematical model; Photosynthesis","carbon; malate dehydrogenase; silicon; article; biological model; chloroplast; enzymology; kinetics; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; photon; photosynthesis; Carbon; Chloroplasts; Kinetics; Malate Dehydrogenase; Models, Biological; Oxidation-Reduction; Photons; Photosynthesis; Silicon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846273491

Total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations (mean ± standard error) at the beginning of exposures were as follows: control, 0.2 ± 0.1 μg/L; low, 9.6 ± 2.5 μg/L; medium, 40.7 ± 6.9 μg/L; and high, 120.2 ± 11.4 μg/L. Biological availability of hydrocarbons was confirmed by a significant induction of hepatic cytochrome P450 content and ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity. Critical swimming speed (Ucrit) was significantly reduced in fish exposed to the highest concentration of WSF for 96 h (11% ± 3.7% reduction) and at the two highest concentrations at four weeks (16% ± 3.6% and 29% ± 5.4% reductions) and eight weeks (11% ± 3.8% and 40% ± 5.7% reductions). Mortality occurred in all groups 24 h following Ucrit swim trials, with significantly higher mortalities observed in fish exposed to WSF in a concentration- and time-dependent manner (maximum mortality of 72.2% ± 5.5% in the eight-week, high-exposure group). Burst swimming alone resulted in increased plasma cortisol, lactate, Na+, and Cl- concentrations and decreased muscle glycogen levels that returned to baseline values by 24 h. An interpretation of the effect of WSF exposure on postexercise metabolic recovery was complicated by pre-exercise alterations in several parameters. The time courses and magnitudes of several key postexercise parameters, including plasma cortisol, lactate, and muscle glycogen, were significantly altered by exposure to WSF.

Various parameters such as adsorbent dose, pH and activation temperature of carbon were studied to establish optimum adsorption conditions. The results showed that the rates of adsorption of metals increase with adsorbent dose. The pH variation showed that maximum adsorption capacities were observed at pH 4.

Plants can affect available soil carbon, temperature, and water content, which each have the potential to affect microbial community composition and function. These same variables change seasonally, and thus plant control on microbial community composition may be modulated or overshadowed by annual climatic patterns. We examined microbial community composition, C cycling processes, and environmental data in California annual grassland soils from beneath oak canopies and in open grassland areas to distinguish factors controlling microbial community composition and function seasonally and in association with the two plant overstory communities. Every 3 months for up to 2 years, we monitored microbial community composition using phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis, microbial biomass, respiration rates, microbial enzyme activities, and the activity of microbial groups using isotope labeling of PLFA biomarkers (13C-PLFA) . Distinct microbial communities were associated with oak canopy soils and open grassland soils and microbial communities displayed seasonal patterns from year to year. The effects of plant species and seasonal climate on microbial community composition were similar in magnitude. In this Mediterranean ecosystem, plant control of microbial community composition was primarily due to effects on soil water content, whereas the changes in microbial community composition seasonally appeared to be due, in large part, to soil temperature. Available soil carbon was not a significant control on microbial community composition. Microbial community composition (PLFA) and 13C-PLFA ordination values were strongly related to intra-annual variability in soil enzyme activities and soil respiration, but microbial biomass was not. In this Mediterranean climate, soil microclimate appeared to be the master variable controlling microbial community composition and function. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,"biological marker; carbon; phospholipid; water; carbon cycle; community composition; grassland soil; microbial activity; plant community; seasonal variation; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil temperature; soil water; article; bacterium; biomass; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microbiology; oak; oxygen consumption; physiology; plant leaf; population density; population dynamics; season; species difference; temperature; Bacteria; Biological Markers; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Isotopes; Ecosystem; Oxygen Consumption; Phospholipids; Plant Leaves; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Quercus; Seasons; Soil Microbiology; Species Specificity; Temperature; Water; California; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845385707

Bergmann's rule states that organisms are larger at higher latitudes (or in colder climates). Rensch's rule states that male body size varies (or evolutionarily diverges) more than female body size among species, resulting in slopes greater than one when male size is regressed on female size. We use published studies of sex-specific latitudinal body size clines in vertebrates and invertebrates to investigate patterns equivalent to Rensch's rule among populations within species and to evaluate their possible relation to Bergmann's rule. Consistent with previous studies, we found a continuum of Bergmann (larger at higher latitudes: 58 species) and converse Bergmann body size clines (larger at lower latitudes: 40 species). Ignoring latitude, male size was more variable than female size in only 55 of 98 species, suggesting that intraspecific variation in sexual size dimorphism does not generally conform to Rensch's rule. In contrast, in a significant majority of species (66 of 98) male latitudinal body size clines were steeper than those of females. This pattern is consistent with a latitudinal version of Rensch's rule, and suggests that some factor that varies systematically with latitude is responsible for producing Rensch's rule among populations within species. Identifying the underlying mechanisms will require studies quantifying latitudinal variation in sexspecific natural and sexual selection on body size. © 2006 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

A large volume of water and ice is transported through Fram Strait, with net water transport of 1.7-3.2 Sv southward in the East Greenland Current and a volume ice flux in the range of 0.06-0.11 Sv. The mean annual ice flux is about 866,000 km2 yr-1. The Kongsfjorden-Krossfjorden fjord system on the coast of Spitsbergen, or at the eastern extreme of Fram Strait, is mainly affected by the northbound transport of water in the WSC. Mixing processes on the shelf result in Transformed Atlantic Water in the fjords, and the advection of Atlantic water also carries boreal fauna into the fjords. The phytoplankton production is about 80 g C m-2 yr-1 in Fram Strait, and has been estimated both below and above this for Kongsfjorden. The zooplankton fauna is diverse, but dominated in terms of biomass by calanoid copepods, particularly Calanus glacialis and C. finmarchicus. Other important copepods include C. hyperboreus, Metridia longa and the smaller, more numerous Pseudocalanus (P. minutus and P. acuspes), Microcalanus (M. pusillus and M. pygmaeus) and Oithona similis. The most important species of other taxa appear to be the amphipods Themisto libellula and T. abyssorum, the euphausiids Thysanoessa inermis and T. longicaudata and the chaetognaths Sagitta elegans and Eukrohnia hamata. A comparison between the open ocean of Fram Strait and the restricted fjord system of Kongsfjorden-Krossfjorden can be made within limitations. The same species tend to dominate, but the Fram Strait zooplankton fauna differs by the presence of meso- and bathypelagic copepods. The seasonal and inter-annual variation in zooplankton is described for Kongsfjorden based on the record during July 1996-2002. The ice macrofauna is much less diverse, consisting of a handful of amphipod species and the polar cod. The ice-associated biomass transport of ice-amphipods was calculated, based on the ice area transport, at about 3.55 × 106 ton wet weight per year or about 4.2 × 105 t C yr-1. This represents a large energy input to the Greenland Sea, but also a drain on the core population residing in the multi-year pack ice (MYI) in the Arctic Ocean. A continuous habitat loss of MYI due to climate warming will likely reduce dramatically the sympagic food source. The pelagic and sympagic food web structures were revealed by stable isotopes. The carbon sources of particulate organic matter (POM), being Ice-POM and Pelagic-POM, revealed different isotopic signals in the organisms of the food web, and also provided information about the sympagic-pelagic and pelagic-benthic couplings. The marine food web and energy pathways were further determined by fatty acid trophic markers, which to a large extent supported the stable isotope picture of the marine food web, although some discrepancies were noted, particularly with regard to predator-prey relationships of ctenophores and pteropods. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Rainfall, and climate more generally, are implicated directly in the United Nations ""Millennium Development Goals"" to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger, and reduce child mortality and incidence of diseases such as malaria by the target date of 2015. But, Africa is not currently on target to meet these goals. We pose a number of questions from a climate science perspective aimed at understanding this background: Is there a common origin to factors that currently constrain climate science? Why is it that in a continent where human activity is so closely linked to interannual rainfall variability has climate science received little of the benefit that saw commercialization driving meteorology in the developed world? What might be suggested as an effective way for the continent to approach future climate variability and change? We make the case that a route to addressing the challenges of climate change in Africa rests with the improved management of climate variability. We start by discussing the constraints on climate science and how they might be overcome. We explain why the optimal management of activities directly influenced by interannual climate variability (which include the development of scientific capacity) has the potential to serve as a forerunner to engagement in the wider issue of climate change. We show this both from the perspective of the climate system and the institutions that engage with climate issues.

The effects of seasonal and intermittent precipitation events on net water vapor and CO2 fluxes were determined for crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum), juniper (Juniperus osteosperma), and sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) ecosystems using eddy covariance measurements. The measurements were made at Rush Valley, Utah, in the northern Great Basin of the United States. Data were evaluated during the growing seasons of 2002 and 2003. Each of these communities responds to precipitation pulses in all seasons, but these responses vary among season and ecosystem, and differ for water vapor and CO2. The degree and direction of response (i.e., net uptake or efflux) depended upon the timing and amount of precipitation. In early spring, both evapotranspiration (ET) and CO2 fluxes responded only slightly to precipitation pulses because soils were already moist from snowmelt and spring rains. As soils dried later in the spring, ET response to rainfall increased. The summer season was very warm and dry in both years, and both water and CO2 fluxes were generally reduced as compared to fluxes in the spring. Water vapor fluxes increased during and immediately after periodic summer rain events at all sites, especially at juniper, followed by the sagebrush and crested wheatgrass sites. Net CO2 exchange changed significantly at the juniper and sagebrush sites but changed very little at the crested wheatgrass site due to senescence of this grass. However, in the wetter summer of 2003, the grass species maintained physiological activity and responded to rain events. In the fall of both years, responses of ET and CO2 fluxes to precipitation were very similar for all three communities, with only small changes, presumably due to significantly lower temperatures in the fall. This research documents the importance of the temporal distribution of rainfall on patterns of ET and CO2 fluxes and suggests that soil moisture and stand-level leaf area index (LAI) are critical factors governing ET and CO2 responses to precipitation in these communities. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"carbon flux; evapotranspiration; precipitation assessment; rainfall; semiarid region; soil moisture; water vapor; North America; United States; Utah; Agropyron cristatum; Agropyron desertorum; Artemisia tridentata; Juniperus; Juniperus osteosperma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750939387

Snow cover that accumulates at temperatures close to the ice-water phase transition is at greater risk to climate warming than cold climate snowpacks because it affects both precipitation phase and ablation rates. This study maps areas in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States that are potentially at risk of converting from a snow-dominated to a rain-dominated winter precipitation regime, under a climate-warming scenario. A data-driven, climatological approach of snow cover classification is used to reveal these ""at risk"" snow zones and also to examine the relative frequency of warm winters for the region. For a rain versus snow temperature threshold of 0°C the at-risk snow class covers an area of about 9200 km2 in the Pacific Northwest region and represents approximately 6.5 km3 of water. Many areas of the Pacific Northwest would see an increase in the number of warm winters, but the impacts would likely be concentrated in the Cascade and Olympic Ranges. A number of lower-elevation ski areas could experience negative impacts because of the shift from winter snows to winter rains. The results of this study point to the potential for using existing datasets to better understand the potential impacts of climate warming. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"global warming; mapping; precipitation (climatology); snow cover; snowpack; North America; Pacific Coast [North America]; Pacific Coast [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750932524

Like all vestimentiferans, L. luymesi obtains its nutrition from sulfide-oxidizing endosymbiotic bacteria, which it houses in an internal organ called the trophosome. This tubeworm has a lifespan of over 170 years and its survival is contingent upon the availability of sulfide during this long period. In sediments underlying L. luymesi aggregations, microbes produce sulfide by coupling sulfate reduction with hydrocarbon oxidation. L. luymesi acquires sulfide from the sediment using a root-like posterior extension of its body that is buried in the sediment. Its symbionts then oxidize the sulfide to produce energy for carbon fixation, and release sulfate and hydrogen ions as byproducts. It is critical for the tubeworm to eliminate these waste ions, and it could do so either across its vascular plume or across its root. In this study, we measured sulfate and proton elimination rates from live L. luymesi and found that they eliminated approximately 85% of the sulfate produced by sulfide oxidation, and approximately 67% of the protons produced by various metabolic processes, across their roots. On the basis of experiments using membrane transport inhibitors, we suggest that L. luymesi has anion exchangers that mediate sulfate elimination coupled with bicarbonate uptake. Roots could be the ideal exchange surface for eliminating sulfate and hydrogen ions for two reasons. First, these ions might be eliminated across the root epithelium using facilitated diffusion, which is energetically economical. Second, sulfate and hydrogen ions are substrates for bacterial sulfate reduction, and supplying these ions into the sediment might help ensure a sustained sulfide supply for L. luymesi over its entire lifespan.","Hydrocarbon seep; Lamellibrachia luymesi; Proton; Root; Sulfate; Tubeworm","agents affecting water, molecule or ion transport; proton; sulfate; active transport; animal; article; biological model; comparative study; drug effect; energy metabolism; ion transport; metabolism; microbiology; pH; physiology; Polychaeta; symbiosis; United States; Animals; Biological Transport, Active; Energy Metabolism; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Ion Transport; Louisiana; Membrane Transport Modulators; Models, Biological; Polychaeta; Protons; Sulfates; Symbiosis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lamellibrachia luymesi; Polychaeta; Siboglinidae; Vestimentifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750580226

Several authors have shown that spatially derived characterisation factors used in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) can differ widely between different countries in the context of regional impact categories such as acidification or terrestrial eutrophication. Previous methodology studies in Europe have produced country-dependent characterisation factors for acidification and terrestrial eutrophication by using the results of the EMEP and RAINS models and critical loads for Europe. The unprotected ecosystem area (UA) is commonly used as a category indicator in the determination of characterisation factors in those studies. However, the UA indicator is only suitable for large emission changes and it does not result in environmental benefits in terms of characterisation factors if deposition after the emission reduction is still higher than the critical load. For this reason, there is a need to search for a new category indicator type for acidification and terrestrial eutrophying in order to calculate site-dependent characterisation factors. The aim of this study is to explore new site-dependent characterisation factors for European acidifying and eutrophying emissions based on accumulated exceedance (AE) as the category indicator, which integrates both the exceeded area and amount of exceedance. In addition, the results obtained for the AE and UA indicators are compared with each other. Methods. The chosen category indicator, accumulated exceedance (AE), was computed according to the calculation methods developed in the work under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP). Sulphur and nitrogen depositions to 150×150 km 2 grid cells over Europe were calculated by source-receptor matrices derived from the EMEP Lagrangian model of long-range transport of air pollution in Europe. Using the latest critical load data of Europe, the site-dependent characterisation factors for acidification and terrestrial eutrophication were calculated for 35 European countries and 5 sea areas for 2002 emissions and emissions predicted for 2010. In the determination of characterisation factors, the emissions of each country/area were reduced by various amounts in order to find stable characterisation factors. In addition, characterisation errors were calculated for the AE-based characterisation factors. For the comparison, the results based on the use of UA indicator were calculated by 10% and 50% reductions of emissions that corresponded to the common practice used in the previous studies. Results and Discussion. The characterisation factors based on the AE indicator were shown to be largely independent of the reduction percentage used to calculate them. Small changes in emissions (≤100 t) produced the most stable characterisation factors in the case of the AE indicator. The characterisation errors of those characterisation factors were practically zero. This means that the characterisation factors can describe the effects of small changes in national emissions that are mostly looked at in LCAs. The comparison between country-dependent characterisation factors calculated by the AE and UA indicators showed that these two approaches produce differences between characterisation factors for many countries/areas in Europe. The differences were mostly related to the Central and Northern European countries. They were greater for terrestrial eutrophication because the contribution of ammonia emission differ remarkably between the two approaches. The characterisation factors of the AE indicator calculated by the emissions of 2002 were greater than the factors calculated by the predicted emissions for 2010 in almost all countries/sea areas, due to the presumed decrease of acidifying and eutrophying emissions in Europe. Conclusions and Recommendations. In this study, accumulated exceedance was shown to be an appropriate category indicator in LCIA applications for the determination of site-dependent characterisation factors for acidification and terrestrial eutrophication in the context of integrated assessment modelling. In the future, it would be useful to calculate characterisation factors for emissions of separate parts of large countries and sea areas in Europe. In addition, it would also be useful to compare the approach based on the AE indicator with the method of the hazard index, as recommended in the latest CML guidebook. © 2006 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Acidification; Characterisation; Europe; Indicator; Integrated assessment modelling; LCIA; Life cycle impact assessment; Terrestrial eutrophication","nitrogen; sulfur; acidification; air pollution; biosafety; calculation; conference paper; developed country; ecosystem; environmental impact; environmental protection; Europe; eutrophication; hazard assessment; human; life cycle assessment; mathematical computing; methodology; organization; pollution transport; priority journal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750578978

Here we studied how both warming and species richness loss affect water use in grasslands, while identifying interactions between these global changes. Experimental ecosystems containing one, three or nine grassland species from three functional groups were grown in 12 sunlit, climate-controlled chambers (2.25 m2 ground area) in Wilrijk, Belgium. Half of these chambers were exposed to ambient air temperatures (unheated), while the other half were warmed by 3°C (heated). Equal amounts of water were added to heated and unheated communities, so that warming would imply drier soils if evapotranspiration (ET) was higher. After an initial ET increase in response to warming, stomatal regulation and lower above-ground productivity resulted in ET values comparable with those recorded in the unheated communities. As a result of the decreased biomass production, water use efficiency (WUE) was reduced by warming. Higher complementarity and the improved competitive success of water-efficient species in mixtures led to an increased WUE in multi-species communities as compared to monocultures, regardless of the induced warming. However, since the WUE of individual species was affected in different ways by higher temperatures, compositional changes in mixtures seem likely under climatic change due to shifts in competitiveness. In conclusion, while increased complementarity and selection of water-efficient species ensured more efficient water use in mixtures than monocultures, global warming will likely decrease this WUE, and this may be most pronounced in species-rich communities. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Evapotranspiration; Global warming; Grassland species; Species richness; Water use efficiency","biomass; complementarity; evapotranspiration; global warming; grassland; plant community; species richness; water use efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750441130

I show how a local struggle can be represented as a global struggle: a case study concerning the domestic use of natural gas in the Norwegian city of Stavanger, and how this metamorphosed into a struggle about what was the appropriate geographical scale at which the environmental and climatic consequences of a natural gas project should be assessed, is described. By framing climate change as a global issue, local actors were able to portray the natural gas project as environmentally friendly. I argue that the realisation of this natural gas project should be seen in light of how strategies over scale - which were developed in the debate - fitted with climate discourses institutionalised in national policy and politics.",,"climate change; environmental assessment; environmental issue; environmental management; environmental planning; environmental policy; natural gas; policy making; policy strategy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750319703

Assuming transient laminar 3-D incompressible flow in a representative human nasal cavity, the cyclic airflow pattern as well as local and overall nanoparticle depositions were computationally simulated and analyzed. The focus was on transient effects during inhalation/exhalation as compared to the steady-state assumption typically invoked. Then, an equation for a matching steady-state inhalation flow rate was developed that generates the same deposition results as cyclic inhalation.

The AHR and HIFs utilize the same heterodimeric partner, the aryl hydrocarbon nuclear translocator (ARNT) for proper function. This requirement raises the possibility that cross-talk exists between these critical signaling systems. Single gene and reporter assays have yielded conflicting results regarding the nature of the competition for ARNT. Therefore, to determine the extent of cross-talk between the AHR and HIFs, a comprehensive analysis was performed using global gene expression analysis. The results identified 767 and 430 transcripts that are sensitive to cobalt chloride and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-ρ-dioxin (TCDD) stimulation, respectively, with 308 and 176, respectively, exhibiting sensitivity to cross-talk. The overlap between these two sets consists of 33 unique transcripts, including the classic target genes CYP1A1, carbonic anhydrase IX, and those involved in lipid metabolism and coagulation. Computational analysis of the regulatory region of these genes identified complex relationships between HIFs, AHR, and their respective response elements as well as other DNA motifs, including the SRF, Sp-1, NF-kB, and AP-2 binding sites.

As a result, xeriscaping has become a popular approach to landscaping in arid climates. Currently, no regulations control the mineralogy of decorative rocks that are used in these applications. Eight public sites were examined in Las Vegas, NV, where green and white salt crusts appeared on recently emplaced decorative rocks. The landscaping rocks, underlying soil, surface salt crusts, irrigation water runoff, and plants were analyzed for mineralogy and/or chemistry. Pyrite and high levels of copper were identified in the decorative rock. Acid-rock drainage caused by pyrite oxidation has concentrated copper in salt efflorescences, and As, Cu, Mo, Pb, and Cr in plant tissues. These metals are not known to occur naturally in Las Vegas Valley soils, and our results indicate that their source is the landscaping aggregate.

To prevent these emissions growing with world population, future FW best management practices need to be evaluated. The objective of this paper was therefore to predict FW production for 2025 if present management practices are maintained, and then, to compare the impact of scenario 1: encouraging people to stay in rural areas and composting 75% of their FW, and; of scenario 2, where in addition to scenario 1, composting or anaerobically digesting 75% of urban FW (UFW). A relationship was established between per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and the population percentage living in urban areas (%UP), as well as production of municipal solid waste (MSW) and UFW. With estimated GDP and population growth per country,%UP and production of MSW and UFW could be predicted for 2025. A relatively accurate (R2 &gt; 0.85) correlation was found between GDP and%UP, and between GDP and mass of MSW and FW produced. On a global scale, MSW and UFW productions were predicted to increase by 51 and 44%, respectively, from 2005 to 2025. During the same period, and because of its expected economic development, Asia was predicted to experience the largest increase in UFW production, of 278 to 416 Gkg. If present MSW management trends are maintained, landfilled UFW was predicted to increase world CH4 emissions from 34 to 48 Gkg and the landfill share of global anthropogenic emissions from 8 to 10%. In comparison with maintaining present FW management practices, scenario 1 can lower UFW production by 30% and maintain the landfill share of the global anthropogenic emissions at 8%. With scenario 2, the landfill share of global anthropogenic emissions could be further reduced from 8 to 6% and leachate production could be reduced by 40%.

To test the effect of nutrient availability on decomposition, carbon dioxide (CO2) flux dynamics, microbial biomass, and nutrients, we added nitrogen (N) with phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), to prevent limitation of the latter 2 nutrients, over 2 growing seasons to plots at Mer Bleue peatland, Ontario, Canada. After the first growing season, increasing N fertilization (with constant P and K) decreased in vitro CO2 production potential and increased microbial biomass measured with a chloroform fumigation-extraction technique in the upper peat profile, while by the end of the second season, CO2 production potential was increased in response to N plus PK treatment, presumably due to more easily decomposable newly formed plant material. In situ CO2 fluxes measured using chamber-techniques over the second year corroborated this presumption, with greater photosynthetic CO2 uptake and ecosystem respiration (ER) during high N plus PK treatments. The more efficient microbial community, with slower CO2 production potential and larger biomass, after the first year was characterized by larger fungal biomass measured with signature phospholipid fatty acids. The majority of N was likely quickly sequestered by the vegetation and transferred to dissolved organic forms and microbial biomass in the upper parts of the peat profile, while additional P relative to controls was distributed throughout the profile, implying that the vegetation at the site was N limited. However, in situ CO2 flux data suggested the possibility of P or NPK limitation. We hypothesize that nutrient deposition may lead to enhanced C uptake by altering the microbial community and decomposition, however this pattern disappears through subsequent changes in the vegetation and production of more readily decomposable plant tissues.","Carbon dioxide; Microbial biomass; Nitrogen; Peatland; Phosphorus; PLFA","carbon dioxide; decomposition; microbial community; nutrient availability; nutrient dynamics; ombrotrophic environment; peatland; Canada; Mer Bleue; North America; Ontario",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750078384

This paper summarizes current knowledge on reduction of structural Fe(III) in iron-rich dioctahedral smectites and partial stabilization of Fe(II) in reduced SWa-1 ferruginous smectite via fixation of Li+ cations upon heating. Fe(III) in Fe-rich dioctahedral smectites was completely reduced in citrate-bicarbonate buffer using sodium dithionite. Progress in the reduction or reoxidation process was followed by monitoring the Fe(II)-O-Fe(III) intervalence electron transfer transition using visible spectroscopy at 730 nm. Reduction proceeds from basal surfaces rather than from particle edges. One study found that trioctahedral domains and vacancies may occur within the structure of reduced minerals, but another study indicated less radical structural changes. Fully reoxidized minerals contain less OH groups. About 20% of total Fe can be stabilized as Fe(II) in reduced SWa-1 via Li+-saturation and heating the Li-form of a highly reduced mineral in N2 atmosphere at 260 °C for 24 h. Part of the Li+ is trapped in previously vacant octahedral sites, forming trioctahedral AlFe(II)LiOH or Fe(III)Fe(II)LiOH groupings. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Combining the CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) model with data on harvest indices and yields, we calculated net primary production, woody production in orchard and vineyard crops, and soil carbon. Over the 21-yr period, two trends resulted in carbon sequestration. Yields increased an average of 20%, corresponding to greater plant biomass and more carbon returned to the soils. Also, orchards and vineyards increased in area from 0.7 × 106 ha to 1.0 × 106 ha, displacing field crops and sequestering woody carbon. Our model estimates that California's agriculture sequestered an average of 19 g C·m-2·yr-1. Sequestration was lowest in non-rice annual cropland, which sequestered 9 g C·m -2·yr-1 of soil carbon, and highest on land that switched from annual cropland to perennial cropland. Land that switched from annual crops to vineyards sequestered 68 g C·m -2·yr-1, and land that switched from annual crops to orchards sequestered 85 g C·m-2·yr-1. Rice fields, because of a reduction in field burning, sequestered 55 g C·m-2·yr-1 in the 1990s. Over the 21 years, California's 3.6 × 106 ha of agricultural land sequestered 11.0 Tg C within soils and 3.5 Tg C in woody biomass, for a total of 14.5 Tg C statewide. This is equal to 0.7% of the state's total fossil fuel emissions over the same time period. If California's agriculture adopted conservation tillage, changed management of almond and walnut prunings, and used all of its orchard and vineyard waste wood in the biomass power plants in the state, California's agriculture could offset up to 1.6% of the fossil fuel emissions in the state. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.","Agriculture; California, USA; Carbon sequestration; Global carbon cycle; Soils","carbon; fossil fuel; agricultural land; annual plant; biomass allocation; carbon sequestration; conservation tillage; crop yield; data set; net primary production; orchard; soil carbon; vineyard; wood; agriculture; article; biological model; biomass; chemistry; crop; ecosystem; environmental protection; soil; time; United States; wood; Agriculture; Biomass; California; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Fossil Fuels; Models, Biological; Soil; Time Factors; Wood; California; North America; United States; Juglans; Prunus dulcis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749544687

Dispersal among populations and synchronous stochastic effects (the so called ""Moran effect"") are the mechanisms most likely to explain such synchrony patterns. Very few studies have related the degree of spatial synchrony to the biological characteristics of species. Here we present a case where specific predictions can be made to relate river fish species characteristics and synchrony determined exclusively by a Moran effect through the expected sensitivity of species to the regional component of environmental stochasticity. By analyzing 23-year time series of abundance estimates in two isolated localities we show that species associated with synchronized reproduction during the wet season, high fecundity, small egg size and high gonado-somatic index (the so called ""periodic"" strategy) have a higher degree of spatial synchrony in population dynamics than species associated with the opposite traits (the so called ""equilibrium"" strategy). This is supported by significant relationships (P values <0.01) between species traits and the levels of synchrony after removing taxonomical relatedness. Spatial synchrony computed from summed annual total catches by groups of species, separated into strategy types also showed a significantly higher degree of synchrony for the periodic (r=0.83) than the equilibrium (r=0.46) group. Regional hydrological variability is likely to be partly responsible for the observed synchrony pattern and a regional discharge index showed better relationships with the periodic group, supporting the expected differential effect of regional environmental correlation on population dynamics. © OIKOS.",,"abundance; fish; life history; population dynamics; synchrony; Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa; Pisces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749477348

To this end, chemists have taken advantage of the homolytic carbon-selenium bond cleavage as an efficient way to generate carbon-centered radicals. The reactivity of the radicals generated from β-hydroxy (or alkoxy) α-phenylseleno (or α-halo) esters in hydrogen transfer or allylation reactions will be reviewed. The minimization of the allylic-1,3 strain and the intramolecular dipole-dipole effect in the transition states are at the origin of the diastereoselectivities noted in these reactions (acyclic stereocontrol). The predominance of the anti isomer, in the hydrogen transfer reactions, has been shown to be enhanced by taking advantage of the exocyclic effect. Lewis acids were successfully used to create temporary cycles a to the carbon-centered radical in order to induce the latter effect. Reversing the sense of the diastereoselectivity could be efficiently achieved using bidendate Lewis acids through the endocyclic effect. The synthesis of stereogenic quaternary centers using free radical-based allylation is described. The development of tandem reactions combining the Mukaiyama and the hydrogen transfer reactions, with various Lewis acids, led to the synthesis of propionates and polypropionate motifs.

Complementary NMR experiments have also been performed on a polycarbonate homopolymer containing the same 13C and 19F labels. In the blend, the 13C observed spin was at high concentration, and the 19F dephasing or probe spin was at low concentration. In this situation, an analysis in terms of a distribution of isolated heteronuclear pairs of spins is valid. A comparison of the results for the blend and homopolymer defines the NMR conditions under which higher concentrations of probe labels can be used and a simple analysis of the REDOR results is still valid. The nearest neighbors of a CF 3 on one chain generally include a carbonate group on an adjacent chain. A direct interpretation of the REDOR total dephasing for the polycarbonate blend indicates that at least 75% of carbonate-carbon 13C⋯F 3 nearest neighbors are separated by a narrow distribution of distances 4.7 ± 0.3 Å.

The source, rate and extent of release of these compounds are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to characterize the release of SOCs and the regulated parameter, non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs) during the decomposition of residential refuse and its major biodegradable components [paper (P), yard waste (YW), food waste (FW)]. Work was conducted under anaerobic conditions in 8-L reactors operated to maximize decomposition. Refuse and YW were also tested under aerobic conditions. NMOC release during anaerobic decomposition of refuse, P, YW, and FW was 0.151, 0.016, 0.038, and 0.221 mg-C dry g-1, respectively, while release during aerobic decomposition of refuse and YW was 0.282 and 0.236 mg-C dry g-1, respectively. The highest NMOC release was measured under abiotic conditions (3.01 mg-C dry g-1), suggesting the importance of gas stripping. NMOC release was faster than CH4 production in all treatments. Terpenes and ketones accounted for 32-96% of SOC release in each treatment, while volatile fatty acids were not a significant contributor. Release in aerobic systems points to the potential importance of composting plants as an emissions source. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Food wastes; Non-methane organic compounds (NMOC); Speciated organic compounds (SOC); Anaerobic digestion; Decomposition; Industrial emissions; Land fill; Organic compounds; Solid wastes; Waste treatment; alcohol derivative; alkane derivative; aromatic compound; chlorinated hydrocarbon; fluorine derivative; ketone derivative; methane; organic compound; siloxane; terpene derivative; volatile fatty acid; Anaerobic digestion; Decomposition; Industrial emissions; Land fill; Organic compounds; Solid wastes; Waste treatment; anoxic conditions; decomposition; landfill; municipal solid waste; organic compound; oxic conditions; trace metal; aerobic capacity; anaerobic capacity; article; biodegradation; composting; decomposition; environmental release; food; gas; landfill; municipal solid waste; paper; Air Pollutants; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon Dioxide; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Food; Methane; Organic Chemicals; Paper; Plant Leaves; Plant Stems; Poaceae; Refuse Disposal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749406879

Separating climate from human-caused changes in the vegetation requires a strategy for determining times of change across the entire region. We quantified transitions in the vegetation across Europe during the past 12,000 years using a mixture model approach on two datasets: radiocarbon dates from pollen diagrams and zone boundaries from selected reference sites. Major transitions in the vegetation, as recorded in pollen diagrams, appear synchronous across the continent. These transitions were also synchronous with those identified in North America pollen diagrams and major environmental changes recorded in North Atlantic marine records and Greenland ice cores. This synchronicity suggests that the major vegetation transitions in Europe during the Holocene and late glacial were primarily caused by large-scale atmospheric circulation change. These climate changes may have caused some of the cultural, political and migration changes in European societies during the Holocene. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,"Carbon; Climate change; Database systems; Environmental impact; Glacial geology; Vegetation; Landscapes; Pollen diagrams; Postglacial climate; Quantified transitions; Radiocarbon; Synchronicity; Climatology; atmospheric circulation; climate conditions; data set; environmental change; environmental history; Holocene; ice core; late glacial; Postglacial; vegetation; Arctic; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Eurasia; Europe; Greenland; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749345674

The four components of the model are (i) awareness of and concern about the potential impacts of climate change, (ii) adaptation strategy, (iii) the concept of an adaptation space from which options are selected, and (iv) the notion that three groups of factors influence awareness, strategy and option selection: susceptibility to change, internal characteristics of the organisation, and regulatory and market context. Public water supply in England and Wales is provided by private sector companies, subject to environmental and economic regulation. Hydrological simulations suggest that climate change has the potential to reduce the reliability of supply sources over the next few decades. The industry in December 2004 completed a review of investment requirements over the next five years. Awareness of climate change is high in the water industry, but by developing assessment procedures and incorporating them into the investment review the regulators forced companies to consider explicitly the potential impacts of climate change in a consistent and rigorous manner. These analyses combined climate change with other pressures on water resources, and in practice companies did not attribute specific investment decisions or proposals to climate change or indeed any other individual drivers. The broad strategy adopted by all water supply companies - to maintain standards of service - is determined by regulatory controls and market considerations, but the degree of concern about the impacts of climate change and precise adaptation options necessary to address supply-demand imbalances varied between water supply companies, reflecting local geographic conditions. The water supply companies and regulators have different perspectives on the relative merits of supply-side and demand-side measures, reflecting different organisational priorities. The 2004 investment review determined that no specific actions were necessary to deal with future climate change, but that measures set in place - in terms of methodologies and investment in investigations into specific resource developments - provided a sound foundation for more specific actions in the next investment review in five years time. The paper concludes by summarising the factors assisting and constraining adaptation over the next few decades. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",,"Hydrology; Investments; Regional planning; Regulatory compliance; Strategic planning; Water supply; Economic regulation; Market considerations; Public water supply; Resource developments; Strategy selection; Climate change; adaptation; analytical method; assessment method; climate change; hydrological modeling; public sector; water resource; water supply; England; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Wales; Western Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749320246

The role of DNS in delivering new Scientific insight into turbulent combustion is illustrated using results from a recent 3D turbulent premixed flame simulation. To understand the influence of turbulence on the flame structure, a 3D fully-resolved DNS of a spatially-developing lean methane-air turbulent Bunsen flame was performed in the thin reaction zones regime. A reduced chemical model for methane-air chemistry consisting of 13 resolved species, 4 quasi-steady state species and 73 elementary reactions was developed specifically for the current simulation. The data is analyzed to study possible influences of turbulence on the flame thickness. The results show that the average flame thickness increases, in qualitative agreement with several experimental results. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749074227

The principal organic compound is methylmercury (MeHg). The primary route of exposure to MeHg for humans is consumption of fish. The safe dose (reference dose, RfD) of MeHg that can be consumed without neurotoxicological consequences is 0.1 μg per kg b.w./day. According to available data, the whole population of certain European countries or people who consume large quantities of fish are exposed to doses of MeHg that exceed the RfD. Given this level of mercury exposure, in order to avoid or reduce the expected neurotoxic consequences on foetuses we propose the following strategy: 1) At present the most reasonable solution for pregnant women (and small children) is to reduce substantially or completely avoid fish intake. 2) In the medium term the European Community should evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of breeding uncontaminated fish in order to reduce the drawbacks of banning fish consumption. 3) In the long term there is no alternative to substantially reducing mercury emissions worldwide. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.","Children; European Community; Fish consumption; Methylmercury","mercury; methylmercury; organic compound; bioaccumulation; biotransformation; breeding; child; child health; environmental exposure; environmental release; Europe; fish; food intake; human; neurotoxicity; pregnant woman; priority journal; review; safety; Animals; Child; Child Welfare; Diet; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Europe; European Union; Female; Humans; Mercury; Mercury Poisoning; Mercury Poisoning, Nervous System; Pregnancy; Seafood",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749070350

We have carried out a survey of 60 Herbig Ae/Be stars in the 3 micron wavelength region in search for the rare spectral features at 3.43 and 3.53 micron. These features have been attributed to the presence of large, hot, hydrogen-terminated nanodiamonds. Only two Herbig Ae/Be stars, HD 97048 and Elias 3-1 are known to display both these features. Methods. We have obtained medium-resolution spectra (R ∼ 2500) with the ESO near-IR instrument ISAAC in the 3.15-3.65 micron range. Results. In our sample, no new examples of sources with prominent nanodiamond features in their 3 micron spectra were discovered. Less than 4% of the Herbig targets show the prominent emission features at 3.43 and/or 3.53 μn. Both features are detected in our spectrum of HD 97048. We confirm the detection of the 3.53 μm feature and the non-detection of the 3.43 μm feature in MWC 297, Furthermore, we report tentative 3.53 μm detections in V921 Sco, HD 163296 and T CrA. The sources which display the nanodiamond features are not exceptional in the group of Herbig stars with respect to disk properties, stellar characteristics, or disk and stellar activity. Moreover, the nanodiamond sources are very different from each other in terms of these parameters. We do not find evidence for a recent supernova in the vicinity of any of the nanodiamond sources. We have analyzed the PAH 3.3 μ feature and the Pfund δ hydrogen emission line, two other spectral features which occur in the 3 micron wavelength range. We reinforce the conclusion of previous authors that flared-disk systems display significantly more PAH emission than self-shadowed-disk sources. The Pf δ line detection rate is higher in self-shadowed-disk sources than in the flareddisk systems. Conclusions. We discuss the possible origin and paucity of the (nano)diamond features in Herbig stars. Different creation mechanisms have been proposed in the literature, amongst others in-situ and supernova-induced formation. Our data set is inconclusive in proving or disproving either formation mechanism. © ESO 2006.","Circumstellar matter; Planetary systems: protoplanetary disks; Stars: pre-main-sequence","Circumstellar matter; Nanodiamond sources; Protoplanetary disks; Supernova; Astronomy; Hydrogen; Nanostructured materials; Optical resolving power; Space research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749068860

Noise levels were measured in 3 types of buses: (1) bi-articulated, (2) speedy, and (3) feeder, 20 buses of each type. Bi-articulated buses are formed by three cars and two hinges, and operate in exclusive lanes, where cars are not allowed. They stop at specific stations intended for rapid loading and unloading of passengers. Speedy buses operate in regular streets across the city, but they stop at fewer stations than other buses. Feeder buses operate normally in the whole city, along regular streets and bus stops. The evaluation of noise levels in the workplace of bus drivers (that is, inside buses) was performed according to ISO 1999 (Determination of occupational noise exposure), and the brazilian Standards NHO-01 (Occupational Health Standard), and NR 17 (Standard for Ergonomics). In 56 out of the 60 buses examined, the normalized noise exposure levels LEX,8h were below 82 dB(A). The quality of the workplace was thus considered as ""acceptable"". The four buses with measured noise levels above 82 dB(A) demand the adoption of preventive and corrective measures (NHO-01) aiming at reducing noise emission levels. These buses are older and have the engine located in the front. On the other hand, when NR-17 is used as a reference for the evaluation of the noise quality in the workplace of the bus drivers, all buses were considered uncomfortable, with LEX,8h&gt;65 dB(A). Year of manufacture and location of the engine are two factors that highly contribute to the level of noise reaching the driver. These considerations are of relevance, as the placement of the bus engine can be decided at the time of projecting the bus. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, the flame structure and the NOx emission characteristics of the Smithells flame were compared with those of the ordinary Bunsen flame under the same conditions, and its NOx reduction mechanism was investigated in detail. It was found experimentally that the Smithells flames have about 40% less total NOx emission than Bunsen flames. The numerically simulated flame structures are in good agreement with those of the experimental results, and the reduction rate of NOx emission also agreed well. From the numerical results it was found that the reduction is mainly caused by the suppression of Zeldovich NO due to the temperature decrease of the outer flame, and to the absence of the active production of O radicals at the flame base that are inherently formed by an interaction between the outer flame and the inner flame in the case of Bunsen flame. A secondary cause of the reduction is a deoxidization process from NO to N2 in the reduction atmosphere of the interconal regions of the Smithells flames, in which cooling by the outer tube wall promotes the conversion from NO to HNO in the reaction loop NO → HNO → NH → N → NO. © 2006 The Combustion Institute.","Bunsen flame; Deoxidization; NOx; Smithells flame; Two-staged combustion","Combustion; Cooling; Laminar flow; Nitrogen oxides; Reaction kinetics; Reduction; Bunsen flame; Deoxidization; Smithells flame; Two staged combustion; Flame research; methane; nitric oxide; nitrogen; Combustion; Cooling; Flame research; Laminar flow; Nitrogen oxides; Reaction kinetics; Reduction; air; analytic method; article; atmosphere; combustion; comparative study; cooling; fire; kinetics; priority journal; reduction kinetics; smithells flame",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748977988

The reactor's efficiency, defined as the enthalpy of the calcination reaction at ambient temperature (3184 kJ kg-1) divided by the solar energy input, reached 30-35% for quicklime production rates up to 4 kg h-1. The solar lime reactor prototype operated reliably for more than 100 h at solar flux inputs of about 2000 kW m-2, withstanding the thermal shocks that occur in solar high temperature applications. By substituting concentrated solar energy for fossil fuels as the source of process heat, one can reduce by 20% the CO2 emissions in a state-of-the-art lime plant and by 40% in a conventional cement plant. The cost of solar lime produced in a 20 MWth industrial solar calcination plant is estimated in the range 131-158 $/t, i.e. about 2-3 times the current selling price of conventional lime. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Dominant plants provide habitat and ecosystem structure, so changes in their distribution can be expected to have cascading effects on entire communities. Observing areas that respond quickly to climate fluctuations provides foresight into future ecological changes and will help prioritize conservation efforts. We investigated patterns of mortality in six dominant plant species during a drought in the southwestern United States. We quantified population mortality for each species across its regional distribution and tested hypotheses to identify ecological stress gradients for each species. Our results revealed three major patterns: (1) dominant species from diverse habitat types (i.e., riparian, chaparral, and low- to high-elevation forests) exhibited significant mortality, indicating that the effects of drought were widespread; (2) average mortality differed among dominant species (one-seed juniper [Juniperus monosperma (Engelm.) Sarg.] 3.3%; manzanita [Arctostaphylos pungens Kunth], 14.6%; quaking aspen [Populus tremuloides Michx.], 15.4%; ponderosa pine [Pinus ponderosa P. & C. Lawson], 15.9%; Fremont cottonwood [Populus fremontii S. Wats.], 20.7%; and pinyon pine [Pinus edulis Engelm.], 41.4%); (3) all dominant species showed localized patterns of very high mortality (24-100%) consistent with water stress gradients. Land managers should plan for climatic uncertainty by promoting tree recruitment in rare habitat types, alleviating unnatural levels of competition on dominant plants, and conserving sites across water stress gradients. High-stress sites, such as those we examined, have conservation value as barometers of change and because they may harbor genotypes that are adapted to climatic extremes. ©2006 Society for Conservation Biology.","Climate change; Fragmentation; Fremont cottonwood; Manzanita; One-seed juniper; Pinyon pine; Ponderosa pine; Quaking aspen; Rare habitat; Water stress","barometry; climate change; conservation planning; drought; ecosystem dynamics; environmental stress; habitat type; management practice; mortality risk; plant; population distribution; population structure; article; disaster; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; metabolism; mortality; plant; population dynamics; United States; Arizona; Disasters; Ecosystem; Greenhouse Effect; Mortality; Natural Disasters; Plants; Population Dynamics; North America; United States; Arctostaphylos; Arctostaphylos pungens; Arctostaphylos uva-ursi; Juniperus; Juniperus monosperma; Pinus edulis; Pinus ponderosa; Populus fremontii; Populus tremuloides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748946411

Bio-ethanol is such a promising renewable fuel. However, today it is produced from sugar or starch-raw materials that are relatively expensive. To lower the production cost of bio-ethanol the cost of the raw material must be reduced and the production process made more efficient. The production of bio-ethanol from corn stover using simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) at high dry matter content addresses both issues. Corn stover is an agricultural by-product and thus has a low economic value. SSF at high dry matter content results in a high ethanol concentration in the fermented slurry, thereby decreasing the energy demand in the subsequent distillation step. In this study, SSF was performed on steam-pretreated corn stover at 5, 7.5 and 10% water-insoluble solids (WIS) with 2 g/L hexose-fermenting Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ordinary compressed baker's yeast). SSF at 10% WIS resulted in an ethanol yield of 74% based on the glucose content in the raw material and an ethanol concentration of 25 g/L. Neither higher yeast concentration (5 g/L) nor yeast cultivated on the liquid after the pretreatment resulted, under these conditions, in a higher overall ethanol yield. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The amounts of carbon disulfide adsorbed by three modified carbon samples are all larger than that of the raw one. It is found that organic amine is more effective than KOH as active ingredient for modification of activated carbon. The Freundlich equation is found to be the best model to fit the isotherm data for the four carbon samples at different temperatures studied. The isosteric heats of adsorption on the four carbon samples, derived from the adsorption isotherms using the Clapeyron equation, decrease with increase of surface loading. The heat of adsorption lies between 17.7 and 51.4 kJ/mol, where the carbon sample modified with KOH and ethylenediamine has the highest value with the exception of the case of high surface coverage (> 3.5 mmol/g). It is also found that the choice of adsorption isotherm has a significant influence on the values of isosteric heat of adsorption calculated. The isosteric heats of adsorption at zero surface loadings for the four carbon samples are 53.93, 53.87, 45.17 and 65.54 kJ/mol respectively and the carbon sample modified with KOH and ethylenediamine has the highest value. Analysis of the thermodynamic data shows the mobility of adsorbed carbon disulfide increases with increase of surface loading in all cases. The observed entropy change associated with the adsorption is higher than the theoretical value for the mobile adsorption but lower than the theoretical value for the localized adsorption in all cases except the carbon sample modified with KOH and ethylenediamine at higher surface coverage (> 4 mmol/g). The observed entropy change also decreases with increase of surface loading in all cases. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Simplified multiple linear regression equations are developed from a database of the EPA's MOBILE6 computations to calculate emission factors. The coefficient of determination (R2) values of the models range from 0.82 to 0.99. The methodology has been implemented in Mississippi and validated for rural areas in Ohio.

Considerable attention has been given to woody encroachment in the western US and the role it might play as a carbon sink; however, in many parts of the western US the reverse process is also occurring. The conversion of woody shrublands to annual grasslands involves the invasion of non-native cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) which in turn leads to increased frequency and extent of fires. We compared carbon storage in adjacent plots of invasive grassland and native shrubland. We scaled-up the impact of this ecosystem shift using regional maps of the current invasion and of the risk of future invasion. The expansion of cheatgrass within the Great Basin has released an estimated 8±3 TgC to the atmosphere, and will likely release another 50±20 TgC in the coming decades. This ecosystem conversion has changed portions of the western US from a carbon sink to a source, making previous estimates of a western carbon sink almost certainly spurious. The growing importance of invasive species in driving land cover changes may substantially change future estimates of US terrestrial carbon storage. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bromus tectorum; Carbon budget; Cheatgrass; Fire; Great Basin; Invasive species; Land cover change; Woody encroachment","carbon budget; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; fire; global change; invasive species; land cover; shrubland; North America; United States; Bromus; Bromus tectorum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748670693

Location: Finland, northern Europe. Methods: Data from a national butterfly atlas survey carried out during 1991-2003, with a 10-km grain grid system, were used in these analyses. We used generalized additive models (GAM) and hierarchical partitioning (HP) to explore the main environmental correlates (climate and land-cover) of the realized niches of 98 butterfly species. The accuracy of the distribution models (GAMs) was validated by resubstitution and cross-validation approaches, using the area under the curve (AUC) derived from the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plots. Results: Predictive accuracies of the 98 individual environment-butterfly models varied from low to very high (cross-validated AUC values 0.48-0.99), with a mean of 0.79. The results of both the GAM and HP analyses were broadly concordant. Most of the variation in butterfly distributions is associated with growing degree-days, mean temperature of the coldest month and cover of built-up area in all six phylogenetic groups (butterfly families). There were no statistically significant differences in predictive accuracy among the different butterfly families. Main conclusions: About three-quarters of the distributions of butterfly species in Finland appear to be governed principally by climatic, predominantly temperature-related, factors. This indicates that many butterfly species may respond rapidly to the projected climate change in boreal regions. By determining the ecological niches of multiple species, we can project their range shifts in response to changes in climate and land-cover, and identify species that are particularly sensitive to forecasted global changes. © 2006 The Authors.","AUC; Butterfly atlas; Climate; Distribution; Finland; GRASP; Hierarchical partitioning; Land-cover","butterfly; climate effect; geographical distribution; graphical method; land cover; model validation; niche; numerical model; Eurasia; Europe; Finland; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Papilionoidea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748545281

Yet, some solution is required to reduce emissions of methane and trace constituents to the atmosphere for the protection of the public and of the global climate. Methane oxidation, as a natural biochemical process, offers an opportunity to reduce methane emissions with a simple, passive alternative cover system. The goal of this article is to develop an effective design of Methane Oxidation Covers to achieve superior methane management performance while still producing equivalent closure conditions to conventional covers in semi-arid, cold climates. specifically, the goal is to reduce methane surface emissions by 50% to 80%, with no significant increase in leachate production compared with conventional covers of clay and topsoil. A field pilot test of an alternative cover system with gas collection, methane oxidation and heat extraction was conducted on an operating MSW/ICI waste landfill in Western Canada from August 2001 to February 2005. The cool, semi-arid region experiences cold winters (down to minus 40°C) for up to 5 months of the year, and annual precipitation rates of 150 mm to 450 mm p.a., of which one third to one half falls as snow. The need to direct gas from large surface areas to gas control zones of minimal area led to the configuration of the system of gas collection trenches connected to a central methane oxidation (MethOx) bed. The need to keep the bed above 5°C in winter required the development of a simple, passive heat transfer system. The maintenance of suitable moisture contents and the restriction of percolation were accomplished by the choice of filter material and the layering of the bed over the gas percolation layer. The test program was conducted in three phases from August 2001 to February 2005. In the first test phase, a methane oxidation bed of yardwaste compost performed well during the summer, but froze from November to April and did not resume oxidation until May. Oxygen was always present at or above 3%(vol.) and the moisture content remained above 25%(vol.) in the lower layer of the bed. The freezing temperature caused the most serious performance reduction. In the next phases of the study, a passive heating system was installed in an accelerated methane oxidation bed. Heat exchange from inside the landfill to the filter raised the bed temperature to 14 to 18°C during the third winter of the test. The moisture contents of 25% to 50% (v/v) in the bed were high, but the percolation rate was only 7.3 mm/a, or about 2% of total precipitation. The methane oxidation performance increased with the heating of the bed, from a 33% emission reduction in an unheated bed, up to 89% in a well heated filter bed. The achievement of high oxidation performance (over 80%), the complete reduction of surface emissions from the test area (to zero), and the low percolation rate through the filter bed (less that 2%) constitute a proof of principle for MethOx covers in cool, semi-arid climates. The possible improvement of the Alternative Cover System's performance by adding vegetation to the filter bed is currently being tested in the ongoing research project. © Springer 2006.","Alternative cover design; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Heat extraction; Heat recovery; Landfill gas management; Methane oxidation; MSW landfill","Biochemistry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Land fill; Methane; Oxidation; Solid wastes; Waste heat utilization; Greenhouse gases; Heat extraction; Landfill gas management; Air pollution control; methane; oxygen; Air pollution control; Biochemistry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Land fill; Methane; Oxidation; Solid wastes; Waste heat utilization; cold region; emission; greenhouse gas; methane; municipal solid waste; oxidation; semiarid region; article; field emission; gas analysis parameters; heat acclimatization; landfill; oxidation kinetics; oxidation reduction reaction; pedogenesis (soil); precipitation; semiarid climate; solid waste management; Canada; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748473587

Anthropogenic activities, industrialization, farming activities, transport, urbanization, animal and human excretions, domestic wastes and copper mining have affected the river, contaminating it and its sediments with heavy metals. Concentration and distribution of Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd were studied with the purpose of determining their bioavailability and their relation with the characteristics of the sediments. Freshly deposited seasonal sediments were collected from 0-8 cm depths from 6 locations (S1 to S6) along the 30-km long channel length, in the four seasons of year on the following dates: May 2001 (D1, autumn); August 2001 (D2, winter); October 2001 (D3, spring) and January 2002 (D4, summer). The dried samples were sifted to obtain the &lt; 63-μm sediment fraction, since it has been shown that large amounts of heavy metals are bound in the fine-grained fraction of the sediment. Cu and Zn were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry and Pb and Cd by square wave anodic stripping voltammetry. The highest concentrations of Cu (2850 μg g- 1) were found in the northern part of the river (S1, average D1-D4), near the mountains and a copper mine, and then decreased downstream to 209 μg g- 1 (S6). Total Zn showed an irregular variation, with higher values at S1 (1290 μg g- 1) and high values in some winter sampling (1384 μg g- 1 S4, S5-D2). Pb showed different trends, increasing from S1 to S6 (17 to 61 μg g- 1), with the highest values in the summer samples (83 μg g- 1, S4-S6, D4), and total Cd increased slightly from mean values of 0.2 and 0.5 μg g- 1. Partition into five fractions was made using Tessier's analytical sequential extraction technique; the residue was treated with aqua regia for recovery studies, although this step is not part of the Tessier procedure. The results show that Cu, Zn and Pb in the sediments were dependent on the sampling places along the river, and variation in two years was low (D1-D4). The highest values of total organic matter, carbonate and conductivity were found in S6, which has the smallest size particles, while at S1 the sediments were predominantly sand and contain larger amounts of silica. Cu associated with carbonate decreased gradually from 58% (1771 μg g- 1, S1) to 16% (32 μg g- 1, S6); Cu bonded to reducible fraction was almost constant (33% to 37%), and Cu associated with oxidizable fraction increased from 7% (S1) to 34% (S6), but copper content was lower (214 to 68 μg g- 1). Zn had a similar fractionation profile. However, Pb bound to oxidizable fraction did not show significant percent variation along the river (20% to 19%), but the amount bounded was 4 to 12 μg g- 1. The residual fraction increased from 24% to 41% (5 to 25 μg g- 1, S1 to S6). The distribution of Cd in the sediment was almost independent of the sampling stations and was bound to carbonate, reducible and residual fraction in similar proportion. Cu and Zn at S1 were mainly bound to carbonates and reducible phases with 91% and 73% (2779 and 965 μg g- 1, respectively), and with a change in the pH and/or the redox potential of the sediment-water system, these contaminants could easily enter the food chain. In S6 the amount of Cu and Zn in these phases was 50% and 53% (100 to 313 μg g- 1, respectively). © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Both the approaches are based on the comparison between seasonal weekends' and weekdays' data. Relative differences observed between Sundays' and weekdays' PM10 concentrations are analysed in terms of their probability distributions for the cold and warm season separately. As a consequence of the reduced circulating traffic flows, Sundays' concentration levels are on average about 20% lower, but an increase of concentration levels is sometimes observed under unfavourable meteorological conditions. The effect of the reduced traffic on Sundays is assessed also in terms of particles' number concentration. The results obtained by the analysis of weekly PM10 concentration data are compared to information derived from the emission inventory for traffic. From observed reduction of Sundays' traffic flow, the corresponding expected variation in primary PM10 emissions from traffic is calculated accounting for both exhaust and non-exhaust contribution. Seasonal probability distribution of PM10 emission variations are obtained by implementing the COPERT III methodology in a Monte Carlo simulation: on Sundays estimated values of PM10 emissions always result lower than on weekdays and on average about 50% less. Based on estimated reductions for PM10 traffic emission and on observed reductions for PM10 ambient air concentrations, traffic emissions appear responsible for about 50% of the PM10 concentration levels in the urban area. This contribution is both due to exhaust and non-exhaust emissions: depending on site exposure to the traffic source, out of the 50% contribution of total traffic emissions to PM10 concentrations, a 4-40% share is estimated to come directly from the exhaust, whereas the remaining share derives from non-exhaust emissions and resuspension of soil dust. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The overall dissolution reactions were also examined by combining the anodic and cathodic polarisation curves. The presence of clay coatings affected neither the anodic curve shapes nor the peak positions for gold oxidation nor changed the cathodic curve appearance for oxygen reduction. The peak current densities slightly reduced in the presence of clay coating and this trend became more noticeable with an increase in the coating thickness. Non-conductive clay only acted as a barrier to the diffusion of reagents to the gold surface, but did not galvanically interact with gold. Different carbon coatings, natural carbonaceous matter from Stawell gold ore, activated carbon and graphite, performed similarly in affecting the anodic gold oxidation, i.e., the shift of rest potential to a more anodic position, the narrowing of the first peak region (a more cathodic overpotential region), the shift of current peaks to more anodic positions and the high current densities at high overpotentials over 0.7 V. The carbon coatings changed the wave appearance for oxygen reduction. In the presence of the carbon coatings, the current densities for oxygen reduction became lower at less cathodic potentials and became higher at more cathodic potentials, and the current densities for oxygen reduction increased with an increase in the thickness of the carbon coatings. The presence of the carbon coatings did not change the reaction control mechanisms for either gold oxidation or oxygen reduction. The combination of anodic and cathodic reactions indicated that the carbon coatings significantly reduced the gold oxidation rates with increasing coating thickness, in agreement with the leach results. The oxidation potentials shifted to a more anodic direction with increased thickness of the carbon coatings. The magnitude of the decrease in the gold oxidation rates was comparable for the different carbon coatings at a similar thickness, despite their microstructures, surface areas and activities being significantly different. The results showed that the carbon coatings galvanically interacted with gold. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The effect of the use of studded tyres on concentrations in a street canyon has been quantitatively assessed using monitoring data. A 10% decrease in the fraction of studded tyres was estimated to reduce the weekly average street canyon PM10 levels (due to local road abrasion) by about 10 μg m-3 if only daytime and dry street conditions were considered. These results are obtained by correlating the increase in PM10 levels during autumn with the increased use of studded tyres. Since the share of studded tyres is around 75% in Stockholm during wintertime, the peak springtime PM10 levels that occur during dry road conditions would be substantially lower if the use of studded tyres were regulated. Intense sweeping or washing of the pavements resulted in marginal reductions (&lt;10%) and will have no important influence on the PM10 levels with the methodologies and working machineries tested here. Application of calcium magnesium acetate (CMA, Ice Away, as 25% water solution) on the road surface of a highway during dry conditions resulted in an average reduction of around 35% in the daily PM10 averages. The most efficient way to reduce PM10 levels in the long-term and for a large area is to reduce the use of studded tyres, while application of CMA may be efficient to reduce peak levels, which frequently occur during dry road conditions in spring. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

R. Grace operated a vermiculite plant in a mixed industrial/residential area of northeast Minneapolis from 1936 to 1989. The plant processed vermiculite ore contaminated with amphibole asbestos from a mine in Libby, MT. Air monitoring in the early 1970s found fiber concentrations in excess of 10 fibers per cubic centimeter of air (f/cc), indicating that worker exposure to asbestos was occasionally 100 times the current occupational standard. Residents of the surrounding community also had direct contact with vermiculite processing wastes (containing up to 10% amphibole asbestos) that were made freely available. Children played on waste piles and neighborhood residents hauled the wastes away for home use. In total, 259 contaminated residential properties have been found to date. Reported emission factors and plant process data were used as inputs to model airborne emissions from the plant over several operating scenarios using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ISC-Prime model. Results estimate short-term air concentrations of asbestos fibers in residential areas nearest the plant may have at times exceeded current occupational standards. Exposure estimates for other pathways were derived primarily from assessments done in Libby by the U.S. EPA. The Northeast Minneapolis Community Vermiculite Investigation (NMCVI) was conducted by the Minnesota Department of Health to identify and characterize the exposures of a cohort of over 6000 people who live or lived in Northeast Minneapolis and may have been exposed to asbestos. This cohort is now being investigated in a respiratory health screening study conducted by the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota Department of Health.

The amount of input depends not only on the size of structural C pools but also on their loss rates. • In the field, we examined the effects of elevated atmospheric partial pressures of CO2 (pCO2) and nitrogen (N) supply on pool size and rates of structural C loss in stubble and roots of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) by using multiple-pulse labelling and steady-state labelling. • Stubble retained structural C for roughly half the time it was retained in roots. Elevated pCO2 combined with low N supply enlarged the pools of roots and stubble. These conditions also stimulated the rate of structural C loss from stubble and, thus, the amounts available for further transformation. • The potential of multiple-pulse labelling as a field technique is highlighted. The stimulation of structural C loss from stubble by elevated pCO2 at low N provides a missing link between increased C assimilation and low yield response and indicates a potentially higher input of structural C into the soil. © The Authors (2006).","Elevated CO2; Lolium perenne (perennial ryegrass); Managed grassland; Pulse labelling; Roots; Steady-state labelling; Structural carbon loss; Stubble","carbon; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; atmospheric pressure; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; grass; grassland soil; nitrogen; nutrient loss; root; stubble; article; biomass; chemistry; Lolium; metabolism; plant root; soil; time; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Lolium; Nitrogen; Plant Roots; Soil; Time Factors; Lolium perenne",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747618695

Results from bagging areas within the same three facilities have been previously published. Particle number and mass concentration measurements were conducted in these work areas and at ambient comparison sites at each of the three carbon black plants. No elevated ultrafine particle number concentrations (UFP, &lt;100 nm) with respect to ambient were determined in the work areas of Plant 1, intermittently elevated concentrations at Plant 2, and permanently elevated concentrations at Plant 3. The intermittently elevated UFP concentrations in the pelletizer and reactor areas of Plant 2 could be related to nearby traffic emissions. The ultrafine particle number concentrations at Plant 2 are comparable to those determined at urban traffic sites. Both work areas of Plant 3 showed elevated UFP concentrations in the pelletizer and reactor areas. In the case of the reactor, which was the only enclosed reactor area investigated among the three facilities, the source of the elevated UFP number concentration was most likely attributable to grease and oil fumes from maintenance activities, a conclusion supported by carbon fractionation analysis. The elevated UFP number concentrations in the pelletizing area in this same plant are related to leaks in the production line, which allowed particulate matter to escape to the surrounding areas. Absolute PM10 mass concentrations were all within normal ambient concentrations except for the pelletizing area in Plant 3, which showed continuous levels above ambient. One additional source contributing to peak level PM10 mass concentrations were all within normal ambient concentrations except for the pelletizing area in Plant 3 which showed continuous levels above ambient. One additional source contributing to peak level PM10 mass concentrations at Plant 2 was due to wind dispersion from a carbon black spill incident the day prior to measurements. It is concluded from these measurements that no carbon black is released in the reactor and pelletizing areas (as UFP or PM10) from the closed production lines under normal operating conditions.

Vast areas of the Tibetan Plateau are underlain by predominantly warm permafrost, which is actually degrading due to a rise in mean surface temperatures caused by global warming. Because of the important role of surface temperature variations on the Tibetan Plateau for the onset and characteristic of the monsoon circulation over south-east Asia, it becomes evident that a consistent climate monitoring strategy in the region is urgently required. As permafrost reacts sensitively to changes in surface temperature, it is considered as a key variable in such a regional climate monitoring system. The Permafrost and Climate in Europe (PACE) project developed standardised methods for the monitoring of permafrost temperatures and distribution in European mountains, which are in good agreement with the site selection criteria of the GCOS Global Terrestrial Network-Permafrost (GTN-P).

The unvegetated sediments showed lower C/N ratios (with the lowest value occurring in the deep organic-rich muddy site) than the seagrass (Ruppia or Zostera) beds, which may be due to the contribution of microalgae (mainly diatoms) to the sedimentary organic matter pool. This was also supported by the detection of microalgal pigments in the bare sediments. On an annual basis, seagrass beds exhibited the highest gross primary productivity (O2 or TCO2 fluxes), while the lowest rates occurred in the deep central basin of the Lake. Seasonally, there was a general trend of highest production in spring or summer, and lowest production in winter or autumn. Organic carbon oxidation scenarios, evaluated by either calcium carbonate dissolution or sulfate reduction models, indicated that both models can explain organic matter mineralization. Trophic status was evaluated using different indices including benthic trophic state index, net O2 fluxes and P/R ratios for Lake Illawarra, which led to similar trophic classifications in general, and also the same trends in spatial and seasonal variations. Overall, these data indicated that the Lake was heterotrophic on an annual basis, as the total community carbon respiration exceeded production, and this supported an earlier LOICZ mass balance/stoichiometric modelling conclusion. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In the case of tropical landfills, where high temperature and evaporation occurs, leachate recirculation may not be enough to maintain the moisture content, therefore supplemental water addition into the cell is an option that could help stabilize moisture levels as well as stimulate biological activity. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of leachate recirculation and supplemental water addition on municipal solid waste decomposition and methane production in three anaerobic digestion reactors. Anaerobic digestion with leachate recirculation and supplemental water addition showed the highest performance in terms of cumulative methane production and the stabilization period time required. It produced an accumulated methane production of 54.87 l/kg dry weight of MSW at an average rate of 0.58 l/kg dry weight/d and reached the stabilization phase on day 180. The leachate recirculation reactor provided 17.04 l/kg dry weight at a rate of 0.14 l/kg dry weight/d and reached the stabilization phase on day 290. The control reactor provided 9.02 l/kg dry weight at a rate of 0.10 l/kg dry weight/d, and reached the stabilization phase on day 270. Increasing the organic loading rate (OLR) after the waste had reached the stabilization phase made it possible to increase the methane content of the gas, the methane production rate, and the COD removal. Comparison of the reactors' efficiencies at maximum OLR (5 kg COD/m3/d) in terms of the methane production rate showed that the reactor using leachate recirculation with supplemental water addition still gave the highest performance (1.56 l/kg dry weight/d), whereas the leachate recirculation reactor and the control reactor provided 0.69 l/kg dry weight/d and 0.43 l/kg dry weight/d, respectively. However, when considering methane composition (average 63.09%) and COD removal (average 90.60%), slight differences were found among these three reactors. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Human intervention and climate change have modified nutrient dynamics and hydroperiod in the Everglades and peat loss due to such anthropogenic activities is evident. However, not much is known on the molecular level regarding the biogeochemical characteristics, which allow peat to be preserved in the Everglades. Lipid biomarkers trapped within or bound to humic-type structures can provide important geochemical information regarding the origin and microbial transformation of OM in peat. Four lipid fractions obtained from a Cladium peat, namely the freely extractable fraction and those associated with humin, humic acid, and fulvic acid fractions, showed clear differences in their molecular distribution suggesting different OM sources and structural and diagenetic states of the source material. Both, higher plant derived and microbial lipids were found in association with these humic-type substances. Most biomarker distributions suggest an increment in the microbial/terrestrial lipid ratio from the free to humin to humic to fulvic fractions. Microbial reworking of lipids, and the incorporation of microbial biomarkers into the humic-type fractions was evident, as well as the preservation of diagenetic byproducts. The lipid distribution associated with the fulvic acids suggests a high degree of microbial reworking for this fraction. Evidence for this 3D structure was obtained through the presence of the relatively high abundance of α,ω-dicarboxylic acids and phenolic and benzenecarboxylic compounds. The increment in structural complexity of the phenolic and benzencarboxylic compounds in combination with the reduction in the carbon chain length of the dicarboxylic acids from the free to fulvic fraction suggests the latter to be structurally the most stable, compacted and diagenetically altered substrate. This analytical approach can now be applied to peat samples from other areas within the Everglades ecosystem, affected differently by human intervention with the aim to assess changes in organic matter preservation. © Springer 2006.","Benzenecarboxylic acids; Diagenesis; Everglades; Humic and fulvic acids; Humin; Peat","Biomarkers; Carboxylic acids; Ecology; Ecosystems; Lipids; Molecular dynamics; Benzenecarboxylic acids; Diagenesis; Everglades; Humic and fulvic acids; Humin; Peat; accumulation; biomarker; climate change; fulvic acid; human activity; humic substance; mangrove; molecular analysis; nutrient dynamics; peat; preservation; Everglades; Florida [United States]; North America; United States; Cladium; Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746663462

The outlook of power industry development in Russia in the 21st century is first considered and its impact on Russia's greenhouse gas emissions is examined. Forecasts for developing Russia's economy and electric power industry in the first half of the 21st century are presented. Possible structural change in the electric power industry in Russia together with dynamic changes of CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in power plants are examined. It is shown that CO2 emissions from fuel combustion at power plants in Russia may increase 2.7-fold in 50 years. Calculations depict that specific CO2 emissions in Asian Russia exceed greatly that of the European part. It then reviews measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions in Greece. Impact of the currently adopted measures and initiatives to reduce emissions in the Greek energy system for the period up to 2030 is discussed with emphasis on the current decade. Under the scenario for environmental policy, the additional commitments and measures to limit CO2 emissions towards the Kyoto targets are discussed. The paper summarizes a possible Italian strategy for implementing Kyoto protocol mechanisms to meet commitments of the EU Emission Trading Draft Directive, the Italian strategy in the Ministerial documents, and final considerations. It then examines clean power generation technology for the 21st Century and gives a perspective from the EU power plant supply industry. A perspective is presented with respect to impact of global climate change on product development strategy. Fossil fuel based power generation technologies will continue to play an important part of the energy mix in the foreseeable future and different parts of the world will require different technologies to meet their local specific requirements. It will be necessary to continue to develop clean technologies and to promote their use world-wide. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The emulsification method is not only motivated by cost reduction but is also one of the potentially effective techniques to reduce exhaust emission from diesel engines. Water/diesel (W/D) emulsified formulations are reported to reduce the emissions of NOx, SOx, CO and particulate matter (PM) without compensating the engine's performance. Emulsion fuels with varying contents of water and diesel were prepared and stabilized by conventional and gemini surfactant, respectively. Surfactant's dosage, emulsification time, stirring intensity, emulsifying temperature and mixing time have been reported. Diesel engine performance and exhaust emission was also measured and analyzed with these indigenously prepared emulsified fuels. The obtained experimental results indicate that the emulsions stabilized by gemini surfactant have much finer and better-distributed water droplets as compared to those stabilized by conventional surfactant. A comparative study involving torque, engine brake mean effective pressure (BMEP), specific fuel consumption (SFC), particulate matter (PM), NOx and CO emissions is also reported for neat diesel and emulsified formulations. It was found that there was an insignificant reduction in engine's efficiency but on the other hand there are significant benefits associated with the incorporation of water contents in diesel regarding environmental hazards. The biggest reduction in PM, NOx, CO and SOx emission was achieved by the emulsion stabilized by gemini surfactant containing 15% water contents. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

For this study the land use model LUCHesse has been newly developed and coupled to a modified version of the Century model (GIS-Century) in the HILLS context. LUCHesse regionalizes macro-level area trends of land use types to the grid level in annual time steps. The generated sequence of land use maps serves as input to GIS-Century for calculating soil carbon sequestration.

In China there has been enormous economic growth since 1978 followed by impacts on the environmental, social and economical conduct of the society. One of the counter actions taken by the Government to halt the environmental degradation in the Loess Plateau has been the introduction of the Slope Land Conversion Program/Crop Conversion Program in 1999, stopping agricultural activity in slope areas, mainly used by small-scale farmers. At the same time climate variations have also been evident in the area, with decreases in rainfall and increases in temperature since 1970. The aim here is to examine what vegetation changes are seen at the regional scale in the area from 2000 to 2002 and how they correlate to local land-use changes. How the land-use changes are correlated with climate variations and/or policies and reforms is then investigated. The data included in this integrated assessment includes remote sensing information for the end of August from MODIS and ASTER images, climate and statistical data, as well as farmers' participatory data. The results show that the large-scale vegetation cover has increased, which correlates well with the dramatic local land-use change caused by the policy implementation. The land-use change shows some correlation with the climate variables (both lagged and simultaneous) but climatic factors alone do not fully explain the regional increase in vegetation. Hence the direct force behind the extreme land-use change is most likely associated with policy and economics, although climatic has some impact on regional scale vegetation pattern. The result from this study is contributing to the increasing growth of literature in climate change research on the complex issue of multiple stressors, i.e. processes that many areas in the developing world are exposed to. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The intermittent irrigation reduced total growing-season CH4 emission by 24.22% but increased N2 O emission by 23.72%, when compared with the continuous flooding. Soil Eh and four related bacterial groups were also measured to clarify their effects on gaseous emissions. Three ranges of soil redox potential were related to gas emissions: below -100 mV with vigorous CH4 emission, above +100 mV with significant N2 O emission, and +100 to -100 mV with little CH4 and N2 O emissions. Intermittently draining the field increased soil oxidation, with a decrease in CH4 emission and an increase in N2 O emission. In general the mid-season drainage slightly increased the populations of methanotrophs, nitrifiers, and denitrifiers but decreased that of methanogens.

CO2 concentrations [CO2] and temperatures (T) will probably increase and a decline of winter rainfall is predicted for south-west Australia. To be able to adapt crop systems to a changing climate it is important to know how different aspects of climate change affect agricultural production and how they interact. In a full factorial design we studied how higher T (2, 4 and 6 °C) elevated [CO2] (525 and 700 ppm) and five different rainfall scenarios affected wheat yield and grain protein. Effects of climate change were simulated with the Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM-Nwheat) using transformed historic weather data. Fifty years of yield and grain protein concentrations were simulated for three soil types at different locations on a north-south transect within the wheatbelt of south-west Australia. Simulation results showed that there were complex interactions between different aspects of climate change on crop systems. Effects of higher temperatures, elevated [CO2] and changed rainfall were in general not linear and differed significantly between soil types and location. Higher [CO2] increased yield especially at drier sites while higher temperatures had a positive effect in the cooler and wetter southern part of the region. The main difference between soil types was that heavier clay soils are most vulnerable to reduced rainfall while sandy soils were more vulnerable to higher temperatures. Elevated [CO2] reduced grain protein concentration and lower rainfall increased protein levels at all sites. Higher temperatures could both increase and decrease protein concentrations. In the southern, higher rainfall part of south-western Australia, yield and gross margin will increase for all likely future climate scenarios. In the drier part of the region, negative effects of 15% reduced rainfall can be compensated for by a 2 °C increase in temperature and 50% higher [CO2] concentrations. However due to the non-linearity of climate change effects a 30% reduction in rainfall cannot be compensated for by higher temperatures and [CO2].

Many previous studies have unrealistically assumed that imports are produced with the technology of the importing country. For countries with diverging technology and energy mixes the likely errors are significant. This study uses a model that explicitly includes regional technology differences to the case of Norway. It is found that CO2 emissions embodied in imports was 67% of Norway's domestic emissions. Around a half of this embodied pollution originates in developing countries, yet they represent only 10% of the value of Norwegian imports. In addition the carbon leakage from non-Annex I countries was at least 30%. We then argue that basing emission inventories on consumption, rather than production, may resolve not only issues related to international trade, but also provide greater flexibility towards pollution intensive resource endowments, emission reductions, and participation levels. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This is cause for concern but also an area to be targeted for emission reduction measures in national action plans. This paper proposes a methodological framework, using the Greek building sector (characterized by an aging building stock constructed mostly in the period before 1980) as a case study for the examination of the economic attractiveness of possible measures, which incorporates crucial parameters such as local climate, use of buildings, age of building stock, etc. that affect the energy conservation potential and consequently the economic performance of available measures. Utilizing this framework, the approach is able to classify measures into three categories, namely 'win-win' cases (i.e. where the implementation of emission reduction measures presents a net economic benefit for end-users), measures that require the implementation of appropriate economic support policies in order to make them economically attractive for end-users, and measures that have excessive cost. The results indicate that the emissions reduction potential of 'win-win' cases is significant. They also demonstrate how individual measures can provide significant reductions if carefully targeted economic support policies are applied. Finally, sensitivity analyses performed with respect to the discount rate applied indicate that it has a substantial impact on the economic performance of some measures and consequently on the magnitude of the 'win-win' potential associated to emissions reduction. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Many EU countries have released national long-term scenarios toward 2050, and their ambitious targets for CO2 emission reduction are aiming at a decrease of more than 50% of today's emission. In April 2004, Japan began a research project on its long-term climate policy. This paper discusses the long-term scenarios in other countries and the medium-term scenarios in Japan to support the development of a Japan's long-term climate stabilization scenario. In this study, CO2 emission is decomposed with an extended Kaya identity (indexes: CO2 capture and storage, carbon intensity, energy efficiency, energy intensity, economic activity) and a Reduction Balance Table is developed. In order to achieve the ambitious target of a 60-80% reduction, the pace of aggregated energy intensity improvement and carbon intensity decrease must be 2-3 times greater than the previous 40-year historical change, and the change rates need to be maintained for 50 years. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Comparison of water level observations dating back to 1938 and water balance scenarios for 1964-1998 assist in constraining the probable magnitude and likely direction of climate and regulation impacts on the water level history of the lake. Overall, the first-order analysis suggests that the effect of flow regulation has been to dampen annual water level variability by about 20 ± 2 cm, to reduce annual maximum water levels by about 14 ± 3 cm and to shift peak water levels earlier in the season by about 30 ± 8 days. Meanwhile, climate forcing has tended to enhance water level variability by 8 ± 2 cm, to enhance maximum water levels by 10 ± 3 cm and to advance the timing of maximum water levels slightly (11 ± 8 days). Climatic and regulation impacts appear to have generally counter-balanced changes in amplitude of water level changes and magnitude of peak levels but have cumulatively contributed to a seasonal shift toward earlier peak water levels in the lake. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Rice is a globally important staple food crop, with a wide distribution and constituting diversified varieties. The introduction of fish rearing to rice farming creates an integrated agro-ecological system. China boasts a history of 1700 years in rice-fish-farming practice. It is no longer a sole agro-production practice, but an agro-cultural pattern. Therefore, it has been listed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as one of the Globally Important Ingenious Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS). Qingtian County of the Zhejiang province has been selected as a pilot conservation site. The rice-fish-farming systems in China diversify China's agro-landscape and favor the conservation of species variety of both rice and fish. The survival of deep-water rice, an indigenous rice variety, and Oujiang red carp, an indigenous fish variety, are cases in point. Being low external input systems, the rice-fish-farming systems necessitate only small amounts of pesticide and fertilizer. The application of pesticides can be lowered to 50% of that of modern, high-input rice production; sometimes, no pesticide application is required. The natural enemies of rice pests show a prominent rise, making the bio-control of rice diseases and pests highly feasible. The rice-fish-farming system is also of great significance in global food security and global change. It provides food and animal protein for subsistence farmers living in ecologically-fragile mountainous regions. It also reduces economic risks that these farmers potentially face. The nitrogen-fixation role of the system increased the content of organic matter, total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the soil by 15.6-38.5%. It also reduces the emission of CH4 by nearly 30% compared with traditional rice farming. However, the economical development and industrialization in China pose a threat to rice-fish farming and, consequently, the numbers of farmers involved in rice-fish farming are decreasing. This calls for the Chinese government to engage itself in the conservation and development of this system and to innovate the existing technologies. It would also be useful, in the meantime, to exploit and conserve rice-fish farming as eco-tourism resources, so that the income of the mountainous farmers can be increased and this important, indigenous agro-culture be conserved and developed. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore a new approach to the modeling of air quality in the NWMB has been adopted by combining the global climate-chemistry model ECHAM5/MESSy and theregional modeling system MM5-EMICAT2000-CMAQ to analyze the high levels of photochemical air pollution during a typical summertime episode. We show that this combination of models is well suited to address the range of scales involved. The complexity of the area requires the application of high spatial and temporal resolution (2 km and 1 hour) modeling to cover local to regional interactions. We address the local and large-scale processes controlling tropospheric ozone in the NWMB, notably emissions and photochemistry, convective and advective transport, deposition processes, and stratosphere-troposphere exchange. The simulation results indicate that the ozone buildup largely results from local photochemical production, which strongly exceeds the removal rates through transport and deposition. The contribution by advective transport is limited, associated with the stagnant meteorological conditions. In the lower troposphere, local recirculation systems are of key importance. The strength of the land-sea breeze circulation and thermally or mechanically driven convection over the complex orography of the eastern Iberian coast can induce vertical transport and the layering of air pollution.

Climatic changes expected for temperature, atmospheric water vapor, and biogenic VOC emissions each individually cause a 1-5% increase in the daily peak ozone. Projected reductions in anthropogenic emissions of 10-50% in NOx and 50-70% in VOCs and CO have the greatest single effect, reducing ozone by 8-15% in urban areas. Changes to the chemical boundary conditions lead to ozone increases of 6% in the San Francisco Bay area and along the west coast but only 1-2% inland. Simulations combining climate effects predict that ozone will increase 3-10% in various regions of California. This increase is partly offset by projected future emissions reductions, and a combined climate and emissions simulation yields ozone reductions of 3-9% in the Central Valley and almost no net change in the San Francisco Bay area. We find that different portions of the model domain have widely varying sensitivity to climate parameters. In particular, the San Francisco Bay region is more strongly influenced by temperature changes than inland regions, indicating that air quality in this region may worsen under future climate regimes.

The inclusion of institutional variables in the form of International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives membership, ISO 14001 implementation, and non-profit sector activity addresses the ecological limitations of the often used IPAT (impact = population × affluence × technology) approach. Results: Results suggest the weak existence of an environmental Kuznets curve, in which the wealthiest cities are reducing their emissions through increased efficiency. Significant institutional impacts are also found to hold in the predicted directions. Specifically, panel and cross-sectional regressions indicate that membership in the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives and non-profit organizational presence have negative effects on industrial carbon dioxide emissions. Conclusion: The presence of institutional drivers at the city level provides empirical support for the POETICs rubric, which recasts the ecological framing of the IPAT identity in a more sociological mold. The results also indicate that Japanese civil society has a role to play in carbon mitigation. More refined studies need to take into consideration an expanded set of methods, drivers, and carbon budgets, as applied to a broader range of cases outside of Japan, to more accurately assess how civil society can bridge the issue of scale that separates local level policy concerns from global level climate dynamics. © 2006 Scholz; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248341274

Cobalt ferrite nanoparticles with different sizes were prepared by the thermal decomposition of acetate precursors and wet method techniques. CoFe2O4 nanoparticles were compacted, then isothermally reduced in H2 flow at 400-600 °C. The isothermal reduction profiles obtained show that a topochemical mode of reduction is developed as the process proceeds. The metallic phases of iron and cobalt, produced from the complete reduction of CoFe2O4 are in nanosize form. The prepared, completely reduced and reoxidized CoFe2O4 compacts were characterized by XRD, SEM and reflected light microscope. The reoxidation process is affected by both particle size and reoxidation temperature. At the initial stages, the reaction was controlled by the interfacial chemical reaction mechanism with some contribution of the gaseous diffusion mechanism. On the other hand, at the final stages the mechanism by which the reoxidation process proceeds was found to be the solid-state diffusion.

In the temperature range 473-573 K, H/D exchange proceeds without side reaction such as cracking at short contact times. Indeed the C-H bond has appeared favorably involved in the activation of neopentane compared to the less accessible C-C bond. The transition state allowing hydron exchange is most likely a carbonium species (pentacoordinated carbon) as in the case of the H/D exchange between methane and solid acid. The activation energies of the H/D exchange between neopentane and zeolites are the same for all zeolites indicating a common carbonium ion type transition state. On the basis of previous results in the case of the exchange between methane and liquid superacids, the deuterium exchange rates in neopentane were tentatively related to the acidity of the solids. However the order of activity MOR &gt; MFI &gt; BEA &gt; FAU seems to be related to the size of the pores, which may suggest the involvement of a confinement effect in the zeolites cavities.

The π-π stacked geometries were estimated by both the magnitudes of peak shifts with concentration and the directions of peak shifts induced by polar solvents. Two patterns of geometries with different π-π interaction strengths were found to coexist in solution for all the three samples. In both of the patterns, the preferential orientation of the stacking is the approach of the carbonyl groups on one molecule to the nitrogen atoms on the stacked partner, which makes the π-deficient aromatic atoms interact with both π-rich and π-deficient aromatic atoms of the stacked partner to maximize the electrostatic complementarity. Differently, whereas the molecules in one pattern are face-to-face stacked in a parallel fashion and slip two rings relative to one another along with the long axis of the conjugated ring systems, the molecules in the other are either face-to-face stacked in an antiparallel fashion with slight slipping between layers or stacked in a turning fashion. Both association constants obtained by fitting the dilution curves and thermodynamic parameters obtained from van't Hoff analyses revealed unexpectedly three thermodynamic processes of aggregations for all the three samples in the temperature region of 298-213 K.

The leaching behavior of organic carbon from incinerator bottom ash samples, obtained from two different solid waste sources, as well as the effects of calcium (Ca) on organic carbon (DOC) leaching associated with pH were therefore investigated in this paper. The effect of pH on the leaching of DOC and other major elements from bottom ash was ascertained through pH-stat leaching experiments. Column leaching experiments were carried out to evaluate the dependence of the leached amount of DOC on Ca leaching. It was found that the bottom ash produced by incineration of municipal solid waste (MSW) was composed of two DOC fractions: DOC leached independent (fraction I) of Ca leaching, observed at alkaline-neutral pH, and DOC leached dependent (fraction II) on Ca leaching, observed at acid pH. However, the bottom ash produced by incineration of industrial solid waste (ISW) was composed of only DOC fraction I. The addition of calcium oxide during incineration and the differences in the paper to plastic ratio in the physical composition of the solid wastes incinerated would explain the distinct organic carbon leaching behaviors of bottom ash samples. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

These films offer a wide range of exceptional physical, mechanical, biomedical and tribological properties that make them scientifically very fascinating and commercially essential for numerous industrial applications. Mechanically, certain DLC films are extremely hard (as hard as 90 GPa) and resilient, while tribologically they provide some of the lowest known friction and wear coefficients. Their optical and electrical properties are also extraordinary and can be tailored to meet the specific requirements of a given application. Because of their excellent chemical inertness, these films are resistant to corrosive and/or oxidative attacks in acidic and saline media. The combination of such a wide range of outstanding properties in one material is rather uncommon, so DLC can be very useful in meeting the multifunctional application needs of advanced mechanical systems. In fact, these films are now used in numerous industrial applications, including razor blades, magnetic hard discs, critical engine parts, mechanical face seals, scratch-resistant glasses, invasive and implantable medical devices and microelectromechanical systems. DLC films are primarily made of carbon atoms that are extracted or derived from carbon-containing sources, such as solid carbon targets and liquid and gaseous forms of hydrocarbons and fullerenes. Depending on the type of carbon source being used during the film deposition, the type of bonds (i.e. sp1, sp2, sp3) that hold carbon atoms together in DLC may vary a great deal and can affect their mechanical, electrical, optical and tribological properties. Recent systematic studies of DLC films have confirmed that the presence or absence of certain elemental species, such as hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, silicon, tungsten, titanium and fluorine, in their microstructure can also play significant roles in their properties. The main goal of this review paper is to highlight the most recent developments in the synthesis, characterization and application of DLC films. We will also discuss the progress made in understanding the fundamental mechanisms that control their very unique friction and wear behaviours. Novel design concepts and the principles of superlubricity in DLC films are also presented. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Friction; Hardness; Microelectromechanical devices; Microstructure; Tribology; Wear of materials; Magnetic hard discs; Mechanical face seals; Razor blades; Scratch-resistant glasses; Diamond like carbon films",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748353813

Examining species climatic preferences via bioclimatic niche modelling is a key tool to study this impact. There is an established link between bioclimatic niche models and phylogenetic diversification. A next step is to examine future distribution predictions from a phylogenetic perspective. We present such a study using Cyclamen (Myrsinaceae), a group which demonstrates morphological and phenological adaptations to its seasonal Mediterranean-type climate. How will the predicted climate change affect future distribution of this popular genus of garden plants? Results: We demonstrate phylogenetic structure for some climatic characteristics, and show that most Cyclamen have distinct climatic niches, with the exception of several wide-ranging, geographically expansive, species. We reconstruct climate preferences for hypothetical ancestral Cyclamen. The ancestral Cyclamen lineage has a preference for the seasonal Mediterranean climate characteristic of dry summers and wet winters. Future bioclimatic niches, based on BIOCLIM and Maxent models, are examined with reference to a future climate scenario for the 2050s. Over the next 50 years we predict a northward shift in the area of climatic suitability, with many areas of current distribution becoming climatically unsuitable. The area of climatic suitability for every Cyclamen species is predicted to decrease. For many species, there may be no areas with a suitable climate regardless of dispersal ability, these species are considered to be at high risk of extinction. This risk is examined from a phylogenetic perspective. Conclusion: Examining bioclimatic niches from a phylogenetic perspective permits novel interpretations of these models. In particular, reconstruction of ancestral niches can provide testable hypothesis about the historical development of lineages. In the future we can expect a northwards shift in climatic suitability for the genus Cyclamen. If this proves to be the case then dispersal is the best chance of survival, which seems highly unlikely for ant-dispersed Cyclamen. Human-assisted establishment of Cyclamen species well outside their native ranges offers hope and could provide the only means of dispersal to potentially suitable future environments. Even without human intervention the phylogenetic perspective demonstrates that major lineages could survive climate change even if many species are lost. © 2006 Yesson and Culham; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"article; climate; Cyclamen; evolutionary adaptation; medical research; nonhuman; phylogeny; precipitation; species extinction; algorithm; biodiversity; biological model; classification; climate; comparative study; Cyclamen; ecology; Europe; forecasting; greenhouse effect; physiology; season; Southern Europe; species difference; temperature; Cyclamen; Myrsinaceae; rain; Algorithms; Biodiversity; Climate; Cyclamen; Ecology; Europe; Forecasting; Greenhouse Effect; Mediterranean Region; Models, Biological; Phylogeny; Rain; Seasons; Species Specificity; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749989347

In addition, there is an interest in replicating these projects in order to restore other degraded areas, protect the Brazilian biomes, and help to diminish deforestation and forest fire, therefore reducing carbon emissions. The acquisition of 19,000 ha of degraded areas of high biological importance in southern Brazil was the first step towards the implementation of the projects. These areas are owned by SPVS, a Brazilian NGO, and are being restored, conserved and transformed into Private Natural Reserves, in partnership with the NGO - The Nature Conservancy, and financed by the companies - American Electric Power, General Motors and Chevron Texaco. The process of forest restoration involves several stages: soil studies, surveying the region's native plants, planning for restoration by means of a Geographical Information System, production of seedlings, application of different techniques for planting (such as manual or mechanised planting with seedlings and stakes), and biomass and biodiversity monitoring. To guarantee the survival of the seedlings on the planted areas, during the first three years, there is a continuous and systematic maintenance programme including weeding of undergrowth, crowing and organic fertilisation.

The authors find that anomalous atmospheric heat source s induced by absorbing aerosols (dust and black carbon) excite a planetary-scale teleconnection pattern in sea level pressure, temperature, and geopotential height spanning North Africa through Eurasia to the North Pacific. Surface cooling due to direct effects of aerosols is found in the vicinity and downstream of the aerosol source regions, that is, South Asia, East Asia, and northern and western Africa. Significant atmospheric heating is found in regions with large loading of dust (over northern Africa and the Middle East) and black carbon (over Southeast Asia). Paradoxically, the most pronounced feature in aerosol-induced surface temperature is an east-west dipole anomaly with strong cooling over the Caspian Sea and warming over central and northeastern Asia, where aerosol concentrations are low. Analyses of circulation anomalies show that the dipole anomaly is a part of an atmospheric teleconnection pattern driven by atmospheric heating anomalies induced by absorbing aerosols in the source regions, but the influence was conveyed globally through barotropic energy dispersion and sustained by feedback processes associated with the regional circulations. The surface temperature sign ature associated with the aerosol-induced teleconnection bears striking resemblance to the spatial pattern of observed long-term trend in surface temperature over Eurasia. Additionally, the boreal spring wave train pattern is similar to that reported by Fukutomi et al. associated with the boreal summer precipitation seesaw between eastern and western Siberia. The results of this study raise the possibility that global aerosol forcing during boreal spring may play an important role in spawning atmospheric teleconnections that affect regional and global climates. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric heating; Atmospheric teleconnection; Black carbon; Boreal spring; Surface cooling; Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Dust; Precipitation (meteorology); Atmospheric aerosols; aerosol; general circulation model; global climate; radiative forcing; regional climate; sea level pressure; sea surface temperature; teleconnection; Africa; Eurasia; North Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749629383

At sites along the California, Mexico, and Peru margins where there are estimates of mass accumulation rates, authigenic U accumulation rates range from ∼0-50 nmol m-2 day-1. At the California and Mexico margin sites Mo accumulation rates range from 0 to 134 nmol m-2 day-1 whereas at the Peru margin site rates may be as high as 550 nmol m-2 day-1. We observe relationships between metal accumulation rates and the delivery and burial rates of organic carbon (Corg). In the case of Mo there appears to be at least two relationships between metal accumulation rate and organic carbon burial. For most of the data presented in this manuscript, continental margin sediments have a Mo:Corg accumulation rate ratio of ∼20 μmol mol-1. This value is significantly lower, however, than those reported for anoxic basins ∼100 μmol mol-1, but is consistent with reported Mo:Corg rain ratios from Mexico margin sediment traps. In contrast to Mo, there appears to be a single U:Corg burial ratio of ∼5 μmol mol-1, which includes a range of environments from anoxic basins and open ocean sites. We interpret the relationships between metal accumulation and organic carbon to indicate that the reactions that govern authigenic metal accumulation are primarily sensitive to the delivery and burial of organic carbon in these particular settings. However, we note that any relationship between metal accumulation and organic carbon could be indirect. In the particular case of Mo, based on what is known about Mo geochemistry from the literature, it is possible that Mo authigenesis is coupled to sulfur cycling in many of the environments covered by this study, and that the observed association between Mo and organic carbon burial is a consequence of the coupling between carbon and sulfur burial. Using the observed relationships between Mo and Corg burial as well as constraints from the Mo isotope budget we estimate that continental margin sediments are an important sink for Mo. The magnitude of this sink (∼0.4 × 108 mol y-1, or larger) may be as much as one quarter of the oceanic removal term, and is likely to be larger than the modern anoxic basin sink. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

S. Environmental Protection Agency and various states. A promising method for mercury removal is catalytic oxidation of elemental mercury (Hg0) to oxidized mercury (Hg2+), followed by wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD). FGD cannot remove Hg 0, but easily removes Hg2+ because of its solubility in water. To date, research has focused on three broad catalyst areas: selective catalytic reduction catalysts, carbon-based materials, and metals and metal oxides. We review published results for each type of catalyst and also present a discussion on the possible reaction mechanisms in each case. One of the major sources of uncertainty in understanding catalytic mercury oxidation is a lack of knowledge of the reaction mechanisms and kinetics. Thus, we propose that future research in this area should focus on two major aspects: determining the reaction mechanism and kinetics and searching for more cost-effective catalyst and support materials.",,"Catalytic oxidation; Mercury emissions; Catalysts; Desulfurization; Environmental protection; Flue gases; Mercury (metal); Oxidation; Reaction kinetics; Air pollution control; coal; mercury; Air pollution control; Catalysts; Desulfurization; Environmental protection; Flue gases; Mercury (metal); Oxidation; Reaction kinetics; catalysis; coal-fired power plant; emission control; environmental protection; mercury (element); oxidation; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; catalyst; cost effectiveness analysis; desulfurization; flue gas; gas; kinetics; oxidation; reaction analysis; review; solubility; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Catalysis; Coal; Gases; Mercury; Metals; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxides",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748781752

This study presents the first long-range study of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) levels in precipitation which demonstrates that DOC concentrations have decreased by approximately half in Wilmington, NC, precipitation. The concentrations of H+(aq) and DOC are highly correlated primarily because small organic acids contribute to both DOC and H+(aq) in precipitation. Ammonium ion concentrations in precipitation have increased due to increased agricultural activities, and this also affects precipitation pH. The reduction of SO2 emissions in 1995 imposed by the Clean Air Act Amendment, better control of emissions of volatile organic compounds, and the increase in ammonia emissions all contribute to the decreasing H+(aq) in precipitation nationwide.

CsrA activity is regulated by two noncoding RNAs, CsrB and CsrC, which act by sequestering multiple CsrA dimers. Here, we describe a protein (CsrD) that controls the degradation of CsrB/C RNAs. The dramatic stabilization of CsrB/C RNAs in a csrD mutant altered the expression of CsrA-controlled genes in a manner predicted from the previously described Csr regulatory circuitry. A deficiency in RNase E, the primary endonuclease involved in mRNA decay, also stabilized CsrB/C, although the half-lives of other RNAs that are substrates for RNase E (rpsO, rpsT, and RyhB) were unaffected by csrD. Analysis of the decay of CsrB RNA, both in vitro and in vivo, suggested that CsrD is not a ribonuclease. Interestingly, the CsrD protein contains GGDEF and EAL domains, yet unlike typical proteins in this large superfamily, its activity in the regulation of CsrB/C decay does not involve cyclic di-GMP metabolism. The two predicted membrane-spanning regions are dispensable for CsrD activity, while HAMP-like, GGDEF, and EAL domains are required. Thus, these studies demonstrate a novel process for the selective targeting of RNA molecules for degradation by RNase E and a novel function for a GGDEF-EAL protein. © 2006 by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.","Biofilm formation; Degradosome; GGDEF-EAL domain proteins; Hfq; Polynucleotide phosphorylase; RNA decay","carbon store regulator B protein; carbon store regulator C protein; carbon store regulator D protein; cyclic GMP; endonuclease; membrane protein; messenger RNA; mutant protein; regulator protein; ribonuclease; ribonuclease e; unclassified drug; article; enzyme deficiency; enzyme regulation; enzyme substrate; gene expression; half life time; in vitro study; in vivo study; metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein degradation; protein domain; protein expression; protein stability; protein targeting; RNA degradation; RNA stability; Amino Acid Sequence; Cyclic GMP; Endoribonucleases; Escherichia coli K12; Escherichia coli Proteins; Genes, Bacterial; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Protein Structure, Tertiary; RNA Stability; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Untranslated; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Escherichia coli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748705968

A current question is which scale optimizes the predictive power of these variables. Due to the development of airborne radar/laser scanning, very high resolution digital elevation models (VHR DEMs) with a typical resolution of 1 m have emerged, allowing an accurate estimation of surface derivatives on a fine scale. Improved understanding of the relationship between scale and predictive power, through a comparative assessment of the significance of topographic variables computed at different scales, is needed. It should help researchers in selecting an adequate scale for the computation of topographic factors and further also increase the precision of models for predicting plant species distributions, and find direct applications, such as a better estimation of potential refuges for plant species in a climate change scenario. In this context, it is worth exploring the use of VHR DEM's techniques for data acquisition. In this study, we use a 1 m resolution laser DEM and a standard 25 m resolution DEM to compute four terrain variables (slope, aspect, plan curvature and profile curvature) at six different scales and compare their predictive ability. Univariate logistic regression models are fitted to presence/absence data of 117 alpine plant species collected at 125 sites in the Western Alps of Switzerland. The results show that slope and aspect, through northness = cos(aspect), are strongly correlated to the presence/absence data of many surveyed species. Using a laser VHR DEM significantly improves the predictive ability of aspect. The predictive power of slope and aspect is optimized when these variables are derived using a calculation window of about 100 m × 100 m (slope) and 20 m × 20 m (aspect). Curvature variables are much less significant. Studies that use them should begin with a careful analysis of their behaviour according to the scale used to compute them. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Yet the most common mapping method of these features is based on visual, qualitative interpretation of air-photos. In this study we examine the feasibility of mapping arid alluvial surfaces by using airborne hyperspectral reflective remote sensing methodology. This technique was tested on Late Pleistocene to Holocene alluvial fan surfaces located in the hyperarid southern Arava valley, Israel. Results of spectral field measurements showed that the surface reflectance is controlled by two main surficial processes, which are used as relative age criteria: the degree of desert pavement development (gravel coverage %) controls the absorption feature depths, while the rock coating development influences significantly the overall reflectance of the surface, but its effect on the absorption feature depths is limited. We show that as the percent of the surface covered by gravels increases, the absorption feature depth of the common gravels, in this case carbonate at 2.33 μm, increases as well; whereas the absorption features depth of the fine particle in-between the gravels, decrease (hydroxyl and ferric absorption features at 2.21 μm, and 0.87 μm, respectively), as the fines are removed from the surface. Using these correlations we were able to map the surface gravel coverage (%) on the entire alluvial fan, by calculating the gravel coverage (%) in each pixel of the hyperspectral image. The prediction of gravel coverage (%) is with accuracy of ± 15% (e.g. gravel coverage of 50% can be predicted to be 35% to 65%). Using extensive accuracy assessment data, we show that the spectral based mapping maintained high accuracy degree (R2 = 0.57 to 0.83).

Aiming to reduce the air pollution generated by these motorcycles, the Taiwan Environmental Protection Administration (TEPA) has maintained an enforced inspection and maintenance (I/M) program for in-use motorcycles since 1996. This report explores the effects of engine type, engine size, engine age, and manufacturers of in-use motorcycles on CO/HC emissions in I/M testing data during the period of 1996-2002 in the Central Air Quality Basin of Taiwan. Additionally, geographical characteristics and failure rates of motorcycles are analyzed. The results indicate that the age, size, and type of engine, and the manufacturers of motorcycles all play a significant role in determining I/M emission test results. The findings also show that two-stroke motorcycles emitted approximately ten times greater HC than those of four-stroke motorcycles. CO/HC test emissions increase with a decrease in engine size, HC test emissions contributed by Yamaha and other manufacturers being the highest. Although CO/HC test emissions generally increase with the age of the motorcycle, older motorcycles do not contribute significantly to total emissions due to the small number of older motorcycles. It was observed that CO/HC test emissions depend on driving patterns, geographical location, and inspection rates of motorcycles. The failure rate due to CO is nearly four times greater than that of HC, and the older and smaller-engine-size motorcycles obtain greater failure rates. These statistical findings can also provide the EPA of Taiwan or other Asian countries with useful information for formulating better environmental strategies to manage motorcycles effectively. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A total of 1442 samples collected between March 1988 and December 2003 analyzed for 30 elemental species were analyzed with the application of the positive matrix factorization (PMF). Eight major sources were extracted: summer-high secondary sulfate (55%), carbon-rich secondary sulfate (16%), summer-low secondary sulfate (2%), gasoline vehicle emissions (13%), diesel emissions (1%), airborne soil (6%), industry (5%), and secondary nitrate (2%). The contributions from the carbon-rich secondary sulfate particles are likely a combination of local and regional influences of the biogenic as well as anthropogenic secondary particles. The compositional profiles for gasoline vehicle and diesel emissions are similar to those identified in other US areas.

Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for age of puberty, nipple number and ovulation rate have been identified in Meishan crosses on pig chromosome 10q (SSC10) near the telomere, which is homologous to human chromosome 10p15 and contains an aldo-keto reductase (AKR) gene cluster with at least six family members. AKRs are tissue-specific hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases that interconvert weak steroid hormones to their more potent counterparts and regulate processes involved in development, homeostasis and reproduction. Because of their location in the swine genome and their implication in reproductive physiology, this gene cluster was characterized and evaluated for effects on reproductive traits in swine. Results: Screening the porcine CHORI-242 BAC library with a full-length AKR1C4 cDNA identified 7 positive clones and sample sequencing of 5 BAC clones revealed 5 distinct AKR1C genes (AKR1CL2 and AKR1C1 through 4), which mapped to 126-128 cM on SSC10. Using the IMpRH7000rad and IMNpRH212000rad radiation hybrid panels, these 5 genes mapped between microsatellite markers SWR67 and SW2067. Comparison of sequence data with the porcine BAC fingerprint map show that the cluster of genes resides in a 300 kb region. Twelve SNPs were genotyped in gilts observed for age at first estrus and ovulation rate from the F8 and F10 generations of one-quarter Meishan descendants of the USMARC resource population. Age at puberty, nipple number and ovulation rate data were analyzed for association with genotypes by MTDFREML using an animal model. One SNP, a phenylalanine to isoleucine substitution in AKR1C2, was associated with age of puberty (p = 0.07) and possibly ovulation rate (p = 0.102). Two SNP in AKR1C4 were significantly associated with nipple number (p ≤ 0.03) and another possibly associated with age at puberty (p = 0.09). Conclusion: AKR1C genotypes were associated with nipple number as well as possible effects on age at puberty and ovulation rate. The estimated effects of AKR1C genotypes on these traits suggest that the SNPs are in incomplete linkage disequilibrium with the causal mutations that affect reproductive traits in swine. Further investigations are necessary to identify these mutations and understand how these AKR1C genes affect these important reproductive traits. © 2006 Nonneman et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Animalia; Suidae; Sus scrofa; alcohol dehydrogenase; aldehyde reductase; carbonyl reductase; amino acid sequence; anatomy and histology; animal; chromosome; chromosome map; female; genetics; male; molecular genetics; multigene family; nipple; ovulation; phylogeny; physiology; sexual maturation; swine; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Aldehyde Reductase; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Mammalian; Female; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Multigene Family; Nipples; Ovulation; Phylogeny; Sexual Maturation; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749457795

The molecular mechanism(s) of the actions in the brain, however, have not been fully investigated. A major participant in the process of the dioxin-toxicity is the dioxin receptor, namely the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). AhR regulates the transcription of diverse genes through binding to the xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE). Since the AhR has also been detected in various regions of the brain, the AhR may play a key role in the developmental neurotoxicity of dioxins. This study focused on the effect of AhR activation in the developing neuron. Methods: The influence of the AhR on the developing neuron was assessed using the Neuro2a-AhR transfectant. The undifferentiated murine neuroblastoma Neuro2a cell line (ATCC) was stably transfected with AhR cDNA and the established cell line was named N2a-Rα. The activation of exogenous AhR in N2a-Rα cells was confirmed using RNAi, with si-AhR suppressing the expression of exogenous AhR. The neurological properties of N2a-Rα based on AhR activation were evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of cytoskeletal molecules and by RT-PCR analysis of mRNA expression of neurotransmitter-production related molecules, such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Results: N2a-Rα cells exhibited constant activation of the exogenous AhR. CYP1A1, a typical XRE-regulated gene, mRNA was induced without the application of ligand to the culture medium. N2a-Rα cells exhibited two significant functional features. Morphologically, N2a-Rα cells bore spontaneous neurites exhibiting axon-like properties with the localization of NF-H. In addition, cdc42 expression was increased in comparison to the control cell line. The other is the catecholaminergic neuron-like property. N2a-Rα cells expressed tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA as a functional marker of catecholaminergic neurotransmitter production. Thus, exogenous AhR induced catecholaminergic differentiation in N2a-Rα cells. Conclusion: The excessive activation of AhR resulted in neural differentiation of Neuro2a cells. This result revealed that dioxins may affect the nervous system through the AhR-signaling pathway. Activated AhR may disrupt the strictly regulated brain formation with irregular differentiation occurring rather than cell death. © 2006 Akahoshi et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; neurotransmitter; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; animal cell; article; cancer cell culture; catecholaminergic system; cell differentiation; cell maturation; comparative study; controlled study; cytoskeleton; gene expression; immunohistochemistry; morphology; nerve fiber; neurite; neuroblastoma cell; neurotoxicity; neurotoxicology; nonhuman; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; statistical significance; Animals; Catecholamines; Cell Differentiation; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; Dioxins; Genetic Vectors; Mice; Neuroblastoma; Neurons; Rats; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA Interference; Signal Transduction; Transfection; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase; Up-Regulation; Animalia; Murinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748976235

The as-grown crystal has different colorations of light green and yellow brown in different parts. Distribution of vanadium in three samples with different colorations was determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. From the absorption spectrum of the yellow-brown part with peaks at 370, 820 and 1320 nm, we can deduce that the reducing atmosphere of carbon diffused from the heating elements can increase the concentration of tetrahedral V3+ ions and induce F color centers. All three samples exhibited light-green color after annealing in vacuum or H2 atmospheres. In the vacuum annealing process, the V3+ ions in tetrahedral positions were enhanced through two methods: one method is the exchanging of octahedral V3+ and tetrahedral Al3+ ions in neighboring sites under thermal excitation, the other is that F color centers were thoroughly eliminated and the escaped free electrons could be captured by V ions with higher valance states to further improve the concentration of tetrahedral V3+ ions. Besides the two mechanisms, the H2 annealing process greatly improved the V3+tetra ions through the reduction effect of H2.. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","A1. Absorption spectra; A2.

Between 20 and 40 calendar (cal) kyr B.P., strong DansgaardOeschger cyclicity is expressed in increased carbonate content and reduced total organic carbon during warm interstadials and IRD marking the end of cold stadials. The planktonic δ18O record of core MD99-2283 compared to available isotopic records in the region confirms the existence of multisourced, synchronized meltwater anomalies during Heinrich (H) events 2 to 4.

Significant meltwater events not related to the H events were also observed between 33 and 35 cal kyr B.P., indicating that the release of meltwater is not necessarily connected with major cooling and enhanced IRD delivery. The simultaneous release of fresh water during H events in the Nordic Seas, through icebergs and ice-dammed lakes, is thought to be the result of sea level increase.

In Australia, these deposits formed during three main periods at -2.95, 1.69 to 1.58, and 0.50 to 0.35 Ga. The 1.69 to 1.58 Ga event, which accounts for over 65 percent of Australia's Zn, was triggered by accretion and rifting along the southern margin of Rodinia. Over 93 percent of Australia's Zn-Pb-Ag resources were produced by four ore-forming system types: Mount Isa (56% of Zn), Broken Hill (19%), volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS; 12%), and Mississippi Valley (8%). Moreover, just 4 percent of Australia's land mass produced over 80 percent of its Zn. The four main types of ore-forming systems can be divided into two ""clans,"" based on fluid composition, temperature, and redox state. The Broken Hill- and VHMS-type deposits formed from high-temperature (&gt;200°C) reduced fluids, whereas the Mount Isa- and Mississippi Valley-type deposits formed from low-temperature (&lt;200°C), H2S-poor, and/or oxidized fluids. The tectonic setting and composition of the basins that host the ore-forming systems determine these fluid compositions and, therefore, the mineralization style. Basins that produce higher temperature fluids form in active tectonic environments, generally rifts, where high heat flow produced by magmatism drives convective fluid circulation. These basins are dominated by immature siliciclastic and volcanic rocks with a high overall abundance of Fe2+. The high temperature of the convective fluids combined with the abundance of Fe2+ in the basin allow inorganic sulfate reduction and leaching of sulfide from the country rock, producing reduced, H2S-rich fluids. Basins that produce low-temperature fluids are tectonically less active, generally intracratonic, extensional basins dominated by carbonate and variably mature siliciclastic facies with a relatively low Fe2+ abundance. In these basins, sediment maturity depends on the paleogeography and stratigraphic position in an accommodation cycle. Volcanic units, if present, occur in the basal parts of the basins. Because these basins have relatively low heat flow, convective fluid flow is less important, and fluid migration is dominated by expulsion of basinal brines in response to local and/or regional tectonic events. Low temperatures and the lack of Fe2+ prevent inorganic sulfate reduction during regional fluid flow, producing H2S-poor fluids that are commonly oxidized (i.e., ∑SO4 &gt; ∑H2S). Fluid flow in the two basin types produces contrasting regional alteration systems. High-temperature fluid-rock reactions in siliciclastic-volcanic-dominated basins produce semiconformable albite-hematite-epidote assemblages, but low-temperature reactions in carbonate-siliciclastic-dominated basins produce regional K-feldspar-hematite assemblages. The difference in feldspar mineralogy is mostly a function of temperature. In both basin types, regional alteration zones have lost, and probably were the source of, Zn and Pb. The contrasting fluid types require different depositional mechanisms and traps to accumulate metals. The higher temperature, reduced VHMS- and Broken Hill-type fluids deposit metals as a consequence of mixing with cold seawater. Mineralization occurs at or near the sea floor, with trapping efficiencies enhanced by subsurface replacement or deposition in a brine pool. In contrast, the low-temperature, oxidized Mount Isa- and Mississippi Valley-type fluids precipitate metals through thermochemical sulfate reduction facilitated by hydrocarbons or organic matter. This process can occur at depth in the rock pile, for instance in failed petroleum traps, or just below the sea floor in pyritic, organic-rich muds. © 2006 Society of Economic Geologists, Inc.",,"Heat transfer; High temperature operations; Mineral resources; Mineralogy; Stratigraphy; Tectonics; Ore-forming systems; Siliciclastic-volcanic-dominated basins; Volcanic-hosted massive sulfide; Ore deposit geology; basin; fluid flow; heat flow; lead; mineral deposit; mineralization; mineralogy; ore deposit; silver; temperature effect; zinc; Australasia; Australia; Calluna vulgaris",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847790331

This paper analyzes computer simulation in two cases of atmospheric transport modeling. First, it investigates pioneering efforts by the meteorologist Heinz Fortak in the 1960s to construct Gaussian models of local and regional air pollution transport. Second, it deals with the much more complex simulation efforts by a Norwegian group around Anton Eliassen in the 1970s and 1980s to model long distance transport and transformation of pollutants. In both cases, the simulation of air pollution phenomena implied a set of specific practices. The use of the computer as a tool required drastic simplifications; the collection and preparation of an enormous amount of input data; the adoption of control procedures to validate the models; and the execution of ""computer experiments"" in sensitivity studies. Because of uncertainty and ignorance, scientists enjoyed a large freedom of choice in the construction of models and simulation runs, and great interpretative flexibility of their outcome. Nevertheless, by relying on tacit expert knowledge and intuition, scientists were ultimately able to approach coherence and stability. © 2006 by the Regents of the University of California.

The renewed methanogenesis was noted after initial desorption measurements had ceased and a canister had an air and desorbed gas mixture backflow into the canister during a measurement. About a week after this event, a secondary emission of gas began and continued for over two years. The desorbed gas volume reached a new maximum, increasing the total from 3.3 to 4.9 litres, some 48% above the pre-contamination total volume. The gases released during desorption show a shift in the isotopic signature over time of methane from δ13CCH4 of -53.60 ‰ and δDCH4 of -312.60 ‰ at the first day to δ13CCH4 of -57.06 ‰ and δDCH4 of -375.80 ‰ after 809 days, when the experiment was arbitrarily stopped and the canister opened to study the coal. These isotopic data, interpreted using a Bernard Diagram, indicate a shift from a mixed thermogenic and biogenic source typical of natural gases in the coals and conventional gas reservoirs of the Cook Inlet Basin to a likely biogenic acetate-fermentation methane source. However, the appearance of CO2 during the renewed gas emissions with a δ13CCO2 of +26.08 to +21.72 ‰, interpreted using the carbon isotope fractions found for acetate fermentation and CO2 reduction between CO2 and CH4 by Jenden and Kaplan (1986), indicates a biogenic CO2-reduction pathway may also be operative during renewed gas emission. Adding nutrients to the coal cuttings and canister water and culturing the microbial consortia under anaerobic conditions led to additional methane-rich gas generation in the laboratory. After this anaerobic culturing, ultraviolet microscopy showed that canister water contained common, fluorescent, rod-like microbes comparable to Methanobacterium sp. Scanning electron microscope investigations of the coal matrix showed several morphological types of microbes, including rod, cocci and spherical forms attached to the coal surface. These microbes apparently represent at least a portion of the microbial consortia needed to depolymerize coal, as well as to generate the observed secondary methane emission from the canister. The introduction of 48% more methane from secondary sources has a major impact on coal-bed methane resource assessments and also in determining the true, in-situ degree of methane saturation in coal-beds using isotherms. Canister and isotherm measurements that show ""supersaturation"" of methane may actually be the result of additional gases generated during secondary methanogenesis.",,"Coal; Desorption; Fermentation; Gas emissions; Isotherms; Methane; Natural gas; Carbon isotope fractions; Methanogenesis; Secondary gas emissions; Petroleum geology; carbon dioxide; geochemistry; isotopic composition; methane; methanogenesis; Oligocene; Pliocene; subbituminous coal; Alaska; Cook Inlet; North America; United States; Methanobacterium sp.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845878822

The albedo derived from the relationship with the PR(19) is compared to the albedo calculated from two parameterization schemes used in the climate models. The results show that the parameterized albedo significantly underestimates over thin ice or overestimates over thick snow-covered ice relative to both the in-situ and microwave-derived albedo.

Northeastern states had net energy reductions for cooling/ heating over the entire period, but in most other regions energy increases for cooling outweighed energy decreases for heating.

Since the 1990s, there have been discovered small-sized natural gas pools in these two basins. The natural gases are composed mainly of hydrocarbon gases, with nonhydrocarbons accounting for less than 2%. Of the hydrocarbon gases, methane accounts for more than 99%, and the components above C2 account for less than 0.2%. On the basis of previous studies of geological background, the composition of natural gases and their carbon isotopic composition, it has been defined that these two gas pools are of bacterial origin. In this work we have comprehensively measured the carbon and hydrogen isotopic composition of natural gases from these two basins and have gone into the details of the mechanism of gas generation. The δ13 C1 values of natural gases from the Luliang Basin are within the range of -72.1% - -73.%, and the δDCH4 values, -242% - -234%, indicating that the bacterial gas generation is dominated by the way of CO2 reduction. It has been evidenced that under continental-facies fresh water conditions there did occur the CO2 reduction as a process of bacterial gas generation. The δ13C1 values of natural gases from the Baoshan Basin are within the range of -62.5% - -63.5%, and the δDCH4, values, -252% - -260%. These isotopic characteristics are fallen into transitional phase of acetate fermentation and CO2 reduction as defined by Whiticar et al. (1986). An important discovery in the Luliang Basin is the carbon isotopic composition of ethane of purely biogenetic origin, i.e., its δ13C2 values are within the range of -61.2% - -66.0%. These carbon isotopic values have been reported for the first time in China. As compared to the δ13C2 values of less than -55% for the two cases encountered previously in the world, a significant difference is that in the latter two cases there are obvious signs of contamination caused by ethane of thermal origin. So it cannot be ruled out that the light δ13 C2 values are the result of isotope fractionation of ethane of thermal origin. The δ13C2 values of natural gases from the Luliang Basin are all less than -60%, and there is almost no possibility that ethane of thermal origin migrated vertically and horizontally into gas pools within this basins. This demonstrates that in the Luliang Basin the ethane, whose δ13C2 values are within the range of -61.2% - -66.0%, is of purely biogenic, hence providing scientific evidence that ethane can be produced by the bacterial process. This is an important discovery in natural science, and also provides clues to the comprehensive study of the mechanism of formation of ethane. © Science in China Press 2006.","Acetate fermentation; Bacterial gas; Carbon and hydrogen isotope; CO2 reduction","Carbon dioxide; Composition; Fermentation; Isotopes; Natural gas; Reduction; Acetate fermentation; Bacterial gas generation; Isotope fractionation; Isotopic composition; Geochemistry; acetate; carbon isotope; fermentation; hydrocarbon generation; hydrogen isotope; isotopic composition; natural gas; phase transition; sedimentary basin; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Yunnan; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750969679

The Antarctic marine ecosystem, considered one of the last remaining pristine ecosystems, is almost uncontaminated by anthropogenic hydrocarbons. However, the danger of a petroleum spillage in the polar, ice-covered regions is increasing due to the development of maritime activity. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing cost-effective in situ techniques for bioremediation of oil-contaminated environments. The long term effects of two different fertilizers on microbial communities of sea-ice contaminated by diesel fuel and ""Arabian light"" crude oil were investigated in land fast-ice located in the ""Terre Adelie"" area (Antarctica). Despite the pristine environmental conditions, significant numbers of indigenous hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria were observed in the control uncontaminated area. After oil and fertilizer addition, the changes in bacterial communities were studied in situ during a eight month period in austral winter 1995. All the results clearly revealed a significant response of Antarctic microbial assemblages to hydrocarbon contamination. One order of magnitude increases of total bacterial abundance occurred in sea-ice after both diesel fuel and crude oil contamination (from 105 to more than 10 6 cell ml-1). Introduction of oil into sea-ice results in several orders of magnitude increase in hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms (from less than 10 to more than 104 MPN ml-1). Addition of fertilizers induced clear enhancements of both total and cultivable microorganisms. The commercial slow release liquid fertilizer Inipol EAP 22® is an efficient biostimulation agent for both types of contamination. However, fish composts represent promising efficient and low cost alternatives.","Antarctic sea-ice; Bioremediation; Diesel fuel","Bacteria (microorganisms)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750682987

Although international climate efforts require long-lasting, credible commitments by participating countries, risk of failure to deliver on such commitments rises with the degree of gap that the domestic institutions permit between the executive and the legislature. The U.S. withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol indicated that the Clinton administration's effort to bring international solutions into the domestic arena before domestic consensus was obtained was counterproductive. The congressional politics over budgetary allocation regarding the Bush administration's technology policies showed that general preference to a technology-oriented approach to climate change alone did not ensure the credibility of international commitments. These cases revealed that the U.S. climate diplomacy was lacking in domestic institutional mechanisms that bring the executive branch's deal at international negotiations, and the legislators' preferences at home, closer together. For the U.S. to take leadership in international climate cooperation, domestic institutional frameworks which reconcile the interests of the two branches are necessary. This paper suggests that such domestic institutional frameworks feature two components: regular channels of communication between the two political branches; and, incentive mechanisms for the two branches to swiftly come to terms with each other. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.","Climate change; Climate diplomacy; Credibility; International commitment; United States","climate change; global climate; international cooperation; Kyoto Protocol; legislation; national politics; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750571409

The invasion of European earthworms into previously earthworm-free temperate and boreal forests of North America dominated by Acer, Quercus, Betula, Pinus and Populus has provided ample opportunity to observe how earthworms engineer ecosystems. Impacts vary with soil parent material, land use history, and assemblage of invading earthworm species. Earthworms reduce the thickness of organic layers, increase the bulk density of soils and incorporate litter and humus materials into deeper horizons of the soil profile, thereby affecting the whole soil food web and the above ground plant community. Mixing of organic and mineral materials turns mor into mull humus which significantly changes the distribution and community composition of the soil microflora and seedbed conditions for vascular plants. In some forests earthworm invasion leads to reduced availability and increased leaching of N and P in soil horizons where most fine roots are concentrated. Earthworms can contribute to a forest decline syndrome, and forest herbs in the genera Aralia, Botrychium, Osmorhiza, Trillium, Uvularia, and Viola are reduced in abundance during earthworm invasion. The degree of plant recovery after invasion varies greatly among sites and depends on complex interactions with soil processes and herbivores. These changes are likely to alter competitive relationships among plant species, possibly facilitating invasion of exotic plant species such as Rhamnus cathartica into North American forests, leading to as yet unknown changes in successional trajectory. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.","Aporrectodea; Dendrobaena; Exotic earthworm invasion; Keystone species; Lumbricus rubellus; Lumbricus terrestris; Minnesota forests; New York forests","biological invasion; boreal forest; earthworm; invasive species; keystone species; soil property; species-area relationship; temperate forest; Minnesota; New York [United States]; North America; United States; Acer; Aporrectodea; Aralia; Betula; Botrychium; Dendrobaena; Lumbricus rubellus; Lumbricus terrestris; Osmorhiza; Populus; Quercus; Rhamnus; Rhamnus cathartica; Tracheophyta; Trillium; Uvularia; Violaceae",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750177022

An herb tundra was established in the lowlands following deglaciation by 13000 cal. BP. Salix, Alnus and probably Betula kenaica, expanded in the area after 10 700 cal. BP, followed by Picea glauca by 8500 cal. BP. Picea mariana became established by 4600 cal. BP. The early Holocene was probably the driest time during the postglacial, as determined by aquatic plant macrofossils and climate models. Lake levels reached near-modern conditions by at least 8000 cal. BP. Mean Fire Intervals (MFI) were longest during the shrub-herb tundra phase (138 ± 65 yr), decreased after expansion of B. kenaica, Salix and Populus (77 ± 49 yr) and Picea glauca (81 ± 41 yr), and increased again with the arrival of P. mariana (130 ± 66 yr). Unlike previous studies, our data demonstrate the highest fire frequencies during the early to mid-Holocene and less frequent fire during the late Holocene when P. mariana forests dominated the lowlands. Early Holocene forests of P. glauca and B. kenaica existed in summers that were longer and drier than today, while the increasingly wetter and cooler climates of the late Holocene probably hindered forest fire around Paradox Lake, perhaps because of less frequent summer drought. © 2006 SAGE Publications.","Alaska; Boreal forest; Charcoal analysis; Climate change; Fire history; Holocene; Vegetation history","boreal forest; charcoal; climate change; fire history; forest fire; Holocene; lowland environment; Postglacial; vegetation history; Alaska; Kenai Peninsula; North America; United States; Alnus; Betula papyrifera kenaica; Betulaceae; Picea glauca; Picea mariana; Populus; Salix",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750151949

This reveals that, in contradiction to some common assumptions, increasing the coherence of large-scale motions can decrease molecular mixing rates, and yet can still be beneficial in some applications. Even relatively minor changes to the exit flow pattern of a non-reacting round jet, through changes to the nozzle profile are found to propagate downstream into the far field, apparently through the underlying turbulent structure. Importantly, while a jet from a smoothly contracting nozzle is found to have higher rates of entrainment, mean spread and mean decay of the scalar field than does a long pipe jet, it has a lower rate of molecular mixing. That is, increased large-scale mixing does not necessarily result in increased fine-scale mixing. A range of devices are reviewed which enhance, or stimulate the large-scale, coherent motions in an emerging jet using acoustic, mechanical or fluidic methods. The available evidence suggests that those methods which induce instantaneously asymmetric flow structure are more effective at increasing the near-field spreading than are those which induce instantaneously axisymmetric flow structure. Only limited data are available of the effects of such near-field changes on the far-field properties. Nevertheless, the available data reveal a clear trend that this near-field flow undergoes a transition to a far-field state whose spread and decay is comparable with that of a steady jet, albeit being indelibly altered by the near-field excitation. It also suggests that ""self-exciting"" devices (i.e. that are not externally forced), cause a net reduction in the total entrainment relative to the unexcited jet, due to the losses induced by the device itself. Nevertheless, the changes which they can impart to the flow, such as redistributing the turbulent energy from the fine to the larger scales, can be beneficial for combustion in applications where high radiant heat transfer is desirable. Precessing and flapping jets are found to cause an increase in flame volume relative to an equivalent simple jet (SJ), implying lower molecular mixing rates. However, importantly, this decrease in mixing is achieved with no increase in the flame length. Rather the width to length ratio of these flames is increased significantly. This is of practical significance because the length of a flame is often the limiting dimension in industrial systems. The reduced strain-rates lead to an increased presence of soot within the flame, while not, in general, significantly influencing the emission of soot from the flame. The increased volume of soot leads to increased radiation, which in turn acts to reduce flame temperature, so lowering thermal NOx emissions through a global residence time-temperature reduction. For example, in full-scale cement kilns these burner nozzles are found to reduce NOx emissions by around 40-60% and increase fuel efficiency (or output) by around 5-10%. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The European Directive on Energy Performance of Buildings which came into force 16 December 2002 will be implemented in the legislation of Member States by 4 January 2006. In addition to the aim of improving the overall energy efficiency of new buildings, large existing buildings will become a target for improvement, as soon as they undergo significant renovation. The building sector is responsible for about 40% of Europe's total end energy consumption and hence this Directive is an important step for the European Union in order that it should reach the level of saving required by the Kyoto Agreement. In this the EU is committed to reduce CO 2 emissions relative to the base year of 1990 by 8 per cent, by 2010. But what will be the impact of the new Directive, how large could be the impacts of extending the obligation for energy efficiency retrofitting towards smaller buildings? Can improvement of the insulation offset or reduce the growing energy consumption from the increasing installation of cooling installations? EURIMA, the European Insulation Manufacturers Association and EuroACE, the European Alliance of Companies for Energy Efficiency in Buildings, asked Ecofys to address these questions. Methods. The effect of the EPB Directive on the emissions associated with the heating energy consumption of the total EU 15 building stock has been examined in a model calculation, using the Built Environment Analysis Model (BEAM), which was developed by Ecofys to investigate energy saving measures in the building stock. The great complexity of the EU-15 building stock had to be simplified by examining five standard buildings with eight insulation standards, which are assigned to building age and renovation status. Furthermore, three climatic regions (cold, moderate, warm) were distinguished for the calculation of the heating energy demand. This gave a basic 210 building types for which the heating energy demand and CO 2 emissions from heating were calculated according to the principles of the European Norm EN 832. Results and Discussion. The model calculations demonstrates that the main contributor to the total heating related CO 2 emissions of 725 Mt/a from the EU building stock in 2002 is the residential sector (77%) while the remaining 23% originates from non-residential buildings. In the residential sector, single-family houses represent the largest group responsible for 60% of the total CO2 emissions equivalent to 435 Mt/a. The technical potential: If all retrofit measures in the scope of the Directive were realised immediately for the complete residential and non-residential building stock the overall CO2 emission savings would add up to 82 Mt/a. An additional saving potential compared to the Directive of 69 Mt/a would be created if the scope of the Directive was extended to cover retrofit measures in multi-family dwellings (200-1000 m2) and non-residential buildings smaller than 1000 m2 used floor space. In addition including the large group of single-family dwellings would lead to a potential for additional CO2 emission reductions compared to the Directive of 316 Mt/a. Temporal mobilization of the potential: Calculations based on the building stock as it develops over time with average retrofit rates demonstrated that regulations introduced following the EPB Directive result in a CO2 emissions decrease of 34 Mt/a by the year 2010 compared to the business as usual scenario. Extending the scope of the EPB Directive to all residential buildings (including single and multi-family dwellings), the CO 2 emission savings potential over the 'business as usual' scenario could be doubled to 69 Mt/a in the year 2010. This creates an additional saving potential compared to the Directive of 36 Mt/a. Cooling demand: The analysis demonstrated that in warm climatic zones the cooling demand can be reduced drastically by a combination of lowering the internal heat loads and by improved insulation. With the reduction of the heat loads to a moderate level the cooling demand, e.g. of a terraced house located in Madrid, can be reduced by an additional 85% if the insulation level is improved appropriately. Conclusions. This study demonstrates that the European Directive on Energy Performance of Buildings will have a significant impact on the CO2 emissions of the European building stock. The main saving potential lies in insulation of the existing building stock. Beyond this, CO2 emissions could, however, be greatly reduced if the scope of the Directive were to be extended to include retrofit of smaller buildings. Recommendation and Perspective. The reductions should be seen in relation to the remaining gap of 190 Mt CO2 eq. per annum between the current emission levels of EU-15 and the target under the Kyoto-Protocol for the year 2010. The energy and industrial sector will probably contribute only a fraction of this reduction via the newly established EU emissions trading scheme and connected projects under the flexible mechanism. In addition, the traffic sector is likely to continue its growth path leading to a widening of the gap. Thus, there is likely to be considerable pressure on the EU building sector to contribute to the EU climate targets beyond what will be achieved by means of the current EPB Directive. Legislators on the EU and national level are therefore advised to take accelerated actions to tap the very significant emission reduction potentials available in the EU building stock. © 2006 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Built Environment Analysis Model (BEAM); Cooling demand; EU 15-Building stock; EU Directive on energy performance of buildings; Heating related CO 2-emissions; Insulation; Kyoto-Protocol; Mitigation of CO 2-emissions","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; environmental modeling; European Union; Kyoto Protocol; mitigation; pollution policy; Eurasia; Europe; European Union; carbon dioxide; air conditioning; air pollutant; air pollution; article; building material; construction work and architectural phenomena; economics; energy conservation; European Union; heating; housing; legal aspect; methodology; standard; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Energy Resources; Construction Materials; European Union; Facility Design and Construction; Heating; Housing; Ventilation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749655923

CAI combustion was achieved in a single-cylinder gasoline direct-injection (DI) engine with a cylinder running in CAI mode. Standard components were used in the camshafts, which had been modified to restrict the gas exchange process. We investigated the effects of the air/fuel ratio, residual exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate, and injection timing such as early and late injections on the attainable CAI combustion region. The effect of injection timing on factors such as the start of combustion, its duration, and its heat release rate was also investigated. The results show that early injection caused the mixture to ignite earlier and to burn more quickly because of the exothermic reaction during the recompression and gave rise to thorough mixing of the fuel and air. Late injection extended the operation region more than early injection, but the emissions of HC and NOx were slightly increased over early injection. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Controlled autoignition (CAI) combustion; Direct-injection engine; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rate; Exothermic reaction; Gas exchange process; Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI); Injection timing; Stratified combustion; Engine cylinders; Exhaust gases; Fuel economy; Fuel injection; Ignition systems; Particulate emissions; Stratified charge engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749609682

To evaluate the physiological basis of their success, we measured the seasonal course of leaf gas exchange, plant water status, and carbon isotope discrimination in these two native trees and two native C4 grasses (Schizachyrium scoparium and Panicum virgatum). Compared to the trees, grasses had higher net photosynthetic rates (A net) and water use efficiency (WUE) and more negative predawn and midday water potentials (ψ) in June and July. While leaf ψ and rates of leaf gas exchange declined for all four species during August, the ψmid of the grasses were significantly more negative than those of the two trees. The deeply rooted trees maintained water status during summer, in contrast to the grasses, which senesced. Juniperus virginiana in particular was well adapted to xeric conditions, with low stomatal conductance, high WUE, and positive Anet at low ψ. The highest values of Anet were observed in May for J. virginiana and in May and September for P. ponderosa. Both species maintained low but positive Anet throughout the winter at temperatures above 0°C. Leaf carbon isotopic signature differed between tree and grass species but did not exhibit significant within-species seasonal variability. The semiarid grassland climate of Nebraska does not appear to limit P. ponderosa and J. virginiana, which use growth during the nongrowing season and access to deep soil moisture to compensate for growing-season drought. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.

Four stages in the late Holocene development of Ho Bugt can be identified: (1) groundwater-table rise and growth of basal peat (from at least 2300 BC to AD 0); (2) salt-marsh formation (0 to AD 250); (3) a freshening phase (AD 250 to AD 1600?), culminating in the drying out of the marshes and producing a distinct black horizon followed by an aeolian phase with sand deposition; and (4) renewed salt-marsh deposition (AD 1600? to present). From 16 calibrated AMS radiocarbon ages on fossil plant fragments and 4 calibrated conventional radiocarbon ages on peat, we reconstructed a local relative sea-level history that shows a steady sea-level rise of 4 m since 4000 cal yr BP. Contrary to suggestions made in the literature, the relative sea-level record of Ho Bugt does not contain a late Holocene highstand. Relative sea-level changes at Ho Bugt are controlled by glacio-isostatic subsidence and can be duplicated by a glacial isostatic adjustment model in which no water is added to the world's oceans after ca. 5000 cal yr BP. © 2006 University of Washington.","Diatoms; Foraminifera; Glacio-isostasy; Ho Bugt; North Sea; Salt marsh; Wadden Sea","glacioisostasy; highstand; Holocene; paleoenvironment; peat; radiocarbon dating; saltmarsh; sea level change; Atlantic Ocean; Denmark; Eurasia; Europe; Ho Bugt; North Sea; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Wadden Sea; Bacillariophyta; Foraminifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749584713

Carbon dioxide will be injected into a saline aquifer of the Triassic Stuttgart Formation in an anticlinal structure of the northeast German Basin. The drilling of one injection and two observation wells will commence at the end of 2006. The predrilling phase focuses on the baseline geological parameters of the anticline. The Stuttgart Formation is lithologically heterogeneous; it consists of sandy channel-(string)-facies rocks, with good reservoir properties alternating with muddy flood-plain-facies rocks of poor reservoir quality. Playa-type rocks form the immediate cap rock above the CO2SINK reservoir. A geostatistical approach has been applied to describe the reservoir architecture between and beyond well control. This model forms the basis for the generation of reservoir-dynamic models of CO2 injection that assist in the planning of injection operations and in the understanding of CO2 plume evolution. A verification of the geometry of the reservoir and the structural situation of its overburden is expected from a three-dimensional baseline seismic survey that was conducted in the autumn of 2005. Laboratory experiments under simulated in-situ conditions were performed to evaluate the geophysical signature of rocks saturated with CO2. The chemical composition of the groundwater and the CO2 flux in the soil were analyzed across the Ketzin anticline, providing the baseline for a monitoring program during and after injection of CO2, targeted at the detection of potential CO2 leakage from the storage reservoir.

Storage of CO2 into depleted oil reservoirs may prove to be both cost effective and environmentally safe. However, injection of CO2 into oil reservoirs is a complex issue, spanning a wide range of scientific, technological, economic, safety, and regulatory issues. Detailed studies about the long-term impact of CO2 on the host reservoir are necessary before this technology can be deployed. This article provides an overview of a U.S. Department of Energy-sponsored project that examines CO2 sequestration in a depleted oil reservoir. The main objectives of the project are (1) to characterize the oil reservoir and its sequestration capacity; (2) to better understand CO2 sequestration-related processes; and (3) to predict and monitor the migration and ultimate fate of CO2 after injection into a depleted sandstone oil reservoir. The project is focused around a field test that involved the injection of approximately 2090 tons (2.09 million kg) of CO2 into a depleted sandstone reservoir at the West Pearl Queen field in southeastern New Mexico. Geophysical monitoring surveys, laboratory experiments, and numerical simulations were performed in support of the field experiment. Results show that the response of the West Pearl Queen reservoir during the field experiment was significantly different than predicted response based on the preinjection characterization data. Furthermore, results from a 19-month bench-scale experiments of CO2 interaction with the Queen sand were not able to be fully reproduced using the latest numerical modeling algorithms, suggesting that the current models are not capturing important geochemical interactions.

Such a strategy must combine efforts both to deter and detect academic misconduct, along with fair but rigorous application of sanctions against such behaviors. Methods useful in preventing or deterring dishonest behaviors among students include early integrity training complemented with course-level reinforcement, faculty role-modeling, and the application of selected testing/assignment preventive strategies, including honor pledges and honesty declarations. Giving students more responsibility for oversight of academic integrity also may help address this problem and better promote the culture needed to uphold its principles.

The hearing screening protocol included distortion product otoacoustic emission, followed in case of repeated OAE referral or high risk (HR) infant by diagnostic auditory brainstem responses. The results indicate that the prevalence and severity of hearing loss amongst Jordanian infants (1.37%) is remarkably higher as compared to the Israeli infants (0.48%). The overall prevalence of bilateral SNHL was seven times more in the Jordanian infants, 18 times in non-risk, and three times in the HR infants relative to the Israeli infants.

The spectral patterns for the minerals rosasite, glaukosphaerite, kolwezite and mcguinnessite are similar to those of malachite, implying that the structure is the same as that of malachite, i.e. monoclinic. A comparison is made with the spectra of malachite. The symmetry of the carbonate anion in the rosasite mineral group is C2υ or Cs and is composition dependent. Two (CO3)2- symmetric stretching modes are observed for the rosasite minerals at 1060 and 1090 cm-1. Two hydroxyl stretching modes are observed for the rosasite mineral group. The position of these bands is determined to be a function of the hydrogen bond lengths. Hydrogen bond distances for rosasite are calculated as 2.867, 2.799 and 2.780 Å, whereas for pokrovskite the distances are 3.280 and 2.999 Å. The effect of lowering the temperature from ambient to 77 K results in a decrease of the hydrogen bond distances by 5%.

Under artificial plantations, the vegetation layer (including roots) had a mean carbon density of 111.3 t/hm2, the litter layer a density of 5.1 t/hm2, and the soil layer a density of 64.9 t/hm2. These values accounted for 28.6%, 13.8%, and 61.0% of their respective counterparts in the natural secondary forests under the same site conditions in the region. The ratios of carbon density among vegetation, litter, and soil pools were 39.6:1.8:58.6 for artificial forests and 57.4:2.7:39.9 for natural forests. The carbon densities of the vegetation and litter layers increased exponentially with forest age. The total carbon density ratios were also increasing gradually. Although the mean total carbon density of the artificial forests in the rehabilitated lands was 281.2 t/hm2 in the experimental area, it accounted for only 41.5% of the carbon density of the natural secondary forests (677.4 t/hm2). The annual increase in total carbon density of artificial forests was as high as 15.2 t/hm2, which was 11.7% more than that of natural forests and 6.8 times higher than that (1.95 t/hm) of artificial forests in the entire country as measured during 1994-1998. This indicates that growth and carbon storage capacity of artificial forests in the rehabilitated lands were higher than those of forests on the barren hills and the secondary forests. We concluded that the conversion project from croplands to forests and grasslands based on scientific principles is very important in the formation of carbon sinks for reducing greenhouse effects. © Higher Education Press 2006.","Artificial forests in rehabilitated land; Carbon storage; Litter layer; Soil layer; Upper reaches of the Yellow River; Vegetation layer",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748950856

Phylogenetic and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses of 16S rRNA genes in fluids and carbonate material from this site indicate the presence of organisms similar to sulfur-oxidizing, sulfate-reducing, and methane-oxidizing Bacteria as well as methanogenic and anaerobic methane-oxidizing Archaea. The presence of these metabolic groups indicates that microbial cycling of sulfur and methane may be the dominant biogeochemical processes active within this ultramafic rock-hosted environment. 16S rRNA gene sequences grouping within the Methylobacter and Thiomicrospira clades were recovered from a chemically diverse suite of carbonate chimney and fluid samples. In contrast, 16S rRNA genes corresponding to the Lost City Methanosarcinales phylotype were found exclusively in high-temperature chimneys, while a phylotype of anaerobic methanotrophic Archaea (ANME-I) was restricted to lower-temperature, less vigorously venting sites. A hyperthermophilic habitat beneath the LCHF may be reflected by 16S rRNA gene sequences belonging to Thermococcales and uncultured Crenarchaeota identified in vent fluids. The finding of a diverse microbial ecosystem supported by the interaction of high-temperature, high-pH fluids resulting from serpentinization reactions in the subsurface provides insight into the biogeochemistry of what may be a pervasive process in ultramafic subseafloor environments.

This study evaluated a submerged microtiter plate assay for direct and rapid monitoring of biofilm formation by subjecting the plates to a continuous flow of either secondary effluent (SE) or biofilter-treated secondary effluent (BF). This method was very robust, based on a high correlation (R2 = 0.92) between the biomass (given by the A600 in the microtiter plate assay) and the biovolume (determined from independent biofilms developed on glass slides under identical conditions) measurements, and revealed that the biomasses in BF biofilms were consistently lower than those in SE biofilms. The influence of the organic-carbon content on the biofilm community composition and succession was further evaluated using molecular tools. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 16S rRNA genes revealed a group of pioneer colonizers, possibly represented by Sphingomonadaceae and Caulobacter organisms, to be common in both SE and BF biofilms. However, differences in organic-carbon availabilities in the two water samples eventually led to the selection of distinct biofilm communities. Alpha-proteobacterial populations were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization to be enriched in SE biofilms, while Betaproteobacteria were dominant in BF biofilms. Cloning analyses further demonstrated that microorganisms adapted for survival under low-substrate conditions (e.g., Aquabacterium, Caulobacter, and Legionella) were preferentially selected in the BF biofilm, suggesting that carbon limitation strategies may not achieve adequate biofouling control in the long run.

To test the model, we estimated leaf lifetime carbon gain for 26 species using the concept of mean labor time for leaves (the part of each day the leaf functions to full capacity), average potential photosynthetic capacity over the leaf lifetime, and functional leaf longevity (leaf longevity discounted for periods within a year wholly unfavorable for photosynthesis). We found that the life-time carbon gain of leaves was rather constant across species. Moreover, when foliar biomass was regressed against functional leaf longevity, aseasonal and seasonal forests fell on a single line, suggesting that the leaf production rate during favorable periods is not substantially different among forests in the world. The gross production of forest ecosystems then can be predicted to a first approximation simply by the annual duration of the period favorable for photo-synthetic activity in any given region. © 2006 by The University of Chicago.","Functional leaf longevity; Gross primary production; Leaf longevity; Lifetime leaf carbon gain; Mean labor time of a leaf","carbon; assimilation efficiency; carbon balance; climate change; forest ecosystem; harvesting; leaf; longevity; photosynthesis; plant community; primary production; article; ecosystem; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; species difference; time; tree; Carbon; Ecosystem; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Species Specificity; Time Factors; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748760392

No general water scarcity is expected for the region even under unusually dry weather scenarios. Localized quantity and quality problems are likely to occur especially in groundwater recharge areas. Some existing institutions can be relied on by municipalities to build an effective adaptation strategy based on a watershed/region perspective, on their credibility, and on their expertise.

Here, we assess this claim by comparing the cool disc-blackbody model with a range of other models. For example, we show that the same ULX spectra can be fitted equally well by subtracting a disc-blackbody component from a dominant power-law component, thus turning a soft excess into a soft deficit. Then, we propose a more complex physical model, based on a power-law component slightly modified at various energies by smeared emission and absorption lines from highly ionized, fast-moving gas. We use the XMM-Newton/EPIC (European Photon Imaging Camera) spectra of two ULXs in Holmberg II and NGC 4559 as examples. Our main conclusion is that the presence of a soft excess or a soft deficit depends on the energy range over which we choose to fit the 'true' power-law continuum; those small deviations from the power-law spectrum are well modelled by disc-blackbody components (either in emission or absorption) simply because they are a versatile fitting tool for most kinds of smooth, broad bumps. Hence, we argue that those components should not be taken as evidence for accretion disc emission, nor used to infer BH masses. Finally, we speculate that bright ULXs could be in a spectral state similar to (or an extension of) the steep power-law state of Galactic BH candidates, in which the disc is now completely comptonized and not directly detectable, and the power-law emission may be modified by the surrounding, fast-moving, ionized gas. © 2006 RAS.","Accretion, accretion discs; Black hole physics; X-rays: binaries",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748643207

We investigated the catalytic activity using electrochemical measurements (cyclic voltammetry) on a glassy carbon electrode in a DMF solution. Dissolving CO 2 gas into the solution, the cyclic voltammograms displayed an irreversible increase of the cathodic current. This result suggests the catalytic reduction of CO2. The redox potential (-1.3 V versus Fc/Fc+) at which the catalytic behavior was observed is 1.1V higher than that catalyzed by cobalt tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTPP). The generation number (n) dependence of the dendrimer catalysts showed the maximum activity at n = 3. A significant decrease of the activity for the largest dendrimer (n = 4) indicates a steric effect, which prevents transmission of the substrate (CO 2 molecule) and electrons to the catalytic center (cobalt porphyrin core). For more efficient catalysis, a novel open-shell dendrimer having a pocket on one side of the molecule was designed and synthesized. Because the accessibility to the core in the opened shell improved, this dendrimer exhibited the highest catalytic activity. These results suggest that tuning of the local domain around the cobalt porphyrin center would lead to a decisive solution for further activation of the CO2 molecule. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Catalysts; Dendrimers; Polyimines","Activation analysis; Catalysts; Dendrimers; Electrochemistry; Polyimides; Porphyrins; Cathodic currents; Electrochemical measurements; Lewis acid; Phenylazomethine dendrimers; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748577293

High molecular weight copolymers of methyl methacrylate with butyl acrylate (MMA-co-BA) having varying molecular weight and composition were used to enhance the rheological properties in shear and extension. Blends containing up to 15 wt% of copolymer were prepared at 200°C and 150 rpm by using a DSM micro-compounder. The samples were characterized by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and rheology. The rheological properties were determined by using small amplitude oscillatory measurements (SAOM) in shear and a Rheotens™ device for melt strength determination. For PMMA, the effects of high molecular weight PMMA copolymer on the matrix were related to the molecular weight, the tacticity of the copolymer, and the individual components. The rheological properties in shear showed enhanced storage and loss moduli at low frequency, while no change was observed at high frequency. In addition, extensional viscosity measurements made by using the filament stretching technique showed a significant increase in melt strength compared to that of the base PMMA with the blend containing the highest molecular weight copolymer showing the maximum force and a reduced drawdown ratio. For polycarbonate, its blends with acrylic copolymer were found to be immiscible. Similar enhancement in the moduli at low frequencies was observed, but a significant increase in the viscosity was obtained as well, resulting from the response of the two-phase system. This change in the rheological properties was further increased at 15 wt% loading. Owing to the formation of a phase-separated morphology, the melt strength was found to increase only slightly. © 2006 Society of Plastics Engineers.",,"Extensional viscosity; Loss moduli; Small amplitude oscillatory measurements (SAOM); Tacticity; Molecular weight; Polycarbonates; Polymethyl methacrylates; Resins; Rheology; Size exclusion chromatography; Viscoelasticity; Copolymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748540702

Over the past two decades, such clusters have played a leading role in the economic growth of China, owing to their collective economic capacity and interdependency. However, the economic boom has led to a general decline in environmental quality. This paper will review the development and current status of the major environmental problems caused by city clusters, focusing on water and air pollution, and suggest possible strategies for solving these problems. Currently, deteriorating water quality is of major concern to the public and decision makers alike, and more than three-quarters of the urban population are exposed to air quality that does not meet the national ambient air quality standards of China. Furthermore, this pollution is characterized by high concentrations of both primary and secondary pollutants. Environmental pollution issues are therefore much more complex in China than in western countries. China is expected to quadruple its GDP by 2020 (using 2000 as the base year for comparison) and, consequently, will face even more serious environmental challenges. Improving energy efficiency and moderating the consumption of natural resources are essential if China is to achieve a balance between economic development and environmental health. © The Ecological Society of America.",,"atmospheric pollution; economic conditions; economic development; economic growth; environmental quality; satellite; surface water; urban area; urban population; water pollution; water quality; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748416478

Beamed radio emission with a high brightness temperature can generate low-frequency plasma waves in the pulsar magnetosphere, and these waves scatter the radio beam. We consider this effect on the propagation of radio emission both in the open field line region and in the closed field line region. The former is applicable to most cases of pulsar radio emission where the propagation is confined to the polar region; it is shown that the induced process is not effective for radio emission of moderately high brightness temperature but can have a severe effect on giant pulses. For giant pulses not to be affected by this process, they must be emitted very close to the light cylinder.

The samples were sieved into six particle size ranges: 500-250, 250-125, 125-63, 63-40, 40-20 and <20 μm and then analysed for 15 trace elements by ICP-MS. Sequential extraction of metals was performed on each subsample. A principal component analysis was also carried out to define the possible origin of metals in dusts. A comparison was made between the trace metal concentrations in road dust and those in main local outcropping rocks. The obtained results, indicate, that the road dust samples contain non-soil-derived elements, whose primary contributors appear to be vehicular traffic and the nearby petrochemical plant. Traffic appears to be responsible for the high levels of Ba, Cu, Cr, Mo, Pb, Sb and Zn. High concentrations of Ni, V and, partly, Ba and Cr were associated with emissions from the petrochemical plant. With respect to the local background, Sb was the most highly enriched trace element in the road dusts. Results of sequential extraction analysis show that most metals are mainly distributed in the non-residual fractions and particularly in the organic/sulphide and Fe-Mn oxides fractions. They also point to superficial adsorption as an important transfer mechanism of trace metals from their sources to the environment. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Given the larger effects of climate oscillations in the north vs. the south, a predicted outcome is for species to conserve climate niches across latitude and to show reduced climate and elevation ranges in the north. An alternative outcome is latitudinal niche diversification and increased climate variation in the north. Location: Western North America. Methods: The questions above were examined using a combination of species occurrence data bases, climate data bases, simple summaries of means and standard deviations and by testing summaries against random distributions across latitude for 21 mammal species from a variety of orders. Results: The results showed that: (i) most species conserve their niche strongly or weakly given overall temperature gradients from north to south; (ii) seasonality experienced by species is relatively static until the highest latitudes despite directional trends across the region; and (iii) the elevation range and temperature variation that species experience decreases from south to north. Main conclusions: Populations at range edges appear to partition environments to remain closer to temperature values similar to those at the core of the range. In addition, seasonality is not a likely explanatory factor of genetic diversity in latitudinal gradients.

This was done in anticipation of experimentation with CO2 sequestration in the Pennsylvanian Tensleep Sandstone underlying the field at a depth of 1680 m. The baseline data were collected during the winter, 2004 in order to minimize near-surface biological activity in the soil profile. The baseline data were used to select anomalous locations that may be the result of seeping thermogenic gas, along with background locations. Five 10-m holes were drilled, 3 of which had anomalous gas microseepage, and 2 were characterized as ""background."" These were equipped for nested gas sampling at depths of 10-, 5-, 3-, 2-, and 1-m depths. Methane concentrations as high as 170,000 ppmv (17%) were found, along with high concentrations of C2H6, C3H8, n-C4H10, and i-C4H10. Much smaller concentrations of C2H4 and C3H6 were observed indicating the beginning of hydrocarbon oxidation in the anomalous holes. The anomalous 10-m holes also had high concentrations of isotopically enriched CO2, indicating the oxidation of hydrocarbons. Concentrations of the gases decreased upward, as expected, indicating oxidation and transport into the atmosphere. The ancient source of the gases was confirmed by 14C determinations on CO2, with radiocarbon ages approaching 38 ka within 5 m of the surface. Modeling was used to analyze the distribution of hydrocarbons in the anomalous and background 10-m holes. Diffusion alone was not sufficient to account for the hydrocarbon concentration distributions, however the data could be fit with the addition of a consumptive reaction. First-order rate constants for methanotrophic oxidation were obtained by inverse modeling. High rates of oxidation were found, particularly near the surface in the anomalous 10-m holes, demonstrating the effectiveness of the process in the attenuation of CH4 microseepage. The results also demonstrate the importance of CH4 measurements in the planning of a monitoring and verification program for geological CO2 sequestration in sites with significant remaining hydrocarbons (i.e. spent oil reservoirs). © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

On the basis of power spectral analysis of 14 time series at four sites from northern peatlands (fens and raised bogs), the temporal variability of physical environment (temperatures, water tables) and biological variables (CO2 flux) shows power-law behaviour, with a scaling exponent ranging from about 0.5 to 1.5. The scaling exponents of air temperatures change from 1.5 at high frequency to 0.5 at low frequency, with a break point at diurnal period. Comparison with similar analysis of temperature data from climate stations suggests that the atmosphere above peatlands has more active heat exchange with waterlogged peatlands than with upland terrestrial ecosystems. Water tables from different peatlands show almost identical power spectra, with a scaling exponent of 1.0 over all time scales. CO2 exchange has more complex spectral structure, with two break points at daily and monthly periods. This spectral structure suggests scale-dependent influence of climatic and hydrological fluctuations on CO2 fluxes. CO2 flux responds to air temperature with a distinct diurnal spectral peak. These results indicate that time scales are important in discussing hydrology and carbon dynamics in peatlands, and that scaling up of short-term experimental results may be inadvisable. Further statistical analysis on drained and harvested peatlands would provide insights into understanding shift in peatland dynamics due to human disturbance. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

They are replacing the traditional soybean monoculture with bare fallow using conventional tillage (CT) practices. The objective of this study was to examine how DMC practices affect soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics and to assess their potential for enhanced soil carbon (C) storage. The approach was to determine soil C stocks along a chronosequence of fields under DMC, and then to apply the generic decomposition and yield (G'DAY) plant-soil model to analyse the soil C storage potential for a number of cropping systems. Forty-five fields were selected on a plateau of Ferralsols in the central Cerrado region to represent a chronosequence of 0-12 years under continuous DMC. Before DMC the fields had been under CT soybean monoculture following the clearing of the native savannah. An average increase in SOC stocks of 0.83 Mg Cha-1 yr-1 in the 0-20cm topsoil was measured. The corresponding increase in total soil nitrogen was 79kg Nha-1 yr-1. The G'DAY model predicted a net accumulation of 0.70-1.15 Mg Cha-1 yr-1 in the 0-40cm topsoil for the first 12 years, depending on the type of soil and DMC system. Model predictions showed that less soil C was accumulated under DMC systems that commenced immediately after clearing the native savannah. Gains in soil C under DMC were primarily due to the introduction of a second crop that caused higher net primary productivity, leading to higher plant C inputs to soil. A rough estimation shows that the conversion of 6 millionha of CT soybean monoculture to DMC in the Cerrados would enhance soil C storage by 4.9 Tg Cyr-1 during at least the first 12 years following the conversion to DMC. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","CENTURY; Cerrado; Cropping systems; Direct seeding mulch-based cropping; G'DAY; Modelling; No-tillage; Soil carbon storage; Soil nitrogen; Tropical soils","cropping practice; mulching; net primary production; seeding; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; tillage; Brazil; South America; Embryophyta; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747781728

We hypothesized that subordinate and dominant Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. (Asteraceae) (common ragweed) plants growing in dense stands would not equally acquire or utilize carbon gains from CO2-enrichment, and that the resulting disproportionate growth gains to subordinates would reduce size inequalities in competing stands. We grew experimental stands of A. artemisiifolia in either ambient (360μLL-1) or twice ambient (720μLL-1) levels of atmospheric CO2. We compared the relative growth, photosynthetic capacity, and architecture of subordinate and dominant plants in each treatment, and assessed size inequalities using the stand-level coefficient of variation (CV). In elevated CO2, plants grew larger, but subordinate plants shifted more mass to upper stem allocation than dominants. Dominant plants demonstrated reduced leaf-level photosynthetic gains in elevated CO2 compared with subordinate plants. Reduced CVs in plant size reflected smaller proportional growth gains by dominants over subordinates in elevated vs. ambient stands. We conclude that differences in the architectural and physiological responses of subordinate and dominant ragweed plants reduce competition and allow subordinate plants to catch up to dominants in elevated CO2 conditions. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Ambrosia artemisiifolia; CO2; Dominant; Photosynthesis; Plant architecture; Ragweed; Size inequality; Subordinate","carbon dioxide; community structure; growth; herb; photosynthesis; physiology; plant architecture; Ambrosia; Ambrosia artemisiifolia; Asteraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747649768

Understanding these changes is challenging because there are complex interactions between 'direct' effects of N on plant physiology and soil biogeochemistry, and 'indirect' effects caused by changes in plant species composition. By planting high N and low N plant community compositions into high and low N deposition model terrestrial ecosystems we experimentally decoupled direct and indirect effects and quantified their contribution to changes in carbon, N and water cycling. Our results show that direct effects on plant growth dominate ecosystem response to N deposition, although long-term carbon storage is reduced under high N plant-species composition. These findings suggest that direct effects of N deposition on ecosystem function could be relatively strong in comparison with the indirect effects of plant community change. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Biodiversity; Evapotranspiration; Frequency dependence; Mineral-associated carbon; Mineralization; Net ecosystem productivity; Plant community composition; Soil decomposer community; Soil enzyme activity","fertilizer; nitrogen; biogeochemistry; carbon; carbon sequestration; community composition; hydrological cycle; nitrogen; physiology; soil; terrestrial ecosystem; article; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant; population dynamics; soil; Ecosystem; Fertilizers; Nitrogen; Plants; Population Dynamics; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747623276

For our analysis we use a global applied general equilibrium (AGE) model that includes consumers' lifestyle change, different production systems, emissions from agricultural sectors, and an emission permits system. Our study leads to the following conclusions. Firstly, more consumption of NPFs assists in reducing global agricultural emissions of methane (CH4), nitrous oxides (N2O) and NH3. However, because of international trade, emission reduction does not necessarily occur in the regions where more NPFs are consumed. Secondly, through lifestyle change of the 'rich', the emission reduction is not substantial because more 'intermediate' consumers will increase their meat consumption. Finally, for the same environmental target the production structure changes towards less intensive technologies and more grazing under environmental policy than under lifestyle change. © Springer 2006.","Applied general equilibrium models; Emissions; Lifestyles; Meat; Novel Protein Foods","Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Meats; Proteins; Public policy; Applied general equilibrium models; Emissions; Lifestyles; Novel Protein Foods; Food products; agricultural emission; alternative agriculture; ammonia; environmental policy; food consumption; general equilibrium analysis; international trade; lifestyle; methane; nitrous oxide; protein",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747588060

We develop the model proposed by Gierlinski & Done, which models the soft excess with heavily smeared, ionized, absorption, by including the emission that must be associated with this absorption. We show that, rather than hindering the ionized absorption model, the addition of the emission actually helps this model reproduce the soft excess. The emission fills in some of the absorption trough, while preserving the sharp rise at ∼1 keV, allowing the total model to reproduce the soft excess curvature from a considerably wider range of model parameters. We demonstrate that this model is capable of reproducing even the strongest soft X-ray excesses by fitting it to the XMM-Newton EPIC PN spectrum of PG1211+143, with good results. The addition of the emission reduces the column density required to fit these data by a factor of ~2 and reduces the smearing velocity from ∼0.28c to ∼0.2c. Gierlinski & Done suggested a tentative origin for the absorption in the innermost, accelerating, region of an accretion disc wind, and we highlight the advantages of this interpretation in comparison to accretion disc reflection models of the soft excess. Associating this material with a wind off the accretion disc results in several separate problems however, namely, the radial nature, and the massive implied mass-loss rate, of the wind. We propose an origin in a 'failed wind', where the central X-ray source is strong enough to overionize the wind, removing the acceleration through line absorption before the material reaches escape velocity, allowing the material to fall back to the disc at larger radii. © 2006 RAS.","Galaxies: active; Galaxies: individual: PG1211+143; X-rays: galaxies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747505789

We describe methods for incorporating simple migration rate assumptions into multispecies modelling, using the Proteaceae of the Cape Floristic Region. Even with optimistic migration assumptions, range loss projections more closely approximate null migration than full migration assumptions. Full migration results were positively skewed by few species with large range increases, an overestimate eliminated by dispersal-limited migration rate assumptions. Wind- and ant/rodent-dispersed species responded differently to climate change. Initially larger ranges of wind-dispersed species were more strongly reduced by climate change, despite far greater assumed dispersal distances - we suggest that these well-dispersed species populate more marginal areas of potential range, causing lower resilience to climatic changes at range margins. Overall, range loss rate slowed with advancing climate change, possibly because species ranges contracted into core areas most resilient to climate change. Thus, a consideration of simple dynamics of range change (rather than single step, present-future comparisons of range) provide new insights relevant for conservation strategies, in particular, and for guiding monitoring efforts to detect and gauge the impacts of climate change on natural populations. © 2006 The Authors.","Bioclimatic models; Conservation; Dispersal; Extinction; Fynbos; GAM; Global change","bioclimatology; Cape Floristic Region; climate change; dispersal; ecological modeling; fynbos; home range; migratory behavior; Africa; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Proteaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747428088

The effects of different ion density and ion energy power settings on the chemical composition of the fluorocarbon layer deposited during the etch process were investigated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to analyse the chemical composition of the post-etched low-k CDO films while spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) was used to determine the overall film thickness. XPS spectra of the C1s core levels reveal that the relative concentration of CFx species in the fluorocarbon films reduced as ion density source power and ion energy power levels were increased, and this can be correlated with a higher etch rate and thinner fluorocarbon layer. Plasma conditions which led to the deposition of a thick fluorocarbon film significantly inhibited the etch rate. This work demonstrates that the chemical composition and the thickness of the fluorocarbon film can be controlled by the plasma power parameters, and this has implications for the etching of ULK CDO layers. © 2006 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Ellipsometry; Fluorocarbons; Permittivity; Plasma etching; Semiconductor doping; Spectroscopic analysis; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Carbon-doped oxide (CDO) films; Ion density source power; Ion energy power settings; Plasma power parameters; Semiconducting films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747271345

The geometries and electronic structures of all complexes in the training sets are optimized within the conductor like screening (COSMO) solvation model. Based on the linear correlation equation δ exp = ̧[ρ(0) - 11884.0] + C, the best fitting for 17 Fe 2+,2.5+ complexes (totally 31 Fe sites) yields α = -0.405 ± 0.042 and C = 0.735 ± 0.047 mm s -1. The correlation coefficient is r = -0.876 with a standard deviation of SD = 0.075 mm s -1. In contrast, the linear fitting for 19 Fe 2.5+,3+,3.5+,4+ complexes (totally 30 Fe sites) yields α = -0.393 ± 0.030 and C = 0.435 ± 0.014 mm s -1, with the correlation coefficient r = -0.929 and a standard deviation SD = 0.077 mm s -1. We provide a physical rationale for separating the Fe 2+,2.5+ fit from the Fe 2.5+,3+,3.5+,4+ fit, which also is clearly justified on a statistical empirical basis. Quadrupole splittings have also been calculated for these systems. The correlation between the calculated (ΔE Q(cal)) and experimental (ΔE Q(exp)) quadrupole splittings based on |ΔE Q(exp)| = A |ΔE Q(cal)| + B yields slope A, which is almost the ideal value 1.0 (A = 1.002 ± 0.030) and intercept B almost zero (B = 0.033 ± 0.068 mm s -1).

The compounds were characterized by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), specific surface area measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO). The LaNiO3 perovskite exhibited activity to methane reforming, but suffered a slow deactivation with time-on-stream. Nevertheless, substitution of the A site metal ion with a tetravalent metal cation (Ce) led to an increase in catalytic activity. Moreover, the insertion of Ce increased the stability of the catalysts with respect to the reforming reaction. The La0.95Ce0.05NiO3 catalyst showed the highest activity, with CO2 conversion of 62% at 1023 K. The XRD and TPR analyses confirmed that at high Ce contents, ceria appears as segregated CeO2 phase and interferes with the rate of perovskite structure formation, so that NiO and La2NiO4 are produced. As a consequence of the low solubility of cerium oxide, its insertion in the perovskite structure is also possible in the low Ce-content regions. This low amount of cerium incorporated is responsible not only for the enhancement of catalytic performance of the perovskite after its activation by reduction, but also for the inhibition of carbon formation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The instrument is configured with a correction factor required by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to account for the difference between the TEOM and the gravimetric method. However, numerous studies have shown that this factor does not fully account for these differences, consequently, the European Commission (EC) insists on an independent assessment of the differences. The US EPA correction was found to contribute between 3 and 5 μg m-3 to the daily mean PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations at Marylebone Road, London, between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2004. The TEOM is also configured to express measurements to a standard temperature (25 °C) and a standard pressure (1 atm). This differs from the US EPA requirement of ambient reporting conditions for both PM10 and PM2.5. It also differs from the European position, which also requires reporting at ambient conditions. When compared to ambient reporting conditions, the TEOM standard temperature and pressure correction was found to contribute between -1 and 7 μg m-3 to the daily mean PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, and 2 μg m-3 to the annual mean concentrations. The standard temperature and pressure correction was also demonstrated to vary the annual mean concentration measured using the TEOM by 2-8% between European capital cities, with higher values in colder northern cities. The standard temperature and pressure correction to individual daily mean concentrations was shown to be up to 20%. It is recommended that the US EPA correction factor is removed from TEOM measurements and that all measurements are reported at ambient temperature and pressure. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Linear improvement is to apply to the mean visibility degradation on the statistically 20% worst days, measured as a Haze Index in units of deciviews (log of aerosol extinction). We use a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) with 1°×1° horizontal resolution to simulate present-day visibility statistics in the USA, compare them to observations from the Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) surface network, and provide natural and background visibility statistics for application of the Regional Haze Rule. Background is defined by suppression of US anthropogenic emissions but allowance for present-day foreign emissions and associated import of pollution. Our model is highly successful at reproducing the observed variability of visibility statistics for present-day conditions, including the low tail of the frequency distribution that is most representative of natural or background conditions. We find considerable spatial and temporal variability in natural visibility over the USA, especially due to fires in the west. A major uncertainty in estimating natural visibility is the sensitivity of biogenic organic aerosol formation to the availability of preexisting anthropogenic aerosol. Background visibility is more variable than natural visibility and the 20% worst days show large contributions from Canadian and Mexican pollution. Asian pollution, while degrading mean background visibility, is relatively less important on the worst days. Recognizing the influence of uncontrollable transboundary pollution in the Regional Haze Rule would substantially decrease the schedule of emission reductions required in the 2004-18 implementation phase. Meaningful application of the Rule in the future will require projections of future trends in foreign anthropogenic emissions, wildfire frequency, and climate variables. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Some of the highly reactive VOC emissions from these facilities can be episodic, so in this work, photochemical air quality models, capable of simulating hundreds of possible types of emission events, have been developed and used to assess the impact of event magnitude, duration, timing and composition on ozone formation and accumulation. Simulations showed that ozone formation varied from nearly zero to up to 30 ppb per 1000 lb of release and that ozone formation depended strongly on the time of day of the release. The time of day that leads to maximum increases in ozone varies from day to day, depending on meteorology and NOx availability. On days and times that were conducive to ozone formation, the maximum additional ozone formation due to emission events was linearly related to emission magnitude, but the slope of that dependence varied based on the composition of the events. Overall, only a small percentage of emission events have the potential to lead to substantial ozone formation.

It is anthropogenically emitted as a pollutant from coal fired power plants and naturally emitted, primarily from volcanoes. Its unique chemical characteristics enable global atmospheric transport and it is deposited after various processes, ultimately ending up in one of its final sinks, such as incorporated into deep sediment or bioaccumulated, primarily in the marine environment. All forms of Hg have been established as toxic, and there have been no noted biological benefits from the metal. Throughout time, there have been notable incidents of Hg intoxication documented, and the negative health effects have been documented to those chronically or acutely exposed. Today, exposure to Hg is largely diet or occupationally dependent, however, many are exposed to Hg from their amalgam fillings. This paper puts a tentative monetary value on Hg polluted food sources in the Arctic, where local, significant pollution sources are limited, and relates this to costs for strategies avoiding Hg pollution and to remediation costs of contaminated sites in Sweden and Japan. The case studies are compiled to help policy makers and the public to evaluate whether the benefits to the global environment from banning Hg and limiting its initial emission outweigh the benefits from its continued use or lack of control of Hg emissions. The cases we studied are relevant for point pollution sources globally and their remediation costs ranged between 2500 and 1.1 million US$ kg- 1 Hg isolated from the biosphere. Therefore, regulations discontinuing mercury uses combined with extensive flue gas cleaning for all power plants and waste incinerators is cost effective. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

A quantitative experimental measure of the state of the art and variations therein is a first step towards establishing principles of bicycle helmet ventilation. A thermal headform mounted in a climate-regulated wind tunnel was used to study the ventilation efficiency of 24 bicycle helmets at two wind speeds. Flow visualization in a water tunnel with a second headform demonstrated the flow patterns involved. The influence of design details such as channel length and vent placement was studied, as well as the impact of hair. Differences in heat transfer among the helmets of up to 30% (scalp) and 10% (face) were observed, with the nude headform showing the highest values. On occasion, a negative role of some vents for forced convection was demonstrated. A weak correlation was found between the projected vent cross-section and heat transfer variations when changing the head tilt angle. A simple analytical model is introduced that facilitates the understanding of forced convection phenomena. A weak correlation between exposed scalp area and heat transfer was deduced. Adding a wig reduces the heat transfer by approximately a factor of 8 in the scalp region and up to one-third for the rest of the head for a selection of the best ventilated helmets. The results suggest that there is significant optimization potential within the basic helmet structure represented in modern bicycle helmets.","Bicycle; Comfort; Heat exchange; Helmet ventilation","air conditioning; airflow; article; bicycle; controlled study; correlational study; experimental study; exposure; heat transfer; helmet; phenomenology; quantitative study; scalp; thermodynamics; velocity; wind; Bicycling; Equipment Design; Head Protective Devices; Humans; Models, Biological; Thermodynamics; Ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746782155

They are biologically driven, linked to the acid-base system (pH, titration alkalinity, CO2 distribution) and to oxidation-reduction reactions (O2 depletion, CO2 reduction and generation, HCO 3- generation). The development of anoxia, in the shallowest and most productive basin, is associated with the generation of HCO3-, increase of electrical conductance, and some elevation of pH. This connection is lacking in the deeper basins with less complete depletion of O2. Vertical gradients of pH, some exceeding 2.5 units, develop during summer stratification in all three basins. The largest are due to the photosynthetic depletion of CO2 in the epilimnion by dense concentrations of phytoplankton. Long-term records indicate an accentuation during lake eutrophication. There is also some increase of pH in hypolimnetic water when anoxic, with free CO2 partly converted to HCO3-. Depth-profiles of conductance reflect the production of HCO3- in deep anoxic regions. They can also indicate, as by minima, the descent of relatively cool flood-water. © Springer 2006.","Alkalinity; Anoxia; pH; Photosynthesis; Redox","Algae; Alkalinity; Carbon dioxide; Catchments; pH effects; Photosynthesis; Redox reactions; Anoxia; Chemical stratification; Hypolimnetic water; Titration alkalinity; Lakes; algal bloom; anoxia; electrical conductivity; eutrophication; pH; photosynthesis; seasonal variation; stratification; England; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746781305

We test here the hypothesis that, by removing an important part of the fish biomass from a lake, a significant amount of methylmercury can be eliminated, therefore reducing the mercury available to the remaining biota, at least in the short term. A mass burden approach is used to evaluate the partitioning of total mercury and methylmercury in natural lake ecosystems. Three small natural lakes from the James Bay territory, in northern Québec, Canada, were selected for intensive fishing. Mercury (Hg) and methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations were evaluated for sediments, water column (dissolved fraction and suspended particulate matter), plankton, aquatic invertebrates, and fish. Biomasses were determined for fish, plankton, and aquatic invertebrates. Two case scenarios are presented using different mercury contributions from the sediment component (1 cm depth, and no sediment). Our results for the scenario including the sediment contribution show that lake sediments represent over 98% of the total mercury while the biotic components represent less than 0.1% of the same burden. For methylmercury, fish account for up to 5% of the burden, while sediments make up 84.6% to 93.1%. If we put aside the sediment contribution, the methylmercury in fish partitioning can represent up to 48%. As for invertebrates, they can account for up to 48% of the total MeHg burden. We do not observe any change in the partitionings or the quantities of Hg and MeHg before and after fishing in either of the two case scenarios even when we do not take into account dynamics of the ecosystems. This will be all the more the case when the dynamics of the system are included in the analyses. Therefore, biological parameters such as growth rates or fish diet must be considered. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The study aimed to compare mercury concentrations in these environmental samples with those reported by other authors during the gold rush of the Madeira River Basin. Today, in the Madeira River the releases of mercury register a sudden reduction due the gold price fall in the international trade. However, about 100 t of Hg were released to the atmosphere and to aquatic systems in the region during the gold rush. The present survey shows that notwithstanding the reduction of Hg emissions to the Madeira River Basin from gold mining proper, concentrations in fish and humans are similar to those measured during the gold rush. Reduction in Hg concentrations is restricted to areas close to old point sources and only for abiotic compartments (air and sediments). Remobilization of Hg from bottom sediments plus re-emission from soils due to land use changes are probably responsible for keeping high Hg concentrations in biological samples. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

To examine differential growth response to soil resources, we grew seedlings of nine tropical tree species at 6.0% of full sun for 12 mo in a factorial design of two soil types (clay and white sand), two phosphate fertilization treatments (control and addition of 100 mg P kg-1) and two watering treatments (field capacity and water limitation to one-third field capacity). Species differed markedly in biomass growth rate, but this hierarchy was almost completely conserved across all eight treatments. All species grew more slowly in sand than clay soils, and no species grew faster with phosphate additions. Only Eperua grandiflora and E. falcata showed significant growth increases in the absence of water limitation. Faster-growing species were characterized by high specific leaf area, high leaf allocation and high net assimilation rate but not lower root allocation. Slower-growing species exhibited greater plasticity in net assimilation rate, suggesting that tolerance of edaphic stress in these species is related more to stomatal control than to whole-plant carbon allocation. Although relative growth rate for biomass was correlated with both its physiological and morphological components, interspecific differences were best explained by differences in net assimilation rate across six of the eight treatments. A suite of traits including high assimilation and high specific leaf area maintains rapid growth rate of faster-growing species across a wide gradient of soil resources, but the lack of plasticity they exhibit may compromise their survival in the poorest soil environments.

Box 9035, NL-6800 ET Arnhem, Netherlands","About 30% of the electricity produced in the Netherlands is generated by coal, all of which is imported. At the same time, the co-combustion of biomass is becoming increasingly important. For the last 25 years, the fate of the elements/trace elements in general and of mercury in particular has been studied in great detail. It appears that on average 50% of the mercury is removed in the ESP (particulate control) and 50% of the remainder is removed in the flue gas desulphurization (FGD), resulting in a total mercury removal of 75%. If a high dust selective catalytic reduction (SCR for NOx reduction) is present, the total removal can be up to 90%. The results indicate that on average the removal of mercury during the co-combustion of biomass is similar to that found for full coal-firing. The conclusion is that a modern coal-fired power station with the above-mentioned flue gas cleaning equipment also removes mercury up to 90%. These cleaning devices are being installed to reduce the emission of particulates, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. This means that mercury abatement can be increased while meeting the EU regulation for SO2 and NOx.

However, microalgal populations will possibly adapt to rising CO2 levels in such a way that they become genetically different from contemporary populations. The unknown properties of these future populations introduce an undefined error into predictions of C pool dynamics, especially the presence and size of the biological C pump. To address the bias in predictions introduced by evolution, we measured the kinetics of CO2 uptake in populations of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that had been selected for growth at high CO2 for 1000 generations. Following selection at high CO2, the populations were unable to induce high-affinity CO2 uptake, and one line had a lower rate of net CO2 uptake. We attribute this to conditionally neutral mutations in genes affecting the C concentrating mechanism (CCM). Lower affinity CO 2 uptake, in addition to smaller population sizes, results in a significant reduction in net CO2 uptake of about 38% relative to contemporary populations under the same conditions. This shows how predictions about the properties of communities in the future can be influenced by the effect of natural selection. © 2006 The Authors.","Carbon concentrating mechanism; Experimental evolution; Natural selection","carbon; carbon dioxide; oxygen; carbon; carbon dioxide; evolutionary theory; green alga; growth rate; mutation; nutrient uptake; phytoplankton; population structure; primary production; animal; article; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; drug effect; genetic selection; genetics; metabolism; mutation; photosynthesis; physiology; Animals; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Mutation; Oxygen; Photosynthesis; Selection (Genetics); Chlamydomonas reinhardtii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746565880

Such information is necessary to understand plant adaptation and evolution in future rising CO2. Here, quantitative trait loci (QTL) for leaf growth, development, quality and leaf senescence were determined in a tree pedigree - an F2 hybrid of Populus trichocarpa T. &amp; G and Populus deltoides Marsh, following season-long exposure to either current day ambient carbon dioxide (a[CO2]) or e[CO2] at 600 μL L-1. Leaf growth and development differed between the grandparents such that P. trichocarpa showed greater response to e[CO2]. In the F2 generation, leaf development and quality traits including leaf area, leaf shape, epidermal cell area, and stomatal number, specific leaf area (SLA), and the phenology trait, canopy senescence index, were sensitive to e[CO2]. Sixty-nine QTL were mapped for the 19 traits of plants in a[CO2] while 60 QTL were mapped for plants in e [CO2]. The results suggest that although many QTL mapped to common positions in a[CO2] and e[CO2], confirming their importance in determining growth, there was also differential genetic control for a number of traits including leaf senescence. Candidate genes were shown to collocate to regions where response QTL mapped.

Metal-ligand coordination is inferred from the shifting of the νC{double bond, long}N stretching vibration mode in the 1610-1620 cm-1 region when compared to that of the free ligand. The UV-Vis spectra show one band around 640 nm typical for square planar Cu(II) complexes.

Bis(N-n-octyl-2-hydroxy-1-naphthaldiminato)-copper(II) has been studied with X-ray diffraction. The molecular structure shows the copper atom in a planar environment and the n-octyl chains having thermal disorder. The crystal packing shows stacked units intermolecularly separated by 3.33 Å, probably due to π-π interactions between naphthyl groups, and Cu-O and O-O separations of 3.95 and 3.42 Å, respectively. The magnetic susceptibility data between 10 and 300 K are indicative of diluted paramagnetic behavior.

The evaluation was based on four criteria with increasing usefulness for 8-h ozone controls. The four criteria can be briefly described as: (1) smooth functional behavior between ozone benefits/disbenefits and the magnitude of the indicator ratio, (2) narrow separation between beneficial and detrimental regimes for oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions controls, (3) narrow transition regime between where volatile organic compound controls are more beneficial than NOx controls and vice versa, and (4) invariance of these transition ranges in time and space. None of the indicator ratios met all criteria. We present results for five sub-regions in northern California. The transition regime for criteria (3) was found to be much wider than that for criteria (2) for all sub-regions. Hence, the indicator ratios may be of only limited usefulness in determining precursor limitations and might be more valuable in diagnosing if NOx controls are beneficial or detrimental.","CCOS; OBM; Ozone control; Photochemical transport model; Precursor limitations","Environmental impact; Geographical regions; Nitrogen oxides; Photochemical reactions; Volatile organic compounds; CCOS; OBM; Ozone control; Photochemical transport model; Precursor limitations; Ozone; nitrogen; oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; nitrogen oxides; ozone; photochemistry; three-dimensional modeling; volatile organic compound; air pollution; article; indicator organism; priority journal; United States; California; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745992304

One of the fundamental aims of the SBP was to link the activity and diversity of microbes with functional roles in the cycling of plant derived carbon through the soil food web. For this purpose novel isotope tracer approaches were applied, whereby stable isotope (13C) labelled CO2 was fed to plants and the root-released labelled carbon was traced into soil microbial biomarkers.

Slightly anisotropic EPR signals were detected during electrochemical reduction of single-walled carbon nanotubes and fullerene peapods in the potential region from -1.75 to -2.15 V vs. decamethylferrocene/decamethylferrocinium couple. They are centered at g = 2.0038 and exhibit a hyperfine structure indicating the presence of functional groups containing N, O, H atoms in neighborhood. They differ from the EPR signals of chemically (potassium) doped SWCNT and C60@SWCNT. As the EPR signal is influenced by the electrolyte counter ions a reaction with electrolysis products of tetraalkylammonium cations is taken into consideration. No EPR lines of fullerene anions were found in electrochemically treated peapods, but these anions are detectable, if a free C60 in solution is cathodically reduced on a SWCNT electrode. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A bioclimatic approach to designing comfortable buildings in hot and humid tropical regions requires, firstly, some preliminary, important work on the building envelope to limit the energy contributions, and secondly, an airflow optimization based on the analysis of natural ventilation airflow networks. For the first step, tools such as nodal or zonal models have been largely implemented in building energy codes to evaluate energy transport between indoor and outdoor. For the second step, the assessment of air velocities, in three dimensions and in a large space, can only be performed through the use of detailed models such as with CFD. A new modelling approach based on the derivation of a new quantity-i.e. the well-ventilated percentage of a living space is proposed. The well-ventilated percentage of a space allows a time analysis of the air motion behaviour of the building in its environment. These percentages can be over a period such as 1 day, a season or a year. Twelve living spaces with different configuration of openings have been studied to compare the performance of ventilation function of the opening distribution. Results and discussion are presented in the paper. This method is helpful for an architect to design the rooms according to their use, and their environment. Finally, the developed models can be used in building projects to estimate the period of the natural ventilation and to reduce the energy consumption due to air-conditioning. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

It provides an indication of the information that can be generated combining Land Suitability Analysis and climate change scenarios. By considering the changing suitability of a few key agricultural enterprises in this region, the project offers an important direction for the agricultural elements of the Victorian Greenhouse Strategy. This pilot project utilises Land Suitability Analysis (LSA) developed by the former Victorian Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE) under the National Land and Water Resources Audit of Australia and further enhanced with Local Government and Catchment Management Authorities across Victoria. This modelling technique allows for an assessment of impacts on a wide range of commodities beyond the historic focus of cropping and pasture models. Following a series of workshops with agronomists, soil scientists, climate scientists, strategic planners and growers, a series of maps/overlays were prepared for Gippsland showing potential suitability of blue gum plantations, Cool Climate Grapes and high yield pasture, as an initial illustration of the methodology. This potential suitability has since been adjusted/modified using a variety of climate change scenarios developed by CSIRO Climate Impacts Group, resulting in an assessment of the change in potential suitability for each enterprise at years 2020 and 2050. The resultant work can be analysed using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to consider change over time and space in the region. Combined with changes in water availability, this may act as an innovative and powerful decision support tool for policy makers in government and industry. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Fire smoke has been associated with irritation of the throat, lung and eyes, and respiratory problems. Climate extreme increases associated with climate change would cause physical damage, population displacement, and adverse effects on food production, freshwater availability and quality. It would also increase the risks of infectious and vector-borne diseases. Climate change impacts the geographical range, seasonality, and the incidence rate of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria. Climate-related ecological changes may expand cholera transmission, particularly among populations in low-laying tropical coastal areas. El Niño conditions may affect the incidence of infectious diseases, such as malaria. Ocean warming would increase temperature-sensitive toxins produced by phytoplankton, which could cause more frequent contamination of seafood. A clearer understanding on the current role of climate change in disease patterns will be able to improve forecasts of potential future impacts of projected climate change and support action to reduce such impacts.","Climate; Human health; Latin America",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646717090

The gain for Latin America is mainly a result of increased export revenues from sales of bio-fuels as a result of the climate policy. It is, on the other hand, unlikely that these allocation approaches would offer an economic incentive for China to join the regime because of its high economic growth, present higher per capita emissions than India and Africa, and more costly mitigation options than Latin America. A more stringent allocation for developing countries such as contraction with convergence of the per capita emissions by the end of this century is estimated to generate reduced net gains or increased net losses for the developing regions (though Africa is still expected to gain). © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It has been suggested that this was caused by a tectonic event, with no climatic change playing a role in desiccation. Quantifying the climate of the region during this period will help support or refute this hypothesis. An effective method for reconstructing the climate from Neogene pollen data is the ""Climatic Amplitude Method"" based on the modern climatic requirements of plants to interpret fossil data. It has been conceived especially for periods devoid of modern vegetation analogue. Twenty Messinian to Lower Zanclean pollen sequences are now available in the peri-Mediterranean region. Most of them do not cover the whole Messinian interval, particularly those along the Mediterranean shorelines where sedimentation was interrupted during the sea's desiccation. In contrast, sedimentation was almost continuous in such areas as the Atlantic side of Morocco, along the Adriatic coast (including the Po Valley), and to a lesser extent the Black Sea. The Mediterranean sites nonetheless provide a reliable if not a discontinuous record of vegetation variability in time and space. A first examination of the pollen diagrams reveals a high regional variability controlled by local conditions, and throughout the interval a southward increase in herb pollen frequency in contrast to the tree pollen frequency. This indicates that open and probably dry environments existed in the southern Mediterranean region prior to, during and after the salinity crisis. Trees developed in areas close to mountains such as in the Po Valley, in Cerdanya and in the Black Sea region. Most variations observed in the pollen diagrams are constrained by fluctuations of Pinus pollen amounts, indicating eustatic variations. Climatic quantification from pollen data does not show obvious climatic changes due to the desiccation of the Mediterranean Sea, especially in the dry and warm southwestern Mediterranean area (Sicily, southern Spain and North Africa). At Maccarone, along the Adriatic Sea, a decrease in temperatures of the coldest month and, less importantly, a decrease in mean annual temperatures, corresponding to a drastic vegetation change, are reconstructed. These temperature variations are assumed to be controlled by regional environmental changes (massive arrival of waters in this basin) rather than to reflect cooling, because some authors link the second phase of evaporite deposition to a period of global warming. Some migrations of plants probably occurred as a response to Mediterranean desiccation. But the climatic contrast which has probably existed at that time between the central Mediterranean and the peripheral areas might be amplified. Climatic reconstruction from pollen data in the western Mediterranean area shows that climate is not the direct cause of the Mediterranean desiccation, as the Mediterranean region had experienced continuously high evaporation long before the crisis. Therefore the main factor leading to this event seems to be the successive closures of the Betic and Rifian corridors, isolating the Mediterranean Sea from the Atlantic Ocean. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This approach has been used since the early to mid-1990s by climate modeling groups from France, the United States, Canada, and Australia, among others, along with or as an alternative to the current widely used nested-grid approach. Stretched-grid GCMs are used for continuous/autonomous climate simulations, as are usual GCMs, with the only difference being that variable resolution grids are used instead of more traditional uniform grids. The important advantages of variable resolution stretched-grid GCMs are that they do not require any lateral boundary conditions/forcing and are free of the associated undesirable computational problems; as a result, they provide self-consistent interactions between global and regional scales of motion and their associated phenomena as in uniform grid GCMs. The international stretched-grid model intercomparison project, phase 1 (SGMIP-1), using variable resolution GCMs developed at major centers/groups in Australia, Canada, France, and the United States, was initiated in 2001 and successfully conducted in 2002-2005. The results of the 12-year (1987-1998) climate simulations for a major part of North America are available at the SGMIP Web site: http://essic.umd.edu/~foxrab/sgmip.html. The SGMIP-1 multimodel ensemble results for the region compare well with reanalysis and observations in terms of spatial and temporal diagnostics. Regional biases for time-averaged model products are mostly limited to about half (or less) of typical reanalysis errors, i.e., within the uncertainties of the available reanalyses, while a high quality of global circulation is preserved.

In this study the radiative effects of mineral dust have been fully incorporated into a regional atmospheric dust model. Dust affects the radiative fluxes at the surface and the top of the atmosphere and the temperature profiles at every model time step when the radiation module is processed. These changes influence the atmospheric dynamics, moisture physics, and near-surface conditions. Furthermore, dust emission is modified by changes in friction velocity and turbulent exchange coefficients; dust turbulent mixing, transport, and deposition are altered by changes in atmospheric stability, precipitation conditions, and free-atmosphere winds. A major dust outbreak with dust optical depths reaching 3.5 at 550 nm over the Mediterranean region on April 2002 is selected to assess the radiative dust effects on the atmosphere at a regional level. A strong dust negative feedback upon dust emission (35-45% reduction of the AOD) resulted from the smaller outgoing sensible turbulent heat flux decreasing the turbulent momentum transfer from the atmosphere and consequently dust emission. Significant improvements of the atmospheric temperature and mean sea-level pressure forecasts are obtained over dust-affected areas by considerably reducing both warm and cold temperature biases existing in the model without dust-radiation interactions. This study demonstrates that the use of the proposed model with integrated dust and atmospheric radiation represents a promising approach for further improvements in numerical weather prediction practice and radiative impact assessment over dust-affected areas.

We evaluate two advanced approaches to estimating the temporal variation in ammonia emissions: a process-based approach and an inverse-modeled approach. These inventories are used as inputs to a three-dimensional CTM, PMCAMx. The model predictions of aerosol NH4+ concentration, NHx (NHx ≡ NH3 + NH4+) concentration, wet-deposited NH4+ mass flux, and NH4+ precipitation concentration are compared with observations. However, it should be cautioned that errors in model inputs other than the ammonia emissions may bias such comparisons. We estimate the robustness of each of these amodel-measurement comparisons as the ratio of the sensitivity to changes in emissions over the sensitivity to errors in the CTM inputs other than the ammonia emission inventory. We find the NHx concentration to be the only indicator that is sufficiently robust during all time periods. Using this as an indicator, the ammonia emission inventories with diurnal and seasonal variation improve the PMCAMx predictions in the summer and winter. In the United States, future efforts to improve the spatial and temporal accuracy of ammonia emission inventories are limited by a lack of a long-term, widespread network of highly time-resolved NHx measurements.

This has lead to a growing demand for hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs) to reduce air pollution and consumption of fossil fuels. CSIRO Energy Technology has developed the ultra-battery, a new technology that will reduce the cost and boost the performance of batteries in HEVs. The ultra-battery is a hybrid energy-storage device, which combines an asymmetric supercapacitor, and a lead-acid battery in one unit cell, taking the best from both technologies without the need for extra electronic controls. The capacitor will enhance the power and lifespan of the lead-acid battery as it acts as a buffer in discharging and charging. Consequently, this hybrid technology is able to provide and absorb charge rapidly during vehicle acceleration and braking. The ultra-battery has been subjected to a variety of tests. To date, results show that the discharge and charge power of the ultra-battery is ∼50% higher and its cycle-life is at least three times longer than that of the conventional lead-acid counterpart. Furthermore, the ultra-battery is able to be produced as either flooded-electrolyte or valve-regulated designs in the existing lead-acid factory and also able to reconfigure for a variety of applications, such as conventional automobile, power tool, forklift, high-power uninterruptible power supply and remote-area power supply. The prototype ultra-batteries have been constructed and are under laboratory evaluation and field trial. The success of the ultra-battery will obviously make HEVs more affordable and widespread. This, in turn, will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the urban environment and the consumption of limited supplies of fossil fuels. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The importance of soil in ecosystem structure and function depends largely on its organic carbon (C) compounds. Plant net primary production (NPP) is the principal source of soil organic C. Soil formation and horizon differentiation result from weathering and translocation processes in the presence of living or dead organic matter. Vegetation is a major control of the status of soil organic C despite interactions with microclimate, soil, successional processes, slope, aspect, and elevation. Combining process modeling and global change considerations seems appropriate, particularly when one considers the implications of global warming on organic C reserves of the higher latitude biomes.

Results: Comparing the response of Arabidopsis wild-type plants with that of the mutants adg1, pgr1 and vtc1 upon altered CO2-availability, the regulatory role of the cellular energy status, photosynthetic electron transport, the redox state and concentration of ascorbate and glutathione and the assimilatory force was analyzed in relation to the transcript abundance of stress-responsive nuclear encoded genes and psaA and psbA encoding the reaction centre proteins of photosystem I and II, respectively. Transcript abundance of Bap1, Stp1, psaA and psaB was coupled with seven metabolic parameters. Especially for psaA and psaB, the complex analysis demonstrated that the assumed PQ-dependent redox control is subordinate to signals linked to the relative availability of 3-PGA and DHAP, which define the assimilatory force. For the transcripts of sAPx and Csd2 high correlations with the calculated redox state of NADPH were observed in pgr1, but not in wildtype, suggesting that in wild-type plants signals depending on thylakoid acidification overlay a predominant redox-signal. Strongest correlation with the redox state of ascorbate was observed for 2CPA, whose transcript abundance regulation however was almost insensitive to the ascorbate content demonstrating dominance of redox regulation over metabolite sensing. Conclusion: In the mutants, signalling pathways are partially uncoupled, demonstrating dominance of metabolic control of photoreaction centre expression over sensing the redox state of the PQ-pool. The balance between the cellular redox poise and the energy signature regulates sAPx and Csd2 transcript abundance, while 2CPA expression is primarily redox-controlled. © 2006 Wormuth et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis protein; carbon monoxide; chlorophyll; chlorophyll a; enzyme; plant RNA; primer DNA; Arabidopsis; gene expression regulation; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; photosynthesis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Carbon Monoxide; Chlorophyll; DNA Primers; Enzymes; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Photosynthesis; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Plant; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749244436

Air masses polluted by anthropogenic sources, identified by concurrently elevated levels of carbon monoxide (CO), SF6, and CHCl3, were sampled over a wide geographical range of these two countries. For each polluted air mass, we calculated emission ratios of halocarbons to CO and employed the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model to determine the footprint associated with the air mass. Gridded CO emission estimates were then mapped onto the footprints and combined with measured emission ratios to generate footprint-weighted halocarbon flux estimates. We present statistically significant linear relationships between halocarbon fluxes (excluding CCl4) and footprint-weighted population densities, with slopes representative of per capita emission rates. These rates indicate that contemporary emissions of five restricted halocarbons (excluding CCl4) in the United States and Canada continue to account for significant fractions (7-40%) of global emissions.

For this purpose, the big region and grid-based Bayesian inversion methods are presented and compared. In the former setup, the monthly emissions over large geographical regions are quantified. In the grid-based setup, the fluxes are optimized at the spatial resolution of the model and on a monthly basis. Source-specific spatiotemporal correlations among errors on the prior emissions are introduced in order to better constrain the inversion problem. Both inversion techniques bring the model columns much closer to the measurements at all latitudes, but the grid-based analysis achieves a higher reduction of the overall model/data bias. Further comparisons with observed mixing ratios at NOAA Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory and Global Atmosphere Watch sites, as well as with airborne measurements are also presented. The inferred emission estimates are weakly dependent on the prior errors and correlations. Our best estimate for the global CO source amounts to 2900 Tg CO/yr in both inversion approaches, about 5% higher than the prior. The global anthropogenic emission estimate is 18% larger than the prior, with the biggest increase for east Asia and a substantial decrease in south Asia. The vegetation fire emission estimates decrease as well, from the prior 467 Tg CO/yr to 450 Tg CO/yr in the grid-based solution and 434 Tg CO/yr in the monthly big region setup, mainly due to a significant reduction of African savanna fire emissions. The biogenic CO/VOC flux estimates are found to be enhanced by about 15% on the global scale. The most significant error reductions concern the biogenic emissions in the tropics, the Asian anthropogenic emissions, and the vegetation fire source over Africa. Our inversion results are further compared with previously reported emission estimates.

Common forest management practices, such as fertilization and thinning, can change wood and stand properties and thus may change vulnerability to ice storm damage. At the same time, increasing atmospheric CO2 levels may also influence ice storm vulnerability. Here we show that a nonintensively managed pine plantation explerienced a ∼250 g C m-2 reduction in living biomass during a single storm, equivalent to ∼30% of the annual net ecosystem carbon exchange of this ecosystem. Drawing on weather and damage survey data from the entire storm cell, the amount of C transferred from the living to the dead biomass pool (26.5 ± 3.3 Tg C), 85% of which will decompose within 25 years, was equivalent to ∼10% of the estimated annual sequestration in conterminous U.S. forests. Conifer trees were more than twice as likely to be killed as leafless deciduous broadleaf trees. In the Duke Forest case study, nitrogen fertilization had no effect on storm-induced carbon transfer from the living to detrital pool while thinning increased carbon transfer threefold. Elevated CO2 (administered with the free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) system) reduced the storm-induced carbon transfer to a third. Because of the lesser leaf area reduction, plots growing under elevated CO2 also exhibited a smaller reduction in biomass production the following year. These results suggest that forests may suffer less damage during each ice storm event of similar severity in a future with higher atmospheric CO2.

Datasets with proven high quality such as NCEP's North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR), and the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) U.S.-Mexico precipitation analysis are used as targets for simulations. Climatological precipitation is not easily simulated. While models capture winter precipitation very well over the U.S. northwest, they encounter failure over the U.S. southeast in the same season. Summer precipitation over the central United States and Mexico is also a great challenge for models, particularly the timing. In general the UKMO-HadCM3 is closest to the observations. The models' potential in simulating interannual hydroclimate variability over North America during the warm season is varied and limited to the central United States. Models like PCM, and in particular UKMO-HadCM3, exhibit reasonably well the observed distribution and relative importance of remote and local contributions to precipitation variability over the region (i.e., convergence of remote moisture fluxes dominate over local evapotranspiration). However, in models like CCSM3 and GFDL-CM2.1 local contributions dominate over remote ones, in contrast with warm-season observations. In the other extreme are models like GISS-EH and MIROC3.2(hires) that prioritize the remote influence of moisture fluxes and neglect the local influence of land surface processes to the regional precipitation variability. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric humidity; Climate change; Computer simulation; Evapotranspiration; Mathematical models; Precipitation (meteorology); Climatological precipitation; General circulation model; Hydroclimate variability; Climatology; climate prediction; climate variation; general circulation model; paleoclimate; simulation; twentieth century",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748858698

Traditionally, additivity is assumed in the assessment of the aerosol climate impact, as the underlying bulk aerosol models are largely constrained to linearity. The microphysical aerosol module HAM establishes degrees of freedom for nonlinear responses of the aerosol system. In this study's results, aerosol column mass burdens respond nonlinearly to changes in anthropogenic emissions, manifested in alterations of the aerosol lifetimes. Specific emission changes induce modifications of aerosol cycles with unaltered emissions, indicating a microphysical coupling of the aerosol cycles. Anthropogenic carbonaceous emissions disproportionately contribute to the accumulation mode numbers close to the source regions. In contrast, anthropogenic sulfuric emissions less than proportionally contribute to the accumulation mode numbers close to the source regions and disproportionately contribute in remote regions. The additivity of the aerosol system is analyzed by comparing the changes from a simulation with emission changes for several compounds with the sum of changes of single simulations, in each of which one of the emission changes was introduced. Close to the anthropogenic source regions, deviations from additivity are found at up to 30% and 15% for the accumulation mode number burden and aerosol optical thickness, respectively.

Urban development is known to increase fluvial flood frequency, hence design measures are routinely implemented to minimize the impact. Studies suggest that historical effects, while potentially large at small scale, are not significant for large river basins. Storm water flooding within the urban environment is an area where flood hazard is inadequately defined; new methods are needed to assess and manage flood risk. Development on flood plains has led to major capital expenditure on flood protection, but government is attempting to strengthen the planning role of the environmental regulator to prevent this. Rural land use management has intensified significantly over the past 30 years, leading to concerns that flood risk has increased, at least at local scale; the implications for catchment-scale flooding are unclear. New research is addressing this issue, and more broadly, the role of land management in reducing flood risk. Climate change impacts on flooding and current guidelines for UK practice are reviewed. Large uncertainties remain, not least for the occurrence of extreme precipitation, but precautionary guidance is in place. Finally, current levels of flood protection are discussed. Reassessment of flood hazard has led to targets for increased flood protection, but despite important developments to communicate flood risk to the public, much remains to be done to increase public awareness of flood hazard. © 2006 The Royal Society.","Climate change; Flood protection; Floods; Land use change; Rainfall",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748092695

Emissions from light-duty vehicles were measured in a San Francisco area highwaytunnel during summers 1991, 1994-1997, 1999, 2001, and 2004. Benzene emission rates decreased over this time period, with a large (54 ± 5%) decrease observed between 1995 and 1996 when California phase 2 reformulated gasoline (RFG) was introduced. We attribute this one-year change in benzene mainly to RFG effects: 36% from lower aromatics in gasoline that led to a lower benzene mass fraction in vehicle emissions, 14% due to RFG effects on total nonmethane organic compound mass emissions, and the remaining 4% due to fleet turnover. Fleet turnover effects accumulate over longer time periods: between 1995 and 2004, fleet turnover led to a 32% reduction in the benzene emission rate.

The largest decrease in annual average ambient benzene concentrations (1.5 ± 0.7 μg m -3 or 42 ± 19%) was observed between 1995 and 1996. The reduction in ambient benzene between spring/summer months of 1995 and 1996 due to phase 2 RFG was larger (60 ± 20%). Effects of fuel changes on benzene during fall/winter months are difficult to quantify because some wintertime fuel changes had already occurred prior to 1995. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Ambient concentrations; Emission rates; Motor vehicle; Air quality; Benzene; Concentration (process); Gasoline; Industrial emissions; Air pollution; benzene; gasoline; organic compound; ozone; toxic substance; Air pollution; Air quality; Benzene; Concentration (process); Gasoline; Industrial emissions; ambient air; benzene; concentration (composition); organic pollutant; petroleum hydrocarbon; traffic emission; air pollution control; air quality; air sampling; ambient air; article; atmosphere; contamination; exhaust gas; fractionation; microenvironment; motor vehicle; quantitative analysis; vapor pressure; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Benzene; Carbon Monoxide; Carcinogens, Environmental; Environment; Environmental Monitoring; Gasoline; San Francisco; Seasons; Transportation; Vehicle Emissions; California; North America; San Francisco Bay; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747477909

The Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA) is a multidisciplinary, multinational research program led by Brazil. The goal of LBA is to understand how the Amazon Basin functions as a regional entity in the earth system and how these functions are changing as a result of ongoing human activity. This compilation of nine papers focuses on a central LBA question in the area of nutrient dynamics and surface water chemistry - how do changes in land use alter fluxes of dissolved and particulate materials from uplands across riparian zones and down the channels of river corridors? These papers cover work conducted in small watersheds on a wide range of topics within the spirit and geographical focus area of LBA: water balance and runoff generation, nutrient transformations in riparian zones and stream channels, carbon fluxes in water moving from land to water and the influence of soils on flowpath structure and stream chemistry. Important new insights can be gained from these and other studies. Forest clearing for pastures results in a decrease in soil hydraulic conductivity that forces water into surficial flowpaths throughout most of the rainy season across wide regions of the Amazon. Riparian zones along small forest streams appear to be very effective in removing nitrate arriving from the uplands, while forest streams take up nitrate at very low rates, allowing them to travel downstream for long distances. Although substantial, the contribution of dissolved organic C (DOC) to the carbon flux from forests to streams appears to be lower than the flux of dissolved inorganic C that is subsequently outgassed as CO2. Remaining key challenges within LBA will be to synthesize existing data sets on river networks, soils, climate, land use and planned infrastructure for the Amazon to develop models capable of predicting hydrologic and biogeochemical fluxes at a variety of scales relevant to the development of strategies for sustainable management of the Amazon's remarkable forest, soil and freshwater resources.

This reaction is of interest as a potential component of a carbon energy cycle (i.e. CO2 + energy → methane → CO2 + energy). The synthesis of hydrocarbons from CO2 is a complex multistep reaction with adsorbed intermediates, most notably adsorbed CO. The exact reaction mechanisms leading to the various products are not clear from the literature data to date and likely change over the range of conditions at which data has been reported. The reaction product distribution is also very sensitive the surface crystal structure copper electrode.

The growing need for oil independence and CO2 mitigation has lead to the increasing importance of alternative fuel usage. CO2 is produced not only as the fuel is used in the vehicle (tank-to-wheel contribution), but also upstream, from the fuel extraction to the refueling station (well-to-tank contribution), and the life cycle of the fuel production (well-to-wheel contribution) must be considered in order to analyse the global impact of the fuel utilization. A road vehicle tank-to-wheel analysis tool that may be integrated with well-to-tank models was developed in the present study.

While U(VI) in the form of the uranyl cation is readily reduced by a range of natural reductants, by contrast complexation of uranyl by carbonate greatly reduces its reduction potential and imposes increased electron transfer (ET) distances. Very little is known about the elementary processes involved in uranium reduction from U(VI) to U(V) to U(IV) in general. In this study, we examine the theoretical kinetics of ET from ferrous iron to triscarbonato uranyl in aqueous solution. A combination of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) electronic structure calculations is employed to compute the parameters that enter into Marcus' ET model, including the thermodynamic driving forces, reorganization energies, and electronic coupling matrix elements. MD simulations predict that two ferrous iron atoms will bind in an inner-sphere fashion to the three-membered carbonate ring of triscarbonato uranyl, forming the charge-neutral ternary Fe 2UO 2(CO 3) 3(H 2O) 8 complex. Through a sequential proton-coupled electron-transfer mechanism (PCET), the first ET step converting U(VI) to U(V) is predicted by DFT to occur with an electronic barrier that corresponds to a rate on the order of ∼1 s -1. The second ET step converting U(V) to U(IV) is predicted to be significantly endergonic. Therefore, U(V) is a stabilized end product in this ET system, in agreement with experiment. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Electron transfer (ET); Electronic coupling; Proton-coupled electron-transfer mechanism (PCET); Triscarbonato uranyl reduction; Complexation; Computer simulation; Electron transitions; Iron compounds; Molecular dynamics; Oxidation; Parameter estimation; Positive ions; Reduction; Uranium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748249317

One of these corresponded to loss of the DB[a,l]P moiety from the original adducted strand to give an 11-mer with an unmodified central dG. The other two products resulted from a highly unexpected migration of the hydrocarbon moiety to either dG5 or dG7 of the complementary strand, 5′-GGTAG5CG7ATGG-3′. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the two 11-mer migration products followed by CD spectroscopy of the isolated adducted nucleosides indicated that, in both cases, the hydrocarbon moiety had undergone configurational inversion at C14 to give the eis 14S DB[a,l]P dG adduct. MS/MS and partial enzymatic hydrolysis showed that the major 11-mer had the hydrocarbon at dG7. Two 11-mer oligonucleotides were synthesized with a single cis 14S DB[a,l]P dG adduct either at G7 or at G 5 and were found to be chromatographically identical to the major and minor migration products, respectively. Although HPLC evidence suggested that a small extent of hydrocarbon migration from the trans 14S DB[a,l]P dG diastereomer also occurred, the very small amount of presumed migration products from this isomer precluded their detailed characterization.

Similar total amounts of metals (about 1.6 atomMet·nm-2) were deposited onto the support, in different proportions, to obtain samples with weight percent of copper varying from 3.3 to 6.5% The SA support was first covered by the copper precursor, Cu(C2H3O2)2, and then gallium (Ga(NO3)3·H2O) or tin (SnCl 4·5H2O) precursors were deposited on the dried Cu-containing sample. The calcined materials were characterized by surface techniques (N2 adsorption and XPS), to detect the surface morphology and chemical state of metal species, and by FT-IR and adsorption calorimetry after CO adsorption. Nanosized metal phases were observed in every case. Besides Cu(II), the surfaces contained Cu(I) as well as Cu(δ+) ions (with 1 &lt; δ &lt; 2) stabilized by the interaction with the acid centers of the support. Gallium oxide preferentially covered the copper oxide phase, while tin dioxide mainly deposited on the bare surface of the support. The reducibility properties of the different supported metal oxides were investigated by TPR from both the qualitative and quantitative points of view.

When the two interconversions occur in sequence, a full, closed process is accomplished, restoring the initial state of the system along two different steps. In a chiral imine-type compound, for example, with an asymmetric center next to the C=N function, photoinduced rotation may be expected to occur in one sense in preference to the opposite one. Thus, photo-isomerization followed by thermal isomerization in a chiral imine compound generates unidirectional molecular motion. Generally, imine-type compounds represent unidirectional molecular photomotors converting light energy into mechanical motion. As they are also able to undergo exchange of the carbonyl and amine partners, they present constitutional dynamics.

In this article we report our finding that Escherichia coli can ferment glycerol in a pH-dependent manner. We hypothesize that glycerol fermentation is linked to the availability of CO2, which under acidic conditions is produced by the oxidation of formate by the enzyme formate hydrogen lyase (FHL). In agreement with this hypothesis, glycerol fermentation was severely impaired by blocking the activity of FHL. We demonstrated that, unlike CO2, hydrogen (the other product of FHL-mediated formate oxidation) had a negative impact on cell growth and glycerol fermentation. In addition, supplementation of the medium with CO 2 partially restored the ability of an FHL-deficient strain to ferment glycerol. High pH resulted in low CO2 generation (low activity of FHL) and availability (most CO2 is converted to bicarbonate), and consequently very inefficient fermentation of glycerol. Most of the fermented glycerol was recovered in the reduced compounds ethanol and succinate (93% of the product mixture), which reflects the highly reduced state of glycerol and confirms the fermentative nature of this process. Since glycerol is a cheap, abundant, and highly reduced carbon source, our findings should enable the development of an E. coli-based platform for the anaerobic production of reduced chemicals from glycerol at yields higher than those obtained from common sugars, such as glucose. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Bacteria; Escherichia coli; Glycerol fermentation; Metabolic engineering","Diesel fuels; Escherichia coli; Fermentation; Genetic engineering; Glucose; Metabolism; Oxidation; Glycerol fermentation; Metabolic engineering; Glycerol; acetic acid; alcohol; carbon dioxide; formic acid; glycerol; hydrogen; lactic acid; lyase; succinic acid; acidity; anaerobic fermentation; article; catalysis; cell growth; Escherichia coli; metabolic engineering; nonhuman; oxidation; pH; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Carbon Dioxide; Cell Culture Techniques; Escherichia coli; Feasibility Studies; Fermentation; Genetic Enhancement; Glycerol; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Lyases; Recombinant Proteins; Escherichia coli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746868000

The derivation is based on the direct means of solution of the commutation equation for the one-electron density matrix by means of passing to the basis of noncanonical molecular orbitals of parent AHs followed by application of the noncommutative Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation theory and retransformation of the results into the initial basis of 2pz AOs of carbon atoms. The second-order corrections obtained are shown to determine alterations in bond orders between chemically bound pairs of atoms under influence of the most popular types of perturbation, viz. changes in the Coulomb parameter(s) and emergence of new intermolecular resonance parameter(s). The same corrections are also demonstrated to play an important role in the formation of stabilization energies of PAHs vs. those of parent AHs. On this basis, an additional insight is given into the content of the classical formulae for total energies of PAHs in terms of self-polarizabilities of atoms and bonds, viz. an energy correction is shown to be made up of a difference between the primary stabilizing contribution of perturbation (which is twice as large as the final stabilization energy) and the destabilizing increment related to weakening of remaining chemical bonds. A detailed comparison of CBO matrices and stabilization energies is made for compounds originating from the same parent hydrocarbon (R) after perturbation of the Coulomb parameter of a certain AO Xr and after building up a composite AH R-R' by formation of a new bond between AOs Xr and X'r of two identical AHs R and R' (e.g., pyridine and biphenyl). The first-order corrections to CBO matrices of these systems are shown to be expressible in terms of the same submatrices, whereas the respective second-order corrections contain coinciding submatrices referring to parent fragments R and R'. As a result, coincidences are established (i) between the self-polarizability of the rth atom of the parent AH R and that of the bond between atoms r and r' of the composite AH R-R', (ii) between alterations in orders of chemical bonds due to both types of perturbation, and (iii) between stabilization energies referring to a single fragment R or R' under an assumption of coinciding perturbation parameters. On this basis, a nontrivial and intriguing similarity is concluded between respective electronic structures in general. Finally, two particular second-order effects are revealed for the same systems, viz. a destabilizing effect related mostly to a local weakening of bonds at the site of perturbation and an energy-free effect manifesting itself as emergence of changes in all bond orders of alternating nature. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Alternant conjugated hydrocarbons; Biphenyl; Charge-bond order matrix; Pyridine; Stabilization energy","Carrier concentration; Chemical bonds; Electronic structure; Mathematical models; Molecular dynamics; Nitrogen compounds; Perturbation techniques; Polarization; Alternant conjugated hydrocarbons; Charge-bond order matrix; Energy-free effects; Stabilization energy; Hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744468789

The light emission of the lowest-order cavity mode at 1.06 μm is enhanced by more than a factor of ten, as compared with nonresonant excitation, when the excitation wavelength is resonant with higher order cavity modes. This result can be attributed to an enhancement in the effective absorption coefficient due to a local enhancement of the excitation light, which couples with the cavity mode. The on-resonant excitation technique selectively and efficiently excites only the QDs in the cavity. On-resonant excitation at energies below the wetting layer band gap energy can achieve stronger light emission from the cavity mode than excitation at energies greater than the wetting layer band gap energy with much less undesirable background emission. It will be shown that this is primarily due to the enhancement in the effective absorption by the cavity resonant effect and the direct carrier generation in QDs. © 2006 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.","Cavity quality factor; Nanocavity; Photoluminescence excitation; Photonic crystal; Quantum dot; Resonant excitation; Selective excitation","Cavity resonators; Crystal structure; Energy gap; Photoluminescence; Photons; Semiconducting indium gallium arsenide; Cavity quality factor; Nanocavity; Photoluminescence excitation; Photonic crystals; Resonant excitation; Selective excitation; Semiconductor quantum dots",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748536436

The emission properties of these complexes and their corresponding platinum(II) 4′-aryl-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridyl chloride complexes (1-4) at room temperature and 77 K have been systematically investigated. Except for the 4′-pyrenyl-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridyl phenylacetylide complex that emits from an admixing state consisting of metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (3MLCT), intraligand charge-transfer ( 3ILCT), and 3π,π* characters, emissions of 4′-naphthyl, 4′-phenanthryl, and 4′-anthryl-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridyl phenylacetylide complexes all originate from a 3MLCT-dominant state. The emission lifetime of the 4′-pyrenyl-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridyl phenylacetylide complex (8) is longer than 2 μs at room temperature, and more than 300 μs at 77 K, while the other three complexes possess an emission lifetime of 200-400 ns at room temperature and tens of microseconds at 77 K. Replacing the chloride ligand in the 4′-naphthyl, 4′-phenanthryl, and 4′-anthryl-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridyl chloride complexes by a phenylacetylide ligand significantly increases the emission efficiency by an order of magnitude, and the emission lifetimes become longer. In contrast, such an alternation has no pronounced effect on the emission efficiency and lifetime of the 4′-pyrenyl-2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridyl complexes. In the transient difference absorption (TA) spectra of 5 and 6, a moderately intense absorption band from 470 to 830 nm and a bleaching band between 400 and 470 nm were observed. For 7, the TA spectrum features a narrow, weak bleaching band at ∼380 nm and a strong, narrow band at ∼420 nm, as well as a broad, structureless band from 470 to 750 nm. In addition, a fourth, positive band appears above 800 nm. Complex 8 exhibits a strong, narrow bleaching band at ∼340 nm and a broad, positive band extending from 370 to 830 nm, with the band maximum appearing at ∼520 nm. The lifetimes obtained from the kinetic transient absorption measurement coincide with those from the kinetic emission measurement, indicating that the transient absorption originates from the same excited state that emits or, alternatively, from a state that is in equilibrium with the emitting state. All complexes exhibit optical limiting for 4.1 ns laser pulses at 532 nm, with 8 giving rise to the strongest optical limiting, presumably because of the much longer triplet excited-state lifetime and the stronger transient absorption at 532 nm. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption; Charge transfer; Complexation; Laser pulses; Molecular structure; Optical properties; Photochemical reactions; Bleaching bands; Chloride complexes; Platinum compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748317920

Our understanding of the factors that control carbon turnover in water-limited ecosystems is limited, however, as studies of litter decomposition have shown contradictory results and only a modest correlation with precipitation. Here we evaluate the influence of solar radiation, soil biotic activity and soil resource availability on litter decomposition in the semi-arid Patagonian steppe using the results of manipulative experiments carried out under ambient conditions of rainfall and temperature. We show that intercepted solar radiation was the only factor that had a significant effect on the decomposition of organic matter, with attenuation of ultraviolet-B and total radiation causing a 33 and 60 per cent reduction in decomposition, respectively. We conclude that photodegradation is a dominant control on above-ground litter decomposition in this semi-arid ecosystem. Losses through photochemical mineralization may represent a short-circuit in the carbon cycle, with a substantial fraction of carbon fixed in plant biomass being lost directly to the atmosphere without cycling through soil organic matter pools. Furthermore, future changes in radiation interception due to decreased cloudiness, increased stratospheric ozone depletion, or reduced vegetative cover may have a more significant effect on the carbon balance in these water-limited ecosystems than changes in temperature or precipitation. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group.",,"Attenuation; Biomass; Decomposition; Ecosystems; Ozone; Photodegradation; Rain; Soils; Solar radiation; Water; Ozone depletion; Photochemical mineralization; Plant litter decomposition; Precipitation; Semi-arid ecosystem; Soil biotic activity; Plants (botany); carbon; organic matter; ozone; rain; carbon balance; carbon cycle; decomposition; leaf litter; mineralization; organic matter; ozone depletion; photodegradation; primary production; semiarid region; soil biota; terrestrial ecosystem; ultraviolet B radiation; article; atmosphere; ecosystem; litter decomposition; mineralization; photochemistry; photodegradation; plant litter; precipitation; priority journal; soil; solar radiation; temperature; ultraviolet B radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746676911

Recognizing the potential for climate change impacts on watershed hydrology is an important part of these long-range planning efforts. Engaging watershed planning groups in discussion on the issue can be challenging, however, given the disconnect in spatial scales for global climate change and watershed planning, financial constraints, time constraints, and in some cases politicization of the climate change issue. One approach to engaging decision makers is providing a low cost, coarse scale but geographically relevant analysis of watershed sensitivity to climate impacts. This paper proposes such a tool for potential application to Washington State watersheds and presents results of the tool's preliminary application to a hypothetical Pacific Northwest watershed. Although detailed hydrology studies are preferred, the ability to provide a coarse scale assessment of hydrologie sensitivity at little to no cost creates opportunities within a watershed planning effort to consider sources of vulnerability and options for building adaptive capacity. While much work remains on the concept, the tool shows promise for being able to quickly and effectively reach smaller scale watersheds lacking the financial and technical resources for detailed climate impacts studies.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149118340

The Danube River basin is the most international watershed in Europe. It drains significant territories of 13 countries, and links European Union (EU) member states with accession countries and non-EU nations. The Danube River Protection Convention provides the framework for coordinated river management and defines the riparians' common objectives. The European Commission's Water Framework Directive gives additional policy direction for integrating management activities in the river basin. The development of a negotiated strategy to reduce the nitrogen loads from the Danube states to the Black Sea tests the effectiveness of this institutional structure. This case also exemplifies how the potential for negative consequences can drive international negotiations even given high uncertainty. The nitrogen emissions have rendered the Black Sea vulnerable to eutrophication and loss of biodiversity. In cooperation with the International Commission for the Protection of the Black Sea, the Danube states have agreed to reduce their nitrogen loads to 1960s levels. The strategy they develop will have to identify the sources from which emissions reductions will come from (point or non-point), which states reduce how much, and how to maintain reductions given anticipated agricultural growth.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149087703

These detections are commonly obtained by observing highJ CO transitions due to their relatively high peak fluxes and observing frequencies in the millimeter atmospheric windows. However, only observations of the CO ground-state transition, CO(10), have the potential to trace the molecular gas at lower excitations, which may give a better estimate of the total molecular gas mass of highz QSOs. Here we present first z>4 CO(10) observations obtained with the NRAO Green Bank Telescope and the MPIfR Effelsberg telescope (Riechers et al. 2006). With these two 100m telescopes, we detect the CO(10) transition in the highredshift QSOs BR 1202-0725 (z = 4.7), PSS J2322+1944 (z = 4.1), and APM 08279+5255 (z = 3.9). We find that the CO/FIR luminosity ratios of these high-z sources follow the same trend as seen for low-z galaxies. Utilizing large velocity gradient (LVG) models based on previous results for higherJ CO transitions, we derive that all CO emission can be described by a single gas component and that all molecular gas appears to be concentrated in a compact nuclear region. We thus find no evidence for luminous, extended CO(10) components in the molecular gas reservoirs around our target quasars. © 2007 International Astronomical Union.","Cosmology: observations; Galaxies: active; Galaxies: formation; Galaxies: high-redshift; Galaxies: ISM; Galaxies: starburst",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36949007633

We have measured ionized gas (H and [Oiii]) and stellar (near-IR Ca triplet) velocity dispersions for five individual Circumnuclear Star Forming Regions (CNSFRs) and the nucleus. Velocities and velocity dispersions in the red range were obtained using the cross-correlation technique of Tonry &amp; Davis (1979AJ.84.1511) with a set of eleven templates, following the work by Nelson &amp; Whittle (1995.ApJSS.99.67) with the variations introduced by Palacios et al. (1997.A &amp; A.323.749). The gas velocities and velocity dispersions have been measured by fitting gaussians to the emission lines (H and [OIII] 5007) using three different suitable continua chosen by visual inspection and taking the average of the three results (Jimnez-Benito et al., 2000.MNRAS.317.907). The rotation velocities derived for gas and stars are in very good agreement, although in some cases the gas seems to rotate slightly faster than stars. The turnover points of the rotational curves seem to be located at the same position than the star forming ring as found in other galaxies (Daz, R. et al., 1999ApJ.512.623). The derived values are consistent with those previously obtained for the systemic velocity of NGC 3351 (Planesas et al., 1997.A &amp; A.325.81). The velocity dispersions of the stars are always larger (by between 10 and 25 km/sec) than those derived from H emission lines. In the cases in which it has been possible to use the Paschen emission lines, the results obtained are similar. The twice ionized oxygen, on the other hand, shows velocity dispersions comparable to the stellar ones or, in some cases, even larger. It is however important to point out that in these metal rich regions the [Oiii] lines are very weak and they have a poor signal to noise ratio, then it is more difficult to accurately estimate the global kinematic behaviour from this emission line. The difference between the behavior of ionized hydrogen and stars could be interpreted by assuming that the gas is confined to the disc and supported by rotation while the stars are mostly supported by dynamical pressure (see Pizzella et al., 2004.A &amp; A.424.447). However, the kinematics of ionized gas as mapped by [Oiii], as we mentioned above, is similar to that of the stellar component. We have applied the virial theorem to estimate the dynamical masses of the clusters and the galactic nucleus, assuming that the systems are gravitationally bound and spherically symmetric, and using sizes measured from the HST-WFPC2 image in the F606W filter (sizes between 2.6 and 5.1 pc). These values of the masses, estimated from stellar velocity dispersion measurements as mapped by the CaT lines, are in the range between 5.1106 and 5.0107 M for the five studied CNSFRs and 3.6107 M for the nucleus of the galaxy, in the inner 23.4 pc. © 2007 International Astronomical Union.","Galaxies: individual (NGC 3351); Galaxies: kinematics and dynamics; Galaxies: star clusters",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36949005653

Chemistry-transport model simulations using the new GFEDv2 biomass-burning emission database show a similar temporal and spatial CO distribution, indicating that the observed enhancements are mainly due to biomass burning (BB). Large differences between the year 2003 and 2004 are observed in both the measurements and the model for South America and Australia. This study analyzes the origin of these observed enhancements in the Southern Hemisphere. The fact that SCIAMACHY is sensitive to surface CO allows for the observation of enhanced CO columns in both emission areas and in areas that are affected by long-range transport of CO. Model results show a large contribution of South American BB CO over Australian BB regions during the 2004 BB season of up to ∼30-35% and up to 55% further south, with smaller contributions for 2003. BB CO transported from southern Africa contributes up to ∼40% in 2003 and ∼30% in 2004.

Like other black carbons, the planar structure of the residual carbon in fly ash results in elevated affinities for planar organic contaminants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and some poly chlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The present study was performed to understand better the mechanisms affecting the strong interaction between planar contaminants and coal fly ash. The removal of 10 PCBs and 10 PAHs by several fly ashes and other sorbents was evaluated under different experimental conditions to highlight the intermolecular forces influencing adsorption. Varying fly ash concentration and solvent system composition indicated that dispersive interactions were most prevalent. For the PCBs, empirical results also were compared to molecular modeling estimates of the energy necessary for the PCB molecule to assume a planar conformation (PCe). The PCe levels ranged from 8 to 25 kcal/mol, depending on the degree of ortho-substituted chlorination of the PCB. A significant correlation between PCe. and PCB removal from solution was observed for the fly ashes and activated carbon, whereas the nonplanar sorbent octadecyl (C18) indicated no relationship. These findings demonstrate the strong interaction between black carbon fly ash and planar organic contaminants. Furthermore, as exemplified by the PCBs, these results show how this interaction is a function of a contaminant's ability to assume a planar conformation. © 2006 SETAC.","Activated carbon; Black carbon; Molecular modeling; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","Activated carbon; Carbon black; Coal ash; Concentration (process); Impurities; Molecular structure; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Solvents; Wastewater treatment; Black carbon; Molecular modeling; Organic contaminants; Fly ash; polychlorinated biphenyl; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; solvent; sorbent; adsorption; anthropogenic source; coal; fly ash; organic pollutant; PAH; PCB; solvent; waste treatment; wastewater; article; chlorination; conformation; fly ash; geochemical analysis; molecular model; nuclear magnetic resonance; planar chromatography; priority journal; solid state; water pollutant; water pollution; Carbon; Coal; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Models, Molecular; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751035244

Method: Using a pre-post, randomized blocks, true experimental design, 10 urban and 16 rural case management teams were randomly assigned to either the ARC organizational intervention condition or to a control condition. The culture and climate of each case management team were assessed at baseline and again after the one-year organizational intervention was completed. In addition, caseworker turnover was assessed by identifying caseworkers on the sampled teams who quit their jobs during the year. Results: Hierarchical Linear Models (HLM) analyses indicate that the ARC organizational intervention reduced the probability of caseworker turnover by two-thirds and improved organizational climate by reducing role conflict, role overload, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization in both urban and rural case management teams. Conclusions: Organizational intervention strategies can be used to reduce staff turnover and improve organizational climates in urban and rural child welfare and juvenile justice systems. This is important because child welfare and juvenile justice systems in the U.S.A. are plagued by high turnover rates, and there is evidence that high staff turnover and poor organizational climates negatively affect service quality and outcomes in these systems. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We were particularly interested in broad-scale vegetation- environment relationships and how well do the patterns conform to climate-vegetation schemes. Material and Methods: We sampled vegetation in 1132 plots from 16 sites from different parts of the Eurasian tundra. Clustering and ordination techniques were used for analysing compositional patterns. Vegetation-environment relationships were analysed by fitting of environmental vectors and smooth surfaces onto non-metric multidimensional scaling scattergrams. Results: Dominant vegetation differentiation was associated with a complex set of environmental variables. A general trend differentiated cold and continental areas from relatively warm and weakly continental areas, and several soil chemical and physical variables were associated with this broad-scaled differentiation. Especially soil chemical variables related to soil acidity (pH, Ca) showed linear relationships with the dominant vegetation gradient. This was closely related to increasing cryoperturbation, decreasing precipitation and cooler conditions. Remarkable differences among relatively adjacent sites suggest that local factors such as geological properties and lemming grazing may strongly drive vegetation differentiation. Conclusions: Vegetation differentiation in tundra areas conforms to a major ecocline underlain by a complex set of environmental gradients, where precipitation, thermal conditions and soil chemical and physical processes are coupled. However, local factors such as bedrock conditions and lemming grazing may cause marked deviations from the general climate-vegetation models. Overall, soil chemical factors (pH, Ca) turned out to have linear relationship with the broad-scale differentiation of arctic vegetation. © IAVS; Opulus Press.","Climate; Complex gradient; Ecocline; Eurasian Arctic; Grazing; Multivariate analysis; Ordination; Soil nutrients; Soil pH","environmental change; geological structure; grazing; latitude; multivariate analysis; soil chemistry; soil property; tundra; vegetation; Eurasia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749569220

Based on previous researches, this article established the cotton climate suitability model and the risk index to analyze the cotton climate risk degree in Henan Province. The result shows that, in the last 40 years, the cotton climate risk degree has a gradual increasing trend in which the precipitation plays a very important role, and the climate suitability and its deviation have different performances in the influence on the risk change in different phases; the increase rate of risk degree has significant regional and transitional characteristics, for example, from the eastern plain to the western mountains, the risk change rate becomes slower and slower, so the contrast between the central-southern Huang-Huai plain and the Funiu mountains is the most remarkable; and in the north-south direction, the contrast between the fast increase belt from the central-southern Huang-Huai plain to the middle Yellow River and the slow increase belt near the Yellow River is particularly remarkable, which is possibly the results of topographic and climatic transitional belt; and the risk change process also has obvious regional difference. For instance, abrupt change is an important characteristic in eastern Henan where this sudden change type has notable latitudinal difference, while in the western mountainous area it is very rare. Although the temperature change over the 40 years is still increasing in this area, the trend has reduced gradually since the end of the 1980s. © 2006 Science in China Press.","Climate change; Climate risk degree; Cotton; Henan Province",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748989819

This process has been engineered with Weiße Elster River sediment (dredged near Leipzig, Germany), as an example. Here, six heavy metal polluted sediments originating from various bodies of water in Germany were subjected to bioleaching to evaluate the applicability of the developed process on sediment of different nature: each sediment was mixed with 2% S0, suspended in water and then leached under identical conditions. The buffer characteristics of each sediment were mainly governed by its carbonate and Ca content, i.e., by its geological background, the redox potential and oxidation state depended on its pre-treatment (e.g., on land disposal), while the pH value was influenced by both. The added S0 was quickly oxidized by the indigenous microbes even in slightly alkaline sediment. The microbially generated H2SO4 accumulated in the aqueous phase and was in part precipitated as gypsum. Significant acidification and heavy metal solubilization only occurred with sediment poor in buffer substances. With the exception of one sediment, the behavior in bioleaching correlated well with the behavior in titration with H2SO4. Since the content in carbonate seemed to be the most important factor deciding on the leachability of a sediment, oxic Weiße Elster River sediment was mixed with 2% S0 and 0 to 100 g/kg of ground limestone to simulate various buffer capacities, suspended in water and then leached. The lime did not inhibit microbial S0 oxidation but generated a delay in acidification due to neutralization of formed H2SO4, where the pH only started to decrease when the lime was completely consumed. The more lime the sediment contained, the longer this lag period lasted, and the higher the pH and the lower the fraction of the solubilized heavy metals finally was. Since Cu requires stronger acidic conditions for its solubilization, it responded more sensitively to lime addition than Zn, Ni, and Cd. Heavy metal polluted sediment containing large amounts of carbonate may, in principle, also be remediated by bioleaching, but metal solubilization requires excessive amounts of the leaching agent and is thus uneconomical. © 2006 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

Global climatic stabilization cannot succeed without the participation of people and organizations in the PRC and the USA. Given the likelihood of continued political paralysis at the national level in both countries, it is important to assess the strengths, weaknesses, and potential of nongovernmental actors in bringing about durable reductions in GHG emissions. Consumption trajectories present one of the most intractable barriers to anthropogenic GHG-emissions reductions and to long-term climatic stabilization. Nordlund and Garvill's (2003) model is adapted and applied in assessing prospects for value change, specific problem awareness, and sustainable-consumption behavior in the PRC and USA. The contributions of nonstate actors are elucidated when issue bundling (specifically links with stress reduction and healthy futures) and principle bundling are incorporated into the explanatory framework. The involvement of transnationally competent activists in emissions-mitigation projects, value change, and durable sustainable-consumption practices provides a beacon for future possibilities.

Large efforts have been made to control phosphorus, but the measures to reduce nitrogen emissions failed at least partly. While it was possible to reduce nitrogen emissions from industry and municipal wastewater treatment plants, diffuse sources are showing only very minor decline. Examples of limnetic, marine and coastal systems are given to review the current knowledge about nitrogen transformation and the effects of nitrate in the environment. When N is the limiting nutrient in a particular water body, this does not necessarily mean that phytoplankton is controllable by NO3- removal. In systems with problems due to a high redox-sensitive internal phosphorus load and under certain constraints, nitrate may be used as an ecotechnological measure to prevent anaerobic phosphorus releas from sediments. Model simulations are used to demonstrate this. A schematic model of redox-mediated temporal phosphorus storage in riverine lake sediments with short retention time is proposed. We conclude that while anthropogenic nitrogen emissions are a global problem, no fast and simple single solution exists. Additional nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment will have no effect, as long as diffuse sources and nitrate concentrations in groundwater remain at a high level. Emission reductions should be achieved in an integrated way, taking direct and indirect effects into account.

Box 541, 33101 Tampere, Finland","Background, Aims, and Scope. Phytoremediation is remediation method which uses plants to remove, contain or detoxify environmental contaminants. Phytoremediation has successfully been applied for the removal of fresh hydrocarbon contamination, but removal of aged hydrocarbons has proven more difficult. Biodegradation of hydrocarbons in the subsurface can be enhanced by the presence of plant roots, i.e. the rhizosphere effect. Phytostabilization reduces heavy metal availability via immobilization in the rhizosphere. Soils contaminated by both hydrocarbons and heavy metals are abundant and may be difficult to treat. Heavy metal toxicity can inhibit the activity of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms and decrease the metabolic diversity of soil bacteria. In this experiment, weathered hydrocarbon- and heavy metal-contaminated soil was treated using phytoremediation in a 39-month field study in attempts to achieve both hydrocarbon removal and heavy metal stabilization. Methods. A combination of hydrocarbon degradation and heavy metal stabilization was evaluated in a field-scale phytoremediation study of weathered contaminants. Soil had been contaminated over several years with hydrocarbons (11,400±4,300 mg kg dry soil)-1 and heavy metals from bus maintenance activities and was geologically characterized as till. Concentrations of soil copper, lead and zinc were 170±50 mgkg-1, 1,100±l,500 mg kg-1 and 390± 340 mg kg-1, respectively. The effect of contaminants, plant species and soil amendment (NPK fertilizer or biowaste compost) on metabolic activity of soil microbiota was determined. Phytostabilization performance was investigated by analyses of metal concentrations in plants, soil and site leachate as well as acute toxicity to Vibrio fischeri and Enchtraeus albidus. Results. Over 39 months hydrocarbon concentrations did not decrease significantly (P=0.05) in non-amended soil, although 30% of initial hydrocarbon concentrations were removed by the last four months of study. In soil amended with NPK fertilizer and municipal biowaste compost, 65% and 60% of hydrocarbons were removed, respectively. The soil contained metabolically diverse bacteria, measured as carbon source utilization and extracellular enzymatic activities. Compost addition resulted in a slight increase in enzymatic activities. Diesel fuel utilization potential in Biolog MT2 plates inoculated with a soil suspension was enhanced by both compost and NPK compared to non-amended soil. Soil toxicity to V. fischeri and E. albidus was low. The leachate was not toxic to V. fischeri. Pine (Pinus sylvestris), poplar (Populus deltoides x Wettsteinii), grasses and clover (Trifolium repens) survived to varying degrees in the contaminated soil. All plants suffered from phytotoxicity symptoms and some trees died during the study period. Plants formed a dense cover over the compost-amended soil, whereas non-amended soil had areas devoid of vegetation throughout the study. Vegetation coverage in the NPK-amended quarter was about 50% after the first four months of study, but increased gradually to 100%. Heavy metals did not accumulate in plant tissue. Discussion. Removal of hydrocarbons from weathered unfertilized hydrocarbon-contaminated soil was not statistically significant despite the presence of a viable hydrocarbon-degrading microbial community. This effect is attributed to soil heterogeneity and low bioavailability of hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbon concentrations were not reduced to the desired level, i.e., 1,500 mg hydrocarbons (kg of dry soil)-1, in any treatment. The presence of clay minerals and organic matter within the compost may have limited heavy metal transfer to leachate and plant tissue. Conclusions. Weathered hydrocarbons were partly decomposed in soil fertilized with NPK fertilizer or biowaste compost, but not from unfertilized soil. The active hydrocarbon-degrading microbiota and low toxicity of soil to V. fischeri and E. albidus indicates low availability of contaminants to microorganisms. Despite high heavy metal concentrations, the soil contained metabolically diverse bacteria, measured as carbon source utilization and extracellular enzymatic activities. Heavy metals did not accumulate in test plants. Pine and poplar suffered from phytotoxicity symptoms in the soil and could not enhance hydrocarbon removal in compost-amended soil, Compost addition combined with a grass and legume crop is suggested for stabilization of combined hydrocarbon- and metal-contaminated soil. Recommendations and Perspectives. Both compost and NPK fertilizers can be used to enhance phytoremediation of soil contaminated with weathered hydrocarbons in the presence of heavy metals; however, compost addition is recommended since it enables greater vegetative coverage. This in turn may decrease heavy metal mobility. Phytoremediation can be used for remediation of soil contaminated with weathered hydrocarbons in the presence of heavy metals. However, phytoremediation of weathered contaminants requires extended periods of time; thus, other remediation methods should be considered in the event of soil contamination posing an immediate public health and/or environmental threat. © 2006 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).","Heavy metals; Metal uptake; Phytoremediation; Phytotreatment; Soil metabolic activity; Soil toxicity; Weathered hydrocarbons","biodegradation; heavy metal; hydrocarbon; phytoremediation; soil pollution; toxicity; Bacteria (microorganisms); Pinus sylvestris; Poaceae; Populus deltoides; Trifolium; Trifolium repens; Vibrio fischeri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748097662

In the present study, we have investigated the molecular mechanism by which sulindac affects the activity and expression of the enzymes that mediate the initial detoxification steps of many environmental carcinogens, the cytochromes P450 1A1, 1A2 and 1B1. Sulindac treatment of Sprague-Dawley rats resulted in a dose-dependent increase in hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity and in the expression of hepatic CYPs 1A1 and 1B1 mRNA. In the HepG2 human liver cancer cell line, sulindac caused a sustained, dose-dependent increase in CYP enzyme activity. Sulindac treatment resulted in a profound, dose-dependent increase in CYP 1A1 mRNA and a modest increase in 1A2 mRNA. The increase in CYP 1A1 mRNA induced by sulindac was, like enzyme activity, sustained for several days after the initial treatment. Sulindac induced the transcription of the CYP1A1 gene, as measured by the level of heterogeneous nuclear 1A1 RNA and by actinomycin D chase experiment. Since the transcription of CYP1A1 is under the control of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), we examined the ability of sulindac to activate the receptor. Sulindac bound to the AhR, as measured by ligand-binding assay, and induced the binding of the AhR with the xenobiotic-responsive element present in the promoter region of the CYP1A1 gene. These results are the first demonstration that NSAIDs modulate carcinogen metabolic enzymes and provide a novel mechanism to explain the established chemopreventive activity of sulindac. © 2006 Oxford University Press.",,"aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; carcinogen; cytochrome P450 1A1; cytochrome P450 1A2; cytochrome P450 1B1; dactinomycin; heterogeneous nuclear RNA; messenger RNA; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; sulindac; xenobiotic agent; animal experiment; article; binding assay; cancer cell culture; cell strain HepG2; chemoprophylaxis; concentration response; controlled study; detoxification; dose response; drug activity; drug mechanism; drug receptor binding; enzyme activity; enzyme regulation; gene expression; genetic transcription; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; ligand binding; liver cancer; male; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; rat; rat strain; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Breast Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; Dactinomycin; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Humans; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Protein Synthesis Inhibitors; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; RNA, Messenger; Sulindac; Transcription, Genetic; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Xenobiotics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747874518

To model the phenomenon, it is assumed that the atmosphere consists of five nonlinearly interacting phases i.e. the raindrops phase, the primary pollutants phase, the secondary pollutants phase and absorbed phases of these pollutants in the raindrops. The dynamics of these phases is assumed to be governed by nonlinear differential equations with source, interaction, recycle and removal terms. The model is analyzed using stability theory of differential equations. It is shown that these pollutants can be washed out from the atmosphere completely by rain in the case of instantaneous emission of primary pollutants. However, when the primary pollutant is emitted at a constant rate, it is found that both the primary and secondary pollutants can still be washed out from the atmosphere under some appropriate conditions and the remaining equilibrium amount would depend upon the rate of emission of primary pollutants, rate of formation of secondary pollutants, rate of raindrops formation and different removal parameters. The equilibrium levels of these pollutants are much smaller after rain than its corresponding value before rain. A numerical study of the model is also performed to investigate the influence of certain key parameters on the dynamics of model system. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

The eastern, central and western areas have the lowest, medium and highest 1996–2002 average target abatement ratios of SO2 (22.09%, 42.23% and 57.58%), soot (26.19%, 56.34% and 66.37%) and dust (15.20%, 29.09% and 40.59%), respectively. 3. These results are consistent with the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory, whereby a more developed area will use environmental goods more efficiently than a less developed area. 4. Compared to dust emission, the average target abatement ratios for SO2 and soot emissions (as direct outcomes of burning coal) are relatively much higher for all three areas. © 2006 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Air pollution abatement; China; Data envelopment analysis; Dust; Soot; Sulfur dioxide (so2); Sustainable development","atmospheric pollution; Gross Domestic Product; Kuznets curve; pollutant; pollution control; sulfur emission; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747469513

Here, we examine the involvement of a predicted G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), GPR-4, during growth and development in the presence of different carbon sources in N. crassa. Δgpr-4 mutants have reduced mass accumulation compared to the wild type when cultured on high levels of glycerol, mannitol, or arabinose. The defect is most severe on glycerol and is cell density dependent. The genetic and physical relationship between GPR-4 and the three N. crassa Gα subunits (GNA-1, GNA-2, and GNA-3) was explored. All three Gα mutants are defective in mass accumulation when cultured on glycerol. However, the phenotypes of Δgna-1 and Δgpr-4 Δgna-1 mutants are identical, introduction of a constitutively activated gna-1 allele suppresses the defects of the Δgpr-4 mutation, and the carboxy terminus of GPR-4 interacts most strongly with GNA-1 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Although steady-state cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels are normal in Δgpr-4 strains, exogenous cAMP partially remediates the dry mass defects of Δgpr-4 mutants on glycerol medium and Δgpr-4 strains lack the transient increase in cAMP levels observed in the wild type after addition of glucose to glycerol-grown liquid cultures. Our results support the hypothesis that GPR-4 is coupled to GNA-1 in a cAMP signaling pathway that regulates the response to carbon source in N. crassa. GPR-4-related GPCRs are present in the genomes of several filamentous ascomycete fungal pathogens, raising the possibility that a similar pathway regulates carbon sensing in these organisms.

In order to examine change in environmental parameters during deposition of Tortonian limestone of southern central Crete, we use integrated field and biofacies analysis together with a detailed study of foraminfera and non-geniculate red algae. Patterns in the relative abundance of non-geniculate coralline red algae are interpreted by comparison with data from modern non-geniculate coralline red algae and with additional information from the studied sediments. Based on these integrated datasets, four red algal associations are identified: a Lithophyllum- dominated association restricted to the upper photic zone in warm-temperate environments, a Lithothamnion- dominated association found in the lower photic zone in warm-temperate environments, a Spongites- dominated association typical for shallow warm-temperate to tropical environments and an association with dominant Mesophyllum which is characteristic for the lower photic zone in warm-temperate to tropical environments. We introduce coralline red algal indices in order to quantify changes in environmental parameters. We recognise four warm intervals within a succession of the Tortonian limestones in southern central Crete. During the most extensive interval, widespread coral carpets formed under prevalent oligotrophic conditions. Analysis of the stratigraphic architecture shows that warm intervals are related to sea-level highstands and therefore may reflect global climatic processes. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Coral carpets; Crete; Eastern Mediterranean; Neogene climate; Red algae; Sequence stratigraphy; Tortonian","abundance; biofacies; climate change; climate effect; coastal sediment; coralline alga; facies analysis; fossil assemblage; Miocene; Neogene; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; sequence stratigraphy; Crete; Eurasia; Europe; Greece; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Southern Europe; algae; Anthozoa; Lithophyllum; Lithothamnion; Mesophyllum; Rhodophyta; Spongites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746915992

However, this type of regulation offers no reward for conducting pollution prevention and technological research to reduce emissions below compliance levels through process innovation. Alternatively, market-based regulations stimulate continued improvement of cleaner manufacturing practices by creating economic incentives for sustained waste reduction. The aim of this work is to furnish regulators and manufacturers with a concise tool for quantifying the impact of future regulatory scenarios. The proposed methodology employs realistic mathematical models of pollution abatement operations used in chemical, pharmaceutical, and specialty chemical manufacturing. It assesses the feasibility of treatment options, estimates their cost and expected emissions. Rigorous optimization techniques are introduced for managing regional emission reduction efforts at reasonable cost to manufacturers. The comprehensive mathematical programming formulations will enable plant managers to ascertain expected compliance cost, and regulators to design environmental regulations for reducing regional emissions at tolerable cost to industry. © 2006 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.","Design of environmental regulations; Emission trading; Multiperiod optimization; Pollution prevention; Sustainable manufacturing","Design of environmental regulations; Emission trading; Multiperiod optimization; Pollution prevention; Sustainable manufacturing; Costs; Drug products; Mathematical models; Optimization; Public policy; Regulatory compliance; Industrial emissions; Costs; Drug products; Industrial emissions; Mathematical models; Optimization; Public policy; Regulatory compliance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746912386

After deriving the full accretion disc solutions explicitly in terms of the parameters of the model, we study their radiative properties both with a simple two-zone model, treatable analytically, and with radiative transfer simulations which account simultaneously for energy balance and Comptonization in the hot phase, together with reflection, reprocessing, ionization and thermal balance in the cold phase. We show that, if not only the density, but also the heating rate within these flows is inhomogeneous, then complex reflection-dominated spectra can be obtained for a high enough covering fraction of the cold phase. In general, large reflection components in the observed X-ray spectra should be associated with strong soft excesses, resulting from the combined emission of ionized atomic emission lines. The variability properties of such systems are such that, even when contributing to a large fraction of the hard X-ray spectrum, the reflection component is less variable than the power-law-like emission originating from the hot Comptonizing phase, in agreement with what is observed in many Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies and bright Seyfert 1. Our model falls within the family of those trying to explain the complex X-ray spectra of bright AGN with ionized reflection, but presents an alternative, specific, physically motivated, geometrical set-up for the complex multiphase structure of the inner regions of near-Eddington accretion flows. © 2006 RAS.","Accretion, accretion discs; Black hole physics",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746829939

The 10- to 12-fold multilateral increase in resolution below the diffraction barrier has been enabled by the elimination of molecular triplet state excitation as a major source of photobleaching of a number of dyes in stimulated emission depletion microscopy. Allowing for relaxation of the triplet state between subsequent excitation-depletion cycles yields an up to 30-fold increase in total fluorescence signal as compared with reported stimulated emission depletion illumination schemes. Moreover, it enables the reduction of the effective focal spot area by up to ≈140-fold below that given by diffraction. Triplet-state relaxation can be realized either by reducing the repetition rate of pulsed lasers or by increasing the scanning speed such that the build-up of the triplet state is effectively prevented. This resolution in immunofluorescence imaging is evidenced by revealing nanoscale protein patterns on endosomes, the punctuated structures of intermediate filaments in neurons, and nuclear protein speckles in mammalian cells with conventional optics.

In a recent review of the model performed for the Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) programme of the European Commission, a more systematic and structured uncertainty analysis has been recommended. This paper aims at contributing to the scientific debate how this can be achieved. Because of its complex structure on the one hand and limited research resources (time, computational capacities) on the other hand a full-blown uncertainty analysis in RAINS is hardly feasible. Therefore, all types of uncertainty require more efficient ways for uncertainty analysis. With respect to parameter uncertainty, we propose to focus research efforts for uncertainty analysis on key parameters. Among different approaches to select key parameters that have been discussed in the literature screening methods seem to be particularly appropriate for complex, deterministic Integrated Assessment models such as RAINS.

Pusa Kesar) plants using open top chambers (OTCs) ventilated with ambient (NFCs) or charcoal filtered air (FCs) at a suburban site of Varanasi, India. Various morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics of the plants were studied at different growth stages. Air monitoring data clearly showed high concentrations of SO2, NO2 and O3 in the ambient air of study site. SO2 and NO2 concentrations were higher during early growth stages of carrot, whereas O3 concentration was highest during later growth stages. Filtration of air has caused significant reductions in all the three pollutant concentrations in FCs as compared to NFCs. Plants growing in FCs showed significantly higher photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency and variable fluorescence as compared to plants growing in NFCs. Protein content also showed a similar pattern, however, lipid peroxidation, ascorbic acid content and peroxidase activity were higher in plants growing in NFCs as compared to FCs. Shoot length, number of leaves per plant, leaf area and root and shoot weight increased significantly upon filtration of ambient air. Total nitrogen decreased significantly in root, but increased significantly in shoot of plants grown in NFCs. Total P, Mg, Ca and K contents decreased significantly in plants grown in NFCs as compared to FCs. The individual pollutant concentrations were below threshold for plant injury, but the combined effect of all the three seems to act synergistically in causing greater adverse impact on dry weight and physiology of carrot plants. The study clearly indicates that air pollutants are high enough in the ambient air to cause significant unfavorable impact on carrot plants. The work further supports the usefulness of OTCs for assessing air pollution damage under field conditions in developing countries. © Springer Science &amp; Business Media, Inc. 2005.","Ambient air; Carrot plants; Impact; Open top chambers; Suburban site","Carrot plants; Lipid peroxidation; Peroxidase activity; Suburban sites; Air pollution; Biochemistry; Environmental chambers; Environmental impact; Filtration; Lipids; Morphology; Photosynthesis; Physiology; Proteins; Plants (botany); ascorbic acid; calcium; magnesium; nitric oxide; oxygen; ozone; peroxidase; phosphorus; potassium; sulfur oxide; water; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; herb; open-top chamber; pollutant; suburban area; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution; ambient air; article; carrot; developing country; dry weight; environmental impact assessment; enzyme activity; fluorescence; growth curve; India; lipid peroxidation; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant growth; plant leaf; plant physiology; plant water use; protein content; shoot growth; stomatal conductance; urban area; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Biomass; Daucus carota; Environmental Monitoring; India; Lipid Peroxidation; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Photosynthesis; Plant Proteins; Reproducibility of Results; Sulfur Dioxide; Daucus carota; Pusa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746708062

It is often assumed that gaseous return of deposited N to the atmosphere as N2O through denitrification may provide an important sink for N. This assumption was tested for four moorland catchments (Allt a'Mharcaidh in the Cairngorms, Afon Gwy in mid-Wales, Scoat Tarn in the English Lake District and River Etherow in the southern Pennines), covering gradients of atmospheric N deposition and surface water NO3- leaching, through a combination of field and laboratory experiments. Field measurements of N2O fluxes from static chambers with and without additions of NH4NO3 solution were carried out every 4 weeks over 1 yr. Wetted soil cores from the same field plots were used in experimental laboratory incubations at 5 and 15 °C with and without additions of NH4NO3 solution, followed by measurement of N2O fluxes. Field measurements showed that significant N2O fluxes occurred in only a very small number of plots with most showing zero values for much of the year. The maximum fluxes were 0.24 kg-N/ha/yr from unamended plots at the River Etherow and 0.49 kg-N/ha/yr from plots with NH4NO3 additions at the Allt a'Mharcaidh. Laboratory incubation experiments demonstrated that large N2O fluxes could be induced by warming and NH4NO3 additions, with the top 5 cm of soil cores responsible for the largest fluxes, reaching 11.8 kg-N/ha/yr from a podsol at Scoat Tarn. Acetylene block experiments showed that while N2 was not likely to be a significant denitrification product in these soils, reduced N2O fluxes indicated that nitrification was an important source of N2O in many cases. A simple model of denitrification suggesting that 10-80% of net N inputs may be denitrified from non-agricultural soils was found to greatly over-estimate fluxes in the UK uplands. The proportion of deposition denitrified was found to be much closer to the IPCC suggested value of 1% with an upper limit of 10%. Interception of N deposition by vegetation may greatly reduce the net supply of N from this source, while soil acidification or other factors limiting carbon supply to soil microbes may prevent large denitrification fluxes even where NO3- supply is not limiting. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Box 27, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland","Northern peatlands represent about 30% of the global soil C pools. The C pool in peat is a result of a relatively small imbalance between production and decay. High water levels and the consequent anoxia are considered the major causes for the imbalance. As such, the C sink of a peatland is labile, and sensitive to disturbances in environmental conditions. Changes in peatland ecosystem functions may be mediated through land-use change, and/or climatic warming. In both cases, lowering of the water level may be the key factor. Logically, lowered water levels with the consequent increase in oxygen availability in the surface soil may be assumed to result in accelerated rates of organic matter decomposition. Yet, earlier research has given highly contrasting results concerning the effects of lowered water levels on the rates of decomposition and the C sink/source behaviour of peatlands. The mechanisms controlling this variation remain unresolved. This paper summarizes the changes observed in the biotic and abiotic controls of decomposition following natural or artificial lowering of peatland water levels and show that they are complex and their interactions have not been previously explored. Long-term changes in the C cycle may differ from short-term changes. Short-term changes represent a disturbance in the ecosystem adapted to the pre-water-level-lowering conditions, while long-term changes result from several adaptive mechanisms of the ecosystem to the new hydrological regime. While in a short term, the disturbed system will always lose C, the long-term changes inherently vary among peatland types, climates, and extents of change in the water level. The paper closes by identifying the gaps in our knowledge that need to be addressed when proceeding towards a causal and unifying explanation for the C sink/source behaviour of peatlands following persistent lowering of the water level. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Simultaneous measurements of SO2 and NOy were used to identify plumes from coal fired power plants (CFPPs). Emission signatures and back trajectories were used to identity specific CFPPs, and to compare observed (i.e., at the site) versus expected (i.e., at the stack) Hg speciation. Results for 41 precipitation-free plume events show that observed RGM:SO2 is substantially lower (by a factor of 2-4) than expected RGM:SO2. HgP represented 2%, or less, of total-Hg in CFPP plumes, in general agreement with emission estimates. Results for 21 events, where both RGM and Hg0 could be estimated, show that total-Hg (i.e., RGM + Hg 0) was essentially conserved from the point of emission to the site, and that Hg0 was the dominant form (average 84%). Emission estimates, based on coal analyses and the EPRI-ICR Hg speciation model, indicate that Hg0 should represent about 42% of Hg in the observed plumes. Possible explanations for these differences include, but are not limited to, in-plume reduction of RGM to Hg0, measurement error, errors in emission estimates, and depositional losses. Further work is needed to confirm these results and to determine if they apply to CFPPs in general, or the limited set of observed CFPPs. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Coal analyses; Coal-fired power plants; Emission signatures; Measurement error; Coal; Industrial emissions; Mercury (metal); Power plants; Precipitation (meteorology); Air pollution; coal; mercury; sulfur dioxide; Air pollution; Coal; Industrial emissions; Mercury (metal); Power plants; Precipitation (meteorology); atmospheric plume; coal-fired power plant; comparative study; mercury (element); nitrous oxide; particulate matter; speciation (chemistry); sulfur dioxide; air analysis; air pollution; article; electric power plant; exhaust gas; particulate matter; plume; precipitation; United States; Air Pollutants; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Mercury; Organomercury Compounds; Particulate Matter; Power Plants; Southeastern United States; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746607292

Conversion of forest residues and agricultural residues to charcoal, district heat and home heating are the most common forms of bioenergy. Biomass electric generation feedstocks are predominantly forest residues (including black liquor), bagasse, and other agricultural residues. Biofuel feedstocks include sugar from sugarcane (in Brazil), starch from maize grain (in the US), and oil seeds (soy or rapeseed) for biodiesel (in the US, EU, and Brazil). Of the six large land areas of the world reviewed (China, EU, US, Brazil, Canada, Australia), total biomass energy consumptions amounts to 17.1 EJ. Short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) established in Brazil, New Zealand, and Australia over the past 25 years equal about 50,000 km2. SRWC plantings in China may be in the range of 70,000-100,000 km2. SRWC and other energy crops established in the US and EU amount to less than 1000 km2. With some exceptions (most notably in Sweden and Brazil), the SRWC have been established for purposes other than as dedicated bioenergy feedstocks, however, portions of the crops are (or are planned to be) used for bioenergy production. New renewable energy incentives, greenhouse gas emission targets, synergism with industrial waste management projects, and oil prices exceeding 60 $ Bbl-1 (in 2005) are major drivers for SRWC or energy crop based bioenergy projects. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Using the deep Spitzer Legacy images and new data and reductions of the Very Large knay-Hubble Deep Field (VLA-HDF) radio data, we find statistically secure counterparts for 60 per cent (21/35) of our submillimetre (submm) sample, and identify tentative counterparts for another 12 objects. This is the largest sample of submm galaxies with statistically secure counterparts detected in the radio and with Spitzer. Half of the secure counterparts have spectroscopic redshifts, while the other half have photometric redshifts. We find that in most cases the 850- μm emission is dominated by a single 24-μm source, with a median flux density of 241 μJy, leading to a median 24-to-850-μm flux density ratio of 0.040. A composite rest-frame SED shows that the submm sources peak at longer wavelengths than those of local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). Using a basic grey-body model, 850-μm selected galaxies appear to be cooler than local ULIRGs of the same luminosity. This demonstrates the strong selection effects, both locally and at high redshift, which may lead to an incomplete census of the ULIRG population. The SEDs of submm galaxies are also different from those of their high-redshift neighbours, the near-IR selected BzK galaxies, whose mid-IR-to-radio SEDs are more like those of local ULIRGs. Using 24-μm, 850-μam and 1.4-GHz observations, we fit templates that span the mid-IR through radio to derive the integrated IR luminosity (LIR) of the submm galaxies and find a median value of L IR(8-1000 μm) = 6.0 × 10 12 LȮ. By themselves, 24-μm and radio fluxes are able to predict L IR reasonably well because they are relatively insensitive to temperature. However, the submm flux by itself consistently overpredicts L IR when using spectral templates which obey the local ULIRG temperature-luminosity relation. The shorter Spitzer wavelengths sample the stellar bump at the redshifts of the submm sources, and we find that the Spitzer photometry alone provides a model-independent estimate of the redshift, σ[Δz/(1 + z)] = 0.07. The median redshift for our secure submm counterparts is 2.0. Using X-ray and mid-IR data, only 5 per cent of our secure counterparts (1/21) show strong evidence for an active galactic nucleus dominating the LIR. © 2006 RAS.","Galaxies: evolution; Galaxies: formation; Galaxies: starburst; Infrared: galaxies; Submillimetre",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746561252

Methods: The current study explores the mortality of a cohort of 1535 male German blue-collar workers employed at a carbon black manufacturing plant for at least one year between 1960 and 1998. Vital status and causes of death were assessed for the period 1976-98. Occupational histories and information on smoking were abstracted from company records. Standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and Poisson regression models were calculated. Results: The SMRs for all cause mortality (observed deaths (obs) 332, SMR 120, 95% CI 108 to 134), and mortality from lung cancer (obs 50, SMR 218, 95% CI 161 to 287) were increased using national rates as reference. Comparisons to regional rates from the federal state gave SMRs of 120 (95% CI 107 to 133) and 183 (95% CI 136 to 241), respectively. However, there was no apparent dose response relationship between lung cancer mortality and several indicators of occupational exposure, including years of employment and carbon black exposure. Conclusions: The mortality from lung cancer among German carbon black workers was increased. The high lung cancer SMR can not fully be explained by selection, smoking, or other occupational risk factors, but the results also provide little evidence for an effect of carbon black exposure.",,"carbon; adult; aged; anamnesis; article; cancer mortality; cancer risk; causal attribution; cohort analysis; controlled study; demography; female; follow up; Germany; human; industrial worker; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; medical record; occupational exposure; priority journal; regression analysis; smoking; vital sign; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carbon; Cause of Death; Female; Germany; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Exposure; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; Smoking",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746549107

Wits, 2050, South Africa","Wetlands provide the ecosystem services of enhancing water quality, attenuating floods, sequestrating carbon and supporting biodiversity. In southern Africa, the pattern and intensity of land use is influenced by whether land tenure is public (state), private (individual ownership), or communal (shared agricultural and grazing resources). The influence of land tenure and its associated use on service provision was compared for communal tenure (grazing, maize production), wildlife conservation, and commercial agriculture (grazing, planted pastures) in the southern Drakensberg. Ordination analyses revealed that oxbow marshes, hill slope seepages and hygrophilous grasslands, the main hydro-geomorphic units, supported distinct plant communities that differed in their response to land use because of wetness or slope. Oxbows, uncultivated because of wetness, were inherently species poor with few exotics. Composition of hill slope seepages, uncultivated because of saturated slopes, varied among tenure types most likely in relation to grazing pressure. Seepages were threatened by the exotic invasive Rubus cuneifolius. Eighty-five percent of hygrophilous grassland had been cultivated by 1953, most of which was subsequently abandoned to secondary grassland. Primary hygrophilous grassland and hill slope seepages were the main repository for indigenous plant diversity, while communal maize fields supported a diverse mixture of mainly exotic species. Soil carbon concentrations decreased from oxbows to pastures, seepages, primary hygrophilous grassland, secondary grassland, and maize on former grassland (7.0, 4.1, 4.0, 3.5, 2.4, and 1.7%, respectively). The pattern for total soil nitrogen and sulphur were the same. Cultivation of hygrophilous grassland was estimated to have reduced soil carbon stocks to 69% of pre-settlement levels by 1953 (∼150 years BP). Stocks then increased by 8% to 2001 following crop abandonment. Cultivation has impaired water quality enhancement and flood attenuation because of greater amounts of bare ground and shorter vegetation. Further improvement of ecosystem services will depend on the influence of socio-economic factors on communal cropping. © Springer 2006.","Carbon; Communal; Cultivation; DCA; Invasives; Oxbows; Plant diversity; South Africa","community composition; grazing pressure; land use; ordination; plant community; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; soil property; vegetation; wetland; Africa; Drakensberg; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Rubus cuneifolius; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746454751

The efficacy of tradable permit schemes in addressing the root cause of environmental decline - economic growth - will not be achieved unless the schemes cap economic activity based on ecological thresholds. Lessons can be learned from the largest tradable permit scheme to date, emissions trading now being implemented with the Kyoto Protocol. The Kyoto Protocol caps neither greenhouse gas emissions at a level that will achieve climate stability nor economic growth. If patterned after the Kyoto Protocol, cap-and-trade schemes for conservation will not ameliorate biodiversity loss either because they will not address economic growth. In response to these failures to cap economic growth, professional organizations concerned about biodiversity conservation should release position statements on economic growth and ecological thresholds. The statements can then be used by policy makers to infuse these positions into the local, national, and international environmental science-policy process when these schemes are being developed. Infusing language into the science-policy process that calls for capping economic activity based on ecological thresholds represents sound conservation science. Most importantly, position statements have a greater potential to ameliorate biodiversity loss if they are created and released than if this information remains within professional organizations because there is the potential for these ideas to be enacted into law and policy. ©2006 Society for Conservation Biology.","Cap and trade; Emissions trading; Kyoto Protocol; Science-policy process","biodiversity; conservation management; economic growth; emissions trading; Kyoto Protocol; air pollution; biodiversity; economics; environmental protection; legal aspect; licensing; review; Air Pollution; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Economics; Licensure",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746379542

The retrieved anoxic sediments and pore fluids were analyzed for particulate organic carbon (POC), total nitrogen, total sulfur, dissolved sulfate, sulfide, methane, ammonium, iodide, bromide, calcium, and total alkalinity. A novel method was developed to derive sedimentation rates from a steady-state nitrogen mass balance. Rates of organic matter degradation, sulfate reduction, methane turnover, and carbonate precipitation were derived from the data applying a steady-state transport-reaction model. A good fit to the data set was obtained using the following new rate law for organic matter degradation in anoxic sediments:RPOC = frac(KC, C (DIC) + C (CH4) + KC) · kx · POCThe rate of particulate organic carbon degradation (RPOC) was found to depend on the POC concentration, an age-dependent kinetic constant (kx) and the concentration of dissolved metabolites. Rates are inhibited at high dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved methane (CH4) concentrations. The best fit to the data was obtained applying an inhibition constant KC of 35 ± 5 mM. The modeling further showed that bromide and iodide are preferentially released during organic matter degradation in anoxic sediments. Carbonate precipitation is driven by the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) and removes one third of the carbonate alkalinity generated via AOM. The new model of organic matter degradation was further tested and extended to simulate the accumulation of gas hydrates at Blake Ridge. A good fit to the available POC, total nitrogen, dissolved ammonium, bromide, iodide and sulfate data was obtained confirming that the new model can be used to simulate organic matter degradation and methane production over the entire hydrate stability zone (HSZ). The modeling revealed that most of the gas hydrates accumulating in Blake Ridge sediments are neither formed by organic matter degradation within the HSZ nor by dissolved methane transported to the surface by upward fluid flow but rather through the ascent of gas bubbles from deeper sediment layers. The model was further applied to predict rates of hydrate accumulation in Sakhalin slope sediments. It showed that only up to 0.3% of the pore space is occupied by gas hydrates formed via organic matter degradation within the HSZ. Gas bubble ascent may, however, significantly increase the total amount of hydrate in these deposits. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The relationship of these changes to mitochondrial function in mature gametes is unclear. The phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPX4; also termed PHGPx) represents a major disulfide bond-stabilized protein of the mitochondrial capsule, and it is readily released by disulfide-reducing agents. However, in addition to GPX4, we detected a second major protein of 26 kDa (MP26) that was eluted from purified hamster sperm tails by the disulfide-reducing agent dithiothreitol. The objectives of the present study were to identify and characterize MP26 and to explore its potential role in mitochondrial function. Proteomic analysis of MP26 by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) identified 14 peptides with sequence identity to a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily termed P26h, which was implicated previously in hamster sperm-zona binding, and with high sequence similarity to mouse lung carbonyl reductase. Indirect immunofluorescence localized MP26 to the midpiece, and two-dimensional PAGE and immunoblot analysis identified a single MP26 isoform of pl 9.0. Immunoblot analyses of cauda epididymal fluid and of purified sperm plasma membranes and mitochondria revealed the exclusive localization of MP26 to the mitochondrial fraction. These data indicate that MP26 does not function in zona binding; instead, like GPX4, it may be associated with the mitochondrial capsule and play an important role in sperm mitochondrial function. © 2006 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.","Epididymis; Gamete biology; Sperm; Spermatogenesis","oxidoreductase; phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase; animal cell; animal tissue; article; axoneme; cellular distribution; controlled study; enzyme isolation; enzyme localization; epididymis tail; hamster; male; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; mitochondrion; nonhuman; priority journal; seminal plasma; spermatozoon; Animals; Cricetinae; Dithiothreitol; Flagella; Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect; Isoenzymes; Male; Mesocricetus; Mitochondria; Oxidoreductases; Spermatozoa; Zona Pellucida; Cricetinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746318621

While numerous studies have investigated model performance at finer resolution (4-5 km), there is relatively limited information available for choosing the optimum grid resolution for predicting future air quality in attainment demonstration studies. We demonstrate an evaluation of the MM5-SMOKE-MAQSIP modeling system for four 8-h ozone episodes in the summers of 1995, 1996 and 1997 in North Carolina using a one-way nested 36/12/4-km application. After establishing acceptable base-case model performance for ozone predictions during each episode, we developed future-year emissions control scenarios for 2007 and 2012, and finally computed relative reduction factors (RRFs) using model outputs from each of the three grid resolutions. Our analyses, based upon qualitative as well as quantitative approaches like the Student's t-test, indicate that RRFs computed at specific monitoring locations-and hence predicted future-year air quality-are not very different between the 4- and 12-km results, while the differences are slightly larger between the 4- and 36-km results. The results imply that grid resolution contributes to a variability of about 1-3 ppb in the projected future-year design values; this variability needs to be incorporated into policy-relevant decision-making. Since this assessment was performed for four different episodes under diverse meteorological, physical and chemical regimes, one can generalize the results from this study. They are also relevant for regional modeling applications that are currently ongoing for studying PM2.5 nonattainment issues, where the need for annual base-year and future-year simulations for demonstrating attainment may place a large demand on computing resources. Based upon the results from this study, future studies may consider using results from 12-km modeling to address future-year air quality goals for ozone and PM2.5 and its components, and then incorporate grid-resolution uncertainties into the computed results. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Runs were made with either of two older mechanisms, Carbon Bond IV (CB4) and the Regional Acid Deposition Model, version 2 (RADM2), and with the more recent and complete California Statewide Air Pollution Research Center, version 1999 mechanism (SAPRC99) in a sensitivity matrix with a full emissions base case and separate 50% control scenarios for emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOX) and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Results from the base case were compared to observations at the Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization Study (SEARCH) site at Jefferson Street in Atlanta, GA (JST) and the Southern Oxidant Study (SOS) Cornelia Fort Airpark (CFA) site downwind of Nashville, TN. In the base case, SAPRC99 predicted more ozone (O3) than CB4 or RADM2 almost every hour and especially for afternoon maxima at both JST and CFA. Performance of the 8 km models at JST was better than that of the 32 km ones for all chemistries, reducing the 1 h peak bias by as much as 30 percentage points; at CFA only the RADM2 8 km model improved. The 2 km solutions did not show improved performance over the 8 km ones at either site, with normalized 1 h bias in the peak O3 ranging from 21% at CFA to 43% at JST. In the emissions control cases, SAPRC99 was generally more responsive than CB4 and RADM2 to NOX and VOC controls, excepting hours at JST with predicted increased O3 from NOX control. Differential sensitivity to chemical mechanism varied by more than ±10% for NOX control at JST and CFA, and in a similar range for VOC control at JST. VOC control at the more strongly NOX- limited urban CFA site produced a differential sensitivity response of &lt;5%. However, even when differential sensitivities in control cases were small, neither their sign nor their magnitude could be reliably determined from model performance in the full emissions case, meaning that the degree of O3 response to a change in chemical mechanism can differ substantially with the level of precursor emissions. Hence we conclude that properly understanding the effects of changes in a model's chemical mechanism always requires emissions control cases as part of model sensitivity analysis. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This study examined the distribution of DMSP in a diverse group of coral reef invertebrates. DMSP was present in all 22 species of cnidarians and ranged from 9 to 723 μmol g-1 of dry mass (DM) with a mean (± 1SD) of 110 ± 180 μmol g-1 DM. It was not detected in a flatworm and an ascidian or in two of five sponges. Concentrations in sponges ranged from undetectable to 16 μmol g-1 DM with a mean of 4 ± 7 μmol g-1 DM. Within the cnidarians, DMSP concentrations did not differ among orders. Among cnidarian species, DMSP concentrations were correlated with symbiotic zooxanthellae densities. Within cnidarian species, DMSP concentrations of individuals were positively correlated with zooxanthellae densities in three of the four species examined. We speculate that DMSP is dietarily derived in sponges and derived from zooxanthellae in the cnidarians.

Two such modeling systems are the community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model and the regional modeling system for aerosols and deposition (REMSAD). To facilitate their inter-comparison, the United States Environmental Protection Agency performed simulations of air quality over the contiguous United States during year 2001 (horizontal grid cell size of 36×36 km) with CMAQ and REMSAD driven by identical emission and meteorological fields. Here, we compare the abilities of CMAQ and REMSAD to reproduce measured aerosol nitrate and sulfate concentrations. Model estimates are compared to observations reported by the interagency monitoring of protected visual environment (IMPROVE) and the clean air status and trend network (CASTNet). Root mean squared errors are calculated for simulation/observation pairs from ten geographic regions and 12 seasons (months). Following the application of the Wilcoxon matched-pair signed rank test, we conclude that CMAQ is more skillful than REMSAD for simulation of aerosol sulfate.

In this study, temporal scale analysis is applied as a technique to evaluate an annual simulation of meteorology, O3, and PM2.5 and its chemical components over the continental US utilizing two modeling systems. The spectral decomposition of total PM2.5 mass from hourly observations and CMAQ and REMSAD model predictions revealed that days of high PM2.5 concentrations are generally characterized by positive forcing from fluctuations having periods equal to or greater than a day (i.e., the diurnal, synoptic, and longer-term components) while the magnitude of intra-day fluctuations showed only small differences between average and episodic conditions. Both modeling systems did not capture most of the variability of the high-frequency, intra-day component for all variables for which hourly measurements were available. Furthermore, it is illustrated that correlations were insignificant on the intra-day time scale for all variables, suggesting that these models in the setup used for this study were not skillful in simulating the higher-frequency variations in meteorological variables and the levels of all pollutants. The models exhibited greatest skills at capturing longer-term (seasonal) fluctuations for temperature, wind speed, O3, sulfate and nitrate. Correlations for total PM2.5, ammonium, elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC) and crustal PM2.5 correlations were highest for the synoptic time scale implying problems with factors other than meteorology, such as emissions or lateral chemical boundary conditions, in capturing the baseline fluctuations. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In the last two decades, it has gained increasing attention as a dominant mechanism of producing high-power radiation in natural high-temperature magnetized plasmas. Originally proposed as a somewhat exotic idea and subsequently applied to include non-relativistic plasmas, the electron-cyclotron maser was considered as an alternative to turbulent though coherent wave-wave interaction which results in radio emission. However, when it was recognized that weak relativistic corrections had to be taken into account in the radiation process, the importance of the electron-cyclotron maser rose to the recognition it deserves. Here we review the theory and application of the electron-cyclotron maser to the directly accessible plasmas in our immediate terrestrial and planetary environments. In situ access to the radiating plasmas has turned out to be crucial in identifying the conditions under which the electron-cyclotron maser mechanism is working. Under extreme astrophysical conditions, radiation from plasmas may provide a major energy loss; however, for generating the powerful radiation in which the electron-cyclotron maser mechanism is capable, the plasma must be in a state where release of susceptible amounts of energy in the form of radiation is favorable. Such conditions are realized when the plasma is unable to digest the available free energy that is imposed from outside and stored in its particle distribution. The lack of dissipative processes is a common property of collisionless plasmas. When, in addition, the plasma density becomes so low that the amount of free energy per particle is large, direct emission becomes favorable. This can be expressed as negative absorption of the plasma which, like in conventional masers, leads to coherent emission even though no quantum correlations are involved. The physical basis of this formal analogy between a quantum maser and the electron-cyclotron maser is that in the electron-cyclotron maser the free-space radiation modes can be amplified directly. Several models have been proposed for such a process. The most famous one is the so-called loss-cone maser. However, as argued in this review, the loss-cone maser is rather inefficient. Available in situ measurements indicate that the loss-cone maser plays only a minor role. Instead, the main source for any strong electron-cyclotron maser is found in the presence of a magnetic-field-aligned electric potential drop which has several effects: (1) it dilutes the local plasma to such an extent that the plasma enters the regime in which the electron-cyclotron maser becomes effective; (2) it generates energetic relativistic electron beams and field-aligned currents; (3) it deforms, together with the magnetic mirror force, the electron distribution function, thereby mimicking a high energy level sufficiently far above the Maxwellian ground state of an equilibrium plasma; (4) it favors emission in the free-space RX mode in a direction roughly perpendicular to the ambient magnetic field; (5) this emission is the most intense, since it implies the coherent resonant contribution of a maximum number of electrons in the distribution function to the radiation (i.e., to the generation of negative absorption); (6) it generates a large number of electron holes via the two-stream instability, and ion holes via the current-driven ion-acoustic instability which manifest themselves as subtle fine structures moving across the radiation spectrum and being typical for the electron-cyclotron maser emission process. These fine structures can thus be taken as the ultimate identifier of the electron-cyclotron maser. The auroral kilometric radiation of Earth is taken here as the paradigm for other manifestations of intense radio emissions such as the radiation from other planets in the solar system, from exoplanets, the Sun and other astrophysical objects.","Auroral kilometric radiation; Coherent radiation; Coherent radiation from Blazar jets; Coherent radiation from stars; Electron-cyclotron maser; Jupiter radio bursts; Non-thermal radiation; Radio emissions from magnetized planets; Solar radio bursts/spikes","Correlation methods; Cyclotrons; Electron beams; Masers; Plasmas; Quantum theory; Radiation; Auroral kilometric radiation; Coherent radiation; Coherent radiation from Blazar jets; Coherent radiation from stars; Electron-cyclotron maser; Jupiter radio bursts; Non-thermal radiation; Radio emissions from magnetized planets; Solar radio bursts/spikes; Astrophysics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746046744

Previous studies have shown an ""ammonia gap"" between modelled and observed changes, which might be due to low effectiveness of abatement measures, interactions with changing atmospheric chemistry, ammonia compensation points and inter-annual variability. This study therefore aimed to support policy development by assessing whether possible future reductions in ammonia emissions would achieve the desired outcome of reduced air concentrations. Two networks for monthly measurement of atmospheric NH3 were established, centred on Cumbria and Devon, these being two of the areas worst-affected by FMD. Measurements of CH4 were made in parallel to represent an inert tracer emitted by ruminants, for which near-source atmospheric concentration enhancements would be unaffected by atmospheric reactions. Measurements commenced immediately after the end of the FMD outbreak in February 2002, followed the period of restocking and ceased in January 2004. The spatio-temporal patterns of monthly NH3 and CH4 emissions and concentrations at 5 km resolution were modelled for the UK, providing a reference to interpret the measurements. Overall trends in monthly modelled and measured NH3 concentrations were not significant, these being masked by seasonal and inter-year variability. However, comparison of sampling locations in FMD-affected areas with those in areas not directly affected by FMD showed relative depletions in modelled NH3 in FMD-affected areas of ∼25% for Cumbria and ∼8% for Devon. These reductions were matched by measured depletions in NH3 in FMD-affected areas of ∼35% for Cumbria and ∼20% for Devon, relative to unaffected areas. The modelled recovery in NH3 emissions was slower than for CH4, due to the lag-time associated with NH3 emissions from manure storage and spreading. For CH4 concentrations, modelled reductions in affected areas relative to unaffected areas were 17% for Cumbria and 5% for Devon, but significant relative changes in the measured CH4 concentrations were not detectable. The results show that sites need to be more representative and/or sampling precision needs to be improved to detect such short-term CH4 signals. Conversely, this study has demonstrated that atmospheric NH3 concentrations responded to changes in regional emissions, but that such short-term changes are only detectable by a multi-site assessment of contrasting areas. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

As dormancy is present throughout the higher plants in all major climatic regions, adaptation has resulted in divergent responses to the environment. Through this adaptation, germination is timed to avoid unfavourable weather for subsequent plant establishment and reproductive growth. In this review, we present an integrated view of the evolution, molecular genetics, physiology, biochemistry, ecology and modelling of seed dormancy mechanisms and their control of germination. We argue that adaptation has taken place on a theme rather than via fundamentally different paths and identify similarities underlying the extensive diversity in the dormancy response to the environment that controls germination. © The Authors (2006).",,"phytohormone; adaptation; biochemistry; environmental conditions; genetics; germination; hormone; maturation; seed dormancy; angiosperm; biological model; drug effect; germination; phylogeny; physiology; plant seed; prenatal development; review; Angiosperms; Germination; Models, Biological; Phylogeny; Plant Growth Regulators; Seeds; Embryophyta",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745899623

The former is based on the dielectric formalism, and the latter combines Monte Carlo with the numerical solution of the motion equation for each projectile to describe its trajectory and interactions through the target. The capabilities of both methods are assessed by the reasonably good agreement between their predictions and the experimental results, for a wide range of projectile energies and target characteristics. Firstly, we apply the theoretical procedure to calculate the stopping cross sections for H+ and He+ beams in foils of different allotropic forms of carbon (such as diamond, graphite, amorphous carbon, glassy carbon and C60-fullerite), as a function of the projectile energy. We take into account the electronic structure of the projectile, as well as the different charge states it can acquire, the energy loss associated to the electronic capture and loss processes, the polarization of the projectile, and a realistic description of the target. On the other hand, the simulation code is used to evaluate the energy distributions of swift H+ and He+ ion beams when traversing several foils of the above mentioned allotropic forms of carbon, in order to analyze the influence of the chemical and physical state of the target in the projectile energy loss. These allotropic effects are found to become more important around the maximum of the stopping cross-section. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The δ13C values of air and plants depend on the amount of atmospheric fossil fuel CO2, which is chiefly emitted in urban areas. A new indicator of CO2 pollution is tested using the δ13C variation in a C4 grass: Eleusine indica. A range of about 4‰ delta units was observed at different sites in Cotonou, the largest city in the Republic of Benin. The highest δ13C values, from - 12‰ to - 14‰, were found in low traffic zones; low δ13C values, from - 14‰ to - 16‰, were found in high traffic zones. The amount of fossil fuel carbon assimilated by plants represented about 20% of the total plant carbon content. An overall decrease in plant δ13C values was observed over a four-year monitoring period. This decrease was correlated with increasing vehicle traffic. The δ13C dataset and the corresponding geographical database were used to map and define zones of high and low 13C-depleted CO2 emissions in urban and sub-urban areas. The spatial distribution follows dominant wind directions, with the lowest emission zones found in the southwest of Cotonou. High CO2 emissions occurred in the north, the east and the center, providing evidence of intense anthropogenic activity related to industry and transportation. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

With complementary thermodynamic approximations, these observations render an assessment of the local effective oxygen partial pressure, which is considerably lower than the external, ambient processing environment.

Multiwalled nanotubes (MWNTs) were formed by aerosol-assisted catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD). This method is based on the pyrolysis of liquid aerosols containing hydrocarbons as carbon source and metallic precursor (ferrocene) as catalyst. For this study, a special procedure consisting of sequential injections of hydrocarbon containing or not 13C isotope labels and ferrocene aerosol was developed in order to localize the carbon source corresponding to this sequence in the final carpet. The use of the nuclear reaction 13C(d,p)14C induced by a microbeam with fast beam scanning allowed us to correlate at the micrometric scale the height in the CNT carpet with the chronology of the growth. Deuteron and proton ion induced X-ray emission were also performed in order to localize the iron element that originates from ferrocene. Results demonstrate unambiguously that nanotubes grow through a base-growth mechanism, where any new injection sequence leads to the growth of nanotubes directly on the substrate surface and that iron content is increasing along the MWNT carpet, with higher concentrations at both ends. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Sequencing of Aspergillus nidulans and comparative analysis with A. fumigatus and A. oryzae. Nature 438 (7071), 1105-1115] was used to design a high-density oligo array with probes for 3278 selected genes using the Febit Geniom® One array system. For this purpose, the program OligoWiz II was used to design 24,125 probes to cover the 3278 selected genes. Subsequently, the Febit system was used to investigate carbon catabolite repression by comparing the gene expression of a creA deleted mutant strain with a reference strain grown either with glucose or ethanol as the sole carbon source. In order to identify co-regulated genes and genes influenced by either the carbon source or CreA, the most significantly regulated genes (p ≤ 0.01) were grouped in eight clusters based on their expression profile. Analysis of the clusters allowed identification of numerous genes that are presumably not regulated by CreA, or alternatively are either directly or indirectly regulated by CreA. Surprisingly, we found evidence that more than 25% of the genes (54 out of the 200 significantly regulated) that are repressed by glucose are not completely de-repressed during growth on ethanol, as deletion of the creA resulted in increased expression of the genes in question even during growth on ethanol. Thus, the expression profiles obtained in the eight clusters indicate that the carbon catabolite repression is not a simple on/off switch but a more complex system not only dependent on the presence or absence of CreA but also on the carbon source. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Since NOx contaminated gases usually also contain sulfurous pollutants, the possible interferences of these sulfur compounds with the BioDeNOx process need to be identified. Therefore, the effect of the sulfur compounds Na2SO4, Na2SO3, and H2S on the biological NO reduction in aqueous solutions of Fe(II)EDTA2- (25 mM, pH 7.2, 55 °C) was studied in batch experiments. Sulfate and sulfite were found to not affect the reduction rate of Fe(II)EDTA2- complexed NO under the conditions tested. Sulfide, either dosed externally or formed during the batch incubation out of endogenous sulfur sources or the supplied sulfate or sulfite, influences the production and consumption of the intermediate nitrous oxide (N2O) during Fe(II)EDTA2- bound NO reduction. At low concentrations (0.2 g VSS/l) of denitrifying sludge, 0.2 mM free sulfide completely inhibited the nitrosyl-complex reduction. At higher biomass concentrations (1.3-2.3 g VSS/l), sulfide (from 15 μM to 0.8 mM) induced an incomplete NO denitrification with N2O accumulation. The reduction rates of NO to N2O were enhanced by anaerobic sludge, presumably because it kept FeEDTA in the reduced state. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The U-tube sampling methodology was developed to collect large volume, multiphase samples at in situ pressures. As a permanent or semi-permanent installation, the U-tube can be used for rapidly acquiring multiple samples or it may be installed for long-term monitoring applications. The U-tube was first deployed in Liberty County, TX to monitor crosswell CO2 injection as part of the Frio CO2 sequestration experiment. Analysis of gases (dissolved or separate phase) was performed in the field using a quadrupole mass spectrometer, which served as the basis for determining the arrival of the CO2 plume. The presence of oxygen and argon in elevated concentrations, along with reduced methane concentration, indicates sample alteration caused by the introduction of surface fluids during borehole completion.

The main focus is on the demonstration of a fundamental difference in the generation of irreversibility during combustion between hydrogen and hydrocarbons. This difference relates to the mechanisms of entropy generation during the oxidation reaction of the two fuels and yields the particularly attractive characteristic of a monotonic decrease in combustion irreversibility with increasing hydrogen content of the fuel, for mole fractions of hydrogen smaller than 10%. This reduction in combustion irreversibility is reflected in an increase in second law efficiency with increasing proportions of hydrogen. The exhaust gas availability at the end of the closed part of the cycle was found to have a local maximum for a hydrogen mole fraction of the order of 5%. These trends with respect to hydrogen also apply when the fuel is diluted with a significant amount of CO2 (of the order of 40%, as for example in the case for landfill gas), although the absolute value of each of the terms of the availability balance is affected strongly by the dilution. © 2005 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Combustion engines; Hydrogen enrichment; Landfill gas; Natural gas; Second law analysis","Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Entropy; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen; Natural gas; Combustion engines; Hydrogen enrichment; Landfill gas; Second law analysis; Gas engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745238138

Projections show that these vehicles will emit more than 7% and 20% of total road transport CO and HC, respectively, by the year 2012, if no additional regulatory measures are taken. In contrast, they will continue to be negligible NOx (0.7%) and CO2 (&lt;1%) emitters, while their particulate matter (PM) emission contribution is expected to decline to below 1% in the future. The relative importance of their emissions, however, increases in urban environments, especially in southern European countries, which host large fleets of small two wheelers. Hence, further regulatory measures are being considered which include durability requirements for the emission controls, in-use compliance and roadworthiness procedures, on-board diagnostics, control of evaporation emissions, PM specific measures and new steps for emission standards. The study quantifies the environmental benefits and the costs associated with each measure, and calculates cost-effectiveness figures which may be used to evaluate each policy option. Results show that for the reduction of HC emissions, both evaporation control and roadworthiness tests are cost-effective while a further tightening of the emission standards for mopeds will bring the largest benefit. Additionally, on-board diagnosis for motorcycles is found to be an expensive measure with questionable effectiveness, while the replacement of mineral with synthetic lubricants would bring clear benefits with respect to PM of 2-stroke engines. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The GHGs covered are six Kyoto gases, namely carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). The local air pollutants are sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO) and total suspended particulates (TSP). These estimates incorporate some of the most recent scientific assessments for India. The multigas emissions have varied sectoral and fuel-based dominance, as well as regional distribution patterns. Coal consumption in power sector dominates CO2 and SO2 emissions, while power and road transport equally contribute to NOX emissions. Rice cultivation and livestock-related emissions from the agriculture sector dominate CH4 emissions, while synthetic fertilizer use in the same sector is the major source of N2O emissions. PFC emissions are dominated by C2F6 and CF4 emissions from aluminum production. The majority of HFC emissions are contributed by HFC-23, a by-product during the production of HCFC-22 that is widely used in refrigeration industry. CO emissions have dominance from biomass burning. Particulate emissions are dominated by biomass burning (residential sector), road transport and coal combustion in large plants. These varied emission patterns provide interesting policy links and disjoints, such as-which and where mitigation flexibility for the Kyoto gases, exploring co-benefits of CO2 and SO2 mitigation, and technology and development pathway dependence of emissions. The present inventory assessment is a pointer to the future emission pathways for India wherein local air pollutant and GHG emissions, although connected, may not move in synchronization and therefore would require alignment through well crafted development and environment strategies. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This unique mixture of two different life forms attracted scientific scrutiny for decades. Embedded in this body of research studies is bush encroachment that affects many overgrazed savannas. Despite scientific efforts, however, the underlying factors that shape the functioning of this biome and govern bush encroachment remain largely elusive. Terminalia sericea is one such encroaching woody plant at the expense of herbaceous layers in overgrazed areas of southern Africa. Recent studies indicated a potential link between rainfall amount and opportunistic rooting systems of encroaching species for harvesting near-surface soil water. This study was thus carried out to specifically test this theory in Etosha National Park across a rainfall gradient. A total of 31 T. sericea shrubs were excavated to examine their rooting systems. Results show that although all plants surveyed showed a shallow root system, only two out of 15 shrubs in the drier section of the park exhibited a taproot. In contrast, half of the 16 shrubs studied in the wetter part displayed a taproot. This suggests that T. sericea shrubs employ a rooting strategy attuned to local climatic conditions. A differential competition between woody plants and the herbaceous layers for soil water is thus variably enhanced, which might act as one of the feeding mechanisms for bush encroachment. Future ecological models of the savanna ecosystems should therefore recognise variation in the rooting characteristics of this, and possibly other bush encroaching plants, in response to precipitation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about the interactive effects of elevated [CO2] and nitrogen (N) supply on grain yield formation of rice (Oryza sativa L.), and no information is available on the combined effect of these factors on grain yield formation of rice cultivars with large panicles or under high N supply. Therefore we conducted a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment at Wuxi, Jiangsu, China, in 2001-2003. A japonica cultivar with large panicle (Wuxiangging 14) was grown at ambient or elevated (c. 200 μmol mol-1 above ambient) [CO2] under three levels of N: low (LN, 15 g N m2), medium (MN, 25 g N m2) and high N (HN, 35 g N m2 (2002, 2003)). The MN level was similar to that recommended to local farmers. FACE significantly increased the grain yield by 12.8% across the 3 years. Maximum grain yield was reached by MN-crops under both ambient and FACE treatments. FACE also substantially increased panicle number per square meter (+18.8%) due to the increase in maximum tiller number (+30.0%) being substantially more than the decreases in productive tiller ratio (-7.7%) with FACE: the former was related to significant increases with FACE in tillering occurrence speed from 10 to 30 days after transplanting (DAT), while for the latter the increases in tillering extinction speed after 45 DAT contributed to the decreases. FACE significantly reduced spikelet number per panicle (-7.6%), which was due mainly to the significant increase in degenerated spikelets per panicle (+51.7%) while differentiated spikelets per panicle showed no change. FACE caused a small but significant increase in filled spikelet percentage and grain weight, which may be due to the combined effects of increased proportion of spikelets on primary branches and source-sink ratio at heading under FACE conditions. The year effects were all significant for yield and its components; however, interactions between all treatment variables were hardly detected. For the cultivar and conditions of this experiment, the above results indicate that, in addition to supply proper total amount of N over the whole season, high-yielding cultivation under future elevated [CO2] conditions need to be focused on regulations after panicle initiation in order to increase the productive tiller ratio, enhance the spikelet formation and raise harvest index. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Of these, multiproject baseline methods have emerged that yield baseline emissions rates (or performance standards), which can be used for any number of projects in the corresponding sector and region. These methods frequently rely on deriving the performance standards from the outputs and associated emissions of recently completed facilities within an appropriate reference region. However, no standard or systematic method has been accepted for determining the appropriate spatial boundary and year of construction (or implementation) for facilities to be included in the reference set. This study examines the question of how GHG crediting programs may begin to methodically address these two parameters. We use examples from power sector and land-use change and forestry projects to illustrate our approach, but the analysis is applicable to a wide variety of GHG mitigation projects. We find that performance standards can generally be grouped into five spatial categories: global, national (or other administrative region), infrastructural, biophysical, and generic. As for temporal periods, multiyear averages produce more consistent performance standards that are often more representative of the mix of resources or technologies that can be used for a given activity than a standard based on only 1 year.","Climate change; GHG mitigation project; Multiproject baselines","Climate change; Electric industry; Electric power systems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Land use; Greenhouse gas mitigation project; Greenhouse gas performance standards; Multiproject baselines; Energy policy; climate change; greenhouse gas; performance assessment; standard (reference)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645049017

In general, this has been due to certain energy related characteristics often connected to their very nature as islands. These limitations attempt to prevent the appearance of problems that might affect the stability and safety of the electrical system. The restrictions imposed on the direct penetration of wind sourced energy in the conventional grids of the Canary Islands are an obstacle to meeting the renewable energy objectives set out by the European Union. As a partial solution to the problem, this paper proposes the installation on Gran Canaria island (Canarian Archipelago) of an appropriately administered wind powered pumped hydro storage system. The results obtained from the application of an optimum-sized economic model of such a system indicates that penetration of renewable sourced energy can be increased by 1.93% (52.55 GW h/year) at a competitive cost for the unit energy supplied. These results are obtained on the hypothesis that two of the largest existing reservoirs on the island (with a difference in height between the two of 281 m and a capacity of some 5,000,000 m3 used in each) are employed as storage deposits. Investment, operating and maintenance costs are taken into account, as well as those costs involving health and environmental damage associated with energy production and use (externalities). The system would consist of: a wind farm with a rated output of 20.40 MW; a modular pumping station with a rated output of 17.80 MW, operated so that the variation in the energy demand for pumping is in sympathy with the wind generation; and a hydraulic plant with a rated output of 60.00 MW. The proposed system would have no negative effect on either the reliability of the electrical system or consumer satisfaction. Furthermore, it would mean a fossil fuel saving of 13,655 metric tonnes/year and a reduction in CO2 emissions into the atmosphere of 43,064 metric tonnes/year. For regions that have topographically suitable sites and which suffer energy problems similar to those of the Canary Islands it is thus suggested that an analysis be made of the technical and economic feasibility of the installation of power systems such as that proposed in this paper. Within the general guiding framework of a policy promoting clean and renewable energy, these systems represent an enormous and as yet barely explored potential. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

They are thereby supposed to reduce mercury (Hg) emissions to the municipal waste water system to acceptable levels. We here present results from a comparative study in situ of three amalgam separators available on the market, all with a claimed efficiency of 99% according to Danish and ISO protocols, and using sedimentation as the principle of separation. We also present corresponding data for an investigational prototype of an improved separator. The obtained efficiency of the three commercial separators is far below what is stated by the manufacturer and by authorities assumed to be the efficiency in clinical conditions. They reduced Hg emissions by 79 - 91%, leaving an average Hg content in outgoing waste water of 1.5 mg L- 1. However, the prototype separator participating in this study retained 99.9% of the waste water Hg emissions, leaving an average Hg content in outgoing waste water of 0.004 mg L- 1. Physical restrictions prohibit sedimentary type separators to recover the Hg fractions causing the largest damages in wastewater treatment plants. This fraction is not considered in the ISO protocol for testing amalgam separators, which therefore needs to be revised. Abolishing the use of dental amalgam and cleaning the tubing systems is the most efficient long-term solution to reduce Hg emissions from dental clinics. Until then, Hg emissions originating from placing, polishing or removing existing amalgam fillings, should be counteracted by the use of low-emission amalgam separators, already on the market or presently being developed for use alone or together with sedimentary type amalgam separators. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Results: We examined soil samples taken from a biodiversity x CO2 grassland experiment where replicate plots harboring 5, 12, or 31 different plant species had been exposed to ambient or elevated (600 ppm) levels of carbon dioxide for 5 years. Analysis of soil bacterial communities in these plots by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) showed that dominant soil bacterial populations varied only very little between different experimental treatments. These populations seem to be ubiquitous. Likewise, screening of samples on a high-resolution level by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) showed that increased levels of carbon dioxide had no significant influence on both soil bacterial community composition (appearance and frequency of operational taxonomic units, OTUs) and on bacterial richness (total number of different OTUs). In contrast, differences in plant diversity levels had a significant effect on bacterial composition but no influence on bacterial richness. Regarding species level, several bacterial species were found only in specific plots and were related to elevated carbon dioxide or varying plant diversity levels. For example, analysis of T-RFLP showed that the occurrence of Salmonella typhimurium was significantly increased in plots exposed to elevated CO 2 (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusion: Plant diversity levels are affecting bacterial composition (bacterial types and their frequency of occurrence). Elevated carbon dioxide does not lead to quantitative alteration (bacterial richness), whereas plant diversity is responsible for qualitative changes (bacterial diversity). © 2006 Grüter et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"carbon dioxide; article; atmosphere; bacterial count; bacterial flora; biodiversity; chemical composition; environmental change; fungus; gel electrophoresis; metabolism; microbial diversity; microbial identification; microbial population dynamics; nonhuman; plant; restriction fragment length polymorphism; Salmonella typhimurium; soil analysis; Atmosphere; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Electrophoresis; Plant Development; Plants; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil Microbiology; Temperature; Bacteria (microorganisms); Otus; Salmonella typhimurium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747843979

In the central region of the Monte desert, four small mammal species (Eligmodontia typus, Calomys musculinus, Akodon molinae and Graomys griseoflavus) coexist and show different habitat uses in response to spatial variability. Three main habitat types are present in the region: mesquite forest, the creosotebush community and sand dunes. These habitat types are present also in the surrounding grazing area. The objective of this study was to determine habitat quality for these species in a protected area (Reserve MaB Ñacuñán) and in the adjacent grazed area. For each species we estimated demographic parameters that are highly correlated to fitness in each habitat, and for both treatments (protected and grazed). We found that the protected area offered a higher quality habitat than the grazed area for all species, but principally A. molinae and G. griseoflavus. At a local scale, we found that A. molinae and C. musculinus clearly showed higher fitness in the more complex habitats as the creosotebush community and the mesquite forest.

Although the ocean within each EEZ has a vast capacity to absorb anthropogenic CO2 and therefore potentially be used as a carbon sink, it is not mentioned within the Kyoto Protocol most likely due to inadequate quantitative estimates. Here, I use two methods to estimate the anthropogenic CO2 storage and uptake for a typically large EEZ (Australia). Results: Depending on whether the Antarctic territory is included I find that during the 1990s between 30-40% of Australia's fossil-fuel CO2 emissions were absorbed by its own EEZ. Conclusion: This example highlights the potential significance of the EEZ carbon sink for national carbon accounts. However, this 'natural anthropogenic CO2 sink' could be used as a disincentive for certain nations to reduce their anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which would ultimately dampen global efforts to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Since the oceanic anthropogenic CO2 sink has limited ability to be controlled by human activities, current and future international climate change policies should have an explicit 'EEZ' clause excluding its use within national carbon accounts. © 2006 McNeil; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248384291

We present here highly reduced chemical schemes for rural and urban dispersion problems based on the Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) technique. CSP identifies the steady-state species for removal, by resolving the ""fast"" and the ""slow"" chemistry components. Here, the CSP method is employed for the reduction of the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism (RACM), which includes 77 species and 237 reactions. Three cases were tested: (1) a polluted scenario including ground emissions, (2) a relatively cleaner environment with 10% of the emission levels of case 1, and finally (3) rural conditions without any emissions, for which the effects of emissions on the reduction procedure were directly studied. It was found that reduced mechanisms with high degree of reduction, down to a 16 step mechanism, i.e., 56 species in steady state, produced excellent results for most species for all cases. These reduced mechanisms did not change much between urban or rural conditions and the inclusion of emissions did not affect significantly the selection of major species. This indicates the persistence of a well-defined fast subset of the mechanism, suggesting that the produced reduced mechanisms are valid for a wide range of conditions in the atmosphere.

These measurements show that such emissions may be much higher when planes are left idling on an airport tarmac than previously believed. The results of this experiment will help local air-quality planners estimate airport emissions, according to researchers working on similar studies. The data may also lead collaborators at the International civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) to revise the engine certification standards. The study took advantage of the Aerodyne Mobile Laboratory, a package-delivery-sized truck recently used in a project to characterize fine particulate matter in Mexico City.

Three global climate models (GCMs) were used to generate high (A2) and low (B2) emission scenarios; the canadian global coupled model (CGCM2), the Australian developed CSIROMk2, and the HadCM3 model developed at the Hadley Centre in the United Kingdom. The three time periods simulated were 2010-2039 (2020s), 2040-2069 (2050s) and 2070-2099 (2080s). An increase in winter temperature of 1.5-4.0 °C and a precipitation increase of the order of 5-20% is predicted by the 2050s. Modelled summer precipitation is more variable with predicted change ranging from zero to a 35% decrease depending on the GCM and emission scenario. Summer temperatures were simulated to increase by approximately 2-4 °C. The UBC Watershed Model was used to model the hydrologic response of gauged sub watersheds in the basin under the altered climates. All scenarios consistently predicted an early onset of the spring snowmelt, a tendency towards a more rainfall dominated hydrograph and considerable reductions in the annual and spring flow volumes in the 2050s and 2080s. Of the three climate models, the CGCM2 model provided the most conservative predictions of the impacts of climate change in Okanagan Basin. Simulations based on the CSIROMk2 climate model suggested greatly reduced snowpack and flow volumes despite a sizeable increase in the winter precipitation. The scenarios raise questions over the availability of future water resources in the Okanagan Basin, particularly as extended periods of low flows into upland reservoirs are likely to coincide with increased demand from agricultural and domestic water users. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Decomposition studies indicate that montmorillonite, a smectite that often forms with interlayers rich in Ca2+, greatly retards the microbial mineralization of soil organic matter. We performed a series of atomistic simulations designed to identify favorable molecular-scale organo-mineral interactions within nanoscale, hydrated complexes consisting of a humic substance and Ca-montmorillonite. Both protonated and Ca-saturated forms of the model humic molecule, representing acidic and circumneutral solution conditions, respectively, were studied within the hydrated interlayer region of a rigid-atom model of Ca-montmorillonite. The protonated humic substance formed direct hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) interactions with the clay mineral. A few polar organic groups adsorbed via water bridging interactions. The Ca-saturated humic substance adsorbed via numerous cation bridges, less numerous water bridges, and indirect H-bonding interactions mediated by water molecules. Application of molecular modeling techniques to this complex organo-mineral system thus allowed identification of interactions favorable to carbon sequestration under both acidic and circumneutral conditions. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Field and modelling studies have demonstrated that water table drawdown during drought periods promotes oxidation of previously stored (reduced) sulphur (S) compounds in wetlands, with subsequent efflux of SO42- upon re-wetting. Although climate-induced changes in processes are generally not integrated into soil-acidification models, MAGIC (Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments) includes a wetland compartment that incorporates redox processes driven by drought events. The potential confounding influence of climate-induced drought events on acidification recovery at Plastic Lake, south-central Ontario (under proposed future S emission reductions) was investigated using MAGIC and two climate scenarios: monthly precipitation and runoff based on long-term means (average-climate scenario), and variable precipitation and runoff based on the past 20 years of observed monthly data (variable-climate scenario). The variable-climate scenario included several periods of summer drought owing to lower than average rainfall and higher then average temperature. Nonetheless, long-term regional trends in precipitation and temperature suggest that the variable-climate scenario may be a conservative estimate of future climate. The average-climate scenario indicated good recovery potential with acid neutralising capacity (ANC) reaching approximately 40 μmolc L- 1 by 2020 and 50 μmolc L- 1 by 2080. In contrast, the forecasted recovery potential under the variable-climate scenario was very much reduced. By 2080, ANC was forecasted to increase to 2.6 μmolc L- 1 from - 10.0 μmolc L- 1 in 2000. Elevated SO42- efflux following drought events (introduced under the variable-climate scenario) has a dramatic impact on simulated future surface water chemistry. The results clearly demonstrate that prediction of future water quality, using models such as MAGIC, should take into account changes or variability in climate as well as acid deposition. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Structural characterization and nature of surface active sites were attempted to explain the methane activation reaction on these catalysts. Although Lewis and Brönsted acid sites were observed on the oxoanion modified zirconias, as detected by infrared of pyridine adsorption, the methane activation occurred only when promoted with specific metals, such as Fe-Mn, Co-Mn, Al, Ni and Cu, for sulfated zirconias, and Ni for molybdated and tugstated zirconias. The results obtained suggest different kinds of active surface sites, depending on the oxoanion present and thus different mechanisms could be proposed for the methane activation reaction. It was suggested that on metal promoted sulfated zirconias, methane was converted into ethane by an acid catalyzed mechanism, more specifically, by S{single bond}OH groups as proton donors. On NiO promoted molybdated and tungstated zirconias, methane was not simultaneously converted into ethane but only after an induction period. The XRD patterns of tugstated zirconias after the reaction with methane, showed only reflections at 2θ = 42.6°, 53.8° and 77.6°, characteristics of nickel on zero oxidation state. Although these reflections were absent for Ni promoted molybdated zirconias, these catalysts were black in color after reaction. TPR experiments using CH4 as reduction gas gave support to the proposal for a mechanism catalyzed by metal for the methane conversion into ethane on Ni promoted molybdated and tungstated zirconias. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The target current increases with increasing the target voltage due to the non-uniform plasma distributed near the target, which follows the Child law. The secondary emission current, following the square root of target voltage, is superposed to the ion current. For the higher pressures of larger than 1.5 mTorr, the target current is larger than the expected current of Bohm current plus the secondary emission current.

The sediments were collected using a domestic vacuum cleaner which was proven to be highly efficient in collecting sub-micron particles. Five particle sizes were analysed separately for eight heavy metal elements (Zn, Fe, Pb, Cd, Cu, Cr, Al and Mn). At all sites, the maximum concentration of the heavy metals occurred in the 0.45-75 μm particle size range, which conventional street cleaning services do not remove efficiently. Multicriteria decision making methods (MCDM), PROMETHEE and GAIA, were employed in the data analysis. PROMETHEE, a non-parametric ranking analysis procedure, was used to rank the metal contents of the sediments sampled at each site. The most polluted site and particle size range were the industrial site and the 0.45-75 μm range, respectively. Although the industrial site displayed the highest metal concentrations, the highest heavy metal loading coincided with the highest sediment load, which occurred at the commercial site. GAIA, a special form of principal component analysis, was applied to determine correlations between the heavy metals and particle size ranges and also to assess possible correlation with total organic carbon (TOC).

A ruling in favor of the states that brought the suit could represent a great challenge to the Bush Administration's policies on climate change. There is widespread opposition to addressing climate change with mandatory programs, however. When questioned about the Supreme Court review, President George W. Bush said global warming is a serious problem but added that there is debate over whether it is caused by human activities. EPA is confident that its 2003 decision about CO2 is correct, according to EPA spokeswoman Jennifer Wood.

It is intended to apply underground storage techniques such as flue gas injection in unminable coal seams. In this context, an experimental study has been performed on the adsorption of pure CO2 and preferential sorption behavior of flue gas. A coal sample from the Silesian Basin in Poland (0.68% V Rr), measured in the dry and wet state at 353 K has been chosen for this approach. The flue gas used was a custom class industrial flue gas with 10.9% of CO2, 0.01% of CO, 9% of H2, 3.01% of CH4, 3.0% of O2, 0.106% of SO2 and nitrogen as balance. Adsorption isotherms of CO2 and flue gas were measured upto a maximum of 11 MPa using a volumetric method. Total excess sorption capacities for CO2 on dry and wet Silesia coal ranged between 1.9 and 1.3 mmol/g, respectively. Flue gas sorption capacities on dry and wet Silesia coal were much lower and ranged between 0.45 and 0.2 mmol/g, respectively, at pressures of 8 MPa. The low sorption capacity of wet coal has resulted from water occupying some of the more active adsorption sites and hence reducing the heterogeneity of adsorption sites relative to that of dry coal. Desorption tests with flue gas were conducted to study the degree of preferential sorption of the individual components. These experiments indicate that CO2 is by far the prefered sorbing component under both wet and dry conditions. This is followed by CH4. N2 adsorbs very little on the coal in the presence of CO2 and CH4. It is also observed that the adsorption of CO2 onto coal is not significantly hindered by the addition of other gases, other than dilution effect of the pressure. In addition to the sorption experiments, the density of the flue gas mixture has been determined up to 18 MPa at 318 K. A very good precision of these measurements were documented by volumetric methods. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The disk emission as observed by ROSAT, the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, and XMM-Newton appears to be uniformly distributed across the disk and to be correlated with solar activity. These characteristics suggest that the disk X rays are produced by (1) the elastic scattering of solar X rays by atmospheric neutrals and (2) the absorption of solar X rays in the carbon K-shell followed by fluorescent emission. The carbon atoms are found in methane molecules located below the homopause. In this paper we present the results of calculations of the scattering albedo for soft X rays. We also show the calculated X-ray intensity for a range of atmospheric abundances for Jupiter and Saturn and for a number of solar irradiance spectra. The model calculations are compared with recent X-ray observations of Jupiter and Saturn. We conclude that the emission of soft X rays from the disks of Jupiter and Saturn can be largely explained by the scattering and fluorescence of solar soft X rays. We suggest that measured X-ray intensities from the disk regions of Jupiter and Saturn can be used to constrain both the absolute intensity and the spectrum of solar X rays.

A decrease of the averaged O3 mixing ratio reaching -3 ppbv is predicted in southern areas whereas an increase reaching up 4 ppbv is calculated in northwestern Europe. The benefit of European emission control measures is found to be significantly counterbalanced by increasing global O3 levels and subsequent long range transport since both are of the same magnitude (up to 4 ppbv) but opposite in sign.

However, for a sustainable sea borne trade it is also important to introduce an efficient, clean and cost effective transport network comprising Inland Water Transport (IWT). The aim of this study is to review the driving forces behind energy demand in Egypt, evaluating different solutions to offset the expected oil reserve and production decline. Alternative fuels, which can be used with relatively small changes in marine propulsion engines, were also compared. In addition, an environmental and economic assessment when using Natural Gas (NG) and gas oil up on varying speed, range, operating hour/day and fuel price was carried by constructing a mathematical model for 106 TEUs container barge. The comparison between fuels revealed that the NG could be considered the best alternative fuel for IWT due to its availability, adaptability, and compliance with local emission regulations.

A hypothetical 50% peanut, 50% cotton, non-irrigated, 40 ha (100 ac) north Florida farm was used to study the interactions of different crop insurance products with ENSO-based climate information and levels of risk aversion under uncertain conditions of climate and prices. Crop yields simulated by the DSSAT suite of crop models using multiyear weather data combined with historical series of prices were used to generate long series of stochastic income distributions in a whole-farm model portfolio. The farm model optimized planting dates and simulated uncertain incomes for 50 alternative crop insurance combinations for different levels of risk aversion under different planning horizons. Results suggested that incomes are greatest and most stable for low risk-averse farmers when catastrophic (CAT) insurance for cotton and 70% or 75% actual production history (APH) for peanut are selected in all ENSO phases. For high risk-averse farmers, the best strategy depends on the ENSO phase: (1) 70% crop revenue coverage (CRC) or CAT for cotton and 65% APH for peanut during EL Niño years; (2) CAT for cotton and 65%, 70%, or 75% APH for peanut during neutral years; and (3) 65% to 70% APH, or CAT for cotton and 70% APH for peanut during La Niña years.

Ammonia loss in each phase was predicted using a mechanistic model for NH 3 volatilized from the surface of an aqueous solution of ammonium where the NHs is transported to the free atmosphere through a pathway with finite resistance. Ammonia emission rate was a function of the ammoniacal N content in the manure, ambient temperature, manure pH, manure moisture content, and the exposed manure surface area. Model relationships were calibrated by selecting values for the resistance to NH 3 transport for the various loss pathways, which predicted daily and annual emissions similar to those reported in published studies. In further evaluation, these calibrated relationships predicted average annual losses similar to those documented in previous work over a range in climate locations. These relationships were integrated into a whole-farm simulation model to provide a tool for evaluating and comparing long-term nitrogen losses along with other performance, environmental, and economic aspects of farm production. Whole-farm simulations illustrated that the use of a free stall barn, bottom-loaded slurry storage, and direct injection of manure into the soil reduced NH 3 emissions by 33% to 50% compared to other commonly used dairy housing and manure handling systems in the northeastern U.S. The improvement in nitrogen utilization more than offset the increased cost in manure handling, providing a small increase in farm profit. The farm model provides a research and teaching tool for evaluating and comparing the economic and environmental sustainability of dairy and beef production systems.","Ammonia emission; Cattle production; Farm model; Nitrogen loss; Simulation","Ammonia emission; Cattle production; Farm model; Nitrogen loss; Computer simulation; Farms; Gas emissions; Ammonia; ammonia; dairy farming; emission; management practice; manure; nitrogen; nutrient loss; Ammonia; Animals; Cattle; Simulation; North America; United States; Animalia; Bos taurus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750591787

The average Pb and Cd content of the dry cells are 1051 mg kg-1 (range 42-3170 mg kg-1) and 107.7 mg kg-1 (range 4.6-410 mg kg-1), respectively. An estimated consumption emission of 1.16 metric ton lead and 0.12 metric ton cadmium are witnessed per decade from the importation of about 11000 metric ton/year of primary batteries and parts. The calculated emissions of 607 kg Pb and 62 kg Cd for 1987 accounts for about 42% of the estimated emissions witnessed for the period 1980-1998. Within this period, an estimated average of 1671 g/t Pb and 475 g/t Cd were emitted annually into the atmosphere with fly ash particulate at municipal waste minimization sites. About 3400 g/t Pb and 41 g/t Cd are released into the soil through ash and cinder at such sites with about 1% of these reaching the underground water per annum. These estimated consumption emissions calls for appropriate legislation and provision of adequate well established systems for the separation, storage, transportation and management of toxic waste materials such as primary and secondary battery wastes. The environmental and health implications of inappropriate management of primary waste are also discussed. The degradation of discarded dry cells in inhabited areas can expose children who play in such contaminated areas to low doses of Pb and Cd.

The study uses both the California Energy Commission guidelines for environmental justice analyses and a method that geographically maps air pollution to perform ex-ante environmental justice analyses of three power plants. The objective is to see if results from using these two analysis methods differ substantially. Findings indicate that the mapping technique employed represents a substantial improvement over defining the impacted population using proximity methods because it accounts for the geographical distribution of the hazard. Furthermore, using multiple comparison benchmarks to determine whether the impacted population constitutes an environmental justice population improves upon existing methods by accounting for the spatial distribution of minority and low income populations and for the possibility that there is a relatively high or relatively low percentage of low income and minority persons in both the impacted and comparison regions.",,"atmospheric pollution; emission control; environmental justice; environmental planning; environmental policy; geographical distribution; mapping; spatial distribution; California; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749860496

The ratio R1 of the intensities of the Si x lines at 50.524 and 50.691 A is adopted. A certain temperature effect in R1 appears near the low-density limit region, which is due to the contamination of the Si x line at 50.703 Å. Using the emission measure distribution model derived by Audard and coworkers for Capella and emissivities calculated with the Astrophysical Plasma Emission Code model by Smith and coworkers, we successfully estimate the contributions of the Fe XVI lines at 50.367 and 50.576 Å (73% and 62%, respectively). A comparison between the observed ratios and theoretical predictions constrains the (logarithmic) electron densities for Procyon to be 8.61-0.20+0.24cm, while for α Cen A and B, Capella, and ε Eri they are 8.81-0.23+0.27, 8.60-0.32+0.39, 9.30-0.48, and 9.11 -0.38+1.40 cm-3, respectively. The comparison of our results with those constrained by the triplet of He-like carbon shows good agreement. For normal stars, our results display a narrow uncertainty, while for active stars, a relatively larger uncertainty due to contamination from Fe XVI lines is found. Another possible reason may be the uncertainty of the continuum level, since the emission lines of Si x become weak for active stars. For e Eri, an electron density in the C v-forming region was first estimated through Si x emission. © 2006. The American Astronomical Society.

Two exposure treatments were used in triplicate mesocosms: natural UVBR (N treatment, considered as the control treatment) and lamp-enhanced UVBR (H treatment, simulating 60% depletion of the ozone layer). A phytoplankton bloom developed after day 3, but no significant differences were found between treatments during the entire experiment for phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a and cell carbon) nor for phytoplankton cell abundances from flow cytometry and optical microscopy of three phytoplankton size classes (picoplankton, nanoplankton and microplankton). In contrast, bacterial abundances showed significantly higher values in the H treatment, attributed to a decrease in predation pressure due to a dramatic reduction in ciliate biomass (∼70-80%) in the H treatment relative to the N treatment. The most abundant ciliate species were Strombidinium sp., Prorodon ovum and Tintinnopsis sp.; all showed significantly lower abundances under the H treatment. P. ovum was the less-affected species (50% reduction in the H treatment compared with that of the N control), contrasting with ∼90% for the other ones. Total specific phytoplanktonic and bacterial production were not affected by enhanced UVBR. However, both the ratio of primary to bacterial biomass and production decreased markedly under the H treatment. In contrast, the ratio of phytoplankton to bacterial plus ciliate carbon biomass showed an opposite trend than the previous results, with higher values in the H treatment at the end of the experiment. These results are explained by the changes in the ciliate biomass and suggest that UVBR can alter the structure of the lower levels of the planktonic community by selectively affecting key species. On the other hand, linearity between particulate organic carbon (POC) and estimated planktonic carbon was lost during the postbloom period in both treatments. On the basis of previous studies, our results can be attributed to the aggregation of carbon released by cells to the water column in the form of transparent exopolymer particles (TEPs) under nutrient limiting conditions. Unexpectedly, POC during such a period was higher in the H treatment than in controls. We hypothesize a decrease in the ingestion of TEPs by ciliates, in coincidence with increased DOC release by phytoplankton cells under enhanced UVBR. The consequences of such results for the carbon cycle in the ocean are discussed. © 2006 American Society for Photobiology.",,"carbon; cilienic acid; linoleic acid; animal; article; biomass; food chain; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; plankton; radiation exposure; sea; temperature; time; ultraviolet radiation; Animals; Biomass; Carbon; Food Chain; Linoleic Acids; Oceans and Seas; Photosynthesis; Plankton; Temperature; Time Factors; Ultraviolet Rays; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Ciliophora; Prorodon; Tintinnopsis sp.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749026950

On Australian farms, sowing of improved pastures is associated with an increase in stocking rate (animals/ha) to manage the sward and repay sowing costs. This increase in animal numbers complicates the calculation of changes in whole-farm enteric methane emissions associated with pasture improvement. The GrassGro™ model was used to simulate the changes in annual methane, meat, wool and gross margin (GM), resulting from sowing improved pasture on a 100 ha cross-bred lamb farm at Cowra, NSW. Simulations used 45 years of local weather data with stocking rates on unimproved and improved pastures of 3.5 and 9 ewes/ha, respectively. Farm methane production and sales of wool and LW were increased 2.3-, 2.7- and 3.1-fold by sowing 100% of the farm area to improved pasture. GM was increased almost four-fold and the annual variation in GM reduced.

It describes a theoretical blueprint constructed of concepts from the theory of dissipative structures (derived from the discipline of physical chemistry) and world-systems theory (derived from the discipline of sociology) into a proposed integrated theory pivoting on the concept of social vulnerability. The goal is to examine the key concepts of this theory - vulnerability, resilience and adaptive capacity - as elements of the complex systems perspective provided by dissipative structure principles. The focus on social vulnerability provides the means to establish the role of external economic linkages relevant to industrial forestry - the core/periphery relations of the world-system - as they influence the social vulnerability of the boreal forest SESs. These systems are posited as embedded peripheries, following world-system criteria, and as the focal scale of analysis within a larger hierarchically organized dissipative structure. The goal is to suggest and stimulate ideas for further discussion and exploration, motivated by the premise that any successful climate change mitigation efforts depend on having sound theoretical foundations on which to stand. © Springer 2006.","Boreal forest; Dissipative structures; Embedded peripheries; Social vulnerability; World-systems theory","boreal forest; climate change; resource development; theoretical study; vulnerability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748786831

Relatively little research has focused on understanding how ecosystems respond to changes in precipitation regimes, which are expected to have significant impacts for ecosystem functioning, species distribution, species richness and biodiversity especially in arid ecosystems. There is a need for integrated studies to understand the functional ecology of different species in order to predict their success under changing environmental conditions. One example for such an integrated assessment is a study by Xu and Li (this issue) on water-use strategies of desert shrubs. By combining investigations of morphological traits, such as root architecture, with ecophysiological measurements Xu and Li were able to elucidate the differing adaptive strategies of three desert shrubs in their arid environment. The plant physiological response of the plants was closely related to their water-use strategy and was coupled with the functional type of the root system. Integrated research such as this will lead to a more complete understanding of the water and carbon economy of plant species and ecosystems and will allow a more accurate prediction of plant responses to changing environmental conditions. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.","Arid ecosystems; Plant strategies; Water pulses; Water-use","ecosystem function; functional change; global change; integrated approach; natural hazard; plant community; precipitation (climatology); root system; shrub; species diversity; terrestrial ecosystem; water use",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748699373

Some mire plant communities vanish quickly following the water-level drawdown; some may prevail longer in the moister patches of peatland. Drainage ditches, as a new kind of surface, introduce another component of spatial variation in drained peatlands. These variations were hypothesized to affect methane (CH4) fluxes from drained peatlands. Methane fluxes from different plant communities and unvegetated surfaces, including ditches, were measured at the drained part of Lakkasuo mire, Central Finland. The fluxes were found to be related to peatland site type, plant community, water-table position and soil temperature. At nutrient-rich fen sites fluxes between plant communities differed only a little: almost all plots acted as CH4 sinks (-0.9 to -0.4 mg CH4 m-2 d-1), with the exception of Eriophorum angustifolium Honck. communities, which emitted 0.9 g CH4 m-2 d -1. At nutrient-poor bog site the differences between plant communities were clearer. The highest emissions were measured from Eriophorum vaginatum L. communities (29.7 mg CH4 m-2 d-1), with a decreasing trend to Sphagna (10.0 mg CH4 m-2 d-1) and forest moss communities (2.6 mg CH4 m -2 d-1). CH4 emissions from different kinds of ditches were highly variable, and extremely high emissions (summertime averages 182-600 mg CH4 m-2 d-1) were measured from continuously water-covered ditches at the drained fen. Variability in the emissions was caused by differences in the origin and movement of water in the ditches, as well as differences in vegetation communities in the ditches. While drainage on average greatly decreases CH4 emissions from peatlands, a great spatial variability in fluxes is emerged. Emissions from ditches constantly covered with water, may in some cases have a great impact on the overall CH4 emissions from drained peatlands. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.","Bog; CH4; Drainage; Emission; Fen; Plant community","drainage; emission; forestry; heterogeneity; methane; mire; peatland; plant community; soil temperature; spatial variation; vegetation; water table; Eurasia; Europe; Finland; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Bryophyta; Eriophorum angustifolium; Eriophorum vaginatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748681305

Many current methods rely directly on adaptations of regulatory-orientated approaches. The resultant hazard-based indicators reflect differences in maximum likely individual exposure in the region for an emission and differences in regulatory limits. Such regulatory hazard-based indicators, however, may not provide a consistent basis for relative comparison across chemicals in terms of toxicological risk, as they were not designed for this application purpose. It is therefore essential to consider other methods in LCA to provide comparative estimates, taking into account the full extent of toxicological risks and differences in consequences. This article provides a step-by-step description of the methodological similarities and differences between such risk and hazard based indicators for LCA. An example for benzo[a]pyrene demonstrates a risk-based methodology, highlighting relationships with regulatory approaches and problems that remain in current practice.

The precise implications of the scientific claims about climate change, and the extent to which they pose dangers to various populations, are becoming intensely debated at many levels in relation to policy. How 'danger' is interpreted will ultimately affect which actions are taken. In this paper, we examine how climate change is conceptualised by publics in Europe and in the USA. Although there is widespread concern about climate change, it is of secondary importance in comparison to other issues in people's daily lives. Most individuals relate to climate change through personal experience, knowledge, the balance of benefits and costs, and trust in other societal actors. We analyse these factors through findings from various surveys and studies, which highlight both the distinctiveness and some shared perspectives at a generalised level. We reflect upon these in relation to trust and responsibility for climate change action, and risk communication, supporting the call for discourses about climate change to also be situated in people's locality, as a means of increasing its saliency. © Springer 2006.",,"Public policy; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risk communication; Societal actors; Climate change; analytical method; anthropogenic effect; climate change; public attitude; survey; Eurasia; Europe; North America; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747676927

We estimated the life-cycle energy consumption and emissions associated with biofuel production and use in light-duty vehicle (LDV) technologies by using the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model. Analysis of biofuel production was based on ASPEN Plus model simulation of an advanced fermentation process to produce fuel ethanol/protein, a thermochemical process to produce Fischer-Tropsch diesel (FTD) and dimethyl ether (DME), and a combined heat and power plant to co-produce steam and electricity. Our study revealed that cellulosic biofuels as E85 (mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline by volume), FTD, and DME offer substantial savings in petroleum (66-93%) and fossil energy (65-88%) consumption on a per-mile basis. Decreased fossil fuel use translates to 82-87% reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across all unblended cellulosic biofuels. In urban areas, our study shows net reductions for almost all criteria pollutants, with the exception of carbon monoxide (unchanged), for each of the biofuel production option examined. Conventional and hybrid electric vehicles, when fueled with E85, could reduce total sulfur oxide (SO x)emissions to 39-43% of those generated by vehicles fueled with gasoline. By using bio-FTD and bio-DME in place of diesel, SOx emissions are reduced to 46-58% of those generated by diesel-fueled vehicles. Six different fuel production options were compared.

While the texture of the carbon matrix can be controlled by the infiltration conditions, the carbon texture at the fiber-matrix interface differs from the bulk matrix and cannot be determined by the infiltration parameters. We often observe a high-textured layer with a thickness up to 100 nm at the interface prior to the formation of the bulk matrix with a lower texture.

In contrast to BN-substrates, thin high-textured pyrolytic layers are observed at the interface of carbon on planar Si- and cordierite-substrates where strong bonding between pyrolytic carbon and the substrate is achieved by the formation of Si-C bonds.

The atmosphere component is the 5° × 4° global general circulation model of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) with 9 levels in the vertical direction. The ocean component with a horizontal resolution of 0.5°, is based on a low-resolution model (22° × 1° in longitude-latitude). Simulations of the ocean component are first compared with its previous version. Results show that the enhanced ocean horizontal resolution allows an improved ocean state to be simulated; this involves (1) an apparent decrease in errors in the tropical Pacific cold tongue region, which exists in many ocean models, (2) more realistic large-scale flows, and (3) an improved ability to simulate the interannual variability and a reduced root mean square error (RMSE) in a long time integration. In coupling these component models, a monthly ""linear-regression"" method is employed to correct the model's exchanged flux between the sea and the atmosphere. A 100-year integration conducted with the coupled GCM (CGCM) shows the effectiveness of such a method in reducing climate drift. Results from years 70 to 100 are described. The model produces a reasonably realistic annual cycle of equatorial SST. The large SSTA is confined to the eastern equatorial Pacific with little propagation. Irregular warm and cold events alternate with a broad spectrum of periods between 24 and 50 months, which is very realistic. But the simulated variability is weaker than the observed and is also asymmetric in the sense of the amplitude of the warm and cold events.","Coupled model; ENSO; High-resolution; Statistical correction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746860277

Conventional extracorporeal gas exchange is labor-intensive, expensive, and usually requires systemic anticoagulation. In this study, a simplified venovenous circuit was developed by using regional citrate anticoagulation to avoid potential complications associated with systemic heparin. Five healthy adult sheep underwent percutaneous placement of a double-lumen 18F catheter into the internal jugular vein. The extracorporeal circuit consisted of a hollow fiber oxygenator and a variable speed roller pump. Regional anticoagulation consisted of a continuous citrate infusion to the inflow limb of the circuit. Systemic calcium levels were maintained by calcium chloride infusion through a central line. CO2 transfer was measured at varying levels of blood and gas flow. CO2 transfer ranged from 31 ml/min (500 ml/min blood flow; 2 l/min gas flow) to 150 ml/min (1000 ml/min blood flow; 15 l/min gas flow) and was directly proportional to blood flow and gas flow (p < 0.05).

Impaired bicarbonate secretion is a key component of CF-related pancreatic disease, but the role of impaired bicarbonate secretion in CF lung disease is less well understood. The submucosal glands of the conducting airways produce and secrete a complex airway surface liquid that lines the airway epithelium and plays a significant role in mucociliary clearance. The serous cell is the predominant cell type of the submucosal gland and a predominant site of CFTR expression. Calu-3 cells are a model of airway submucosal gland serous cells that demonstrates vectorial bicarbonate secretion in response to elevations in cAMP. Based on previously published measurements of unidirectional ion flux, pharmacological inhibition of short-circuit current and ion substitution studies, one can hypothesize the existence of an electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter (NBC) in the basolateral membrane of Calu-3 cells that mediates bicarbonate entry from the interstitium. To test this hypothesis, we performed reverse-transcriptase PCR, western blotting, and surface biotinylation to identify and localize electrogenic NBCs in Calu-3 cells. Our data demonstrate that both pNBC1 and NBC4 mRNAs can be identified and that their protein products are expressed at the basolateral membrane of polarized Calu-3 cells. These data suggest that these transporters contribute to regulated bicarbonate secretion across Calu-3 cells and perhaps human airway submucosal glands. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Along present and former meander bends, dipping laminated sandy channel-bank deposits rest in sharp lithostratigraphic and chronologic contrast to the adjacent and overlying mudflat deposits. Horizontal channel migration rates of roughly 10 to 20 meters per century are orders of magnitude faster than the minimum estimates of vertical mudflat silt accumulation, which range from 5 to 25 centimeters per century. Given the nearly 6000-year history since the late-Holocene marine transgression that produced the initial lagoon environments of deposition, it is no surprise that channel meander migration has left a prevalence of channel-bank deposits in the subsurface lithostratigraphy. Furthermore, regional subsidence and rising relative sea level continue to enhance the net accumulation of mudflat and salt marsh deposition on top of the older deposits. Tapered variations of tidal-channel width, depth, and flow velocity, as well as wind-driven waves with associated intensities of turbulence along the meandering paths, lead to recognizable sediment grain size trends and lagoon deposit stratigraphy. Human interventions, such as dredging, spoil disposal, and powerboat wakes, introduce other contrasting processes and depositional features.

In 2001, the total concentrations of contaminating metals in the soil measured at the most polluted plot were 59 000 mg kg-1 Pb, 180 mg kg-1 Cd, and 3300 mg kg-1 Zn. A negative correlation between the concentration of metals in the soil and plant biodiversity parameters along the gradient of pollution in 2001 was detected. Plant species lists were compiled in 2001 for plots located at different distances from the emission source and compared to that of 1981. In the period from 1981 to 2001, smelter emissions were reduced, and plant species richness increased at all examined plots. Among the successful survivals were some metal hyperaccumulators (Minuartia gerardii, Thlaspi praecox, and Biscutella laevigata). Of special interest were plants that survived the period of highest pollution. We believe that these species can be used in metal-degraded environments for natural revegetation to immobilize heavy metals. The ecosystem in the surroundings of the former smelter is presently recovering. Our results suggest that high metal concentrations in soil are a potential limiting factor for revegetation. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,"Biodiversity parameters; Metal hyperaccumulators; Natural revegetations; Smelter emissions; Concentration (process); Contamination; Lead; Particulate emissions; Plants (botany); Vegetation; Soil pollution; cadmium; lead; zinc; Concentration (process); Contamination; Lead; Particulate emissions; Plants (botany); Soil pollution; Vegetation; hyperaccumulation; industrial emission; lead; metals industry; plant; revegetation; smelting; soil pollution; spatiotemporal analysis; species richness; survival; article; bioaccumulation; biodiversity; concentration response; heavy metal removal; metal industry; nonhuman; revegetation; Slovenia; soil pollution; species richness; Biodiversity; Cadmium; Industrial Waste; Lead; Metallurgy; Plants; Slovenia; Soil Pollutants; Zinc; Eurasia; Europe; Slovenia; Southern Europe; Zerjav; Biscutella laevigata; Minuartia gerardii; Thlaspi praecox",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746765054

Simulations showed large changes in ozone and ozone sensitivities at three sites investigated between summers 1987 and 1997 due to emission reductions. However, only small changes in ozone and ozone sensitivities were predicted between 1997 and 2010. Sensitivities of the differences in ozone between simulations with different emission scenarios were calculated and compared to sensitivities of ozone in each simulation. In some cases, the sensitivities of ozone differences were smaller than those of ozone itself, but in other cases, such as when the sensitivity to NOx emissions changed sign, sensitivities of differences were larger. The adjoint method was most useful for determining when and where model inputs affect, or have the potential to affect, an ozone response. For example, the method was used to plot the spatial distribution of important emission source regions to 1-hour versus 8-hour peak ozone. Changes in the distribution and sign of the adjoint function for emitted species revealed changes in the area of influence of pollutant emissions on peak ozone due to emission controls.

Some of these tools allow the representation of complex environments within hydrocarbon production plants. In certain explosion scenarios, a correction is usually made for the presence of buildings and other complexities by using crude approximations to obtain realistic estimates of explosion behaviour as can be found when predicting the strength of blast waves resulting from initial explosions. With the advance of computational technology, and greater availability of computing power, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools are becoming increasingly available for solving such a wide range of explosion problems. A CFD-based explosion code - FLACS can, for instance, be confidently used to understand the impact of blast overpressures in a plant environment consisting of obstacles such as buildings, structures, and pipes. With its porosity concept representing geometry details smaller than the grid, FLACS can represent geometry well, even when using coarse grid resolutions. The performance of FLACS has been evaluated using a wide range of field data. In the present paper, the concept of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and its application to gas explosion prediction is presented. Furthermore, the predictive capabilities of CFD-based gaseous explosion simulators are demonstrated using FLACS1).

A WAIS collapse could cause a 5-6 metre global sea level rise within centuries. In three case studies, we investigate the response of society to the most extreme yet not implausible scenario, a five-metre sea level rise within a century, starting in 2030. The case studies combine a series of interviews with experts and stakeholders with a gaming workshop. In the Rhone delta, the most likely option would be retreat, with economic losses, perhaps social losses, and maybe ecological gains. In the Thames estuary, the probable outcome is less clear, but would probably be a mix of protection, accommodation and retreat, with parts of the city centre turned into a Venice of London. A massive downstream barrier is an alternative response. In the Rhine delta (the Netherlands), the initial response would be protection, followed by retreat from the economically less important parts of the country and, probably, from Amsterdam-Rotterdam metropolitan region as well. These impacts are large compared to other climate change impacts, but probably small compared to the impacts of the same scenario in other parts of the world. This suggests that the possibility of a anthropogenic-climate-change-induced WAIS collapse would strengthen the case for greenhouse gas emission reduction.","Adaptation; Sea level rise; West-Antarctic Ice Sheet","Climate change; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Estuaries; Adaptation; Climate change impacts; Sea level rise; West Antarctic Ice Sheet; Sea level",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746613639

These effects are evaluated most accurately by direct comparison of binding affinities of selectively fluorinated compounds with their corresponding hydrocarbons. In cases where structural data confirm similar binding geometries for the fluorocarbon and hydrocarbon analogues, reliable estimates for the impact of fluorination upon arene-π X and C-F X interaction energies are possible. Existing studies show that fluorination's impact on any individual molecular interaction is quite modest. Upon binding to a protein receptor, cumulative fluorinated aromatic quadrupolar and C-F X dipolar interaction energies rarely differ from those the corresponding hydrocarbons by more than 1.3 kcal/mol, and most individual interactions appear to be in the 0.1-0.4 kcal/mol range. Similarly, non-ideal selective fluorination is rarely associated with a dramatic decrease in affinity, because the impact of weak repulsive interactions in the bound state is counterbalanced by increased lipophilicity. © 2006 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.","Arene-arenen interactions; C-C framework; Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; Fluorination; Fluorobenzenes; Intermolecular interaction","1,2 dichlorobenzene; 1,2 difluorobenzene; 1,2,3 trifluorobenzene; 1,2,3,4 tetrafluorobenzene; 1,2,4,5 tetrafluorobenzene; 1,3 difluorobenzene; 1,3,5 trifluorobenzene; 1,4 difluorobenzene; 4 aminobutyric acid C receptor; 4 fluorophenylalanine; aromatic amino acid; aromatic compound; benzene derivative; carbonate dehydratase II; carbonate dehydratase inhibitor; cation; chlorobenzene; fluoride; fluorine; fluorobenzene; hexafluorobenzene; methazolamide; pentafluorobenzene; pentafluorobenzoyl derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; sulfonamide; unclassified drug; binding affinity; covalent bond; dimerization; drug conformation; drug design; drug mechanism; drug receptor binding; drug structure; fluoridation; human; hydrogen bond; hydrophobicity; lipophilicity; macromolecule; molecular interaction; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; receptor blocking; review; Animals; Drug Design; Drug Interactions; Enzyme Inhibitors; Fluorine; Fluorine Compounds; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Fluorinated; Molecular Structure; Thermodynamics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746610484

Extrapolation of the mitigation potential of alternative management practices from field studies to a national scale may be enhanced by spatially explicit process models, like the DeNitrification andl Decomposition (DNDC) model. Our objective was to analyze the impacts of mitigation alternatives, management of water, fertiizer, and rice straw, on net GHG emissions (carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide fluxes), yields, and water use. After constructing a GIS database of soil, climate, rice cropping area and systems, and management practices, we ran DNDC with 21-yr alternative management schemes for each of the approximately 2500 counties in China. Results indicate that, despite large-scale adoption of midseason drainage, there is still large potential for additional methane reductions from Chinese rice paddies of 20 to 60% over 2000-2020. However, changes in management for reducing CHU emissions simultaneously affect soil carbon dynamics as well as N2O emissions and can thereby reorder the ranking of technical mitigation effectiveness. The order of net GHG emissions reduction effectiveness found here is upland rice &gt; shallow flooding &gt; ammonium sulfate &gt; midseason drainage &gt; off-season straw &gt; slow-release fertilizer &gt; continuous flooding. Most of the management alternatives produced yields comparable to the baseline; however, continuous flooding and upland rice significantly reduced yields. Water management strategies appear to be the most technically promising GHG mitigation alternatives, with shallow flooding providing additional benefits of both water conservation and increased yields. © ASA, CSSA, SSSA.",,"China; DeNitrification andl Decomposition (DNDC); Mitigating net greenhouse gas emissions; Paddy rice systems; Crops; Decomposition; Denitrification; Environmental impact; Extrapolation; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Methane; Water conservation; Greenhouse effect; ammonium sulfate; carbon dioxide; fertilizer; methane; nitrous oxide; soil water; agriculture; China; climate change; conference paper; crop production; flooding; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; harvest; methanogenesis; rice; soil; water management; Air Pollutants; Carbon; China; Climate; Disasters; Fertilizers; Gases; Geography; Greenhouse Effect; Implosive Therapy; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Oryza sativa; Seasons; Soil; Time Factors; Waste Management; Fertilizers; Rice",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746477426

This paper explores the implications of the QALY approach for measuring the impacts of air pollution regulations, with an example using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Heavy Duty Engine/Diesel Fuel regulations. The paper also examines the issues surrounding the potential use of QALY measures in cost-benefit analysis for air pollution regulations. Key findings are that, compared with a cost-benefit approach, the QALY framework gives more weight to reductions in incidence of chronic disease relative to reductions in premature mortality risk, especially when the mortality risk reductions occur in older populations. In addition, use of monetized QALYs in cost-benefit analysis is not recommended, due to fundamental differences in the theoretical grounding of the different measures. However, application of monetized QALYs based on age-specific willingness to pay (WTP) for mortality risk reductions gives very similar results to typical cost-benefit analysis for mortality risk reductions, as opposed to using values for QALYs based on non-age specific WTP. The paper concludes that in cases where mortality provide the majority of a regulation's impacts, QALY based cost-effectiveness analysis and WTP based cost-benefit analysis may not differ in their conclusions. However, in cases where morbidity or non-health outcomes are significant, cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis may result in different evaulations of the efficiency of the regulation. © Springer 2006.","Air pollution; Cost-effectiveness; Morbidity; Mortality; QALY; Valuation","Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Environmental protection; Regulatory compliance; Risk assessment; Morbidity; Mortality; QALY; Valuation; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; cost-benefit analysis; diesel; environmental protection; mortality risk; pollution control; willingness to pay; North America; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746475201

Fortunately, however, conservation-oriented agricultural management systems can be, and have been, developed to sequester SOC, improve soil quality, and increase crop productivity. Our objectives were to (i) review literature related to SOC sequestration in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production systems, (ii) recommend best management practices to sequester SOC, and (iii) outline the current political scenario and future probabilities for cotton producers to benefit from SOC sequestration. From a review of 20 studies in the region, SOC increased with no tillage compared with conventional tillage by 0.48 ± 0.56 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (H0: no change, p &lt; 0.001). More diverse rotations of cotton with high-residue-producing crops such as corn (Zea mays L.) and small grains would sequester greater quantities of SOC than continuous cotton. No-tillage cropping with a cover crop sequestered 0.67 ± 0.63 Mg C ha-1 yr -1, while that of no-tillage cropping without a cover crop sequestered 0.34 ± 47 Mg C ha-1 yr-1 (mean comparison, p = 0.04). Current government incentive programs recommend agricultural practices that would contribute to SOC sequestration. Participation in the Conservation Security Program could lead to government payments of up to $20 ha-1.

These differences make it very difficult to predict how plant communities will respond to elevated CO2. Such information is critical to furthering our understanding of community and ecosystem responses to global climate change. To determine how a simple plant community might respond to elevated CO2, a model regenerating longleaf pine community composed of five species was exposed to two CO2 regimes (ambient, 365 μmol mol-1 and elevated, 720 μmol mol-1) for 3 yr. Total above- and belowground biomass was 70 and 49% greater, respectively, in CO2-enriched plots. Carbon (C) content followed a response pattern similar to biomass, resulting in a significant increase of 13.8 Mg C ha -1 under elevated CO2. Responses of individual species, however, varied. Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) was primarily responsible for the positive response to CO2 enrichment. Wiregrass (Aristida stricta Michx.), rattlebox (Crotalaria rotundifolia Walt. Ex Gmel.), and butterfly weed (Asclepias tuberosa L.) exhibited negative above- and belowground biomsss responses to elevated CO2, while sand post oak (Quercus margaretta Ashe) did not differ significantly between CO2 treatments. As with pine, C content followed patterns similar to biomass. Elevated CO 2 resulted in alterations in community structure. Longleaf pine comprised 88% of total biomass in CO2-enriched plots, but only 76% in ambient plots. In contrast, wiregrass, rattlebox, and butterfly weed comprised 19% in ambient CO2 plots, but only 8% under high CO2. Therefore, while longleaf pine may perform well in a high CO2 world, other members of this community may not compete as well, which could alter community function. Effects of elevated CO2 on plant communities are complex, dynamic, and difficult to predict, clearly demonstrating the need for more research in this important area of global change science. © ASA, CSSA, SSSA.",,"Community functions; Community structures; Global change science; Symbiotic relationships; Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Ecosystems; Morphology; Plants (botany); carbon; carbon dioxide; pine oil; unclassified drug; ambient air; Aristida stricta; Asclepias tuberosa; biomass; carbon utilization; community; conference paper; Crotalaria rotundifolia; ecosystem; global change; global climate; nitrogen concentration; nonhuman; oak; phenology; pine; plant growth; plant leaf; plant physiology; plant response; Quercus margaretta; Atmosphere; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Pinus; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Soil; Aristida stricta; Asclepias tuberosa; Crotalaria rotundifolia; Pinus palustris; Quercus margaretta; Quercus stellata",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746460949

A key question involving the potential use of forests to store more carbon as part of climate change mitigation is the impact of forest investments on the timing and quantity of forest volumes that affect carbon storage. Using an economic optimization model, we project levels of U.S. forest volumes as indicators of carbon storage for a wide range of private forest investment scenarios. Results show that economic opportunities exist to further intensify timber management on some hectares and reduce the average timber rotation length such that the national volume of standing timber stocks could be reduced relative to projections reflecting historical trends. The national amount of timber volume is projected to increase over the next 50 yr, but then is projected to decline if private owners follow an economic optimization path, such as with more forest type conversions and shorter timber rotations. With perfect foresight, future forest investments can affect current timber harvest levels, with intertemporal linkages based on adjustments through markets. Forest investments that boost regenerated timber yields per hectare would act to enhance ecosystem services (e.g., forest carbon storage) if they are related to the rate of growth and extent of growing stock inventory. © ASA, CSSA, SSSA.",,"Carbon storage; Economic optimization models; Forest investments; Timber yields; Carbon; Climate change; Investments; Mathematical models; Forestry; climate change; conference paper; crop rotation; economics; ecosystem; environmental change; forest; forestry; global climate; harvest; land use; quality control; Air Pollution; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forestry; Geography; Population Dynamics; Time Factors; United States; Carbon; Climates; Forestry; Investment; Mathematical Models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746460324

Nearly 3.2 Mha are permitted for mining activities in the United States, which are required to be reclaimed with vegetative cover. While site-specific studies have assessed C accumulation on reclaimed mine sites, regional analyses to estimate potential C increases have not been conducted. For this analysis, potential C sequestration is analyzed on 567 000 ha of mine land in a seven-state region reclaimed to cropland, pasture, or forest. Carbon accumulation is estimated for cropland, pasture, and forest soils, forest litter layer, and aboveground biomass by estimating average annual rates of C accumulation from site-specific and general C sequestration studies. The average annual rate of C storage is highest when mine land is reclaimed to forest, where the potential sequestration is 0.7 to 2.2 Tg yr-1. The C from soils, litter layer, and biomass from mine lands reclaimed to forest represents 0.3 to 1.0% of the 1990 CO2 emissions from the study region (919 Tg CO2). To achieve the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction goal of 7% below the 1990 level as proposed by the Kyoto Treaty requires CO2 emissions in the study area to be reduced by just over 64 Tg CO2.

Experiments with polyhydroxy-butyrate/valerate (PHBV, a biopolymer), cellulose (natural polymer) and acetate (soluble substance) as substrates were carried out to evaluate the impact of non-controlled inocula on test response. The European Committee of Normalization (ECN) Standard for packaging materials was the method chosen to evaluate the ultimate aerobic biodegradability, in order to establish carbon balances. Inocula were obtained from activated sludges sampled in the aerated tank of a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Activated sludges were collected at different periods, so the inoculum concentration (X0) in the test was dependent on the seasonal variations of the source. As the initial carbon content (S0) was maintained to a well-defined value, various S0/X0 ratios were obtained. At high S0/X0 ratios, cellular growth and soluble residual carbon accumulation were favoured and low mineralization levels were obtained. An increase in the quantity of mineralized carbon due to a low S0/X0 ratio seems to support the notion of standardized biodegradability tests in relation to this parameter, which could enhance the reliability of test results of polymeric materials. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A no-till (NT) cropping systems study initiated in 1999 to evaluate soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration potential in irrigated agriculture was used in this study to make trace gas flux measurements for 3 yr to facilitate a complete greenhouse gas accounting of GWP and GHGI. Fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O were measured using static, vented chambers, one to three times per week, year round, from April 2002 through October 2004 within conventional-till continuous corn (CT-CC) and NT continuous com (NT-CC) plots and in NT corn-soybean rotation (NT-CB) plots. Nitrogen fertilizer rates ranged from 0 to 224 kg N ha-1. Methane fluxes were small and did not differ between tillage systems. Nitrous oxide fluxes increased linearly with increasing N fertilizer rate each year, but emission rates varied with years. Carbon dioxide efflux was higher in CT compared to NT in 2002 but was not different by tillage in 2003 or 2004. Based on soil respiration and residue C inputs, NT soils were net sinks of GWP when adequate fertilizer was added to maintain crop production. The CT soils were smaller net sinks for GWP than NT soils. The determinant for the net GWP relationship was a balance between soil respiration and N2O emissions. Based on soil C sequestration, only NT soils were net sinks for GWP. Both estimates of GWP and GHGI indicate that when appropriate crop production levels are achieved, net CO2 emissions are reduced. The results suggest that economic viability and environmental conservation can be achieved by minimizing tillage and utilizing appropriate levels of fertilizer. © ASA, CSSA, SSSA.",,"Sequestration potential; Soil organic carbon (SOC); Tillage systems; Trace gas fluxes; Cultivation; Greenhouse effect; Irrigation; Global warming; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; air temperature; atmosphere; carbon sequestration; clay; conference paper; corn; crop production; crop rotation; cropping system; gas exchange; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; irrigation (agriculture); sand; seasonal variation; soil temperature; soybean; United States; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Colorado; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Monitoring; Fertilizers; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Irrigation; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Organic Chemicals; Soil; Soybeans; Time Factors; Zea mays; Cultivation; Greenhouse Effect; Irrigation; Glycine max; Zea mays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746423073

The CO2 is not going into the atmosphere, ultimately reducing greenhouse gases even further. In addition to Suncor and ARC, Petro-Canada, Husky, Nexen, Shell, Anadarko, Apache, Devon Canada, and Enbridge Pipelines are all eager to move the massive project forward. The proposed CO2 network consists of three parts, i.e., source, transportation, and destination. Many see CO2 EOR as a vehicle upon which the goal of reducing CO2 emissions can ride. Special facilities on site would be required to capture and prepare the CO2. According to studies, the cost of collecting CO2 at a typical Benfield-type hydrogen plant including dehydration and compression, is ≈ $(Can)28,000/ton, and operating costs are ≈ $(Can)3.50/ton.

Overall, the system carries out the same job of a conventional combustor, with the fundamental advantage of segregating the oxidation products (CO2 and H2O) into an output flow free of nitrogen and excess oxygen. The flow exiting the reduction reactor consists of water and CO2, the latter readily available for liquefaction, transport and long-term storage. The hot, vitiated air from the oxidation reactor is the means to produce power through a thermodynamic cycle. This paper reports of a study supported by the ENI group to assess the potential of the integration between CLC and combined gas-steam power cycles. More specifically, we focus on four issues: (i) optimization of plant configuration; (ii) prediction of overall efficiency; (iii) use of commercial gas turbines; (iv) preliminary economic estimates. The CLC system is based on iron oxides which, to maintain their physical characteristics, must operate below 900-1000°C. Given the crucial importance of the temperature of the vitiated air generated by CLC on the performance of the combined cycle, we consider two options: (i) ""unfired"" systems, where natural gas is fed only to the CLC system, (ii) ""fired"" systems, where the vitiated air is supplementary fired to reach gas turbine inlet temperatures ranging 1000-1200°C. Results show that unfired configurations with maximum process temperature 850-1050°C and zero emissions reach net LHV plant efficiencies ranging 43%-48%. Fired cycles where temperature is raised from 850 to 1200°C by supplementary firing can achieve 52% net LHV efficiency with CO2 emission about one half of those of a state-of-the-art combined cycles. Fired configurations allow significant capital cost and fuel cost savings compared to unfired configurations; however, a carbon tax high enough to make them attractive (close to 50 €/ton) would undermine these advantages.

The radio quasar 3C 454.3 underwent an exceptional optical outburst lasting more than 1 year and culminating in spring 2005. The maximum brightness detected was R = 12.0, which represents the most luminous quasar state thus far observed (MB ∼ -31.4). Aims. In order to follow the emission behaviour of the source in detail, a large multiwavelength campaign was organized by the Whole Earth Blazar Telescope (WEBT). Methods. Continuous optical, near-IR and radio monitoring was performed in several bands. ToO pointings by the Chandra and INTEGRAL satellites provided additional information at high energies in May 2005. Results. The historical radio and optical light curves show different behaviours. Until about 2001.0 only moderate variability was present in the optical regime, while prominent and long-lasting radio outbursts were visible at the various radio frequencies, with higher-frequency variations preceding the lower-frequency ones. After that date, the optical activity increased and the radio flux is less variable. This suggests that the optical and radio emissions come from two separate and misaligned jet regions, with the inner optical one acquiring a smaller viewing angle during the 2004-2005 outburst. Moreover, the colour-index behaviour (generally redder-when-brighter) during the outburst suggests the presence of a luminous accretion disc. A huge mm outburst followed the optical one, peaking in June-July 2005. The high-frequency (37-43 GHz) radio flux started to increase in early 2005 and reached a maximum at the end of our observing period (end of September 2005). VLBA observations at 43 GHz during the summer confirm the brightening of the radio core and show an increasing polarization. An exceptionally bright X-ray state was detected in May 2005, corresponding to the rising mm flux and suggesting an inverse-Compton nature of the hard X-ray spectrum. Conclusions. A further multifrequency monitoring effort is needed to follow the next phases of this unprecedented event. © ESO 2006.","Galaxies: active; Galaxies: jets; Galaxies: quasars: general; Galaxies: quasars: individual: 3C 454.3","Information analysis; Infrared radiation; Light sources; Luminous materials; Natural frequencies; Active; Quasars: general; Quasars: individual: 3C 454.3; Astrophysics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746097365

On scales below ∼1 kpc, the radio-FTR correlation is clearly better than the correlation of the cold gas tracers (CO and Hi) with either the radio or the FIR emission. For the LMC as a whole, there is a tight correlation between the radio and FIR emission on spatial scales above ∼50 pc. By decomposing the radio emission into thermal and non-thermal components, however, we show that the scale on which the radio-FIR correlation breaks down depends on the thermal fraction of the radio emission; regions that show a strong correlation to very small scales are the same regions where the thermal fraction of the radio emission is high. Contrary to previous studies of the local radio-FIR correlation in the LMC, we show that the slope of the relation between the radio and FIR emission is non-linear. In bright star-forming regions, the radio emission increases faster than linearly with respect to the FIR emission (power-law slope of ∼ 1.2), whereas a flatter slope of ∼0.6-0.9 applies more generally across the LMC. Our results are consistent with a scenario in which the ultraviolet photons and cosmic rays in the LMC have a common origin in massive star formation, but the cosmic rays are able to diffuse away from their production sites. Our results do not provide direct evidence for coupling between the magnetic field and the local gas density, but we note that synchrotron emission may not be a good tracer of the magnetic field if cosmic rays can readily escape the LMC. © 2006 RAS.","Galaxies: individual: Large Magellanic Cloud; Infrared: galaxies; Magellanic Clouds; Radio continuum: galaxies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746096141

The stars are assumed to be polytropic ellipsoids. The surfaces of constant density maintain their ellipsoidal shape during the time evolution. The equations of hydrodynamics then reduce to a system of ordinary differential equations for the internal velocities, the principal axes of the stars and the orbital parameters. The equations of motion are given within Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalism. The special case when both stars are axially symmetric fluid configurations is considered. Leading order gravitational radiation reaction is incorporated, where the quasi-static approximation is applied to the internal degrees of freedom of the stars. The influence of the stellar parameters, in particular the influence of the polytropic index n, on the leading order gravitational waveforms is studied.","Gravitational waves; Polytropic equation of state; Riemann-S binaries",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746078909

In this present study, we screened the complete set of viable deletion strains in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for sensitivity to acrolein to identify cell functions involved in resistance to reactive aldehydes. We identified 128 mutants whose gene products are localized throughout the cell. Acrolein-sensitive mutants were distributed among most major biological processes but particularly affected gene expression, metabolism, and cellular signaling. Surprisingly, the screen did not identify any antioxidants or similar stress-protective molecules, indicating that acrolein toxicity may not be mediated via reactive oxygen species. Most strikingly, a mutant lacking an old yellow enzyme (OYE2) was identified as being acrolein sensitive. Old yellow enzymes are known to reduce α,β- unsaturated carbonyl compounds in vitro, but their physiological roles have remained uncertain. We show that mutants lacking OYE2, but not OYE3, are sensitive to acrolein, and overexpression of both isoenzymes increases acrolein tolerance. Our data indicate that OYE2 is required for basal levels of tolerance, whereas OYE3 expression is particularly induced following acrolein stress. Despite the range of α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds that have been identified as substrates of old yellow enzymes in vitro, we show that old yellow enzymes specifically mediate resistance to small α,β- unsaturated carbonyl compounds, such as acrolein, in vivo.

The main goal of the research activity was a systematic investigation of the burner aimed to find the best operating conditions in terms of optimum equivalence ratio, thermal power and lower pollutant emissions. The analysis, which focused on the main parameters influencing the thermal efficiency and pollutant emissions at the exhaust (NOx and CO), has been carried out for different operating conditions of the burner: input thermal powers from 12.8 up to 18 kW and equivalence ratio from 0.5 (very lean flame) to 0.95 (quasi-stoichiometric condition). To significantly reduce pollutant emissions ensuring at the same time the thermal requirements of the heating process, it has been developed a new burner configuration, in which a fraction of the exhaust gases recirculates in the main combustion region through a variable gap between the burner efflux and the inner flame tube. This internal recirculation mechanism (exhaust gases recirculation, EGR) has been favoured through the addition of a pre-combustion chamber terminated by a converging nozzle acting as a mixing/ejector to promote exhaust gas entrainment into the flame tube. The most important result of this solution was a decrease of NOx emissions at the exhaust of the order of 50% with respect to the original burner geometry, for a wide range of thermal power and equivalence ratio. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

However, an information-theoretic analysis presented here reveals that their information content is substantially different. A scaling relation exists between polarization and anisotropy, and normalization allows their direct comparison. Various measures of information such as the absolute, relative, differential, and potential entropies all appear larger for anisotropy over part or all of its normalized overlap with the polarization function. The larger information content coincides with the signal range where the emitted light is polarized mostly in the parallel direction. Polarization takes on larger absolute entropy only when the emission is about perpendicular to the incident light and when the differential entropy is considered over the entire physical domain. The additional information locally afforded by polarization appears to be related to its larger signal range whereas the extra information in anisotropy may be attributed to a second perpendicular emission plane in its definition, which is oriented along the axis of propagation of light and takes the contribution of all degrees of rotational freedom into account. Thus anisotropy may be considered as a more accurate and more informative representation of the underlying physical phenomena. Some practical aspects relevant to studies of protein-ligand interactions are also discussed.","Anisotropy; Entropy; Fluorescence; Information; Polarization; Spectroscopy","Fluorescence polarization; Information; Information content; Anisotropy; Entropy; Information theory; Light emission; Light polarization; Fluorescence; ligand; protein; anisotropy; article; chemistry; entropy; fluorescence polarization; metabolism; spectrofluorometry; Anisotropy; Entropy; Fluorescence Polarization; Ligands; Proteins; Spectrometry, Fluorescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745930559

Increased soil N2O emissions, depressed CH4 uptake and depressed soil respiration CO2 loss is considered a likely response to increased N deposition. This study examined fluxes of N2O, CH 4 and CO2 over two growing seasons from soils in unmanaged forest and grassland communities on abandoned agricultural areas in Michigan. All sites were subject to simulated increased N-deposition in the range of 1-3 g N m-2 annually. Nitrous oxide fluxes and soil N concentrations in coniferous and grassland sites were on the whole unaffected by the increased N-inputs. It is noteworthy though that N2O emissions increased three-fold in the coniferous sites in the first growing season in response to the low N treatment, although the response was barely significant (p&lt;0.06). In deciduous forests, we observed increased levels of soil mineral N during the second year of N fertilization, however N2O fluxes did not increase. Rates of methane oxidation were similar in all sites with no affect of field N application. Likewise, we did not observe any changes in soil CO2 efflux in response to N additions. The combination of tillage history and vegetation type was important for the trace gas fluxes, i.e. soil CO2 efflux was greater in successional grassland sites compared with the forested sites and CH4 uptake was reduced in post-tillage coniferous- and successional sites compared with the old-growth deciduous site. Our results indicate that short-term increased N availability influenced individual processes linked to trace gas turnover in the soil independently from the ecosystem N status. However, changes in whole system fluxes were not evident and were very likely mediated by competitive N uptake processes. © Springer 2006.","Carbon dioxide; Forest; Grassland; Greenhouse gas; Methane; N-deposition; Nitrous oxide; Successional Community; Trace gas","agricultural land; atmospheric deposition; carbon dioxide; forest ecosystem; grassland; methane; nitrous oxide; soil nitrogen; Michigan; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745889607

We measured soil C accumulation, aggregation, soil water, N2O emissions, soil inorganic N, and crop yields in till and no-till corn-soybean-wheat rotations between 1989 and 2002 in southwestern Michigan and investigated whether tillage effects varied over time or by crop. Mean annual NO3- concentrations in no-till were significantly less than in conventional till in three of six corn years and during one year of wheat production. Yields were similar in each system for all 14 years but three, during which yields were higher in no-till, indicating that lower soil NO3- concentrations did not result in lower yields. Carbon accumulated in no-till soils at a rate of 26 g C m-2 yr-1 over 12 years at the 0- to 5-cm soil depth. Average nitrous oxide emissions were similar in till (3.27 ± 0.52 g N ha d-1) and no-till (3.63 ± 0.53 g N ha d-1) systems and were sufficient to offset 56 to 61% of the reduction in CO2 equivalents associated with no-till C sequestration. After controlling for rotation and environmental effects by normalizing treatment differences between till and no-till systems we found no significant trends in soil N, N2O emissions, or yields through time. In our sandy loam soils, no-till cropping enhances C storage, aggregation, and associated environmental processes with no significant ecological or yield tradeoffs. © ASA, CSSA, SSSA.",,"Nitrous oxide emissions; Sandy loam soils; Treatment differences; Wheat production; Crops; Ecology; Sand; Soils; Nitrogen oxides; carbon dioxide; nitrate; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; soil water; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; conference paper; corn; cropping system; harvest; loam soil; nitrous oxide emission; no tillage; soil aggregation; soil depth; soil pollution; soybean; tillage; United States; wheat; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Crops, Agricultural; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Michigan; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Time Factors; Ecology; Farm Crops; Nitrogen Oxides; Sand; Soil; Glycine max; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745864123

They constituted an operon, which is involved in fructose metabolism of this strain by channeling intracellular fructose into the phosphoketolase pathway. A third open reading frame, unkR, upstream of the operon was identified as homologous to genes of LacI/GalR family repressors. The UnkR repressor's role in transcriptional control of the fruIK operon could, however, not be established by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis. Sequence analysis revealed two putative catabolite responsive elements (cre) in the promoter region of fruIK suggesting that the fruIK operon is under negative regulatory control by carbon catabolite repression. Expression and enzyme activity data were compatible with the assumption that the fruIK operon is represessed by glucose.

Our observations show that 24 of the X-ray sources have radio candidates within the INTEGRAL error circle.

METHODS: An 18-month longitudinal survey of infestation of Ae. aegypti immature stages was conducted for the 1015 residences (premises) of Vila Planalto, an area of Brasilia where the Breteau Index was about 40 before the study. This area was divided into five zones: a control zone with environmental management alone and four zones with insecticide treatment (methoprene, Bti, temephos). We tested for significant differences between infestation levels in the control and insecticide-treated areas, for relationships between climatic variables and larval indices, and to determine risk factors of infestation for certain types of premises and containers. RESULTS: Environmental vector control strategies dramatically decreased infestation in the five areas. No significant differences could be detected between control strategies with insecticide and without. Some premises and container types were particularly suitable for breeding. The influence of climate on the emergence of Ae. aegypti adults for the area is described. CONCLUSION: In a moderately infested area such as Brasilia, insecticides do not improve environmental vector control. Rather, infestations could be further reduced by focusing on residences and containers particularly at risk. The nature of the link between climate and larval population should be investigated in larger-scale studies before being used in forecasting models. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Aedes aegypti; Breeding sites; Larval stegomyia indices; Longitudinal survey; Management strategies; Pupae","insecticide; methoprene; temefos; breeding site; climate effect; developmental stage; insecticide; management practice; mosquito; Aedes aegypti; article; Brazil; breeding; climate; dengue; disease carrier; disease transmission; environmental factor; epidemic; infection control; infection risk; infestation; larva; longitudinal study; nonhuman; risk factor; tropical disease; waste water; water supply; yellow fever; Aedes; Animals; Brazil; Climate; Dengue; Environment; Health Surveys; Humans; Insect Vectors; Insecticides; Larva; Longitudinal Studies; Risk Factors; Seasons; Water Supply; Yellow Fever; Brasilia; Brazil; Federal District [Brazil]; South America; Aedes aegypti",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745746832

Sampling was carried out during seasonal cruises (summer and autumn 2003 and winter and spring 2004) in 12 stations located in transects off the coast of Malaga (southern Spain). This work reports for the first time seasonal variations of the Arrhenius activation energy (Ea) as well as being the first study to address CO2 balance in the NW Alboran Sea. These variations were related to changes in the phytoplankton community assemblage, which could ultimately be caused by the seasonal variability of hydrological conditions. ETS activity was significantly higher in summer, coinciding with a higher chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration and relatively high levels of particulate organic matter. The ETS:Chl atotal ratios were low during the four seasons, suggesting a high contribution of autotrophic phytoplankton to the respiratory activity of planktonic community. Respiratory CO2 production (RCP) calculated from ETS activity ranged from 4.6 to 28.1 mg C m-3 day-1 during the four cruises. Chl a-specific RCP was lower than the maximum photosynthetic rates reported in the literature for the studied area, suggesting that primary production (PP) and respiration in the water column might be unbalanced. © The Author 2006.

Here, we document the patterns of plant species richness for different taxonomic groups in China's nature reserves, and discuss their possible explanations at national and regional scales, using vascular plant richness data coupled with information on climate and topographical variables. We found that water deficit, energy and elevation range (a surrogate of habitat heterogeneity) represent the primary explanations for variation in plant species richness of the nature reserves across China. There are consistent relationships between species richness and climate and habitat heterogeneity for different taxonomic vascular plant groups at the national scale. Habitat heterogeneity is strongly associated with plant richness in all regions, whereas climatic constraints to plant diversity vary regionally. In the regions where energy is abundant or water is scarce, plant richness patterns were determined by water and habitat heterogeneity, whereas in the region with low energy inputs, water interacting with energy, and habitat heterogeneity determined its species richness pattern. Our results also suggest that energy variables alone do not represent the primary predictor of plant richness. © 2006 The Authors Journal compilation.","China; Energy; Habitat heterogeneity; Nature reserves; Plant richness; Taxonomic groups; Vegetation region; Water","biodiversity; climate conditions; Earth; energy budget; habitat type; heterogeneity; nature reserve; species richness; taxonomy; vascular plant; water demand; water stress; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745684925

This finding is derived from measurements in purified biogenic opal that can be separated from detrital materials using a newly developed technique based on surface charge characteristics. Initial results from a sediment core taken near the present-day position of the Antarctic Polar Front (ODP Site 1093) show dramatic changes in the intrinsic concentrations of, Be, Al, Ti, Fe, Mn and Zn in the opal assemblages during the past ∼140 kyr BP. The results imply appreciable climatically controlled fluctuations in the level of bioreactive trace elements. The time series of total Be, Al, Ti, Fe and 10Be in the sediment core are all well correlated with each other and with dust records in the polar ice cores. The observations suggest that a significant flux of these trace metals to oceans is contributed by the aeolian dust, in this case, presumably from the Patagonia. This observation also allows determination of fluxes of dust-contributed 10Be to the Antarctica ice sheets. However, our data show that the relationships among the various metals are not perfectly linear. During periods of higher dissolved concentrations of trace elements (indicated by Fe and Ti) the relative concentrations of bioreactive elements, Be, Al, Mn and Zn are decreased. By contrast, the Fe/Zn and Fe/Mn ratios decrease significantly during each transition from cold to warm periods. The relative behavior could be consistent with any of the following processes: (i) enhanced biological productivity due to greater supply of the bioreactive elements (e.g. Zn) during cold periods (ii) increased biological and inorganic scavenging of particle active elements (e.g. Be and Al) during early interglacial periods (iii) differential uptake/removal of the metals by the various diatom taxa whose relative productivity or growth rate changes with large scale climate. In any case, with one sedimentary phase and in single sedimentary sections, we now have the potential to compare directly a proxy for aeolian input of micronutrients (e.g. Fe or Ti), with a proxy for production (e.g. 26Al/Al ratios). We expect that studies of the temporal records of trace elements and cosmogenic nuclides in contrasting regions of upwelling and productivity, which exhibit different sensitivities to global climate fluctuations and micronutrient inputs, would lead to a direct and comprehensive test of ideas such as the hypothesis of iron control of atmospheric carbon dioxide [Martin, J.H., 1990. Glacial-interglacial CO2 change: the iron hypothesis. Paleoceanography 5, 1-13]. Our present data from a single site do not show that increases in dissolved Fe concentrations, per se, were responsible for increased biological productivity. However, a much clearer picture of the effect of increased dust fluxes should emerge when we have data for trace elements and the cosmogenic nuclides, 10Be and 26Al from various oceanic provinces. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesized that (1) the shifting of species and life forms across the humidity gradient is related to a shifting in traits of green and senesced leaves with some overlapping among life forms, and (2) leaf traits associated with litter decomposition are related to the potential dynamics of soil-N across the humidity gradient. LMA in green leaves and P-resorption efficiency decreased with humidity while concentrations of lignin and total phenolics in green and senesced leaves and P concentration in senesced leaves increased with humidity. Soil C and N concentrations were positively correlated to humidity. Increasing soil N concentration was related to increasing rates of absolute (per unit soil mass) potential net N-mineralization and microbial-N flush. Relative (per unit N mass) potential net N-mineralization and microbial-N flush decreased with soil N and were inversely correlated to lignin concentration and C/N ratio in senesced leaves. We found overlapping in N concentration and C/N ratio in green and senesced leaves, P concentration in green leaves, and N resorption among species and life forms across the humidity gradient. We concluded that (1) leaf traits related to carbon fixation and the decomposition pathway significantly varied with humidity and were not overlapped between plant life forms from dry and humid habitats, (2) the largest overlapping among species and plant life forms across the gradient occurred in those leaf traits related to N conservation in the plant, and (3) life forms from humid habitats produce more recalcitrant litter that induce lower rates of relative potential net N mineralization (per unit N) than those of dry habitats. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Climatic gradient; Leaf mass per area; N mineralization; Nutrient resorption; Steppe and forest species","nitrogen; carbon fixation; leaf area; mineralization; nitrogen cycle; soil microorganism; soil nitrogen; Argentina; article; ecosystem; humidity; physiology; plant leaf; soil; Argentina; Ecosystem; Humidity; Nitrogen; Plant Leaves; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745332669

The level of possible reductions depends upon the extent to which firewood off-sets the use of fossil fuels, the efficiency with which wood is burnt, and use of fossil fuels for collection and transport of firewood. Plantations grown for firewood also have a cost of emissions associated with their establishment. Applying the FullCAM model and additional calculations, these factors were examined for various management scenarios under three contrasting firewood production systems (native woodland, sustainably managed native forest, and newly established plantations) in low-medium rainfall (600-800 mm) regions of south-eastern Australia. Estimates of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of heat energy produced for all scenarios were lower than for non-renewable energy sources (which generally emit about 0.3-1.0 kg CO2 kWh-1). Amongst the scenarios, emissions were greatest when wood was periodically collected from dead wood in woodlands (0.11 kg CO2 kWh-1), and was much lower when obtained from harvest residues and dead wood in native forests (&lt;0.03 kg CO2 kWh-1). When wood was obtained from plantations established on previously cleared agricultural land, use of firewood led to carbon sequestration equivalent to -0.06 kg CO2 kWh-1 for firewood obtained from a coppiced plantation, and -0.17 kg CO2 kWh-1 for firewood collected from thinnings, slash and other residue in a plantation grown for sawlog production. An uncertainty analysis, where inputs and assumptions were varied in relation to a plausible range of management practices, identified the most important influencing factors and an expected range in predicted net amount of CO2 emitted per unit of heat energy produced from burning firewood.

In this work, 26 publications were surveyed that report on the occurrence of natural root-colonizing AM fungi identified using rDNA region sequences. A total of 52 host plant species were investigated. Sixteen publications provided data enabling a comparison to be made of AM fungal taxon richness and community composition across 36 host plant species and 25 locations. Ninety-five fungal taxa (small subunit rRNA gene sequence types) were involved, 49 of which were recorded from at least two study sites, and 65 from more than one host plant species. 2 The number of AM fungal taxa per host plant species differed between habitat types: a significantly higher richness was found in tropical forests (18.2 fungal taxa per plant species), followed by grasslands (8.3), temperate forests (5.6) and habitats under anthropogenic influence (arable fields and polluted sites, 5.2). 3 AM fungal communities exhibit differing compositions in broadly defined habitat types: tropical forests, temperate forests and habitats under anthropogenic influence. Grassland locations around the world host heterogeneous AM fungal communities. 4 A number of AM fungi had a global distribution, including sequence types related to the Glomus intraradices/fasciculatum group, G. mosseae, G. sp. UY1225 and G. hoi, as well as the Glomus and Scutellospora types of unknown taxonomic affiliation. Widespread taxa occur in both natural and anthropogenic (disturbed) habitats, and may show high local abundance. However, about 50% of taxa have been recorded from only a single site. 5 The current global analysis of AM fungal communities suggests that soil micro-organisms may exhibit different distribution patterns, resulting in a high variability of taxon richness and composition between particular ecosystems. © 2006 British Ecological Society.","Distribution; Diversity; Geographical range; Habitat; rDNA; Soil communities; Soil fungi","carbon cycle; grassland; habitat type; host plant; mycorrhiza; root colonization; soil microorganism; symbiont; taxonomy; temperate forest; terrestrial ecosystem; Arbuscular; Fungi; Glomus; Glomus hoi; Glomus mosseae; Scutellospora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745263287

The aim was to find how much greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions various kinds of wood energy cause (not only CO2, but also CH4 and N2O), which energy they substitute, their potential to reduce GHG emissions, and the major sources of uncertainty. The method was life cycle assessment. Six types of wood energy were studied: fuel wood, sawdust, pellets, briquettes, demolition wood, and bark. GHG emissions over the life cycle of the wood energy types in this study are 2-19% of the emissions from a comparable source of energy. The lowest figure is for demolition wood substituting oil in large combustion facilities, the highest for fuel wood used in dwellings to substitute electricity produced by coal-based power plants. Avoided GHG emissions per m3 wood used for energy were from 0.210 to 0.640 tonne CO2-equivalents. Related to GWh energy produced, avoided GHG emissions were from 250 to 360 tonne CO2-equivalents. Avoided GHG emissions per tonne CO2 in the wood are 0.28-0.70 tonne CO2-equivalents. The most important factors were technology used for combustion, which energy that is substituted, densities, and heating values. Inputs concerning harvest, transport, and production of the wood energy are not important. Overall, taking the uncertainties into account there is not much difference in avoided GHG emissions for the different kinds of wood energy. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Further, it is generally believed that treatment of CO poisoning is more effective when performed as soon as possible after the exposure. This suggests that a hospital's inability to measure blood COHb could lead to delayed or missed diagnosis or treatment. This study evaluated the ability of hospitals in the Pacific Northwest to measure COHb levels. The clinical laboratory of every acute care hospital in Washington, Idaho, Montana, and Alaska was surveyed regarding the ability to measure COHb levels, the method utilized and the time required. If they could not measure COHb, they were asked whether samples are sent elsewhere, the location of the referral laboratory, and time required. Results were then compared to the list of hospitals referring CO-poisoned patients to a regional center for hyperbaric oxygen therapy from 2003-2004. In the four states, only 44% of acute care hospitals have the capability to measure COHb. The remaining 56% send blood samples to other laboratories. The average time to get a result is 10 ± 10 min in hospitals with co-oximetry and 904 ± 1360 min in those without, a difference of 15 h (p < 0.0001). When samples are sent out, the average distance is 121 miles, often bypassing a hospital with CO-oximetry capability. Over 90% of CO-poisoned patients referred for hyperbaric treatment came from hospitals able to measure COHb. Fewer than one-half of acute care hospitals in a four-state region have the capability to measure COHb levels. This has the potential to significantly impact diagnosis or treatment of patients with acute CO poisoning. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

A1B 3X5, Canada","The abundance of gold and selected trace elements in magmatic sulfide and rock-forming minerals from Silurian-Devonian granitoids in southwestern New Brunswick were quantitatively analyzed by laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry. Gold is mainly hosted in sulfide minerals (i.e., chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, and pyrite), in some cases perhaps as submicron inclusions (nanonuggets). Gold is below detection (&lt;0.02 ppm) in major rock-forming minerals (i.e., plagioclase, K-feldspar, biotite, hornblende, and muscovite) and oxides (i.e., magnetite, and ilmenite). Gold distribution coefficients between sulfide and granitoid melt are calculated empirically as: DAucpy/melt = 948 ± 269, DAupo/melt = 150 ± 83, and DAupy/melt = 362 ± 96. This result suggests that gold behavior in the granitoid systems is controlled by the conditions of sulfur saturation during magmatic evolution; the threshold of physiochemical conditions for sulfur saturation in the melts is a key factor affecting gold activity. Gold behaves incompatibly prior to the formation of sulfide liquids or minerals, but it becomes compatible at their appearance. Gold would be enriched in sulfur-undersaturated granitoid magmas during fractionation, partitioning into evolved magmatic fluids and favoring the formation of intrusion-related gold deposits. However, gold becomes depleted in residual melts if these melts become sulfur-saturated during differentiation, leading to gold precipitation in the early sulfide phases of a granitoid suite. Late-stage Cl-bearing magmatic-hydrothermal fluids with low pH and relatively high oxidation state derived from either progressively cooling magmas at depth or convective circulation of meteoric water buffered by reduced carbon-bearing sediments, may scavenge gold from early sulfide minerals. If a significant amount of gold produced in this manner is concentrated in a suitable geological environment (e.g., shear zones or fracture systems), intrusion-related gold deposits may also be generated. Exploration for intrusion-related gold systems should focus on the areas around evolved phases of granitoid suites that remained sulfur-undersaturated. For sulfur-saturated granitoid suites, the less differentiated phase and associated structures are the most prospective targets. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","Appalachians; Gold abundance; Gold partitioning; Granitoids; Intrusion-related gold systems; LA-ICPMS; New Brunswick; Sulfide minerals","chemical composition; gold; granitoid; igneous intrusion; laser method; mass spectrometry; partitioning; pH; sulfide; trace element; Canada; New Brunswick; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745197299

The proposed reduction in emissions of nitrogenous pollutants in Europe under the Gothenburg Protocol raises the question of whether affected ecosystems have the potential to recover to their previous condition and, if so, over what timescale. Since 1998, we have monitored the response of a lowland heathland in southern England following the cessation of a long-term nitrogen addition experiment, and subsequent management, assessing changes in vegetation growth and chemistry, soil chemistry and the soil microbial community. Persistent effects of earlier nutrient loading on Calluna growth and phenology, and on the abundance of lichens, were apparent up to 8 years after nitrogen additions ceased, indicating the potential for long-term effects of modest nutrient loading (up to 15.4 kg N ha-1 yr-1, over 7 years) on heathland ecosystems. The size and activity of the soil microbial community was elevated in former N-treated plots, 6-8 years after additions ceased, suggesting a prolonged effect on the rate of nutrient cycling. Although habitat management in 1998 reduced nitrogen stores in plant biomass, effects on belowground nitrogen stores were small. Although some parameters (e.g. soil pH) recover pretreatment levels relatively rapidly, others (e.g. vegetation cover and microbial activity) respond much more slowly, indicating that the ecological effects of even small increases in nitrogen deposition will persist for many years after deposition inputs are reduced. Indeed, calculations suggest that the additional soil nitrogen storage associated with 7 years of experimental nitrogen inputs could sustain the observed effects on plant growth and phenology for several decades. Carry over effects on plant phenology and sensitivity to drought suggest that the persistence of vegetation responses to nitrogen deposition should be integrated into long-term assessments of the impact of global climate change on sensitive ecosystems. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Calluna; Dwarf shrub community; Eutrophication; Gothenburg Protocol; Lichen cover; Lowland heathland; Microbial activity","biomass; climate change; climate effect; deposition; ecosystem dynamics; environmental assessment; environmental change; eutrophication; global change; heathland; nitrogen cycle; vegetation cover; England; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Calluna",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745183318

Analyses were performed using the NIOSH thermal-optical transmittance (TOT) protocol. Five-minute black carbon (BC) concentrations were also measured simultaneously using an aethalometer to compare with the thermal and optical EC measurements obtained from a Sunset Lab carbon analyzer. Close inspection of 1-h time-resolved OC and EC measurements reveals many carbon transients, which were mostly attributed to local traffic emissions. In this study, only three distinct carbon pollution episodes are discussed. The first episode was characterized by smoke plumes from forest fires that occurred in southeastern China, which resulted in enhanced OC concentrations. The second episode was strongly associated with regional haze over northeastern China and local stagnation conditions, which lead to highly elevated OC and EC levels throughout the episode. The third episode occurred at the weekend (Saturday and Sunday) was related to broad OC peak and the highest short-term OC excursion over the entire study period. Back trajectory analysis and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) satellite image data were used to characterize potential source regions for the developed episodes and the transport pathways of the air masses. The measured EC concentrations for the three episodes were strongly associated with the optical EC (R2 = 0.90 - 0.98) and BC concentrations (R2 = 0.93 - 0.95). The slopes from the relationship between EC and BC varied with the classification of the pollution episodes, ranging from 0.79 to 1.22, suggesting that the attenuation coefficient used for the determination of the BC particle concentrations could depend on the time, sampling location, emission sources of carbon particles, etc. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

They are commonly made of 316L stainless steel or Nitinol, two alloys containing nickel, an element classified as potentially toxic and carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Although they are largely implanted, the long-term safety of such metallic elements is still controversial, since the corrosion processes may lead to the release of several metallic ions, including nickel ions in diverse oxidation states. To avoid metallic ion release in the body, the strategy behind this work was to develop a process aiming the complete isolation of the stainless steel device from the body fluids by a thin, cohesive and strongly adherent coating of RF-plasma-polymerized fluoropolymer. Nevertheless, prior to the polymer film deposition, an essential aspect was the development of a pre-treatment for the metallic substrate, based on the electrochemical polishing process, aiming the removal of any fragile interlayer, including the native oxide layer and the carbon contaminated layer, in order to obtain a smooth, defect-free surface to optimize the adhesion of the plasma-deposited thin film. In this work, the optimized parameters for electropolishing, such as the duration and the temperature of the electrolysis, and the complementary acid dipping were presented and accurately discussed. Their effects on roughness as well as on the evolution of surface topography were investigated by Atomic Force Microscopy, stylus profilometry and Scanning Electron Microscopy. The modifications induced on the surface atomic concentrations were studied by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. The improvements in terms of the surface morphology after the pre-treatment were also emphasized, as well as the influence of the original stainless steel surface finish. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2006.",,"Biomedical equipment; Carcinogens; Coating techniques; Corrosion prevention; Electrochemistry; Metals; Nickel alloys; Plasma devices; Polymers; Biological lumen; Electrochemical polishing process; Metallic endovascular stent; RF-plasma-polymerized fluoropolymer; Stainless steel; acid; stainless steel; article; biopolishing; electrolysis; film; material coating; priority journal; process optimization; stent; surface property; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Coated Materials, Biocompatible; Electrochemistry; Electrolytes; Materials Testing; Microscopy, Atomic Force; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Prostheses and Implants; Stainless Steel; Stents; Surface Properties; X-Ray Diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745120500

Here, we examine several well-known ecogeographical rules, especially those pertaining to body size in contemporary, historical and fossil taxa. We review the evidence showing that rules of geographical variation in response to variation in the local environment can also apply to morphological changes through time in response to climate change. These rules hold at various time scales, ranging from contemporary to geological time scales. Patterns of body size variation in response to climate change at the individual species level may also be detected at the community level. The patterns underlying ecotypic variation are complex and highly context-dependent, reducing the 'predictive-power' of ecogeographical rules. This is especially true when considering the increasing impact of human activities on the environment. Nonetheless, ecogeographical rules may help interpret the likely influences of anthropogenic climate change on ecosystems. Global climate change has already influenced the body size of several contemporary species, and will likely have an even greater impact on animal communities in the future. For this reason, we highlight and emphasise the importance of museum specimens and the continued need for documenting the earth's biological diversity. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Bergmann's rule; Body size evolution; Climate change; Geographical variation; Time scale","body size; climate change; evolution; geographical variation; adaptation; animal; body size; climate; ecology; evolution; fossil; geography; review; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Body Size; Climate; Ecology; Evolution; Fossils; Geography; Animalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745104095

Prairie) lines were produced over-expressing a sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase-1 gene (SnRK1) under the control of a patatin (tuber-specific) promoter. SnRK1 activity in the tubers of three independent transgenic lines was increased by 55%-167% compared with that in the wild-type. Glucose levels were decreased, at 17%-56% of the levels of the wild-type, and the starch content showed an increase of 23%-30%. Sucrose and fructose levels in the tubers of the transgenic plants did not show a significant change. Northern analyses of genes encoding sucrose synthase and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, two key enzymes involved in the biosynthetic pathway from sucrose to starch, showed that the expression of both was increased in tubers of the transgenic lines compared with the wild-type. In contrast, the expression of genes encoding two other enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism, α-amylase and sucrose phosphate synthase, showed no change. The activity of sucrose synthase and ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase was also increased, by approximately 20%-60% and three- to five-fold, respectively, whereas the activity of hexokinase was unchanged. The results are consistent with a role for SnRK1 in regulating carbon flux through the storage pathway to starch biosynthesis. They emphasize the importance of SnRK1 in the regulation of carbohydrate metabolism and resource partitioning, and indicate a specific role for SnRK1 in the control of starch accumulation in potato tubers. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase; Carbohydrate metabolism; Glucose; Metabolite signalling; Protein kinase; SNF1; Solanum tuberosum; Starch; Sucrose synthase; Sugar sensing","amylase; carboxylesterase; fructose; glucose; glucose 1 phosphate adenylyltransferase; glucosyltransferase; hexokinase; patatin protein, Solanum tuberosum; protein kinase; starch; sucrose; sucrose phosphate synthase; sucrose synthase; sucrose-phosphate synthase; vegetable protein; article; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; potato; promoter region; transgenic plant; alpha-Amylase; alpha-Amylases; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases; Fructose; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Glucose; Glucose-1-Phosphate Adenylyltransferase; Glucosyltransferases; Hexokinase; Plant Proteins; Plants, Genetically Modified; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Kinases; Solanum tuberosum; Starch; Sucrose; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745087119

Biodiesel is one product of the chemical reaction of an alcohol with a vegetable oil or animal fat (the other product being glycerol). It is biodegradable and nontoxic, has low emission profiles and so is environmentally beneficial. A number of technical advantages of biodiesel fuel: (1) it prolongs engine life and reduces the need for maintenance (biodiesel has better lubricating qualities than fossil diesel), (2) it is safer to handle, being less toxic, more biodegradable, and having a higher flash point, and (3) it reduces some exhaust emissions (although it may, in some circumstances, raise others). The cost of biodiesel is higher than diesel fuel. Currently, there are seven producers of biodiesel in the United States. Pure biodiesel (100%) sells for about $1.50 to $2.00 per gallon before taxes. Fuel taxes will add approximately $0.50 per gallon.","Biodiesel; Economy; Environmental impacts; Fuel characteristics; Use of biodiesel","Alcohols; Biodegradation; Environmental impact; Exhaust gases; Oils and fats; Vegetable oils; Economy; Fuel characteristics; Use of biodiesel; Fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33744993867

Mineral dust emissions are simulated using a physical dust emission scheme over a region extending from 35.5°N to 47°N and from 73°E to 125°E. The input parameters required by the dust emission model are (1) surface features data including aerodynamic roughness length, soil dry size distribution and texture; and (2) meteorological surface data, mainly wind speed, soil moisture and snow cover. The way by which these surface features and meteorological data can be assessed is described and discussed. The influence of soil moisture and snow cover is taken into account and their effects on simulated dust emission are quantified. The simulations reproduce on a daily basis the location and intensity of the severe events of April 1998 and spring 2001 as recorded by the meteorological stations and/or described in various studies. Based on 6 yr of simulations, the main dust source regions are identified and their relative contributions to the total dust emissions are quantified. The seasonal cycle of the dust storms frequency is well reproduced with a maximum in spring. The simulations suggest that it is mainly controlled by the emissions occurring in the Taklimakan desert in latter spring and in summer, and by those occurring in the northern deserts of China in winter. The Taklimakan desert appears to be the most frequent and steady source of dust emissions during the studied period. On the other hand, in the Gobi desert, only a few dust emission events are simulated, but the dust amount emitted during each event is generally very large. In the northern deserts of China, dust emissions are frequent and their intensity is variable. These results show an important annual and inter-annual variability of the emitted dust (between 100 Mt yr- 1 and 460 Mt yr- 1), mainly controlled by the occurrence of severe events in the Gobi desert and in the northern deserts of China. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we document seasonal changes in basal MBO emission rates and test several models predicting these changes based on thermal history. These models represent extensions of the ISO G93 model that add a correction factor Cbasal, allowing MBO basal emission rates to change as a function of thermal history. These models also allow the calculation of a new emission parameter Estandard30, which represents the inherent capacity of a plant to produce MBO, independent of current or past environmental conditions. Most single-component models exhibited large departures in early and late season, and predicted day-to-day changes in basal emission rate with temporal offsets of up to 3 d relative to measured basal emission rates. Adding a second variable describing thermal history at a longer time scale improved early and late season model performance while retaining the day-to-day performance of the parent single-component model.

Over the western plain of Taiwan, where most of the 23 million inhabitants live, the concentration of ozone increased substantially during the last ten years (1994-2003). This increase is puzzling as the emissions of ozone precursors, oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) decreased significantly in the same period. An in-depth analysis focusing on ""total oxidant"" (estimated by O3+NO2) showed that its concentration remained essentially constant in Taipei, Taiwan, during that same ten year time period. Given that the regional tropospheric ozone is increasing, the constant oxidant level suggests that the oxidant production from photochemical reactions in Taipei should have been reduced to some extent, due to the reduction in emissions of ozone precursors. Consequently, the increasing trend in ozone was a result of the reduced titration by NO. These results are important to the formulation of ozone control strategies, especially for newly developed countries like Taiwan. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In the past medical waste was often mixed with municipal solid waste and disposed of in residential waste landfills or improper treatment facilities (e.g. inadequately controlled incinerators) in Korea. In recent years, many efforts have been made by environmental regulatory agencies and waste generators to better manage the waste from healthcare facilities. This paper presents an overview of the current management practices of medical waste in Korea. Information regarding generation, composition, segregation, transportation, and disposal of medical wastes is provided and discussed. Medical waste incineration is identified as the most preferred disposal method and will be the only available treatment option in late 2005. Faced with increased regulations over toxic air emissions (e.g. dioxins and furans), all existing small incineration facilities that do not have air pollution control devices will cease operation in the next few years. Large-scale medical waste incinerators would be responsible for the treatment of medical waste generated by most healthcare facilities in Korea. It is important to point out that there is a great potential to emit air toxic pollutants from such incinerators if improperly operated and managed, because medical waste typically contains a variety of plastic materials such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC). Waste minimization and recycling, control of toxic air emissions at medical waste incinerators, and alternative treatment methods to incineration are regarded to be the major challenges in the future. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Sewage sludge is the predominant sewage fertiliser product available today, but the use of sewage sludge in agriculture has been questioned as regards hazardous substances. In this respect, blackwater from separating systems seems to better fulfil agricultural requirements regarding fertiliser products. The objective of this paper was to analyse the environmental impact and resource use in a life cycle perspective for three systems, each including both wastewater handling and agricultural production. In the reference system, food waste disposers were installed in houses. Milled food waste and wastewater were treated in a wastewater treatment plant and the sewage sludge was used for producing a soil conditioner. In the sludge utilisation system, food waste from households was composted, wastewater was treated conventionally and sewage sludge was used in oat production. In the blackwater system, toilet water from low-flush toilets and milled organic waste were digested together and spread in growing oats. Data on the wastewater system were derived from simulations by the substance-flow model URWARE/ORWARE. The blackwater system required slightly more primary energy than the other two systems. In particular, construction of storage facilities contributed considerably to energy use. The emissions of greenhouse gases and SO2 were of the same magnitude for all three systems, while the eutrophying emissions were reduced significantly in the blackwater system. As regards NH3 and NOX, the emissions were highest for the blackwater system. High substitution of mineral fertiliser, optimal spreading technique and well-designed collection and storage facilities were important factors for the environmental outcome in the blackwater system. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

They comprise fuel cell stacks, fuel processors that generate hydrogen from natural gas, heat recovery equipment, and hot-water tanks. These systems do not require additional infrastructure and can influence consumer acceptance, however, there are limitations in terms of efficiency and flexibility. This paper proposes the implementation of a regional hydrogen energy interchange network among energy consumers for the interchange of energy comprising hydrogen, electricity, and heat (hot water) in residential areas. In order to achieve an efficient and flexible operation of the network, the fuel processors should be separated from the fuel cell stacks. In addition to the proposed concept, a concrete design of the system for a group of eight homes was presented. The effect of the system on CO2 mitigation and cost reduction for the homes was analyzed using a mathematical model. The outcomes of various cases where the number of fuel cells and fuel processors were varied with or without energy interchange were compared. The result of this analysis revealed that the proposed system contributes simultaneously to the improvement of both the objectives. © 2006 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","CO2 mitigation; Energy interchange; Energy network; Fuel cell; Residential","Carbon dioxide; Electricity; Hydrogen; Process control; Thermal effects; CO2 mitigation; Energy interchange; Energy network; Residential; Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33646097922

That is the reason why an experiment with different tillage systems and their influence on fuel consumption and CO2 emission was carried on six locations in Slavonia and Baranja, the most important agricultural regions in Croatia, within the period of 1996-2004. The compared tillage systems were the conventional tillage (CT), the conservation or reduced tillage (RT) and the no-tillage system (NT). The testing crops were four major arable crops in Croatia: maize (Zea mays L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), soybean (Glycine max L.) and barley (Hordeum sativum L.). Under the CT system and due to fuel consumption, the CO2 emissions for these crops were 167.72, 136.18, 162.86 and 132.36 kg ha-1, respectively. The use of the RT and the NT systems saved 35.3-42.9% and 87.8-88.1%, respectively, thus reducing part of the CO2 emission. Presuming the use of the CT system on arable land of Slavonia and Baranja will decrease from its 93.7% to the EU-15 soil tillage trend for 2015 (RT 40% and NT 5%), the total annual emission of CO2 could be reduced by 9312 Mg or 18.3%. The benefits of non-conventional tillage systems use could not only significantly contribute to environmental protection but could also improve economic results of farmers in Croatia. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The model incorporates a variety of potential NH3 abatement techniques. It also incorporates the first application of a spatial model of the diffusion of environmental impacts from NH3 emissions. This models N deposition at a nearby nature reserve. The model finds that the uniform rules proposed under the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive (IPPC) are likely to be ineffective in certain contexts and that a landscape-scale approach is more suitable for reducing N deposition from livestock production units in environmentally sensitive locations. However, the adjustments required are associated with large reductions in net margin. This reflects the limited range of cost-effective NH3 abatement techniques available. An alternative cost-effective abatement technique could be to maintain a spatial buffer between livestock production and sensitive receptors. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

It considers whether advantages for the environmental situation and energy carrier supply can be expected from the already visible future characteristics of hydrogen as a new secondary energy carrier. Possible production paths for hydrogen from hydrocarbon-based, renewable or carbon-reduced/-free primary energy carriers are evaluated with respect to primary energy use and CO2 emissions from the fuel cycle. Hydrogen has to be packaged by compression or liquefaction, transported by surface vehicles or pipelines, stored and transferred to the end user. Whether generated by electrolysis or by reforming, and even if produced locally at filling stations, the gaseous or liquid hydrogen has to undergo these market processes before it can be used by the customer. In order to provide an idea of possible markets with special emphasis on the German energy sector, a technical systems analysis of possible hydrogen applications is performed for the stationary, mobile and portable sector. Furthermore, different ""business as usual"" scenarios are analysed for Germany, Europe and the World concerning end energy use in different sectors. The very small assumed penetration of hydrogen in the analysed scenarios up to the year 2050 indicates that the hydrogen economy is a long-term option. With reference to the assumed supply paths and analysed application possibilities, hydrogen can be an option for clean energy use if hydrogen can be produced with carbon-reduced or -free primary energy carriers like renewable energy or biomass. However, the energetic use of hydrogen competes with the direct use of clean primary energy and/or with the use of electric energy based on renewable primary energy. As a substitution product for other secondary energy carriers hydrogen is therefore under pressure of costs and/or must have advantages in comparison to the use of traditional energy carriers. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Meanwhile, a 1 Mw plant from FCE is being used to generate electricity for Santa Rita Jail in Alameda County, CA, making it the greenest county facility in the US. According to David and Steven Gill, owners of Gills Onions, they have achieved tremendous efficiencies by using technology to streamline the process of cleaning, cutting, packaging, and selling fresh produce. The latter has focused his attention on boosting the firms energy reliability and efficiency while reducing energy costs by installing two 250 kw DFC units, which are expected to be operational in mid-2007. By using renewable biogas, generated by digesting onion peel and other fresh produce waste, Gills Onions will reduce its fuel and waste disposal costs, resulting in significant annual savings. Gills Onions will be able to depreciate the capital cost of the fuel cell on an accelerated 5-yr schedule, and take advantage of an Investment Tax Credit for the purchase of fuel cell power plants. The Santa Rita Jail project will provide 50% of the facilitys annual power needs, save county taxpayers more than $260 000/yr, and benefit the environment. The installation of the plant is Alameda Countys latest accomplishment in its Climate Change Leadership Strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The power from the new unit, i.e., a DFC 1500 fuel cell system, along with the jails previously installed 1.2 Mw solar power array and energy efficiency upgrades, will shrink its power purchases by as much as 80% during the peak-demand summer months, when California's electric utility grid can face capacity constraints. This lower demand will also eliminate > 3200 ton/yr of greenhouse gas emissions.",,,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030596832

The outcomes suggest that, with minimal changes in roof configuration, the residential rooftop potential in terms of percentage contributions of total domestic energy demands (except space conditioning) could increase from 73 to 82.5 per cent for a maximum utilization scenario. For a more realistic situation, taking account of available sizes and dimensions of solar equipment the energy contribution could be enhanced from 46 to 69 per cent.

Using the household sector as a case-study, it looks at the prospects of these ""options"" against the backdrop of the CDM, the financial incentives for investors in the form of CERs and the possibility of trading CERs in the international markets. The results of the study show that the total annual energy saving potential due to energy efficiency and fuel shifts by 2010-11 is expected to be about 1014 PJ, while the corresponding GHG reduction potential is close to 112 million tonnes of CO2 per year. Also, it is found that energy efficiency and renewable energy technology (EERT)-based programmes have positive net present values, and high rates of return for the households involved. Though the financial benefits alone should have made most of these programmes attractive they have failed to penetrate the household sector because of many barriers. Also, EERTs produce positive environmental externalities. It is proposed that small-scale entrepreneurs and ESCOs be made part of EERT implementation to overcome these barriers, and to ensure profits for them, it is necessary to include these projects under the CDM. This is because the current level of financial returns alone cannot ensure profitability for the stakeholders involved (households, entrepreneurs and ESCOs). This paper presents a few CDM business cases (for both rural and urban households) and demonstrates their feasibility and profitability from the perspectives of all the stakeholders. The business cases include shifting from: (1) traditional to efficient firewood stoves for cooking, (2) traditional to efficient kerosene stoves for cooking, (3) electrical to solar water heaters for water-heating, and (iv) traditional to efficient lighting packages for lighting. The paper concludes that the possibility of earning profits is very high from these small-scale CDM project cases, the highest being in the case of shifting from traditional to efficient firewood stoves. Yet the potential for EERT is tantalizingly difficult to tap in climate change mitigation projects in the household sector. Two factors appear to lie behind this difficulty. Firstly, EERT projects in the household sector tend to be small and dispersed. This can raise transaction costs. Second, while the EERT projects are usually profitable on the basis of energy savings alone, they may have relatively high costs per tonne of carbon when the benefits of energy savings are not taken into account. In general, carbon investors look for simple deals with straightforward revenue streams and hence avoid dispersed EERT projects. However, if implemented effectively, the CDM can be expected to transform the environmental issues from unwanted externality into an attractive business opportunity. © 2006 International Energy Initiative, Inc.",,"Commerce; Economics; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Finance; Greenhouse gases; Heating; International trade; Lighting; Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Annual energy savings; Business opportunities; Climate change mitigation; Environmental issues; Financial benefits; Financial incentives; International markets; Renewable energy technologies; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65549104267

The ventilation efficiencies were also analyzed locally and regionally in the greenhouses. It is critical to set up identical primary climate conditions in order to analyze the ventilation efficiencies of greenhouses with different configurations. However, it is impossible to control these factors in field experiments which requires a lot of measuring equipment and labor. As one solution a CFD simulation which is able to visualize the air flows quantitatively and qualitatively was used in this study. The accuracy of the CFD model used had previously been shown to be ±6.7%. The tracer gas decay method was used to analyze the ventilation efficiencies quantitatively to overcome the limitations of traditional ventilation measurements, and it was connected to the CFD model using UDF (User defined function) tools. When the boundary layers of wind velocity and turbulent intensity were used as the inlet boundary condition of the CFD, the ventilation rates were 1.26, 1.08, 1.01 and 0.73 min-1, respectively for widespan, 1-2W, singlespan and Venlo type greenhouses. For these cases, the wind direction was perpendicular to the sidevent of the greenhouse with a speed of 2m s-1 at a 10 m height. The average ventilation rates with the wind parallel to the sidevents were 36%, 57%, 37% and 79%, respectively lower than with the wind perpendicular to the sidevents, and 50%, 95%, 52% and 91% with the wind 45 degrees to the sidevent. The results showed that the 1-2W and Venlo types are less influenced by wind direction. It was also indicated that the CFD can be a very effective and powerful tool for studying greenhouse ventilation.","Computational fluid dynamics; Greenhouse; Natural ventilation; Tracer gas decay; Ventilation efficiency",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37849186731

Today the grower can only react and intervene when symptoms become visible but in most cases with already irrecoverable damage. The challenge is to monitor the plant's physiological status in a continuous way to anticipate unfavourable environmental conditions more rapidly. The objective of the reported research was to develop real-time mathematical algorithms to monitor plant stress as a basis for an on-line early-warning system. Truss tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. 'Clothilde') were cultivated inside two greenhouse compartments. During the growing season several severe and moderate stress conditions such as an increased and decreased indoor temperature were applied alternately in between the two compartments. In total 17 stress experiments were executed, duplicated over two compartments. The stress intensity was function of the outdoor climate and the duration of the applied stressor such that the achieved minimal indoor temperature ranged from 12.8°C to 16°C for the cold shock and the maximal indoor temperature ranged from 27.6°C to 36.7°C for the heat shock. Climate and plant variables were sampled every 20 seconds. Leaf temperature was measured as a plant response and was on-line modelled as function of climate variables with a black-box model approach. The plant health status was evaluated by the calculated steady state gain of the black box model. Depending on stress intensity and health status of the plant in combination with the environmental conditions changes in plant status could be detected, some minutes after stress situations were applied. Visible damage occurred hours later after the stress conditions were applied.","Black box; Crop monitoring; Early warning; Lycopersicon esculentum; Phytomonitoring; Speaking plant","Lycopersicon esculentum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37849185234

Culture-based and culture-independent microbiological methods were used to determine if mixed plant treatments stimulate different microbial communities and catabolic genotypes in comparison to individual plant species that comprise the mix. DGGE analysis of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA genes revealed that alfalfa (Medicago sativa) had a dominant effect on the structure of rhizosphere microbial communities in mixed plant treatments, stimulating relative increases in specific Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria populations. Alfalfa and mixes containing alfalfa, while supporting 100 times more culturable PAH degraders than other treatments, exhibited only 10% TPH reduction, less than all planted treatments except perennial rye grass (Lolium perenne).

The aim of our study was to evaluate isotopomer analysis of N2O (intramolecular distribution of 15N) as well as conventional nitrogen and oxygen isotope ratios (i) as a tool to identify N2O production processes in soils and (ii) to constrain the isotopic fingerprint of soil-derived N 2O. We conducted a microcosm study with arable loess soil fertilized with 20 mg N kg-1 of 15NO3--labeled or non-labeled ammonium nitrate. Soils were incubated for 16 d at varying moisture (55%, 75% and 85% water-filled pore space (WFPS)) in order to establish different levels of nitrification and denitrification. Dual isotope and isotopomer ratios of emitted N2O were determined by mass spectrometric analysis of δ18O, average δ15N (δ15Nbulk) and 15N site preference (SP = difference in δ15N between the central and peripheral N-positions of the asymmetric N2O molecule). Total rates and N 2O emission of denitrification and nitrification were determined by 15N analysis of headspace gases and soil extracts of the 15NO3- treatment. N2O emission and denitrification increased with moisture whereas gross nitrification was almost constant. In the 55% WFPS treatment, more than half of the N2O flux was derived from nitrification, whereas denitrification was the dominant N 2O source in the 75% WFPS and 85% WFPS treatments. Moisture conditions were reflected by the isotopic signatures since highly significant differences were observed for average δ15Nbulk, SP and δ18O. Experiment means of the 75% WFPS and 85% WFPS treatments gave negative δ15Nbulk (-18.0‰ and -34.8‰, respectively) and positive SP (8.6‰ and 15.3‰, respectively), which we explained by the fractionation during N2O production and partial reduction to N2. In the 55% WFPS treatment, mean SP was relatively low (1.9‰), which suggests that nitrification produced N2O with low or negative SP. The observed influence of process condition on isotopomer signatures suggests that the isotopomer approach might be suitable for identifying N2O source processes. However, more research is needed to determine the impact from process rates and microbial community structure. Isotopomer signatures were within the range reported from previous soil studies which supports the assumption that SP of soil-derived N2O is lower than SP of tropospheric N2O. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In this review, we selectively highlight current USDA-ARS research on switchgrass for biomass energy. Intensive research on switchgrass as a biomass feedstock in the 1990s greatly improved our understanding of the adaptation of switchgrass cultivars, production practices, and environmental benefits. Several constraints still remain in terms of economic production of switchgrass for biomass feedstock including reliable establishment practices to ensure productive stands in the seeding year, efficient use of fertilizers, and more efficient methods to convert lignocellulose to biofuels. Overcoming the biological constraints will require genetic enhancement, molecular biology, and plant breeding efforts to improve switchgrass cultivars. New genomic resources will aid in developing molecular markers, and should allow for marker-assisted selection of improved germplasm. Research is also needed on profitable management practices for switchgrass production appropriate to specific agro-ecoregions and breakthroughs in conversion methodology. Current higher costs of biofuels compared to fossil fuels may be offset by accurately valuing environmental benefits associated with perennial grasses such as reduced runoff and erosion and associated reduced losses of soil nutrients and organic matter, increased incorporation of soil carbon and reduced use of agricultural chemicals. Use of warm-season perennial grasses in bioenergy cropping systems may also mitigate increases in atmospheric CO2. A critical need is teams of scientists, extension staff, and producer-cooperators in key agro-ecoregions to develop profitable management practices for the production of biomass feedstocks appropriate to those agro-ecoregions.","Bioenergy; Biomass conversion technologies; Panicum virgatum L.; Stand establishment; Switchgrass improvement; USDA-ARS","agricultural ecosystem; biofuel; biomarker; biomass power; cost-benefit analysis; cropping practice; energy crop; environmental values; erosion control; germplasm; grass; management practice; plant breeding; soil conservation; North America; United States; Panicum virgatum; Poaceae",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248150476

As other developing countries with rising per capita GDPs are emerging as important greenhouse gas emitters, the experience of China holds important lessons. In order to mitigate the reality of climate change, developing countries need carefully to assess appropriate policy models for renewable energy development. This article contains an analysis of the Chinese policy path and impact on the speed and benefit of domestic wind turbine installations. It is found that policy-makers have faced a critical trade-off between ""fast-track"" cutbacks on fossil energy sources through wind power development and ""slow-track"" wind power installations through development of a local manufacturing industry. China's choice of the slow-track model has proved constructive with the largest potential for CO2 reductions. The article identifies China's ability to coordinate policies for supply and demand as an inevitable factor for the success of the model. The immediate value of this analysis is to the benefit of developing countries' future choice of policy model. Policy-makers in emerging economies that wish to develop renewable energy sources have to take into account the institutional, manufacturing and wind resource foundations of their respective countries. The article concludes that a majority of developing countries may have to look towards a fast-track policy model. However, the larger emerging economies with manufacturing capabilities and strong wind resource endowments could realize a greater part of the potential for emission reductions through the slow-track model of wind energy development. © 2006 International Energy Initiative, Inc.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Decision making; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Manufacture; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Wind power; Wind turbines; Carbon dioxide emissions; Climate change mitigation; Manufacturing capability; Manufacturing industries; Renewable energy development; Renewable energy source; Wind energy development; Wind power installations; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34147178514

Cells developed different strategies for the inactivation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and respectively reactive carbonyl species. To date the best-known enzymatic system implicated in the inactivation of carbonyl species is the glyoxalase system. It comprises two enzymes, glyoxalase I and II, which use glutathione for the conversion of acyclic α-oxoaldehydes into corresponding α-hydroxyacids. Using glutathione this enzymatic system underline the strong link between oxidative and carbonyl stress: augmentation of oxidative stress depletes glutathione leading to the accumulation of carbonylic compounds. These compounds are able to modificate all classes of biomolecules: protein glycation is associated with enzymatic inactivation, protein denaturation and cellular-mediated immune response, nucleotide glycation is associated with mutagenesis and apoptosis, and excessive lipid glycation with membrane lipid bilayer disruption. Inhibition of the glyoxalase system leads to the accumulation of toxic carbonyl species. This strategy is used for the design of different drugs with anti-tumor, anti-protozoal and anti-bacterial properties. The present paper will focus on the mechanistical aspects of the glyoxalase system, reviewing some of the therapeutical strategies used for its inhibition.","Carbonyl stress; Glyoxalase; Glyoxalase inhibitors; α-oxoaldehydes",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34047222003

Untreated pig slurry (IPS) with and without the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD), digested thin fraction of pig slurry (DTP), composted solid fraction of pig slurry (CP) and composted municipal solid waste (MSW) mixed with urea were applied at a rate of 175 kg available Nha-1, and emissions were compared with those from urea (U) and a control treatment without any added N fertilizer (Control). The cumulative denitrification losses correlated significantly with the soluble carbohydrates, dissolved N and total C added. Added dissolved organic C (DOC) and dissolved N affected the N2O/N2 ratio, and a lower ratio was observed for organic fertilizers than from urea or unfertilized controls. The proportion of N2O produced from nitrification was higher from urea than from organic fertilizers. Accumulated N2O losses during the crop season ranged from 3.69 to 7.31 kg N2O- Nha-1 for control and urea, respectively, whereas NO losses ranged from 0.005 to 0.24 kg NO-Nha-1, respectively. Digested thin fraction of pig slurry compared to IPS mitigated the total N2O emission by 48% and the denitrification rate by 33%, but did not influence NO emissions. Composted pig slurry compared to untreated pig slurry increased the N 2O emission by 40% and NO emission by 55%, but reduced the denitrification losses (34%). DCD partially inhibited nitrification rates and reduced N2O and NO emissions from pig slurry by at least 83% and 77%, respectively. MSW + U, with a C:N ratio higher than that of the composted pig slurry, produced the largest denitrification losses (33.3 kgNha-1), although N2O and NO emissions were lower than for the U and CP treatments.

Upward diffusion of methane from gas hydrate deep in the sedimentary strata might be another important source of carbon for sulfate reducing bacteria and subsequently induce higher rates of sulfate reduction in sediments. Since abundant gas may migrate upward to the surface as a result of tectonic activity occurring in the accretionary wedge, this study investigates the effect of methane migration on the sulfate reduction process in continental margin sediments offshore southwestern Taiwan. Piston and gravity core samples were taken in order to evaluate vertical and spatial variations of sulfate and methane. Pore water sulfate, sulfide, methane, sediment pyrite, and organic carbon were extracted and analyzed. Rapid sulfate reduction, high pyrite contents in sediments and higher concentrations of dissolved sulfide and methane were found in the study area with relatively low organic carbon concentrations. Up to 300 μmole g-1 of pyrite, 10 mM dissolved sulfide and 9 mM methane were found in the study region. Sulfate depletion was as shallow as ∼1 m beneath the sediment/water interface. At similar water depths, however, low methane and pyrite were found in some areas with almost no sulfate reduction. Sulfate flux in the study region is among the highest reported. Large spatial variations were a result of high methane flux, probably originating from gas hydrate deeper in sediments. Co-existence of rapid sulfate reduction and high methane concentrations in sediments indicated that methane is controlling sulfate reduction in the region. Downward diffusion of sulfate is linearly correlated with upward methane flux in the Good Weather Ridge region. Methane becomes an important source of carbon for the sulfate reducer and subsequently controlling sulfate reduction and pyrite formation.","Diffusion; Gas hydrate; Pyrite; South China Sea; Sulfate reduction","continental margin; diffusion; gas hydrate; hydrocarbon migration; marine sediment; methane; organic carbon; oxidation; pyrite; sulfate-reducing bacterium; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846916916

Dengue has become the most important endemic disease in Brazil. The Amazonian state of Roraima has one of the highest incidence rates of dengue in the country. The objective of this study was to determine whether significant temporal relationships exist between the number of reported dengue cases and short-term climate measures for the city of Boa Vista, the capital of Roraima. If such relationships exist, that suggests that it may be possible to predict dengue case numbers based on antecedent climate, thus helping develop a climatebased dengue early-warning system for Boa Vista. Methods. Seasonal Pearson product-moment correlations were developed between 3-week running averages of daily numbers of reported dengue cases for September 1998-December 2001 and certain meteorological variables (thermal, hydroclimatic, wind, atmospheric pressure, and humidity) up to 25 weeks before. Two-sample t tests were also applied to test for statistically significant differences between samples of daily dengue cases with above-average values and samples with below-average values for three-variable meteorological combinations. These multivariate combinations consisted of the three climate measures that together explained the greatest portion of the variance in the number of dengue cases for the particular season. Results. The strength of the individual averaged correlations varied from weak to moderate. The correlations differed according to the period of the year, the particular climatic variable, and the lag period between the climate indicator and the number of dengue cases. The seasonal correlations in our study showed far stronger relationships than had daily, full-year measures reported in previous studies. Two-sample t tests of multivariate meteorological combinations of atmospheric pressure, wind, and humidity values showed statistically significant differences in the number of reported dengue cases. Conclusions. Relationships between climate and dengue are best analyzed for short, relevant time periods. Climate-based multivariate temporal stochastic analyses have the potential to identify periods of elevated dengue incidence, and they should be integrated into local control programs for vector-transmitted diseases.","Aedes; Brazil; Climate; Dengue; Disease outbreaks; Forecasting; Models, biological; Weather","climate conditions; correlation; dengue fever; disease incidence; epidemiology; multivariate analysis; prediction; statistical analysis; temporal analysis; weather; Boa Vista; Brazil; Roraima; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846864908

These efforts targeted coal fires and included devolatalised coal, low-smoke stoves and electrification. All these efforts were more or less prescriptive in nature, technology driven and shared a common view of the role of technology. In this paper a different approach is described that had very good results. This approach starts at the coal user and their preferences and does not try to change their behaviour or attitude by means of education or coercive measures. This was done because after several years of involvement with coal and wood using communities, a good understanding was developed of the role of fire in the household and the context in which possible solutions must function. Also, the user of the technology is made a full partner in the problem solving process. This approach resulted in the adaptation of an alternative method to light a coal fire. The adapted method enjoys widespread acceptance and can reduce the contribution of coal fires to air pollution by 50%. Plans are under way by the South African Government to introduce communities nationwide to this method.","Air pollution; Devolatilised coal; Electrification; eMbalenhle air quality project; Low-smoke stoves low-smoke fuels","Coal combustion; Education; Energy conservation; Problem solving; Strategic planning; Technology transfer; Devolatilised coal; Electrification; EMbalenhle air quality projects; Low-smoke stoves low-smoke fuels; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846334850

Since USS and MSWC may contain organic contaminants, heavy metals or pathogens, this practice represents a potential problem to the environment. In the case of heavy metals both bioavailability and toxicity seems to be critically dependent on the chemical form of the element. In this work, a pot experiment was carried out with different levels of MSWC and USS, as well as an inorganic solution of Cu and Zn. The aim was to obtain information about their bioavailability, mobility and toxicity and correlation among the different soil extracted fractions (F1 - Exchangeable metal associated with carbonated phases, F2 - Reducible metal or associated with Fe and Mn oxides, F3 - Oxidizable metal bound to organic matter) with the Cu and Zn foliar (CuF and ZnF) and pseudo totals contents (CuPtotal and ZnPtotal), using the BCR sequential and aqua regia extraction procedure. Both of these methods were adequate to predict the Cu and Zn available to the plant, as high values on the CuF-Cu∑123, CuF-CuPtotal, ZnF-Zn∑123 and ZnF-ZnPtotal correlations were verified. Copper bounded mainly to F3, while Zn bounded to F1, F2 and F3 fractions and the regression analysis revelled that Cu and Zn ryegrass absorption were made mainly on F1 and F3 for Cu and F1 for Zn. © Selper Ltd, 2006.","Heavy metal bioavailability; Municipal solid waste compost; Ryegrass; Speciation; Urban sewage sludge","Biogeochemistry; Composting; Copper; Extraction; Heavy metals; Iron oxides; Municipal solid waste; Organic compounds; Regression analysis; Sewage sludge; Soils; Toxicity; Zinc; Aqua regia extraction; BCR sequential extraction; Metal bioavailability; Municipal solid waste compost; Organic contaminant; Ryegrass; Soil organic matters; Speciation; Fluorine compounds; copper; ferric oxide; manganese oxide; organic matter; zinc; Absorption; Copper; Extraction; Organic chemicals; Regression analysis; Soil conservation; Toxicity; Zinc; bioavailability; copper; municipal solid waste; sludge; soil organic matter; speciation (chemistry); zinc; article; controlled study; correlation analysis; intermethod comparison; municipal solid waste; perennial ryegrass; plant nutrient; prediction; regression analysis; sludge treatment; soil pollution control; soil treatment; solid waste management; Lolium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846182234

This study has found an unexpected benefit for this practice: it reduces particulate emission. Nine types of the popular incense on the local market were chosen for this study. The calcium content in raw material incense was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, followed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy. The correlation between the calcium content and emission characteristics of incense was investigated. The calcium content varied from 1.8 to 60 mg/g (incense burned) among those nine different types of incense. Very little calcium (&lt;1%) was found in natural wood or plants, which is mainly the raw material of incense. Instead, most calcium was artificially added in the form of CaCO3 during manufacturing. The combustion characteristics, including burning rate, emission factors of particulate, ash, and solid-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (SPAHs), varied significantly among the nine types of incense. Incense containing 2% calcium would emit 30% less S-PAHs, compared with those with little (&lt;0.2%) calcium.

The water-soluble elemental compositions of PM2.5 samples collected at four satellite monitoring sites in the surrounding region were also determined. Fe was the most abundant but least water soluble of the elements determined at the Steubenville site, having a mean ambient concentration of 272 µg/m3 and a median fractional solubility of 6%. Fe solubility and its correlations with SO42− and temperature varied significantly by season, consistent with the hypothesis that secondary sulfates may help to mobilize soluble Fe under suitable summertime photochemical conditions. Significantly higher ambient concentrations were observed at Steubenville than at each of the four satellite sites for 10 of the 18 elements (Al, As, Ca, Cd, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na, Pb, and Zn) determined in the water-soluble PM2.5 fraction. Concentrations of Fe, Mn, and Zn at Steubenville were substantially higher than concentrations reported recently for larger U.S. cities. Receptor modeling identified seven sources affecting the Steubenville site. An (NH4)2SO4-dominated source, likely representing secondary PM2.5 from coal-fired plants to the west and southwest of Steubenville, accounted for 42% of the PM2.5 mass, and two sources likely dominated by emissions from motor vehicles and from iron and steel facilities in the immediate Steubenville vicinity accounted for 20% and 10%, respectively. Other sources included an NH4NO3 source (15%), a crustal source (6%), a mixed nonferrous metals and industrial source (3%), and a primary coal combustion source (3%). Results suggest the importance of very different regional and local source mechanisms in contributing to PM2.5 mass at Steubenville and reinforce the need for further research to elucidate whether metals such as Fe, Mn, and Zn play a role in the PM2.5 health effects observed previously there. © 2006 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.",,"Mass spectrometry; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Photochemical reactions; Reaction kinetics; Solubility; Acid-digestible fractions; Satellite monitoring sites; Secondary sulfates; Water-solubility; Trace elements; aluminum; arsenic; cadmium; calcium; iron; lead; magnesium; manganese; sodium; trace element; zinc; air monitoring; article; exhaust gas; iron and steel industry; mass spectrometry; particulate matter; photochemistry; priority journal; temperature; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845963979

Ehrh. and shade-intolerant Prunus serotina, a J.F. Ehrh. and Betula papyrifera Marsh. Seedlings were exposed to a factorial combination of [CO2] (ambient and elevated (658 μmol mol-1)) and understory shade (deep and moderate) in open-top chambers placed in a forest understory. The elevated [CO2] treatment increased mean light-saturated net photosynthetic rate by 63% in the shade-tolerant species and 67% in the shade-intolerant species. However, when measured at the elevated [CO2], long-term enhancement of photosynthesis was 10% lower than the instantaneous enhancement seen in ambient-[CO2]-grown plants (P&lt;0.021). Overall, growth light environment affected long-term photosynthetic enhancement by elevated [CO2]: as the growth irradiance increased, proportional enhancement due to elevated [CO2] decreased from 97% for plants grown in deep shade to 47% for plants grown in moderate shade. Results suggest that in N-limited northern temperate forests, trees grown in deep shade may display greater photosynthetic gains from a CO2-enriched atmosphere than trees growing in more moderate shade, because of greater downregulation in the latter environment. If photosynthetic gains by deep-shade-grown plants in response to elevated [CO2] translate into improved growth and survival of shade-intolerant species, it could alter the future composition and dynamics of successional forest communities. © 2006 Heron Publishing.","Acer saccharum; Betula papyrifera; Deep shade; Downregulation; Fagus grandifolia; Nitrogen limitation; Photosynthetic enhancement; Prunus serotina","carbon dioxide; deciduous tree; growing season; growth rate; nitrogen; nutrient limitation; photosynthesis; seedling; shade tolerance; solar radiation; temperate forest; understory; Acer; Acer saccharum; Betula papyrifera; Fagus; Fagus grandifolia; Prunus; Prunus serotina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845867135

The changes have been attributed to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, of which carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main contributor. There is now increasing evidence that elevated CO2 will directly alter the structure of plant communities although this will depend on the availability of major nutrients, particularly nitrogen. Changes in plant phenology will also occur as a result of warming, resulting in changed patterns of development of vegetation and in particular longer growing seasons for plants. Climate plays a pivotal role in determining the geographic distribution of plant species and climate 'envelopes' describe the potential range of climatic conditions over which species and ecosystems occur. As the climate changes these climate envelopes will move and, based on available evidence, the predicted change in climate is expected to have significant effects on the distribution of species and ecosystems. Modelling of climate envelope movements show that some of the key Irish habitats, particularly peatlands, are likely to be vulnerable and may be eliminated by climatic change predicted during the rest of this century. © Royal Irish Academy.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845782460

The method has been collaboratively studied, and statistical results are here reported. Fourteen collaborators were sent 62 sample materials in a blind duplicate design. Materials represented a broad cross section of fertilizer types, including phosphate ore, manufactured phosphate products, N-P-K blends, organic fertilizers, and micro-nutrient materials. As much as possible within the limit of the number of samples, materials were selected from different regions of the United States and the world. Limit of detection (LOD) was determined using synthetic fertilizers consisting of reagent grade chemicals with near zero levels of the non-nutritive elements, analyzed blindly. Samples with high iron content caused the most variability between laboratories. Most samples reasonably above LOD gave HorRat values within the range 0.5 to 2.0, indicating acceptable method performance according to AOAC guidelines for analyses in the mg/kg range.

The silica leakage hypothesis predicts higher opal fluxes in the EEP and lower opal fluxes in the Southern Ocean during periods of low atmospheric CO2. These predictions are not borne by the sedimentary record during glacial oxygen isotope stage 2 (OIS 2, 13-27 kyrs B.P.). However, we find a prominent opal flux maximum in the EEP in the middle of OIS 3 (ca. 40-60 kyrs BP) coinciding with low opal fluxes in several cores from the subantarctic zone. This observation is consistent with silica leakage from the Southern Ocean to the equatorial upwelling region during OIS 3, when both low dust flux and extended sea ice could have contributed to limiting diatom productivity in the Southern Ocean.

Following up on some earlier work focusing upon general mortality and child-specific health effects, this article uses a larger data set, covering more than 90 Chinese cities, along with a set of China-based epidemiological functions, to estimate some of the adult health benefits of reducing urban air pollution. Projecting future air pollution based upon current conditions, it calculates the averted mortality and morbidity effects that would result from the cleanup of particulates, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide. The inclusion of nitrogen dioxide in our analysis is particularly important because it is a growing problem and has not been included in most of the more widely known studies that examine Chinese air pollution. Finally, the economic valuation of these pollution-related health effects is developed, using a number of recent, China-based valuation studies. © 2006 New York Academy of Sciences.","China; Economic valuation; Health effects; Urban air pollution","nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; air monitoring; air pollution; asthma; bronchitis; child health; conference paper; morbidity; mortality; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; socioeconomics; suspended particulate matter; urban area",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845643048

From February to July, net community production (NCP) controls the seasonal variations of DIC in the surface waters of the entire North Sea, with a net uptake ranging from 0.5 to 1.4 mol C m-2 month-1. During the August-December period, NCP controls the seasonal variations of DIC in the southern North Sea, with a net release ranging from 0.5 to 0.8 mol C m-2 month-1. Similarly, during the April-August period in the deeper layer of the northern North Sea, the NCP was the main factor controlling DIC concentrations, with a net release ranging from 0.5 to 5.5 mol C m-2 month-1. In the surface layer of the North Sea, NCP on the basis of DIC was 4.3 ± 0.4 mol C m-2 yr-1, whereas, NCP on the basis of nitrate was 1.6 ± 0.2 mol C m-2 yr-1.

The LULC was a primary driver of in-stream constituent concentrations and nutrient speciation owing to differences in dominant sources and input pathways associated with agricultural, urban, and forested land uses. Stream discharge was shown to be a major factor that dictated not only the magnitude of constituent concentrations, but also the chemical form. In high discharge agricultural subbasins, where nitrate was the dominant nitrogen form, there was a negative correlation between discharge and nitrate concentration indicating groundwater inputs as the dominant pathway. In urban settings, however, nitrate was positively correlated with discharge, and, in forested subwatersheds, where dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) was the dominant nitrogen form, there was a positive correlation between discharge and DON, indicating washoff from the watershed as the dominant input pathway. Similarly, phosphorus concentrations were strongly regulated by LULC, discharge, and seasonally. This comparative study highlights that different mechanisms regulate different forms of nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon, and thus field programs or water quality models used for regulatory purposes must assess these nutrient forms to accurately apply management plans for nutrient reductions.","Biogeochemistry; Climate; Hydrologic Simulation Program Fortran; Hydrology; Land use and land cover; Nitrogen; Non-point-source nutrients; Organic carbon; Phosphorus; Watersheds","Discharge (fluid mechanics); Hydrology; Land use; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Watersheds; Biogeochemistry; Hydrologic Simulation Program Fortran; Land cover; Non-point-source nutrients; Organic carbon; Water analysis; carbon; dissolved organic nitrogen; nitrogen; phosphorus; water; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Hydrology; Land use; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Water analysis; Watersheds; annual variation; coastal plain; dissolved organic nitrogen; land cover; land use; nitrogen; organic carbon; phosphorus; streamflow; watershed; agriculture; article; biogeochemistry; climate; correlation analysis; forest; hydrology; land use; nitrogen fixation; nutrient concentration; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; sediment transport; sedimentology; simulation; water quality; watershed management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33845416541

Both on-site emissions at the treatment facility due to the biological processes used and fossil fuels consumed for energy and heat and upstream emissions related to off-site production and transmission of fuels and the off-site production of electricity for the plant were included. For the year 2000, the on-site methane (CH4) emission rate from Canadian municipal wastewater treatment facilities was estimated at 1600 Mg/year. The total on-site emission rate of carbon dioxide (CO2) was estimated at 669 100 Mg/year, but the estimated total CO2 equivalent emissions rose to 1048 500 Mg/year once upstream emissions were included.

The environmental characterisation of combustion by-products (boiler slag, fly ash and FGD gypsum) were also established according to the Council Decision 2003/33/EC on waste disposal. To this end, water leaching tests (EN-12457-4) were performed, analysing the elements with environmental concern by means of the aforementioned techniques. According to the leaching behaviour of combustion by-products studied, these could be disposed of in landfills for non-hazardous wastes. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The addition of hydrogen to the HC-SCR reaction feed over Ag/Al2O3 results in a remarkable improvement in NOx conversion using a variety of different hydrocarbon feeds. There is some debate concerning the role that hydrogen has to play in the reaction mechanism and its effect on the form of Ag present during the reaction. Many of the studies use in situ UV-Vis spectroscopy to monitor the form of Ag in the catalyst and appear to indicate that the addition of hydrogen promotes the formation of small Ag clusters which are highly reactive for NOx conversion. However, some authors have expressed concern about the use of this technique for these materials and further work is required to address these issues before this technique can be used to give an accurate assessment of the state of Ag during the SCR reaction. A study using in situ EXAFS to probe the H2 assisted octane-SCR reaction has shown that small Ag particles (containing on average 3 silver atoms) are formed during the SCR reaction but that the addition of H2 to the feed does not result in any further change in the Ag particle size. This points to the direct involvement of H2 in the reaction mechanism. Clearly the addition of hydrogen results in a large increase in the number and variety of adsorbed species on the surface of the catalyst during the reaction. Some authors have suggested that conversion of cyanide to isocyanate is the rate-determining step and that hydrogen promotes this conversion. Others have suggested that hydrogen reduces nitrates to more reactive nitrite species which can then activate the hydrocarbon; activation of the hydrocarbon to form acetates has been proposed as the key step. It is probable that all these promotional effects can take place and that it very much depends on the reaction temperature and feed conditions as to which one is most important. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Ag/Al2O3; Decane; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen; Octane; Reaction mechanism; Review; SCR; Selective catalytic reduction of NOx",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750926290

For estimation of concentration of car exhaust pollutants, each car is treated as an instantaneous moving emission source. This approach enables us to model time and spatial changes of emission, especially during cold and cool start of an engine. These stages of engine work are a source of significant pollution concentration in urban areas. In this work, two models are proposed: one for the estimation of emission after cold start of the engine and another for the prediction of pollutant concentration. The first model (defined for individual exhaust gas pollutants) enables us to calculate the emission as a function of time after the cold or cool start, ambient temperature and average speed of motion. This model uses the HBEFA database. The second mathematical model is developed in order to calculate the pollutant dispersion and concentrations. The finite volume method is applied to discretise the set of partial differential equations describing wind flow and pollutant dispersion in the domain considered. Models presented in this paper can be called short-term models on a small spatial scale.

However, the WFD does not explicitly mention risks posed by climate change to the achievement of its environmental objectives. This is despite the fact that the time scale for the implementation process and achieving particular objectives extends into the 2020s, when climate models project changes in average temperature and precipitation. This paper begins by reviewing the latest UK climate change scenarios and the wider policy and science context of the WFD. We then examine the potential risks of climate change to key phases of the River Basin Management Process that underpin the WFD (such as characterisation of river basins and their water bodies, risk assessments to identify pressures and impacts, programmes of measures (POMs) options appraisal, monitoring and modelling, policy and management activities). Despite these risks the WFD could link new policy and participative mechanisms (being established for the River Basin Management Plans) to the emerging framework of national and regional climate change adaptation policy. The risks are identified with a view to informing policy opportunities, objective setting, adaptation strategies and the research agenda. Key knowledge gaps have already been identified during the implementation of the WFD, such as the links between hydromorphology and ecosystem status, but the overarching importance of linking climate change to these considerations needs to be highlighted. The next generation of (probabilistic) climate change scenarios will present new opportunities and challenges for risk analysis and policy-making. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show the importance of considering the influence of site-specific or level-specific conditions on the environmental effects of load management. On the national level, load management measures can hardly provide significant environmental benefits in Sweden, due to the high hydropower production, which is the demand following production source. Emission reductions will rather be the result of energy efficiency measures, which will lower the load demand as well as the energy demand.

DPs are unilateral GHG emissions reduction projects carried out in a country with a binding greenhouse gas emission reduction target under the Kyoto Protocol (Annex I Country). In contrast to the well known project-based mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol - the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI) - Domestic Offset Projects are located in the same country as the investor. Therefore tradable emission reduction certificates for DPs are issued by the investor's domestic authority. This paper presents possible implementation options for DPs based on JI and CDM experience, as well as possible implementation problems. Policy additionality seems to be an especially crucial requirement and thus was analysed in more detail. In addition, the emission reduction potential resulting from DPs was estimated for the Federal state of Baden-Württemberg, in South-West Germany. Here, it is shown that the scope for DPs is restricted because of the extent of the German climate program. In Baden-Württemberg only some DPs and JI activities fulfil the criterion of policy additionality. For this reason, DPs are probably of more interest in Annex-I countries with a more limited climate policy mix.",,"Environmental protection; Greenhouse effect; Particulate emissions; Public policy; Climate policy; Climate protection; Domestic offset projects (DPs); Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Climatology; anthropogenic effect; climate effect; emission control; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; policy implementation; pollution policy; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750319344

The purpose of the demonstration is twofold: (a) efficient, low-cost energy generation and (b) hydrogen production. Although a next-generation plant could be developed as a single-purpose facility, early designs are expected to be dual purpose, as assumed here. A dual-purpose design with a combined cycle of a Brayton top cycle and a bottom Rankine cycle was investigated. An intermediate heat transport loop for transporting heat to a hydrogen production plant was used. Helium, CO2, and a helium-nitrogen mixture were studied to determine the best working fluid in terms of the cycle efficiency. The relative component sizes were estimated for the different working fluids to provide an indication of the relative capital costs. The relative size of the turbomachinery was measured by comparing the power input/output of the component. For heat exchangers the volume was computed and compared.

This gives some insight into the sensitivity of the cycle to various operating conditions as well as trade-offs between efficiency and component size.

The participants of the workshop are part of the European Network of Excellence MarBEF (Marine Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function), a consortium of 56 European marine institutes to integrate and disseminate knowledge and expertise on marine biodiversity. Here we review some of the new trends and emerging topics in marine chemical ecology. The first section deals with microbial chemical interactions. Microbes communicate with each other using diffusible molecules such as N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHL). These are regulators in cell-density-dependent gene regulation (quorum sensing) controlling microbial processes. In chemical interactions with higher organisms, microbes can act either as harmful pathogens that are repelled by the host's chemical defense or as beneficial symbionts. These symbionts are sometimes the true producers of the host's secondary metabolites that have defensive and protective functions for their hosts. We also describe how allelochemicals can shape phytoplankton communities by regulating competition for available resources, and also interactions among individuals of the same species. Compounds such as the diatom-derived unsaturated aldehydes have been demonstrated to act as infochemicals, and they possibly function as a diffusible bloom-termination signal that triggers an active cell death and bloom termination at sea. The same molecules have also been shown to interfere with the reproductive capacity of grazing animals deterring future generations of potential predators. Such compounds differ from those that act as feeding deterrents since they do not target the predator but its offspring. Many of the neurotoxins produced by dinoflagellates act as feeding deterrents, and laboratory experiments have shown that ingestion of these algae by some microzooplankton and macrozooplankton can cause acute responses such as death, incapacitation, altered swimming behavior, and reduced fecundity and egg-hatching success. These effects may rarely occur in nature because of low individual grazing rates on dinoflagellate cells and grazing on other food sources such as microflagellates and diatoms. We also consider the nutritional component of marine plant-herbivore interactions, especially in the plankton, and the information available on the effects of growing conditions of algae on the production of toxic metabolites. Species producing saxitoxins seem to consistently produce the highest amounts of toxins (on a per cell basis) in the exponential phase of growth, and there is a decrease in their production under nitrogen, but not under phosphorus stress, where the production actually increases. We try to explain the circumstances under which organisms defend themselves chemically and argue that the most likely explanatory model for the production of secondary metabolites used for defense in planktonic organisms is the carbon nutrient balance hypothesis, which predicts that most algae produce their toxins mainly under conditions where carbon is in excess and nitrogen (or other nutrients) is limiting. We also discuss chemically mediated macroalgal-herbivore interactions in the benthos and the large variation in concentration of seaweed defense metabolites at different spatial and temporal scales. Seaweeds have been shown to produce a large variety of secondary metabolites with highly variable chemical structures such as terpenoids, acetogenins, amino acid derivates, and poly-phenols. Many of these compounds probably have multiple simultaneous functions for the seaweeds and can act as allelopathic, antimicrobial, and antifouling or ultraviolet-screening agents, as well as herbivore deterrents. We also provide examples of interactions between marine benthic invertebrates, especially sponges, molluscs, and cnidarians, that are mediated by specific secondary metabolites and discuss the role of these in shaping benthic communities. © 2006 Estuarine Research Federation.",,"benthos; chemical ecology; host-symbiont interaction; macroalga; organic compound; phytoplankton; plant-herbivore interaction; seaweed; secondary metabolite; toxic organism; algae; Animalia; Bacillariophyta; Cnidaria; Dinophyceae; Invertebrata; Mollusca",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749648123

Study sites, located throughout the southern New England region (USA), ranged from Spartina alterniflora-dominated reference marshes, marshes under various regimes and histories of tide restoration, and a severely tide-restricted Phragmites australis marsh. Fundulus δ13C values were greater for fish from reference Spartina marshes than for fish from adjacent tide-restricted or tide-restored marshes where higher percent cover of C3 plants, lower water column salinities, and more negative dissolved inorganic δ13C values were observed. The difference in Fundulus δ13C values between a tide-restricted Phragmites marsh and an adjacent reference Spartina marsh was great compared to the difference between marshes at various stages of tide restoration and their respective reference marshes, suggesting that food web support functions are restored as the degree of tidal restriction is lessened. While a multiple isotopic approach can provide valuable information for determining specific food sources to consumers, this study demonstrates that monitoring Fundulus δ13C values alone may be useful to evaluate the trajectory of ecological change for marshes undergoing tidal restoration. © 2006 Estuarine Research Federation.",,"angiosperm; carbon isotope; fish; food web; intertidal environment; macroalga; saltmarsh; seagrass; New England; North America; United States; Fundulus; Fundulus heteroclitus; Magnoliophyta; Phragmites; Phragmites australis; Spartina; Spartina alterniflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749627369

HCO 3- was the dominant source of inorganic C taken up by phytoplankton at all sampling locations, accounting for ∼60-90% of total C uptake. The uptake of HCO3- occurred primarily through a direct transport system, while indirect HCO3- use, mediated by extracellular carbonic anhydrase (eCA), played a minor role in the C uptake system. Direct HCO3- transport and eCA activity were not related to ambient nutrient or CO2 concentrations or to phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll a [Chl a]) or primary productivity. There was significant variability in the biomass-normalized activities of Rubisco, PEPC, and total (intracellular and extracellular) carbonic anhydrase. The activities of all of the enzymes measured exhibited significant correlations with both CO2 concentrations and Chl a. PEPC activity averaged 20% of Rubisco activity (range 0.5-110%), and the PEPC:Rubisco ratio was positively correlated with CO2 concentrations and negatively correlated with Chl a. Carbonic anhydrase activity was strongly anticorrelated with CO2 and positively correlated with Chl a.

Major reductions in the largest emissions sources have made accurate inventories of previously minor sources much more important to the understanding and improvement of local air quality. Changes in manufacturing processes, industry types, vehicle technologies, and metropolitan infrastructure are occurring at an increasingly rapid pace, emphasizing the importance of inventories that reflect current conditions. New technologies for measuring source emissions and ambient pollutant concentrations, both at the point of emissions and from remote platforms, are providing novel approaches to collecting data for inventory developers. Advances in information technologies are allowing data to be shared more quickly, more easily, and processed and compared in novel ways that can speed the development of emission inventories. Approaches to improving quantitative measures of inventory uncertainty allow air quality management decisions to take into account the uncertainties associated with emissions estimates, providing more accurate projections of how well alternative strategies may work. This paper discusses applications of these technologies and techniques to improve the accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of emission inventories across North America and outlines a series of eight recommendations aimed at inventory developers and air quality management decision-makers to improve emission inventories and enable them to support effective air quality management decisions for the foreseeable future. © 2006 Air & Waste Management Association.",,"Air pollution; Air quality; Data reduction; Decision making; Estimation; Inventory control; Air emission inventories; Air quality management; Local air quality; Metropolitan infrastructure; Particulate emissions; accuracy; air analysis; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; air quality control; ambient air; article; chemical analysis; environmental management; industry; information technology; North America; priority journal; air pollutant; air pollution; algorithm; apparatus, equipment and supplies; environmental monitoring; standard; statistics; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Air Pollution; Algorithms; Environmental Monitoring; Equipment and Supplies; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749135247

The degree of such failure can be as minor as a pinhole leak or as major as a fully involved baghouse fire. In some cases, local air pollution regulations or federal hazardous waste laws may require estimation of the total quantity of particulate matter released to the environment as a result of such failures. In this paper, a technique is presented for computing the dust loading in the baghouse exhaust when one or more bags have failed. The algorithm developed is shown to be an improvement over a previously published result, which requires empirical knowledge of the variation in baghouse pressure differential with bag failures. An example calculation is presented for a bag-house equipped with 200 bags. The prediction shows that a small percentage of failed bags can cause a relatively large proportion of the gas flow to bypass the active bags, which, in turn, leads to high outlet dust loading and low overall collection efficiency from the baghouse. © 2006 Air & Waste Management Association.",,"air pollutant; air pollution; algorithm; article; atmospheric pressure; dust; equipment; filtration; forecasting; instrumentation; air analysis; air pollution; calculation; dust; filter; filtration; gas flow; mathematical analysis; particulate matter; prediction; priority journal; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Air Pollution; Air Pressure; Algorithms; Dust; Equipment Failure; Filtration; Forecasting; Air pollution; Dust; Exhaust gases; Failure analysis; Filters (for fluids); Filtration; Bag failures; Baghouse exhausts; Particulate loading; Pressure differentials; Particles (particulate matter)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749120758

IA, N-7465 Trondheim, Norway","One of the measures for reducing global CO2 emissions is to capture CO2 and store it safely in geological formations. Safe and effective CO2 management requires reliable tools for calculate accurately the properties of both pure CO2 and CO2 in mixtures. If the default models and parameters of commercial flow sheeting tools are used when predicting the solubility of water in CO2 and CO2 in mixtures may not always result in satisfactory results. Having in mind the need for reliable operation of the processes along the CO2 capture, transport and injection chain, reliable tools are cardinal. The purpose of the present work has been to establish reliable model parameters by selecting equation of state (EOS) models for evaluation, develop a database of reliable experimental data on solubility of H2O, CO2 and CH4 based on data collected from literature, use the data to establish and suggest model parameters based on the database, and test and document the ability of the various EOS models to predict the solubility of H2O in CO2 or a mixture of CO2 and CH4. Experimental data on solubility of H2O, CO2 and CH4 were collected from literature and compared with a model based on the rest of the experimental data in order to evaluate the quality of the data. The second order SRK-HV (SRK-Huron Vidal) model with six parameters was used as model for evaluating the experimental data. The models SRK-VdW (Soave Redlich Kwong, Van der Waals mixing rules), SRK-HV (SRK-Huron Vidal) and the CPA (Cubic Plus Association) was evaluated. Based on the data for the mutual solubilities of H2O, CO2 and CH4, new model parameters were adapted for the SRK-HV, and the CPA models. Solubility of H2O in CO2 and H2O in the CO2-CH4 mixture was emphasized. The second order SRK-HV model produced acceptable results with deviation from 3% to 9% between experiments and the model. The CPA model was less accurate, producing results with deviation from 9% to 35% between experiments and the model. The SRK-VdW model gave two different binary coefficients, one for solubility of water in liquid CO2 and another for solubility of CO2 in water. That gave same deviation as the SRK-HV model, (typically 7% for H2O in CO2 but 93% for CO2 in water, or 4% for CO2 in water but 390% for H2O in CO2 with another binary coefficient). The SRK-VdW is not indented for use of two different binary coefficients. © 2006 Institution of Chemical Engineers.","Carbon dioxide; Cubic Plus Association; Equation of state; SRK-Huron Vidal; Water solubility","Carbon dioxide; Equations of state; Hydrogen; Mathematical models; Solubility; Thermodynamics; Mutual solubilities; Thermodynamic models; Water solubility; Mixtures; Carbon dioxide; Equations of state; Hydrogen; Mathematical models; Mixtures; Solubility; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33749043485

Due to the scattered CO2 sources and the uncertainty in the growth of the CO2 market, a cost effective and flexible transport system is required. In this work a ship transport concept is developed as an alternative to pipeline transport. New technical solutions, cost-, energy-, exergy- and CO2 emission analysis for ship-based transport of CO2 are presented. The concept includes all the elements in the transport chain, namely liquefaction, intermediate storage, loading system, semi-pressurized ship and offshore unloading system. Economical large-scale transport Of CO2 by ship could be done in semi-pressurized vessels of around 20 000 m3 at pressures near triple point (6.5 bara and -52°C) in order to use well established design for commercial construction of LPG carriers and intermediate storage. This condition also gives the highest density in the liquid state, which reduces the transport unit cost. Liquefaction Of CO2 is best achieved in an open cycle, where the refrigeration is partly or fully provided by the feed gas itself. The offshore unloading system will transport the liquid CO2 from the dedicated CO2 ship to the wellhead on the platform at the required temperature and pressure. During the unloading phase the ship is connected to a submerged turret loading (STL) system. The CO2 is pumped to a pressure high enough to avoid phase transition in the transfer lines. A flexible riser, a subsea pipeline and an insulated pipeline in the platform shaft bring the CO2 from the unloading location to the topside of the platform. The CO2 is pumped to injection pressure and heated to avoid operational problems before it is injected into the reservoir for EOR using conventional water injection wells. The total specific energy requirement for the selected transport chain is 142 kWh tonne-1 C02, where the liquefaction process accounts for 77%. An exergy analysis of the chain is performed showing that the minimum work required in the chain is 60 kWh tonne-1 CO2, giving a chain rational efficiency of 42%. The total CO2 emissions are estimated to be approximately 1.4% of the inlet CO2. The total costs of ship-based transport are calculated to be 20-30 USD tonne-1 for volumes larger than 2 Mt y-1 and distances limited to the North Sea.

Different scenarios for a respective gradual technology transition between 2015 and 2050 are provided. State-of-the-art simulations of three-dimensional (3D) radiative forcing (RF) distributions are compiled and complemented for the various agents determining aviation climate impact. They are utilized to quantify the globally averaged transient climate response and respective differences between the transition scenarios. A climate impact reduction of between 15% and 50% in terms of RF is indicated for the cryoplane scenarios at the 2050 time slice, with a best estimate near 30% in case of a swift transition. The respective reduction range is between 5% and 15% in terms of surface temperature change, with a best estimate of about 10%. The environmental benefit of a cryoplane transition further increases if time horizons beyond 2050 are considered. Besides known uncertainties in quantifying aviation climate impacts, crucial limitations of our assessment are insufficient knowledge on contrail cirrus induced by cryoplanes and on the feasibility to produce large amounts of LH2 from renewable energy sources. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This provides the DH utilities with major flexibility in changing their fuel and technology mix when the economic conditions for generation change. Two recently introduced policy instruments have changed the DH utilities' costs for generation considerably; the tradable green-certificate (TGC) scheme introduced in 2003 in Sweden, and the tradable greenhouse-gas emission permit (TEP) scheme introduced in the EU on January 1, 2005. The objective of this study is to analyse how these two trading schemes impact on the operation of the Swedish DH sector in terms of changes in CHP generation, CO2 emissions, and operating costs. The analysis was carried out by comparing the most cost-effective operation for the DH utilities, with and without, the two trading schemes applied, using a model that handles the Swedish DH-sector system-by-system. It was found that the volume of renewable power generated in CHP plants only increased slightly owing to the TGC scheme. The TGC and the TEP schemes in force together, however, nearly doubled the renewable power-generation. CO2 emissions from the DH sector may either increase or decrease depending on the combination of TGC and TEP prices. The overall CO2 emissions from the European power-generation sector would, however, be reduced for all price combinations assuming that increased Swedish CHP generation replaces coal-condensing power (coal-fired plants with power generation only) in other European countries. The trading schemes also lower the operational costs of the DH sector since the cost increase owing to the use of more expensive fuels and the purchase of TEPs is outweighed by the increased revenues from sales of electricity and TGCs. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A program of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating, applying mainly single-grain analyses, was therefore initiated. Many samples have independent age estimates from radiocarbon to check the OSL results, but OSL age estimates are also provided for those sites that otherwise lack secure chronological control. Sediment samples for OSL were obtained primarily from Paleoindian and Archaic localities, though include deposits of more recent age. Through the analysis of single grains, equivalent dose-the numerator of the age equation-is evaluated independently on numerous grains. The distribution of these values is relatively broad for some samples, and this is attributed to post-depositional mixing. Mixing is also evident in some samples with more narrow distributions. Selecting portions of the mixed distributions for age determination allows more accurate dating for some samples, but the nature of the distributions limits the resolution on others, conclusions that cannot be as easily drawn from multi-grain analysis. Where independent age control is available, most OSL results broadly conform; however, some samples show discrepancies that are not readily explained, but may relate to association or dose rate problems. This underscores the desirability of obtaining where possible suites of chronological evidence. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We document carbon disposal through the mineralization of mine tailings at Clinton Creek, Yukon Territory, and Cassiar, British Columbia. We confirm crystallographic binding of carbon in these tailings and quantify carbon dioxide uptake using quantitative phase analysis with the Rietveld method for X-ray powder diffraction data. Planar disorder in the structures of the kaolinite-serpentine group minerals makes Rierveld refinements of X-ray powder diffraction data for serpentinites problematic. Using structureless pattern fitting and with the addition of a known quantity of a well-crystallized material, the problem of structural disorder is overcome by considering the serpentine minerals as amorphous phases. We test the accuracy and precision of this refinement method using synthetic serpentine-rich mine tailings of known composition. Estimates of the abundance of hydrated magnesium carbonates in these tailings have a precision of approximately 5% relative for mineral species present in amounts greater than 10 wt%. Precise estimates of carbonate mineral content and crystallographically bound atmospheric CO2 are made for samples of serpentine-rich tailings from Clinton Creek and Cassiar. Results for mine tailings are also compared to mineralogically similar samples from a carbonate playa at Atlin, British Columbia.

Cross-polarization magic-angle spinning 13C NMR (CPMAS 13C NMR) analysis performed with variable contact-time (VCT) pulse sequences showed that the largest molecular-size fractions contained aromatic, alkyl, and carbohydrate-like components. The carbohydrate-like content and the alkyl chain length seemed to decrease with decreasing molecular size. Progressive reduction of aromatic carbon atoms was also observed with decreasing molecular size of the separated fractions. Mathematical treatment of the results from VCT experiments enabled cross polarization (TCH) and proton spin-lattice relaxation (T1ρ(H)) times to be related to structural differences among the size fractions. The conformational distribution indicated that the eleven size fractions could be allocated to two main groups. The first group, with larger nominal molecular sizes, was characterized by molecular domains with slower local molecular motion. The second group of size fractions, with smaller nominal molecular sizes, was characterized by a larger number of molecular domains with faster local molecular motion.

Calculations show that subgrid terrain parameters alter the diurnal cycle and horizontal distributions of surface energy budget components. This effect becomes more significant with increased terrain slope, especially in winter. Due to the inclusion of the subgrid topography, the surface area of a model grid box changes over complex terrain areas. Numerical experiments, with and without the subgrid scale topography scheme, show that the parameterization scheme of subgrid scale topography modifies the distribution of the surface energy budget and surface temperature around the Tibetan Plateau.

Four common tallgrass prairie species were germinated and grown for 7 months in environmentally controlled chambers using two different atmospheric elemental mercury (Hg°; 3.7 ± 2.0 and 10.2 ± 3.5 ng m-3), soil Hg (&lt;0.01 and 0.15 ± 0.08 μg g-1), and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) (390 ± 18, 598 ± 22 μmol mol-1) exposures. Species used included two C4 grasses and two C3 forbs. Elevated CO2 concentrations led to lower foliar Hg concentrations in plants exposed to low (i.e., ambient) air Hg° concentrations, but no CO2 effect was apparent at higher air Hg° exposure. The observed CO2 effect suggests that leaf Hg uptake might be controlled by leaf physiological processes such as stomatal conductance which is typically reduced under elevated CO2. Foliar tissue exposed to elevated air Hg° concentrations had higher concentrations than those exposed to low air Hg°, but only when also exposed to elevated CO2. The relationships for foliar Hg concentrations at different atmospheric CO2 and Hg° exposures indicate that these species may have a limited capacity for Hg storage; at ambient CO2 concentrations all Hg absorption sites in leaves may have been saturated while at elevated CO2 when stomatal conductance was reduced saturation may have been reached only at higher concentrations of atmospheric Hg°. Foliar Hg concentrations were not correlated to soil Hg exposures, except for one of the four species (Rudbeckia hirta). Higher soil Hg concentrations resulted in high root Hg concentrations and considerably increased the percentage of total plant Hg allocated to roots. The large shifts in Hg allocation patterns-notably under soil conditions only slightly above natural background levels-indicate a potentially strong role of plants in belowground Hg transformation and cycling processes. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The study is applied to the Aburrá Valley, in the Colombian Andes, which is a practically unknown area from the point of view of ozone formation. The model used for this application is the European modelling of atmospheric constituents (EUMAC) zooming model (EZM) which consists of a mesoscale prognostic model (MEMO, mesoscale meteorological model) and a chemical reaction model (MUSE, multiscale for the atmospheric dispersion of reactive species), coupled to the chemical mechanism EMEP (European monitoring and evaluation program). The analysis is performed for a real episode that was characterized by high ozone production and that happened during the 23rd and 24th December, 1999 in Medellín (Colombia). From this real scenario, a sensitivity analysis has been carried out in order to assess the influence of VOC and NOx amounts on ozone production and to extract some conclusions for future ozone abatement policies in Andean regions. As far as ozone air quality is concerned, it is shown that in order to keep current levels the emphasis must be put to avoid increasing NOx emissions, or alternatively, to augment VOC emissions in order to have a high VOC/NOx ratio. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The impact on urban air quality could be reduced if the trends of vehicle emissions are well understood. In the present study, the real-world emissions of vehicles were measured using a remote sensing system at five sites in Hangzhou, China from February 2004 to August 2005. More than 48000 valid gasoline powered vehicle emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC) and nitrogen oxide (NO) were measured. The results show that petrol vehicle fleet in Hangzhou has considerably high CO emissions, with the average emission concentration of 2.71%+/-0.02%, while HC and NO emissions are relatively lower, with the average emission concentration of (153.72+/-1.16)x10(-6) and (233.53+/-1.80)x10(-6), respectively. Quintile analysis of both average emission concentration and total amount emissions by model year suggests that in-use emission differences between well maintained and badly maintained vehicles are larger than the age-dependent deterioration of emissions. In addition, relatively new high polluting vehicles are the greatest contributors to fleet emissions with, for example, 46.55% of carbon monoxide fleet emissions being produced by the top quintile high emitting vehicles from model years 2000-2004. Therefore, fleet emissions could be significantly reduced if new highly polluting vehicles were subject to effective emissions testing followed by appropriate remedial action.",,"carbon monoxide; hydrocarbon; nitric oxide; article; car; China; city; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; methodology; statistics; Automobiles; Carbon Monoxide; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Hydrocarbons; Nitric Oxide; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747149309

This DOC can serve as a resource for heterotrophic bacteria and influence whether lakes function as sources or sinks of atmospheric CO2. However, it remains unclear as to how terrestrial carbon moves through lake food webs. We addressed this topic by conducting a comparative lake survey in the northeastern U.S. along a gradient of terrestrial-derived DOC. We used naturally occurring carbon stable isotopes of CO2, particulate organic matter (POM), and crustacean zoplankton, as well as gas measurements and culture-independent assessments of microbial community composition to make inferences about the flow of terrestrial carbon in lake food webs. Stable isotope ratios of POM and zooplankton decreased with DOC and were often depleted in 13C relative to terrestrial carbon, suggesting the importance of an isotopically light carbon source. It has been proposed that the incorporation of biogenic methane (CH4) into plankton food webs would account for such trends in stable isotope ratios, but we found weak evidence for this hypothesis, on the basis of relationships of CH4, methanogenic archaebacteria, and methanotrophic bacteria in our lakes. Instead, our results are consistent with the view that phytoplankton increase their use of heterotrophically respired CO2 with increasing concentrations of terrestrial-derived DOC. The effect of this CO2 recycling can be detected in the stable isotope composition of crustacean zooplankton, suggesting that the direct transfer of terrestrial DOC inputs to higher trophic levels may be relatively inefficient. © 2006, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; comparative study; crustacean; dissolved organic carbon; food web; isotopic composition; lake ecosystem; methane; particulate organic matter; phytoplankton; North America; United States; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Crustacea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746956954

The air conditioning process for hot and humid climates involves reducing air temperature and humidity. In the present analysis the inlet state is the state of the environment which has also been chosen as the dead state. The final state is the human thermal comfort fixed at 20 °C dry bulb temperature and 60% relative humidity. The general air conditioning process is represented by an equivalent path consisting of an isothermal dehumidification followed by a sensible cooling. An exergy analysis is performed on each process separately. Dehumidification is analyzed as a separation process of an ideal mixture of air and water vapor. The variations of the minimum work required for the air conditioning process with the ambient conditions is estimated and the ratio of the work needed for dehumidification to the total work needed to perform the entire process is presented. The effect of small variations in the final conditions on the minimum required work is evaluated. Tolerating a warmer or more humid final condition can be an easy solution to reduce the energy consumptions during critical load periods. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Our synthesis of the published scientific literature shows three major environmental problems: (1) it can increase the concentration of hydrogen ions in freshwater ecosystems without much acid-neutralizing capacity, resulting in acidification of those systems; (2) it can stimulate or enhance the development, maintenance and proliferation of primary producers, resulting in eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems; (3) it can reach toxic levels that impair the ability of aquatic animals to survive, grow and reproduce. Inorganic nitrogen pollution of ground and surface waters can also induce adverse effects on human health and economy. Because reductions in SO2 emissions have reduced the atmospheric deposition of H2SO4 across large portions of North America and Europe, while emissions of NOx have gone unchecked, HNO3 is now playing an increasing role in the acidification of freshwater ecosystems. This acidification process has caused several adverse effects on primary and secondary producers, with significant biotic impoverishments, particularly concerning invertebrates and fishes, in many atmospherically acidified lakes and streams. The cultural eutrophication of freshwater, estuarine, and coastal marine ecosystems can cause ecological and toxicological effects that are either directly or indirectly related to the proliferation of primary producers. Extensive kills of both invertebrates and fishes are probably the most dramatic manifestation of hypoxia (or anoxia) in eutrophic and hypereutrophic aquatic ecosystems with low water turnover rates. The decline in dissolved oxygen concentrations can also promote the formation of reduced compounds, such as hydrogen sulphide, resulting in higher adverse (toxic) effects on aquatic animals. Additionally, the occurrence of toxic algae can significantly contribute to the extensive kills of aquatic animals. Cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates and diatoms appear to be major responsible that may be stimulated by inorganic nitrogen pollution. Among the different inorganic nitrogenous compounds (NH4+, NH3, NO2-, HNO2, NO3-) that aquatic animals can take up directly from the ambient water, unionized ammonia is the most toxic, while ammonium and nitrate ions are the least toxic. In general, seawater animals seem to be more tolerant to the toxicity of inorganic nitrogenous compounds than freshwater animals, probably because of the ameliorating effect of water salinity (sodium, chloride, calcium and other ions) on the tolerance of aquatic animals. Ingested nitrites and nitrates from polluted drinking waters can induce methemoglobinemia in humans, particularly in young infants, by blocking the oxygen-carrying capacity of hemoglobin. Ingested nitrites and nitrates also have a potential role in developing cancers of the digestive tract through their contribution to the formation of nitrosamines. In addition, some scientific evidences suggest that ingested nitrites and nitrates might result in mutagenicity, teratogenicity and birth defects, contribute to the risks of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and bladder and ovarian cancers, play a role in the etiology of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and in the development of thyroid hypertrophy, or cause spontaneous abortions and respiratory tract infections. Indirect health hazards can occur as a consequence of algal toxins, causing nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, hepatoenteritis, muscular cramps, and several poisoning syndromes (paralytic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, amnesic shellfish poisoning). Other indirect health hazards can also come from the potential relationship between inorganic nitrogen pollution and human infectious diseases (malaria, cholera). Human sickness and death, extensive kills of aquatic animals, and other negative effects, can have elevated costs on human economy, with the recreation and tourism industry suffering the most important economic impacts, at least locally. It is concluded that levels of total nitrogen lower than 0.5-1.0 mg TN/L could prevent aquatic ecosystems (excluding those ecosystems with naturally high N levels) from developing acidification and eutrophication, at least by inorganic nitrogen pollution. Those relatively low TN levels could also protect aquatic animals against the toxicity of inorganic nitrogenous compounds since, in the absence of eutrophication, surface waters usually present relatively high concentrations of dissolved oxygen, most inorganic reactive nitrogen being in the form of nitrate. Additionally, human health and economy would be safer from the adverse effects of inorganic nitrogen pollution. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

For example, in Latin America and in the Caribbean, from an approximate population of 500 million, only 125 million have access to good drinking water, and about 200 million do not have adequate sanitary facilities. In many large populated centers, as well as in some small communities, the air quality is very poor and this becomes an additional factor to be added to the overall effects of poverty. In many cases, air pollution is not a high priority for governments that are intent on expanding economic development. A major issue, which is of great concern in the creation of air pollution, is the use of additives in automotive gasoline and/or to produce reformulated and oxygenated gasoline. In many Latin American and Asiatic countries, the use of reformulated gasoline (RFG) is being touted as a cure for the prevailing urban smog problems. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency, has reported that RFG represents ""a significant"" step toward clean air, with the introduction of RFG in 1995, combined with other industrial and transportation controls aimed at air pollution reduction. This information pertains to the USA and not to all countries in the world. All of these control measures together are responsible for the long-term downward trend in US air pollution. However, this ""magic formula"", must be implemented only under certain conditions, many of which do not exist in Latin America, in order to produce the expected results. This paper investigates the transportation conditions that exist in most Latin American and Asiatic countries, using Mexico City as an example. It points out that the use of RFG can actually cause a degradation of air quality due to the age distribution of the automotive fleet, along with other technical issues associated with the type of cars currently in use. The reasons behind this degradation along with possible alternative transportation control measures are discussed with the goal of reducing the overall air pollution burden in these developing areas. © Springer-Verlag 2006.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746404273

However, the structural features responsible for membrane localization and the mechanisms regulating its dual intracellular localization are unknown. The maize (Zea mays) SUS1 isoform is likely to have the intrinsic ability to interact directly with membranes because we show: (1) partial membrane localization when expressed in Escherichia coli, and (2) binding to carbonate-stripped plant microsomes in vitro. We have undertaken mutational analyses (truncations and alanine substitutions) and in vitro microsome-binding assays with the SUS1 protein to define intrinsic membrane-binding regions and potential regulatory factors that could be provided by cellular microenvironment. The results suggest that two regions of SUS1 contribute to membrane affinity: (1) the amino-terminal noncatalytic domain, and (2) a region with sequence similarity to the C-terminal pleckstrin homology domain of human pleckstrin. Alanine substitutions within the pleckstrin homology-like domain of SUS1 reduced membrane association in E. coli and with plant microsomes in vitro without reducing enzymatic activity. Microsomal association of wild-type SUS1 displayed cooperativity with SUS1 protein concentration and was stimulated by both lowering the pH and adding Suc. These studies offer insight into the molecular level regulation of SUS1 localization and its participation in carbon partitioning in plants. Moreover, transgenics with active SUS mutants altered in membrane affinity may be of technological utility. © 2006 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Fructose; Plant cell culture; Sugar (sucrose); Membrane localization; Microsomes; Plasma membrane; Enzyme kinetics; Enzymes; Fructose; Sugar; Escherichia coli; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745969118

The purpose of the present paper is to clarify the most cost-effective mix of vehicles for reducing CO2 emissions and to estimate the subsidy that is necessary to achieve this vehicle mix. For this analysis, the energy system of Japan from 1988 to 2032 is modeled using a MARKAL model. The most cost-effective mix of vehicles is estimated by minimizing the total energy system cost under the constraint of an 8% energy-related CO2 emissions reduction nationally by 2030 from the CO2 emissions of 1990. Based on the results of the analysis, hybrid vehicles are the only type of clean-energy vehicle, and their share of the passenger car sector in 2030 will be 62%. By assuming the subsidization of hybrid vehicles, the same vehicle mix can be achieved without constraining CO2 emissions. The peak of the total subsidy estimated to be necessary is 1.225 billion US$/year in 2020, but the annual revenue of the assumed 31 US$/t-C carbon tax from the passenger car sector is sufficient to finance the estimated subsidy. This suggests that we should support the dissemination of hybrid vehicles through subsidization based on carbon tax. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The principle of this study depends on the adsorption of CH4 or CO2 on the surface of coal molecules as well as the nearly twice the amount of adsorption of CO2 compared with CH4. One of the authors had experimentally clarified the adsorption abilities of the coals in each Japanese coalfield. Based on these adsorption-abilities, the amount of the coal-bed methane resources was calculated, and also the sequestration-potential of carbon dioxide was estimated for each coalfield. In this paper, the CO2 sequestration-potential obtained from each coalfield is compared with the potentials from the other coalfields in Japan. Among the Japanese coalfields, the Ishikari coalfield in Hokkaido is the biggest and shows 50% of Japanese CO2-sequestration-potential. And the other big coalfields are the solitary island area in the northwestern district of Kyushu and the Miike-Ariake Sea area.

Depleted soil organic C (SOC) pools of reclaimed mine soil (RMS) ecosystems can be restored through conversion to an appropriate land use and adoption of recommended management practices (RMPs). The objectives of this paper are to (1) synthesize available information on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from coal mining and combustion activities, (2) understand mechanisms of SOC sequestration and its protection, (3) identify factors affecting C sequestration potential in RMSs, (4) review available methods for the estimation of ecosystem C budget (ECB), and (5) identify knowledge gaps to enhance C sink capacity of RMS ecosystems and prioritize research issues. The drastic perturbations of soil by mining activities can accentuate CO2 emission through mineralization, erosion, leaching, changes in soil moisture and temperature regimes, and reduction in biomass returned to the soil. The reclamation of drastically disturbed soils leads to improvement in soil quality and development of soil pedogenic processes accruing the benefit of SOC sequestration and additional income from trading SOC credits. The SOC sequestration potential in RMS depends on amount of biomass production and return to soil, and mechanisms of C protection. The rate of SOC sequestration ranges from 0.1 to 3.1 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1 and 0.7 to 4 Mg ha- 1 yr- 1 in grass and forest RMS ecosystem, respectively. Proper land restoration alone could off-set 16 Tg CO2 in the U.S. annually. However, the factors affecting C sequestration and protection in RMS leading to increase in microbial activity, nutrient availability, soil aggregation, C build up, and soil profile development must be better understood in order to formulate guidelines for development of an holistic approach to sustainable management of these ecosystems. The ECBs of RMS ecosystems are not well understood. An ecosystem method of evaluating ECB of RMS ecosystems is proposed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Three plant species were cultivated for four consecutive growing cycles (28 days each) in soil contaminated with 36.3 μg/g total PAH. During the first growth period, Cucurbita pepo ssp. pepo (zucchini) tissues contained significantly greater quantities of PAHs than did Cucumis sativus (cucumber) and Cucurbita pepo ssp. ovifera (squash). During the first growth cycle, zucchini plants accumulated up to 5.47 times more total PAH than did the other plants, including up to three orders of magnitude greater levels of the six ring PAHs. Over growth cycles 2-4, PAH accumulation by zucchini decreased by 85%, whereas the uptake of the contaminants by cucumber and squash remained relatively constant. Over all four growth cycles, the removal of PAHs by zucchini was still twice that of the other species. Two earthworm species accumulated significantly different amounts of PAH from the soil; Eisenia foetida and Lumbricus terrestris contained 0.204 and 0.084 μg/g total PAH, respectively, but neither species accumulated measurable quantities 5 or 6 ring PAHs. Lastly, in abiotic desorption experiments with an aqueous phase of synthetically prepared organic acid solutions, the release of 3 and 4 ring PAHs from soil was unaffected by the treatments but the desorption of 5-6 ring constituents was increased by up to two orders of magnitude. The data show that not only is the accumulation of weathered PAHs species-specific but also that the bioavailability of individual PAH constituents is highly variable. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Geometries considered include double bifurcation models of upper (G3-G5) and central (G7-G9) airways for a four-year-old child under healthy and 30% constricted conditions. Steady inhalation flow rates consistent with sedentary, light and high activity conditions have been employed. For this study, the deposition patterns of particles ranging from 1 to 7 μ m have been evaluated in terms of branch-averaged filtering efficiencies and highly localized cellular-level deposition rates. These cellular-level deposition values were calculated within150 μ m diameter regions based on a novel microdosimetry factor. For both upper and central airway models, airway constriction increased branch-averaged filtering efficiencies by factors ranging from 1.5 to 10. More significantly, airway constriction was found to increase local cellular-level deposition rates by one to two orders of magnitude, as encapsulated by the microdosimetry factor. Based on these results, asthma constriction is observed to induce a significant increase in branch-averaged particle deposition as well as an even larger increase in local cellular-level deposition and cellular burden. These increased cellular-level deposition values may translate to an increased health risk associated with the inhalation of particulate matter in cases of asthma related bronchoconstriction. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In the case of the ν2 band, which is of E symmetry, specific parameters, different from those adapted to the ν3 and ν4 transitions of F2 symmetry, are used for proper modeling of the spectral shape. Furthermore, as shown previously, a broad absorption feature grows underneath the ν2 band with increasing H2 density. The latter, for which an empirical model is proposed, is attributed to a collision-induced absorption (CIA) process in methane. From the developed models, a database and associated software are built for the updating of planetary atmospheres radiative transfer codes. The quality of these tools is then further demonstrated using emission measurements of the Jovian and Saturnian atmospheres in the ν4 region (7-10 μm) recorded by the Short Wave Spectrometer of the Infrared Space Observatory and the Composite Infrared Spectrometer on-board Cassini. Comparisons between measured radiances and predictions confirm the failure of the purely Lorentzian approach and the quality of the proposed line-mixing model. Furthermore, it is shown that the methane CIA contribution has a significant influence on the planetary emission beyond 1400 cm-1. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The Beijing municipal government and the public have worked hard to control vehicular emissions since 1995. Strategies and measures have been introduced to regulate land use and traffic planning, emission control of in-use vehicles and new vehicles, fuel quality improvement, introduction of clean fuel vehicle technology and fiscal incentives. New development plans for Beijing will change the transportation structure by encouraging public transportation. For in-use vehicles, the I/M program has employed ASM tests since early 2003 and the government has encouraged the retirement of high-emission vehicles. For new vehicles, Beijing introduced Euro 1 and Euro 2 emission standards in early 1999 and 2003, respectively. It is also confirmed that Euro 3 standards will be introduced in 2005. At the same time, the fuel quality in Beijing was improved significantly, by banning lead and reducing sulfur among other changes. CNG and LPG were introduced in 1999 and are used in buses and taxis. Today Beijing has the largest CNG bus fleet in the world with more than 2000 dedicated CNG buses. Beijing has also focused on fiscal incentives such as tax deductions for new vehicles meeting enhanced emission standards to encourage their sales. These strategies and measures have had an impact on the control of vehicular emissions. Despite the rapid increase of the vehicle population by 60% between 1998 and 2003, total vehicular emissions have not increased. With the enhancement of vehicular emission control, the air quality in Beijing is improving as the city strives to its goal for a ""Green Olympics"". © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, as CO2-emissions reduction targets become more ambitious, it is expected that there will be pressure to reduce CO2-emissions from such units well before they reach the end of their useful lifetime. One way to achieve this goal is to integrate a biofuel gasification unit at the plant site. After clean-up, the produced syngas can be co-fired in the CHP unit. This paper discusses the economic performance of this type of retrofit, with specific emphasis on the impact of the following parameters: (i) the original NGCC CHP plant's power-to-heat ratio; (ii) the size of the district-heating system's annual heat-energy demand; (iii) the fuel mix in the district-heating system; and (iv) the availability of low-cost waste-heat that can be delivered to the district-heating system. The economic performance of the retrofitted CHP unit is measured as the overall cost of electricity production (COE). COE is analysed for four different energy-market parameter sets (referred to as Scenarios), including fuel prices, costs associated with energy and climate change policy instruments, and market electricity prices. The results indicate that even relatively high costs associated with CO2 emissions are insufficient to motivate retrofitting an NGCC CHP unit with an integrated biofuel-gasification unit. To promote this type of retrofit, an additional premium value for electricity generated from renewable fuel sources is required (such as the Swedish REC renewable energy certificate system). An unexpected result of this study is that the required value of REC is essentially independent of the energy market scenario considered. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

This type of situation may be particularly relevant if future CO2 abatement policies require that owners of natural gas fired CHP units reduce CO2 emissions. The study investigates the technical, economic and environmental performance of the CHP unit for different fractions of gasified biofuel in the unit's fuel mix. The power plant simulation program GateCycle was used for plant performance evaluation. The calculations are based on a large size (about 300 MWe) NGCC CHP plant that is planned to be built on the West coast of Sweden, producing electricity and district heating for the local energy utility company. The results from this study show that it is possible to co-fire up to 40% (energy basis) biofuel product gas in the CHP unit. At this level of product gas co-firing, the unit's electrical and total efficiencies decrease by approximately 2%-points, compared to operation on natural gas only. Global CO2 emissions can be reduced by approximately 400,000 tonnes/year. The total costs for the local utility company depend on the prevailing CO2 taxation rules, and on the assumed premium value of the renewable power produced. For the base case conditions assumed in the study, the cost of electricity (COE) for a natural gas fired NGCC CHP unit is 253 SEK/MWh, increasing to 306 SEK/MWh when a biofuel gasifier is integrated to the unit. A premium value for renewable electricity of 285 SEK/MWh is required for equal COE values to be achieved by the two systems. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, oxy-co-gasification with biomass implies the use of a renewable resource and additional CO2 reduction. Proper gasifier operation is a key issue in both techniques. A model of an entrained flow gasifier, validated with nearby 3000 actual steady-state operation data (4800 h), is used to study co-gasification of coal, petroleum coke and up to 10% of several types of biomass. As a result, influence of fuel variation in gasifier efficiency and modifications in operation that should be made in oxy-co-gasification are obtained. The model is also used to build reference operation maps (graphs where the main gasification parameters are related to the degrees of freedom that the operator has). A general method for building experimental operation maps only from plant data has also been applied to the gasifier. Tendencies of the maps are the same of those of the model-made maps. In conclusion, oxy-co-gasification is possible providing that operation is adapted. A validated model can be very useful to predict operation points for new fuel mixtures. Operation maps are practical tools that help to operate and diagnose a system (e.g. a gasifier). They allow to understand how it works, to optimise its operation and to avoid wrong operation that may cause plant shut off. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The identification of the best PAFC plant size thus represents a key target resulting in significant economic savings. Therefore, in this paper, several hybrid scenarios are investigated, taking nine hospitals of Ferrara province (Italy) as the study sample. Investigations reveal that the more the proper sizing is carried out in search of the highest environmental and energy benefits, the higher the financial returns will be. The knowledge of this size effect could be adopted as a useful design guideline and can be taken as a first criterion for the adoption of these systems.

In cogeneration systems, the efficiency of energy conversion increases to over 80% as compared to an average of 30-35% for conventional fossil fuel fired electricity generation systems. This increase in energy efficiency can result in lower costs and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions when compared to the conventional methods of generating heat and electricity separately. Cogeneration systems and equipment suitable for residential and small-scale commercial applications like hospitals, hotels or institutional buildings are available, and many new systems are under development. These products are used or aimed for meeting the electrical and thermal demands of a building for space and domestic hot water heating, and potentially, absorption cooling. The aim of this paper is to provide an up-to-date review of the various cogeneration technologies suitable for residential applications. The paper considers the various technologies available and under development for residential, i.e. single-family (&lt;10 kWe) and multi-family (10-30 kWt) applications, with focus on single-family applications. Technologies suitable for residential cogeneration systems include reciprocating internal combustion engine, micro-turbine, fuel cell, and reciprocating external combustion Stirling engine based cogeneration systems.

The analysis focuses first on feebates, a combination of fees and rebates to promote the sale of cleaner new vehicles. The analysis assumes that buyers of new cars may chose between vehicles fueled by gasoline, alcohol, electricity and compressed natural gas. The market shares for new car sales are based on a discrete-choice model estimated from a stated preference survey in California. The analysis is conducted for a hypothetical air shed to illustrate the feasibility of the simulation method. The simulation analysis shows that feebates can lead to important reductions in hydrocarbon emissions, but the reductions will appear gradually as the newer vehicles displace the older vehicles in the air shed. The analysis then focuses on the emissions reduction that could be achieved by scrappage payments to induce early retirement of older cars. The analysis shows that scrappage payments can lead to large, immediate reduction in emissions. The article concludes with a simulation analysis of a combination of scrappage payments and feebates to achieve both immediate and sustained reductions in vehicle emissions. The simulations demonstrate that the emissions reductions could be achieved with rebates and scrappage payments drawn from a single fund financed by the fees imposed on the sale of new cars with high emissions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
