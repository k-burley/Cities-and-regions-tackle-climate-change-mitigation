National estimation still uses a manual calculation. The aim of this study was to estimate the contribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from livestock sector by using ALU tool version 6.0.1, in West Java Province in year 2016 as the case study. The emission were calculated by using Tier-1 and Tier-2 methodologies. Data used were livestock population and emission factors (EF) of CH4 and N2O of any livestock. The results showed that emission from enteric fermentation was 94.754 Gg CH4/year or 2,368.850 Gg CO2e/year with the highest emission from sheep (50.194 Gg CH4/year or 1,254.850 Gg CO2/year). While emission of CH4 from manure was 6,767 Gg CH4/year or 169,175 Gg CO2e/year with the highest emission from dairy cattle (2,870 Gg CH4/year or 71,750 Gg CO2e/year) and direct N2O emission from manure was 0.366 Gg N2O/year or 109.138 Gg CO2e/year with the highest emission from sheep (0.189 Gg N2O/year or 56.212 Gg CO2e/year). As a conclusion, total emission from the livestock sector in West Java Province was 2,647.163 Gg CO2e/year with the largest emission was from enteric fermentation (2,368.850 Gg CO2e/year). This study suggests that ALU tool is applicable to estimate GHG emission for Livestock in Indonesia with limited data available. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","ALU tools; Greenhouse gas emission; livestock; west java province","Agriculture; Animals; Fermentation; Fertilizers; Food technology; Global warming; Logic circuits; Manures; Population statistics; Dairy cattles; Emission factors; Enteric fermentation; GHG emission; livestock; Manure management; Total emissions; West javas; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076642357

However, because of growing concerns over greenhouse gas emissions, the integration of renewable energy sources is mandatory to meet power demands and reduce climatic effects. The advancements in renewable generation sources and battery storage systems pave the way for microgrids (MGs). As a result, MGs are becoming a viable solution for power supply shortage problems in remote-area applications, such as oceanic islands. In this paper, an islanded MG, which consists of PV system, tidal turbine (TT), diesel generator (DG), and Li-ion battery, is considered for Ouessant island in Brittany region in France. The economic operation of the MG is achieved by including battery degradation cost, levelized costs of energy of the PV system and TT, operating and emission costs of DG, and network constraints. The developed model leads to a non-linear and non-convex problem, which unfortunately can converge to a local optimum solution. The problem has, therefore, been relaxed and converted to a convex second-order cone model to achieve an optimal decision strategy for islanded MG operations with a global or near-global solution. Numerical simulations are carried out to prove the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in reducing the operating and emission costs of the islanded MG. It is shown that the developed convex energy management system formulation has an optimality gap of less than 1% with reduced computational cost. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Convex optimization; demand response (DR); energy management system (EMS); island; microgrid (MG); PV system; second-order cone programming; tidal turbine (TT)","Convex optimization; Cost reduction; Energy management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Lithium-ion batteries; Relaxation processes; Tidal power; Demand response; island; Micro grid; PV system; Second-order cone programming; Tidal turbines; Energy management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075531951

However, the widespread applications of CDs in biomedical theranostics, light harvesting, and photocatalysis are limited by the lack of emission and/or excitation in the red/near-infrared (NIR) region. Extensive explorations have been conducted to synthesize CDs with intensive red/NIR emission/excitation (red CDs) by rational design and ingenious synthesis to broaden their applications. This review emphasizes the most recent efforts in the development of CDs with intensive emission at a long wavelength, with a focus on the regulation methods for the optical properties of CDs, including particle size, surface state, and heteroatom doping. Key factors in processing red CDs, such as reaction solvent and precursors, are demonstrated. More importantly, employing polyaromatic and dye molecules as carbon sources is highlighted, which could further expand emission/excitation to the NIR region. The boosting applications of red CDs in white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs), biosensing, bioimaging, theranostics, and photocatalysis are demonstrated. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of red CDs are also discussed. © 2019",,"Biocompatibility; Carbon; Infrared devices; Particle size; Photocatalysis; Extensive explorations; Light-harvesting; Long wavelength; Polyaromatics; Rational design; Reaction solvents; Tunable optical properties; White lightemitting diodes (WLEDs); Optical properties",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066487963

The conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic fuel molecules or other industrial raw materials by electrochemical reduction is an important means to reduce the CO2 content in the atmosphere and establish a new carbon resource balance system. However, the currently used catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction are still unsatisfactory because of several serious problems, such as high overpotential, low selectivity, and high cost. Compared to conventional three-dimensional (3D) catalysts, it is expected that two-dimensional (2D) catalysts with ultra-large surface area, abundant surface atoms, and excellent electrical conductivity along 2D channels could be more beneficial toward CO2 electrochemical reduction. Recently, the application of 2D materials in the field of CO2 electrocatalytic conversion has just begun to receive attention. In this overview, we summarized the latest advances on developing novel 2D materials as catalysts for CO2 electrochemical reduction and highlighted the important role of theoretical simulation in this emerging field. We hope that this overview could provide some guidance for both theoretical and experimental communities to further designing 2D electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction and understanding the corresponding mechanisms.

Our findings revealed that (1) the pH of the precipitation samples has a volume-weighted mean (VWM) of 5.78 and that the acid rain rate is 12%. The enrichment factor (EF), sea salt fraction (SSF), crustal fraction (CF) and anthropogenic fraction (AF) were calculated, and the results indicated that precipitation was characterized by high concentrations of SO4, NH4, Ca and NO3. Na and Cl, Ca and NH4, and SO4 (98.2%) and NO3 (99.8%) were mainly derived from sea salt, earth crust, and anthropogenic activities, respectively. Combined with the air mass trajectory (HYSPLIT (Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory)) and the concentration of non-sea salt (NSS) SO4 and δ34S–SO4nss, the δ34S–SO4sam ranged from −2.6–12.6‰ and atmospheric sulfate was mainly associated with local coal combustion, fossil fuels and the transmission distance of pollution sources from the northwest and southwest in the interior of the continents. (2) An analysis of the river hydrochemical characteristics showed that the cations are mainly Ca and Mg, and they accounted for approximately 90% of the total cations. The anions were mainly HCO3 and SO4, and the hydrochemical composition of the river was mainly controlled by the weathering of carbonate minerals in the river basin. An analysis of the correlation between the changes in the chemical equivalence concentration of [Ca + Mg]/[HCO3+SO4] showed that the ratio of most river water samples was approximately 1, indicating that Ca and Mg in the river need HCO3 and SO4 for chemical equilibrium and that SO4 in the river may be involved in the dissolution of carbonate minerals. (3) Corrections were performed based on the chloride-normalized ratios and the contribution of each terminal element was calculated to estimate the major ions of precipitation input; the results showed that the average contribution ratio of SO4 transported to the river by anthropogenic sulfuric acid in precipitation reached 85.57%. (4) According to the proportional relationships, carbonate weathering accounts for 31.73% of the anthropogenic sulfuric acid via precipitation and would cause an approximate 6.27% increase in carbonate weathering rates but a 19.48% decrease in CO2 consumption rates. Taken together, our results revealed that even in high-carbonate areas of Southwest China, chemical weathering by sulfuric acid can reduce the carbon sink effect caused by carbonate weathering. © 2019","Anthropogenic sulfate; Carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid (SCW); Ionic source; Liujiang river basin; Precipitation; Southwest China","Acid rain; Carbonate minerals; Carbonation; Chemical analysis; Chlorine compounds; Coal combustion; Deposition; Fossil fuels; Hydrochemistry; Positive ions; Precipitation (chemical); River pollution; Rivers; Structural geology; Sulfur compounds; Sulfuric acid; Watersheds; Weathering; Anthropogenic sulfate; Carbonate weathering; Ionic source; River basins; Southwest China; Calcium; air mass; anthropogenic effect; carbon sink; carbonate; chemical composition; chemical weathering; concentration (composition); deposition; enrichment; hydrochemistry; ionic composition; karst; sulfate; sulfuric acid; China; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Liuzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072777013

Taking the provincial data of China from 1999 to 2016 as an example, the empirical results show that during the study period, China's provincial industrial structure rationalizations and advancements have three trends, i.e. rising, U-shaped and inverted U-shaped. In the meantime, China's provincial green development efficiency also has three trends, i.e. rising, falling and U-shaped. Industrial structure rationalization and advancement both have a positive effect on green development efficiency.

After one month of operation of a water-lifting aeration system, the water temperature difference between the bottom and the surface decreased from 9.9 to 3.1◦C, and the concentration of the dissolved oxygen (DO) in the bottom layer increased from 0 to 4.2 mg/L. The existing stratification in the reservoir was successfully eliminated. Total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations were reduced by 47.8%, 66.7%, and 22.9%, respectively. High-throughput sequencing showed that Proteobacteria, Bacteroides, and Actinomycetes accounted for 67.52% to 78.74% of the total bacterial population. Differences in the bacterial changes were observed between the enhanced area and the control area. With the operation of the water-lifting aeration system, the populations of bacteria of the main genera varied temporally and spatially. Principal component analysis pointed out a clear evolution in the vertical distribution of the microbial structure controlled by the operation of the aeration system. Permutational analysis of variance showed a significant difference in the microbial community (p &lt; 0.01). Redundancy analysis showed that physical (water temperature, DO) and chemical environmental factors (Chl-a, TOC, TN) were the key factors affecting the changes in the microbial communities in the reservoir water. In addition, a hierarchical partitioning analysis indicated that T, Chl-a, ORP, TOC, pH, and DO accounted for 24.1%, 8.7%, 6.7%, 6.2%, 5.8%, and 5.1% of such changes, respectively. These results are consistent with the ABT (aggregated boosted tree) analysis for the variations in the functional bacterial community, and provide a theoretical basis for the development and application of biotechnology. © 2019 by the authors.

The problem still exists of subjective decision-making in afforestation. Similar studies have rarely analyzed the long-term effect research of urban forests on air improvement. Using as an example, the city ofWuhan, this paper identifies the regularity between particulate matter concentration and adsorption of sample leaves, and establishes a system dynamics model of ""economy, energy and atmospheric environment."" By combining this regularity with the model, the long-term impact of forest scale on particulate matter and atmospheric environment was simulated. The results show that if the forest coverage rate reaches at least 30%, the annual average concentrations of inhalable particulate matter (PM10) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) can both reach the Grade I limit of national Ambient Air Quality Standard by 2050. The current forest cover is 22.9% of the administrative area. Increasing the forest cover by 600 km2 would increase this percentage to 30% of the total area. In the long run (by the year 2050), however, we showed that this increase would only reduce the annual concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 by 1-2%. Therefore, about 90% of the concentration reduction would still rely on the traditional emission reduction measures. More other ecological functions of forests should be considered in afforestation plan. © 2019 by the authors.","Forest cover; Particulate matter; System dynamics; Wuhan","adsorption; afforestation; air quality; concentration (composition); decision making; forest cover; particulate matter; research work; urban area; urban forestry; China; Hubei; Wuhan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074847268

However, in most previous studies, the synthesis temperature is limited to below 1100 K, which restricts its application. Here, a rapid, in situ 3D heating method to manufacture well-dispersed metal oxide nanoparticles on a 3D carbonized wood (denoted as C-wood) host using microwaves as the driving power is reported. The moderate electronic conductivity of C-wood contributes to the local Joule heating and the good thermal conductivity guarantees the rapid 3D heating of the overall material. The temperature of the C-wood increases from room temperature to ≈2200 K in 4 s (≈550 K s−1), stabilizing to 1400 K, and then cooling back down to room temperature within 2 s. The preloaded precursor salts rapidly decompose and form ultrafine (≈11 nm) metal oxide nanoparticles on the surface of the C-wood during the rapid quenching. The process takes place in air, which helps prevent the metal oxides from being reduced by the carbon.

Using city-level carbon dioxide emission data from Shijiazhuang, a traditional heavy manufacturing city and one of the key cities in Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration in Northern China, this paper employs logarithmic mean Divisia index decomposition method (LMDI) to explore the influence of energy intensity, consumption structure, industry structure, per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and population on Shijiazhuang's total carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 to 2016. The LMDI method is further extended to analyze the impacts of above factors at the industry-segment level. This paper finds that the reduction of energy intensity is the major contributor of decreasing carbon dioxide emissions in Shijiazhuang, whereas the growth of per capita GDP is the main driving force for emission accretion. The dominant industrial segments contributing to increasing emissions in Shijiazhuang City from 2005 to 2016, have changed from CMD (coal mining and dressing), EPSH (electric power, steam and hot water production and supply) to SPFM (smelting and pressing of ferrous metals) and PPC (petroleum processing and coking). The CMD industrial segment shows a significant carbon reducing effort and indicates a strong decoupling status. However, the SPFM and PPC respectively show expansive negative decoupling and weak decoupling status, enlightening a change in the policy focus when Shijiazhuang formulates its emission-reduction plans in the future. This study provides important policy insights for the heavy manufacturing cities in other countries with similar industrial structure, as the industry-based carbon mitigation policies should always be adjusted in different stages of the cities' development according to the change of carbon emission driving industries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Decoupling analysis; Driving force; Industrial city; LMDI","Climate change; Coking; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Manufacture; Petroleum industry; Population statistics; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon mitigation policies; Decoupling analysis; Divisia index decomposition methods; Driving forces; Gross domestic products; Industrial city; LMDI; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073699912

Coupled model parameter estimation (CPE) adjusts model parameters using available observations; then, the observation-adjusted parameters can greatly mitigate the model bias, which has great potential to reduce climate drift and enhance forecast skill in coupled climate models. However, given numerous model parameters that are associated with multiple time scales, how to conduct CPE with the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters (SEMP) is still a popular research topic. With the aid of 3 coupled models, ranging from the conceptual coupled model to the intermediate coupled circulation model, this study has developed a systematic method to implement the SEMP–CPE. Linking coupled model sensitivities with the signal-to-noise ratio of the CPE, the SEMP–CPE method uses a timescale structure with coupled model sensitivities to determine which and how many parameters are estimated simultaneously in each CPE cycle to minimize the error of the coupled model simulation. Given that in a coupled model, the timescales by which different model components sensitively respond to a parameter perturbation can be quite different due to their different variabilities in their characteristic timescales, the first part of our study series focuses on the SEMP–CPE associated with single model component sensitivities. The results show that the quality of the model state analysis (in terms of assimilation) improves with the number of parameters being estimated by the order of sensitivities until the signal-to-noise ratio reaches a low threshold. Only when the most impactful physical parameters are estimated is the error of the state estimation consistently decreasing; as well as the signal-to-noise ratio in state-parameter covariance in SEMP scheme is enhanced. While only the signal extracted from the SEMP–CPE reaches saturated, the signal-to-noise ratio in the SEMP–CPE is maximized, and the state estimation error is minimized. Otherwise, if the parameters with low sensitivities are included in the CPE, the error of the state estimation increases instead. These results provide some insight into simultaneously estimating multiple parameters in a biased coupled general circulation model that assimilates real observations, which further improves climate analysis and prediction initialization. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Coupled parameter estimation; Data assimilation; Simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters; Single model component sensitivities","algorithm; climate modeling; climate prediction; data assimilation; parameter estimation; perturbation; sensitivity analysis; signal-to-noise ratio",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068222368

Ammonia and volatile sulfide compounds (VSCs) are the representative odorants that generated and emitted during the composting process. The emission characteristics of ammonia and VSCs were studied at different workshops in a full-scale municipal sludge-composting plant in North People's Republic of China. Results show that ammonia was the most dominant odorant of all the workshops and relative high concentrations of VSCs were detected at sludge stacking yard and composting workshop. The odor pattern of VSCs at the composting workshop and stacking yard were different. The odor pollution occurred mainly in the first 15 days of the composting process, in which the odor contribution of ammonia increased with time and the VSCs contributed largely in the first 5 days. The cumulative release concentration of VSCs from compost materials was in the order of DMDS (dimethyl disulfide) &gt; DMS (dimethyl sulfide) &gt; CS2 &gt; MT (methyl mercaptan), and the total VSCs release concentration was in the range of 50–3200 μg·m−3. The production of ammonia correlated to the temperature and nitrogen content and state changes, however, the production of VSCs was more complicated due to the reaction and transformation of VSCs. Optimization of aerobic composting conditions and process parameters should be further studied to reduce the emission of odor gas from compost. Implications: Along with the widespread use of sludge aerobic composting in People's Republic of China, the malodor pollution during the composting treatment is becoming a serious environmental issue. The odor pollution occurred mainly in the first 15 days, and ammonia was the main odorant of all the workshops and need to be controlled. Relative high concentrations of VSCs were detected at sludge stacking yard and composting workshop, however, the odor impact of VSCs were different.

The results showed that the rainfall in 2014 was only 47% of long-term mean value (1958-2011). Transpiration accounted for the highest proportion of total water loss in both forests. The stand transpiration of P. tabuliformis and P. orientalis plantations was 247.16 and 259.89 mm, respectively. The other water loss pathways ranked following the order; soil evaporation (P. tabuliformis, 87.26 mm; P. orientalis, 60.02 mm) > canopy interception (P. tabuliformis, 56.63 mm; P. orientalis, 50.23 mm) > litter evaporation (P. tabuliformis, 9.99 mm; P. orientalis, 8.30 mm). Soil water was at a state of the annual deficit but was replenished during the second half of the growing season. The annual water deficit of the P. tabuliformis and P. orientalis stands was 81.24 and 67.45 mm, respectively. Stand water loss was significantly affected by environmental factors. Meanwhile, transpiration was significantly correlated with the stand diameter at breast height. Canopy interception was affected by canopy closure and wind speed. In conclusion, with precipitation as the single water source, water balance in both P. tabuliformis and P. orientalis stands cannot be met during a dry year. Therefore, these stands will face substantial survival challenge associated with precipitation reduction under climate change. © 2019 editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology.

In this study, the particulate matter (PM) levels and gaseous pollutant concentrations during 2018 were examined in Tianjin. The vertical structure of meteorological data at the 250-m tower and the characteristics of turbulence evolution were used to analyse the pollutant occurrence and development during the severe pollutant cases. The maximum PM2.5 values observed in March (~77.1 μg m−3) and November (82.4 μg m−3) as well as the higher PM10 concentration in March–April (~100.0 μg m−3) highlight the contribution of both fine mode and coarse mode particles over Tianjin. The prevailing southerly wind in April was mainly sea winds with larger wind speed at surface and high-altitudes (1.35 m s−1 to 7.98 m s−1), and changed to land breeze in September south-westerly with lower relative humidity (37.6%–46.5%) at 250 m. The photochemical reaction of O3 was affected by the moderate-to-high air temperature, and the distribution of NO2 and SO2 was attributable to the emission and gas-particle transformation under different humidity conditions. The hourly PM2.5 concentration sharply increased to 2.6–5.8 times and lasted for 28–38 h (exceeded 200 μg m−3) during the two pollution events. The variation of turbulent characteristics at different heights could be depressed due to the development of heavy pollution and otherwise could be enhanced by solar radiation. These findings could facilitate understanding the fine structure of temperature-humidity systems and the turbulence characteristics in the boundary layers during typical pollutant events, and their regional climate effects over coastal northern plain cities. © 2019 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Gaseous pollutants; Northern China; Particulate matter; Turbulence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070505350

However, the current studies related to the nexus among them are insufficient, which need to be explored. This article focuses on quantifying the nexus among CO2 emissions, economic development, energy consumption, and urbanization according to data collected from top six provinces (Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu, and Inner Mongolia) of CO2 emissions in China between 1997 and 2015 using multi-variate panel data model (PDM). According to the coefficients in PDM, the energy consumption of Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Hebei, and Shaanxi make the greatest contribution to CO2 emissions and the economic development of Jiangsu and Shandong are deemed as the greatest contributor to CO2 emissions. The Granger causality results illustrate a bi-directional causality exists between economic progress and CO2 emissions and between energy consumption and CO2 emissions for six provinces. Finally, the pathways to handle with the contradictions between economic development and CO2 mitigation of top six provinces are proposed, namely decreasing fossil fuels based energy consumption, giving impetus to renewable energy development, exploring a new evaluation system to judge low carbon economy progress, and increasing investment on equipments to improve energy efficiency. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers","CO2 emissions; economic development; energy consuming; panel data model; urbanization","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Investments; Renewable energy resources; CO2 emissions; Economic development; energy consuming; Panel data models; urbanization; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065157825

Spectroscopic and solid characterization tools including H2-TPR, in situ IR, N2 gas adsorption, CO chemisorption, and TGA-MS were used in the investigation. Ammonia adsorption data suggested that among the studied zeolites, H-FER zeolite contained the highest concentration of framework Al atoms, which are essential for the formation of active extra-framework Fe species. The oxidation state and redox active species of Fe-ZSM-5, Fe-Beta, and Fe-FER catalysts were studied by H2-TPR, which disclosed the presence of a unique reduction peak (originating from N2O pretreatment) centered at approximately 235 °C over the samples. The hydrogen consumption peak was more prominent over Fe-FER than other catalysts, demonstrating that the Fe-FER catalyst contained more active sites for N2O conversion in comparison to Fe-Beta and Fe-ZSM-5 catalysts. For IR spectra of NO adsorbed on the Fe zeolites, a band at 1874 cmâ'1 with a shoulder at 1894 cmâ'1 was observed over the three catalysts, suggesting the presence of extra-framework Fe clusters in ion exchange positions. We demonstrated these clusters are acting as active sites for the oxidation of methane with N2O. Bands of methoxy groups were observed in FTIR profiles of CH4 and N2O adsorbed on Fe-FER, Fe-ZSM-5, and Fe-Beta catalysts at 350 °C. Over Fe-FER, the concentration of silanol-bonded methoxy groups accounted for over 95% of all methoxy groups under all the reaction conditions studied. In comparison, for the Fe-ZSM-5 and Fe-Beta catalysts, the proportion was less than 80%. The catalytic activity studies showed that Fe-FER was the most active catalyst based on methane and N2O conversion, and displayed the highest selectivity to C1-oxygenates and dimethyl ether formation, while Fe-ZSM-5 obtained the highest selectivity to ethylene among the three catalysts.

Advances in emission control technologies since around 1970, however, have partially counteracted emissions increases from the above sectors. Using the fully coupled Community Earth System Model, we quantify the effective radiative forcing (ERF) and climate response to 1970-2010 aerosol changes associated with the above two policy-relevant emission drivers. Emissions from energy-use growth generate a global mean aerosol ERF (mean±1 standard deviation) of -0.31±0.22Wm-2 and result in a global mean cooling (-0.35±0.17 K) and a precipitation reduction (-0.03±0.02mmd-1). By contrast, the avoided emissions from advances in emission control technology, which benefit air quality, generate a global mean ERF of +0.21±0.23Wm-2, a global warming of +0.10±0.13 K, and global mean precipitation increase of +0.01±0.02mmd-1. Despite the relatively small changes in global mean precipitation, these two emission drivers have profound impacts at regional scales, in particular over Asia and Europe. The total net aerosol impacts on climate are dominated by energy-use growth, from Asia in particular. However, technology advances outweigh energy-use growth over Europe and North America. Various non-linear processes are involved along the pathway from aerosol and their precursor emissions to radiative forcing and ultimately to climate responses, suggesting that the diagnosed aerosol forcing and effects must be interpreted in the context of experiment designs. Further, the temperature response per unit aerosol ERF varies significantly across many factors, including location and magnitude of emission changes, implying that ERF, and the related metrics, needs to be used very carefully for aerosols. Future aerosol-related emission pathways have large temporal and spatial uncertainties; our findings provide useful information for both assessing and interpreting such uncertainties, and they may help inform future climate change impact reduction strategies. © 2019 EDP Sciences.

Coastal regions in eastern and southern China may experience especially negative effects because of the frequent occurrence of tropical cyclones (TCs). This study presented a hazard assessment framework for TCs-induced flash floods under climate change scenarios and assessed future inundations in Hadahe River basin, which is in northeastern China. From 1965 to 2014, there were twenty-four TCs ranging from severe tropical storm to super typhoon over Hadahe River basin in twenty years. General Circulation Models (GCMs) are too coarse to depict the impact of TCs on extreme precipitation; therefore, hourly precipitation data from two gauges and the tracks of TCs were used to assess the impact of TCs. An extreme precipitation event on 3–4 August 2012 and the same 600-year future probabilistic extreme rainfall were utilized to investigate the impact of climate change. Daily precipitation data from eight climate models from the NEX-GDDP dataset during 1965–2005 and 2050–2099 represented historical and future simulation conditions, respectively. The hydrologic model HEC-HMS was integrated with the hydraulic model FLO-2D to simulate discharges and inundations of past and future TCs episodes. The results showed that flooded area is projected to increase by 6.6% and 7.8% for inundation depth between 1.0 and 3.0 m under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively. For inundation depth over 3.0 m, flooded area is projected to increase by 17.6% and 22.0%. Relative change of flash flood extent increases as inundation depth increases, indicating that climate change is likely to increase the risk of flash floods. Additional adaptation measures are needed to make the Hadahe River basin and other similar coastal basins more resilient. The results also indicated that considering the impact of TCs produces a more reliable assessment of future flash floods in coastal regions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Extreme precipitation; Flash flood hazard; Tropical cyclones","Climate models; Coastal zones; Flood control; Floods; Hazards; Hurricanes; Hydraulic models; Precipitation (meteorology); Rivers; Storms; Tropics; Watersheds; Climate change scenarios; Daily precipitations; Extreme precipitation; Extreme precipitation events; Flash flood; General circulation model; Severe tropical storm; Tropical cyclone; Climate change; rain; climate change; coastal zone; extreme event; flash flood; hazard assessment; precipitation (climatology); tropical cyclone; Article; China; climate change; flooding; hazard assessment; hurricane; mathematical model; precipitation; priority journal; risk factor; river basin; seashore; seasonal variation; water cycle; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069659648

Some scholars have allocated CO2 emissions to China's industrial sectors in reaching national reduction targets, yet industrial sectors' burden-sharing problem for carbon mitigation at the provincial level has not been well addressed. Given the goal of realizing China's national carbon mitigation target by 2030, we applied a nonlinear quota allocation model to obtain the optimal allocation of emission reduction quotas among 37 industrial sectors in the Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration in China (comprising Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei). Compared to Beijing and Tianjin, the secondary industry in Hebei bears the highest reduction responsibilities, given that Hebei will experience the largest carbon emissions, at 0.42 billion tons in 2030, which is 80.04% of the total emissions in the Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration. Energy production and heavy manufacturing sectors serve as the major carbon emitters and have relatively high carbon intensities, which indicates that they have significant potential and major responsibilities for impacting carbon mitigation. Based on differences in urban function and development mode, the same industrial sectors in the three provinces have different obligations for emission reductions. This study is vital to allocate reduction responsibilities among industrial sectors and to discrete key sector categories bearing a higher mitigation burden. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon intensity; Industrial sectors; Jing-Jin-Ji urban agglomeration; Quota allocationmodeling","carbon emission; emission control; energy use; industrial agglomeration; industrial emission; mitigation; resource allocation; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Jingjinji; Jingjinji; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075887006

Meanwhile, climate change has magnified urban drought in both frequency and severity, putting tremendous pressure on a city's water supply. Therefore, tackling the challenges of urban drought is an integral part of achieving the targets set in at least 5 different Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Yet, the current literatures on drought have not placed sufficient emphasis on urban drought challenge in achieving the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This review is intended to fill this knowledge gap by identifying the key concepts behind urban drought, including the definition, occurrence, characteristics, formation, and impacts. Then, four sub-categories of urban drought are proposed, including precipitation-induced, runoff-induced, pollution-induced, and demand-induced urban droughts. These sub-categories can support city stakeholders in taking drought mitigation actions and advancing the following SDGs: SDG 6 “Clean water and sanitation”, SDG 11 “Sustainable cities and communities”, SDG 12 “Responsible production and consumption”, SDG 13 “Climate actions”, and SDG 15 “Life on land”. To further support cities in taking concrete actions in reaching the listed SDGs, this perspective proposes five actions that city stakeholders can undertake in enhancing drought resilience and preparedness:1) Raising public awareness on water right and water saving; 2) Fostering flexible reliable, and integrated urban water supply; 3) Improving efficiency of urban water management; 4) Investing in sustainability science research for urban drought; and 5) Strengthening resilience efforts via international cooperation. In short, this review contains a wealth of insights on urban drought and highlights the intrinsic connections between drought resilience and the 2030 SDGs. It also proposes five action steps for policymakers and city stakeholders that would support them in taking the first step to combat and mitigate the impacts of urban droughts. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Drought; Resilience; SDGs; Sustainability; Urban","Climate change; International cooperation; Planning; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water management; Water supply; Improving efficiency; Production and consumption; Resilience; SDGs; Sustainability science; Sustainable cities; Urban; Urban water management; Drought; climate change; drought; stakeholder; sustainability; sustainable development; urban planning; water management; water supply; air pollution; drought; ecosystem resilience; environmental policy; environmental sanitation; environmental sustainability; evaporation; evapotranspiration; human; population research; precipitation; priority journal; reliability; Review; risk factor; runoff; suicide; sustainable development; sustainable development goal; urban area; water supply",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069840559

The urban gas pipeline network system has also become a part of the urban basic service facilities, providing energy for the city. The safe operation of the gas pipeline network is closely related to the daily production and life of the people. Because of the economic and other reasons, there are many old gas pipelines in the central city of Changling County. In addition, there is no effective renewal for a long time. These pipelines are running ill, the overall gas distribution is seriously reduced, and there is a leakage phenomenon. There are great potential safety hazards, which also causes a great waste of energy. Therefore, in this context, the government of Changling County takes active measures to solve the problem of the old gas pipeline network in the central city, and promotes the task of gas pipeline network transformation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Briquetting; Emission control; Energy conservation; Gases; Proven reserves; Daily production; Domestic fuels; Energy saving and emission reductions; Gas distribution; Gas pipeline networks; Potential safety hazards; Safe operation; Service facilities; Pipelines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077130387

Fiber-shaped capacitors (FCs) offer high power densities and excellent flexibility but low energy densities. Zn-ion capacitors have high energy density and other advantages, such as low cost, nontoxicity, reversible Faradaic reaction, and broad operating voltage windows. However, Zn-ion capacitors have not been applied in wearable electronics due to the use of liquid electrolytes. Here, the first quasisolid-state Zn-ion hybrid FC (ZnFC) based on three rationally designed components is demonstrated. First, hydrothermally assembled high surface area and conductive reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotube composite fibers serve as capacitor-type positive electrodes. Second, graphite fibers coated with a uniform Zn layer work as battery-type negative electrodes. Third, a new neutral ZnSO4-filled polyacrylic acid hydrogel act as the quasisolid-state electrolyte, which offers high ionic conductivity and excellent stretchability. The assembled ZnFC delivers a high energy density of 48.5 mWh cm−3 at a power density of 179.9 mW cm−3. Further, Zn dendrite formation that commonly happens under high current density is efficiently suppressed on the fiber electrode, leading to superior cycling stability. Multiple ZnFCs are integrated as flexible energy storage units to power wearable devices under different deformation conditions. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, CO2 emissions from airport operations have rarely been estimated and discussed. We investigate the main driving forces of airport CO2 emissions by using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models, separately, to investigate whether urbanization drives airport CO2 emissions and to investigate spatial heterogeneity at the city level. Nighttime light (NTL) data from satellite observations are adopted as a proxy for urbanization. We obtained energy consumption data by end-use purpose for 70 airports in China and calculated the CO2 emissions from on-ground airport operations. The median CO2 emissions of the 70 sample airports are estimated to be 15.9 million tonnes for 2015. Results from the GWR model indicate that airport CO2 emissions are affected by five main factors: urbanization, foreign direct investment, the share of tertiary industry in gross domestic output, passenger turnover of civil aviation and passenger turnover of railways. The elasticity of urbanization shows an increasing trend from the east of China to the west. The spatial heterogeneity of the CO2 emissions of the five airport clusters that are located in five urban agglomerations is discussed. In order to achieve effective reductions of CO2 emissions from airports, policy-makers should consider the spatial heterogeneity of the major driving factors of carbon emissions in different regions to avoid carbon lock-in. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Airport CO2 emissions; China; Geographically weighted regression; Nighttime light data","Airports; Civil aviation; Digital storage; Energy utilization; Investments; Carbon dioxide emissions; China; CO2 emissions; Energy consumption datum; Foreign direct investments; Geographically weighted regression; Geographically weighted regression models; Night-time lights; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; airport; carbon emission; least squares method; nightglow; regression analysis; satellite data; spatial analysis; urbanization; airport; Article; aviation; carbon footprint; China; energy consumption; geographically weighted regression; gross national product; investment; mathematical model; night; railway; spatial analysis; telecommunication; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071118977

However, these estimates have large uncertainty due to the incomplete temporal and spatial coverage of CO2 flux. Here, we evaluated the seasonal and spatial dynamics and controlling factors of CO2 exchange across the water–air interface and their potential role in regional and global carbon budgets in 25 river transects along Guijiang River (GJR), southwestern China, in July and December 2016. These river transects were divided into upstream (US), middle (MS), and downstream (DS) reaches in non-karst, karst and mixed areas, respectively. The riverine CO2 fluxes showed obvious seasonal variations, ranging from 5.62 ± 5.93 g/(m2.d) in summer to 1.25 ± 4.02 g/(m2.d) in winter, with an average value of 3.44 ± 5.48 g/(m2.d). The riverine CO2 fluxes exhibited significant spatial patterns, where the highest and lowest averaged CO2 fluxes occurred at MS in summer and winter, respectively. Generally, the river was a carbon source with respect to the atmosphere throughout the year. However, the CO2 fluxes were obviously restrained by aquatic metabolism and the carbonate buffer system in winter. Additionally, the absorbed CO2 at MS was due to strong photosynthetic and carbonate buffer activities. Carbon loss via atmospheric exchange in the GJR river basin was 0.032 ± 0.047 Tg C/yr, which accounted for 20.1% of the riverine dissolved carbon fluxes (0.160 ± 0.075 Tg C/yr). Thus, 0.128Tg C yr−1 was sequestered in the GJR basin. Our results demonstrate the need to emphasize the importance of aquatic photosynthesis and the carbonate buffer system in restraining CO2 degassing in karst rivers. It is important to underscore the detailed spatiotemporal changes in CO2 flux to reduce uncertainty in current estimates of global riverine CO2 emissions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic photosynthesis; Carbon exchange; Carbonate buffer; Karst river systems; Seasonal and spatial variations","Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Forestry; Landforms; Phase interfaces; Photosynthesis; Uncertainty analysis; Aquatic photosynthesis; Carbon dioxide exchange; Carbon exchange; Carbonate buffer system; River systems; Spatial variations; Spatio-temporal changes; Temporal and spatial; Rivers; buffering; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbonate; degassing; dissolved gas; gas exchange; karst; metabolism; photosynthesis; river basin; river system; seasonal variation; spatial variation; China; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Gui River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071278613

The impulse response function, variance decomposition and panel causality test in the panel vector autoregressive model evaluated in detail the impact of foreign capital inflows, domestic capital inputs and economic growth on CO2 emissions in regions of different energy intensity. The study found that on the whole, foreign direct investment has no significant impact on China's carbon dioxide emissions. China's carbon dioxide emissions are mainly driven by domestic investment and economic growth; the sub-regional analysis, based on different energy intensities, shows that in areas of low energy intensity and medium energy intensity, foreign direct investment has a significant impact on CO2 emissions, and the contribution of foreign investment to CO2 emissions is between 12.2% and 14.1%.

The fastest degradation rates were achieved under sulfate-reducing conditions with half-lives of 49.51 days for n-alkanes and 58.74 days for PAHs. For short-chain n-alkanes and low-molecular weight (LMW) PAHs, relatively higher removal efficiencies were achieved under nitrate- and ferric-reducing conditions. The degradation of long-chain n-alkanes and high-molecular weight (HMW) PAHs coupled to methanogenesis was the most favored as compared with other reducing conditions. Carboxylation was found to be the principle mechanism for regulating n-alkane degradation coupled to denitrification, while the activation of n-alkanes by the addition of fumarate was the principle mechanism for the n-alkane degradation under sulfate-reducing conditions. The anaerobic metabolism of n-alkanes may not proceed via fumarate addition or carboxylation under ferric-reducing and methanogenic conditions. Illumina HiSeq sequencing revealed dissimilar structures of the microbial communities under various reducing conditions. It is hypothesized that the utilization of different TEAs for n-alkane and PAH degradation resulted in distinct microbial community structures, which were highly correlated with the varied degradation behaviors of petroleum hydrocarbons in sediment. The current results may provide reference value on better understanding the biodegradation behaviors of n-alkanes and PAHs in association with the induced microbial communities in sedimentary environments under the four typical reducing conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biodegradation behavior; Microbial community; Petroleum hydrocarbon; Reducing condition; Terminal electron acceptor","alkane; fumaric acid; nitrate; petroleum derivative; hydrocarbon; petroleum; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; sulfate; biodegradation; methanogenesis; microbial community; petroleum hydrocarbon; reduction; sediment chemistry; sulfate-reducing bacterium; addition reaction; anaerobic metabolism; Article; biodegradation; carboxylation; community structure; controlled study; denitrification; gene sequence; half life time; methanogenesis; microbial community; molecular weight; nonhuman; reduction (chemistry); sediment; sulfate reducing bacterium; bioremediation; microflora; Biodegradation, Environmental; Hydrocarbons; Microbiota; Petroleum; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Sulfates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071047977

First, a modified Peng–Robinson equation of state coupled with the parachor model is applied to calculate the vapour–liquid equilibrium and interfacial tensions (IFTs) at a variation of pore radii and different pressures, based on which the MMPs are determined from the diminishing interface method. Second, by means of the factorial-analysis approach and calculated IFTs and minimum miscibility pressures (MMPs), the following five factors are specifically studied to evaluate their main and interactive effects on the IFTs and MMPs: temperature, initial oil and gas compositions, feed gas to oil ratio (feed GOR), and pore radius. It is found that the main and interactive effects of the five factors on the IFTs are inconsistent at different pressures. The effects of the five factors on the MMPs are evaluated quantitatively, which contribute to screen out significant factors, analyze interactions, and identify schemes for the miscible CO2 enhanced oil recovery. The most positive significant main and interactive effects on the MMPs are Factors C (gas composition) and AB (temperature and oil composition), whereas the most negative results are Factors E (pore radius) and AC (temperature and gas compositions). A three-factor analysis indicates that the MMP is substantially reduced in small pores by controlling the percentage of the CH4-dominated gas in the impure CO2 sample and lowering the feed GOR. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Factorial analysis; Interfacial tension; Minimum miscibility pressure; Modified equation of state; Nanopores","Carbon dioxide; Enhanced recovery; Equations of state of liquids; Factor analysis; Gases; Interface states; Nanopores; Solubility; Surface tension; Different pressures; Enhanced oil recovery; Equation of state; Factorial analysis; Interactive effect; Minimum miscibility pressure; Modified equation; Two-stage analysis; Phase interfaces; carbon dioxide; Article; chemical composition; chemical interaction; equilibrium constant; factor analysis; miscibility; oil and gas field; priority journal; quantitative analysis; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070419140

However, in general, it has been seldom used to investigate the organic matter (OM) depositional environment and source of oil. In this paper, we present such an FTIR spectroscopy study based on a case investigation in the early Permian alkaline-lacustrine-derived oils from the Mahu sag, Junggar Basin, Northwest China. The results define 13 FTIR structural parameters that are associated with the OM depositional environment, source, and maturity of oil based on a comparison with well-established oil carbon isotopic and biomarker data. These would be general to the alkaline (saline)-lacustrine petroleum systems worldwide. Further combined FTIR spectroscopy and biomarker parameters in the study area reveal that the lower Permian Fengcheng formation-derived oils in the Mahu sag were generated from source rocks deposited in alkaline-saline to brackish-freshwater environments. The oils have a zoned occurrence, reflecting the general rules of hydrocarbon generation in alkaline lacustrine environments. This study represents the first FTIR spectroscopy study of alkaline-lacustrine oils and suggests that FTIR spectroscopy appears to have considerable potential in advancing oil geochemical research.

Using Beijing as an example, this study analyzes how a large metropolitan city could develop a low-carbon heating sector towards 2030. We simulate different scenarios of deploying natural gas boilers and heat pumps to reduce CO2 emissions of Beijing's heating sector in the EnergyPLAN model. A high share of natural gas heating is found to be incompatible with a continuous decrease in direct CO2 emissions from the heating sector and thus cannot be a long-term solution for low-carbon heating in Beijing. Increasing the share of heat pump heating is advantageous in terms of carbon emissions, air pollutants emissions, benefits to the power grid, and economic operation. The proportion of heating provided by heat pumps increased to 25%, the capacity of district gas boilers remains unchanged and the CO2 emissions per unit of electricity decrease to 0.31 Mt/TWh offers a promising pathway to decarbonize Beijing's heating sector and the total CO2 emissions of Beijing's heating system in 2030 will be 21% lower than the level in 2015. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; EnergyPLAN; Heating systems; Low-carbon","Air pollution; Boilers; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission networks; Gas emissions; Heat pump systems; Natural gas; Pumps; Beijing; Economic operations; EnergyPLAN; Heating system; Heating system using heat pumps; Long-term solutions; Low carbon; Metropolitan cities; Heating; carbon emission; cost analysis; economic analysis; electricity generation; emission control; heating; long-term change; metropolitan area; natural gas; pump; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073651920

With help of these efforts, a bi-level multiobjective stochastic approach to improve irrigation water use efficiency and decrease the pollution production of agronomic measures in the process of agricultural production. The proposed framework integrate bi-level multiobjective programming and stochastic expectation programming to not only make tradeoffs among multiple concerns from two-level decision makers, but also deal with the randomness of runoff. Then, the proposed approach was applied to a real-world case in the middle reaches of the Heihe River basin, northwest China. Results show that the developed approach can improve irrigation water use efficiency, reduce CO2 emission, expand ecosystem service values, and provide more profitable and environment-friendly agricultural planting strategies to decision makers, which can further contribute to the sustainable development of agriculture. Furthermore, by comparing the bi-level multiobjective stochastic programming (BMSP) model with the other six models originated from developed model, it can be found that 1) the single objective model can obtain the best value of that objective, but cannot readily consider other important aspects; 2) the multiobjective models can make tradeoffs among multiple objectives; 3) the BMSP model can reflect the leader-follower relationship in the optimization process.

Similarly in Morocco, this sector is the largest energy consumer reaching a threshold of 33%, 26% for residential buildings and 7% for services (hotels, office buildings, schools, universities and hospitals). Thus, building consumption exceeds the industry sector (21%) and agriculture (8%) [2]. Such patterns are expected to increase quickly in the coming years. Integrating solar Photovoltaic (PV) panels in urban environments is an efficient solution to reduce electricity bills and CO2 emissions of buildings. This paper proposes a methodology to investigate the impact of large-scale deployment of solar PV on the urban micro-climate. This methodology consists of using the building footprints, building materials and meteorological conditions to calculate the urban surface temperatures before and after the integration of PV panels with the aim to assess any PV related Heat Islands (PVHI). © 2019 IEEE.","buildings; component; energy consumption; impact; local temperatures; micro-climates; Photovoltaic Heat Island; PVs; roofs","Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Office buildings; Photovoltaic cells; Service industry; Solar power generation; Building footprint; Large-scale deployment; Local temperature; Meteorological condition; Residential building; Solar photovoltaics; Urban environments; Urban surface temperature; Atmospheric temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084676117

A remaining question is whether the experience of an extreme weather event increases climate change concern via experiential learning or reinforces existing views via motivated reasoning. Building on this work, we explore the relationship between personal experience and climate change policy preferences using surveys in 10 communities that experienced extreme weather events (3 tornadoes, 3 floods, 2 wildfires, 1 hurricane and 1 landslide). We find that self-reported personal harm aligns with objective measures of event impacts and that personal harm (i.e., experience) is associated with higher levels of policy support. However, we do not find that objective measures of event impacts are related to policy support. Though political ideology (i.e., motivated reasoning) dominates our model of policy support in predictable ways, personal harm moderates this relationship suggesting that conservatives reporting higher levels of personal harm from the event are, on average, more likely to express support for climate policy than those reporting lower levels of harm. We postulate that while extreme weather events may serve as teachable moments on climate change, their lessons may only reach conservatives who feel personally harmed, even in the communities most affected. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change policy; Extreme weather events; Personal experience; Public opinion","climate change; environmental policy; extreme event; hazard management; hurricane; learning; nature-society relations; political ideology; public attitude; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074325119

We show that Italy can be considered a good representative for rice cultivation in temperate regions that are not freshwater-limited. However, this situation is changing. We report strong evidence linking the largest European reduction of seasonal surface water that have gradually occurred since 2000 over the rice cultivation area of Northern Italy, to the change in paddy management from traditional continuous flooding to a less greenhouse-gases-emitting practice, that is, dry-seeding with postponed flooding. This change was accompanied by several improvements in agro-practices and crop varieties. Concurrently, regional climate rapidly shifted towards sunnier weather conditions that partly contributed to higher rice yields and stability, decoupling yields from inter-annual climate variability, but also reducing water availability. In Northern Italy, a complete shift of rice cultivation towards dry-seeding is not compatible with seasonal water availability, and a number of drawbacks, with respect to the traditional wet seeding, are also identified from literature review. Therefore, in the context of near-term climate change, sustainable rice cultivation in the middle latitudes seems achievable (without limiting production and/or increasing volatility) by balancing traditional and dry-seeding. © 2019 The Authors Land Degradation & Development Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","agroecosystems; climate change; climate change adaptation and mitigation; land-use change; rice paddy fields; sustainability; water management","Climate models; Cultivation; Floods; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Remote sensing; Surface waters; Sustainable development; Water management; Agro-ecosystems; Climate change adaptation; Climate variability; Land-use change; Literature reviews; Rice paddy; Surface temperatures; Water availability; Climate change; adaptive management; agricultural ecosystem; climate change; land use change; numerical model; paddy field; remote sensing; rice; surface temperature; sustainability; temperate environment; water management; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075332337

To integrate these applications, 15 poplar plantings from nine long-term phytoremediation installations were sampled from 2012 to 2013 in the Midwest (Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin) and Southeast (Alabama, Florida, North Carolina) United States. In this review, we report summary results of this sampling and how performance at each site compared with comparable phytoremediation systems in the literature. We review significant genotypic differences from each planting within the context of provisioning (i.e., biomass production) and regulating (i.e., carbon sequestration) ecosystem services and how they relate to the need for a cleaner environment during times of accelerated ecological degradation. Overall, the contaminated poplar sites provided these ecosystem services comparable to noncontaminated poplar sites used for bioenergy and biofuels feedstock production. For example, phytoremediation trees at the Midwestern sites had biomass values ranging from 4.4 to 15.5 Mg ha−1 y−1, which was ~20% less relative to bioenergy trees (p =.0938). Results were similar for diameter and carbon, with some genotype × environment interactions resulting in phytoremediation trees exhibiting substantially greater growth and productivity (i.e., +131% at one site). As illustrated in the current review, phytoremediation success can be increased with the identification and deployment of genotypes tailored to grow well and tolerate a broad diversity of contaminants (generalists) (i.e., ‘DN34’, ‘NM6’, ‘7300501’) versus those that significantly outperform their counterparts under unique site conditions (specialists) (i.e., ‘220-5’, ‘51-5’, ‘S13C20’).

Both SABER and MLS show a rapid global H2O increase of 5–6% per decade in the lower stratosphere after the 2001 drop. The increasing zonal mean H2O at 40°N in SABER and MLS is consistent with the Boulder frost point hygrometer data in the lower stratosphere. The global distribution of SABER and MLS H2O trends are positive at most altitudes and latitudes, and they peak in the tropical lower stratosphere. In the mesosphere the SABER H2O trend is 0.1–0.2 ppmv per decade and the MLS H2O trend is 0.2–0.3 ppmv per decade. The trend and solar cycle response derived from the observations are compared against the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM).

The aim is to identify the optimal combination of day and night routes by trading off between fuel and staff costs. A Linear Programming (LP) formulation for the Night Time Vehicle Routing Problem (NTVRP) is introduced. The model is then applied to a case study using real data from a department store in Bangkok, Thailand. A fuel consumption model is used alongside an emission model to estimate the beneficial impact of NTVRP on both costs and emissions. Results show that when demand is high and 55 tonne heavy goods vehicles are used, the cost savings are about 16.7 percent. More significantly, CO2 emissions are reduced by more than 30 percent. With low demand, cost savings are more than 30.8 percent, together with a 28.2 percent reduction in CO2 emissions. Overall, the case study shows that nighttime delivery is a viable option to increase efficiency and sustainability of a logistics company. © 2019 IEEE.","Emissions; Nighttime Delivery; Sustainability; Urban Logistics; Vehicle Routing Problem","Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Fuels; Knowledge engineering; Linear programming; Particulate emissions; Sustainable development; Vehicle routing; Vehicles; Consumption modeling; Heavy goods vehicles; Logistics distribution; Nighttime Delivery; Operational parameters; Optimal combination; Urban logistics; Vehicle Routing Problems; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078995356

An in situ passive warming experiment manipulated by open-top chambers and artificial nitrogen (N) addition was deployed in a lacustrine wetland of Xingkai Lake for 3 consecutive years. The annual changes and allocations of the aboveground biomass of Glyceria spiculosa, and decomposition dynamics of the total litter and cotton strips as standard references were observed. Results showed that the aboveground biomass was significantly affected by warming and increased from 99.43 ± 10.59 g m−2 (ambient) to 112.02 ± 8.08 g m−2 (ca. +1 °C) and 117.21 ± 9.92 g m−2 (ca. +2 °C). N addition had a more positive effect on the annual aboveground biomass accumulations than warming, for the relative importance weights of N addition were 2.60 and 1.49 times greater than warming in 2011 and 2013 respectively. Their main effects on the allocations had significant interannual variations, and their interaction effects were dependent on organ and year. The decomposition constant (k-value) of the litter and cotton strips were 0.747 yr−1 and 2.057 yr−1, respectively. Compared to warming and N addition, the internal quality characterized by Lignocellulose index and soil organisms reflected by litterbag size played overwhelming role in decomposition dynamics, with 2 orders greater of relative importance weights in 2011 and 2012. Our results highlight the importance of interannual variation for differentiating the contributions of external and internal factors to boreal wetland plant biomass accumulation and decomposition. Given the asymmetric responses of accumulation and decomposition, the C storage in the litter would increase in long term. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Global warming; Glyceria spiculosa; Plant responses; Wetland carbon balance; Xingkai Lake","Cotton; Global warming; Lakes; Nitrogen; Wetlands; Above ground biomass; Carbon balance; Comparative analysis; Decomposition dynamic; Glyceria spiculosa; Interannual variation; Litter decomposition; Plant response; Biomass; nitrogen; aboveground biomass; annual variation; bioaccumulation; carbon balance; carbon sequestration; comparative study; decomposition; global warming; lacustrine environment; litter; nitrogen; plant; warming; wetland; analysis of variance; Article; bioaccumulation; biomass; carbon storage; climate change; controlled study; Glyceria spiculosa; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; litter decomposition; microclimate; nonhuman; Poaceae; priority journal; simulation; soil analysis; soil organism; warming; biomass; greenhouse effect; plant development; wetland; China; Heilongjiang; Xingkai Lake; Glyceria; Gossypium hirsutum; Biomass; Climate Change; Global Warming; Nitrogen; Plant Development; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069050823

Importantly, the pore structure and permeability of the storage rock are affected by fines release, migration, and reattachment in the initial stage of CO2 injection, especially in unconsolidated sandstone reservoirs. It is thus necessary to better understand the pore structure changes and the associated permeability evolution during and after CO2 injection. We thus imaged an unconsolidated sandstone at reservoir conditions before and after CO2-saturated brine (“live brine”) injection in situ via X-ray microcomputed tomography to explore the effects of fines migration and mineral dissolution induced by CO2 injection. We found that in the examined sample, large pores dominated the total porosity, and porosity slightly increased after live-brine flooding. Moreover, and importantly, the pore structure changed significantly: large pores were further enlarged while small pores shrank or even disappeared. These structural changes in the tested sample were caused by mobilized fines due to the high-fluid interstitial velocity, which eventually reattached to the grains further downstream. Furthermore, the impact of the pore structural changes on permeability were analyzed in detail numerically. These permeability results are consistent with a fines migration mechanism where reattached fines block pore throats and thus decrease permeability drastically. We therefore can conclude that live brine injected into the examined unconsolidated sandstone will slightly improve storage space (porosity slightly increased); however, injectivity may be severely impaired by the permeability reduction. ©2019.

The Beijing Olympic Games in 2022 is the first time in the history of China to host the Winter Olympics, and in Beijing, Zhangjiakou two cities together, Beijing will soon become the history of the Olympic Games held the first summer Olympic Games and the Winter Olympic Games city. Therefore, during the Olympic Games held its research on the food supply problems of athletes, but also the issue of cold chain food distribution has become the focus of the study. Based on the model of vehicle routing problem with time window, we construct a cold chain food distribution model with the aim of minimizing the total cost of distribution. At the same time, in order to respond to the call of green Olympics and green supply chain, we consider energy saving and emission reduction. In the cost calculation, the environmental cost of carbon emission is added. Secondly, the routing of the distribution is optimized by the saving algorithm, and the distribution route is improved by the actual example given. The detailed distribution scheme is given Finally, according to the optimization results, some suggestions are put forward for the cold chain food distribution in the winter Olympic Games. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

It is well known that most long-term records are affected by artificial shifts most commonly caused by station relocation, instrumental modification and local environmental changes. Therefore, for the first time, a thorough homogenization (detection and correction) routine was developed and implemented in the long-term records. Consequently, a new daily adjusted dataset has been generated, including 34 temperature stations and 60 precipitation stations. Based on this comprehensive dataset, 38 extreme indices recommended by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and the Expert Team on Sector-specific Climate Indices have been calculated. These indices will help various sectors to plan properly mitigation actions and adaptation for climate change, in addition to facilitating future studies for the EM. The results showed highly significant changes in temperature extremes associated with warming, especially for those indices derived from the daily minimum temperature (TN, 1950–2017), whereas the maximum temperature (TX) exhibited a similar increasing magnitude of the TN (~0.55°C/decade) in the last 30 years. The warming trends, which are non-monotonic, seem to have been particularly strong since the early 1990s. The coastal area is characterized by higher heat stress during the nighttime, while mountains exhibit a strong tendency towards increasing temperatures during the noon hours. A reduction in the total precipitation amount and in the number of wet days with a tendency towards more intense wet days was found. Although all the regional trends of the precipitation indices were not statistically significant (p ≤.05), they showed a fine spatial coherence. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","climate change; East Mediterranean; extreme indices; homogenization; Israel; precipitation; temperature; trend analysis","Climatology; Earth atmosphere; Homogenization method; Precipitation (chemical); Temperature; Climate change detection; East Mediterranean; Environmental change; extreme indices; Increasing temperatures; Israel; Precipitation indices; Trend analysis; Climate change; air temperature; climate change; database; extreme event; precipitation (climatology); trend analysis; Israel; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066048254

Landsat-based 100 m resolution LCZ maps have been classified by the World Urban Database and Portal Tool (WUDAPT) method using a random forest (RF) machine learning classifier. Some studies have proposed modified RF and convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches. This study aims to compare CNN with an RF classifier for LCZ mapping in great detail. We designed five schemes (three RF-based schemes (S1–S3) and two CNN-based ones (S4–S5)), which consist of various combinations of input features from bitemporal Landsat 8 data over four global mega cities: Rome, Hong Kong, Madrid, and Chicago. Among the five schemes, the CNN-based one with the incorporation of a larger neighborhood information showed the best classification performance. When compared to the WUDAPT workflow, the overall accuracies for entire land cover classes (OA) and for urban LCZ types (i.e., LCZ1-10; OAurb) increased by about 6–8% and 10–13%, respectively, for the four cities. The transferability of LCZ models for the four cities were evaluated, showing that CNN consistently resulted in higher accuracy (increased by about 7–18% and 18–29% for OA and OAurb, respectively) than RF. This study revealed that the CNN classifier classified particularly well for the specific LCZ classes in which buildings were mixed with trees or buildings or plants were sparsely distributed.

To recover energy from hydrate-bearing sediments safely and effectively requires a fundamental understanding of the dynamic behaviour of hydrates in sandy media. Past field production tests have proved the technical feasibility of gas production from hydrate reservoirs. However, technical challenges (e.g. sand production and excessive water production) remain in realizing long-term economic-viable production. In this study, we investigate the effect of various wellbore designs (specifically the shape and the location of perforations) on the fluid production behaviour in aqueous-rich hydrate-bearing sediments. Slotted-liner design was first-time incorporated in depressurization under different bottom-hole pressures (2.5 MPa, 3.0 MPa and 4.0 MPa). Continuous gas production and step-wise water production during the early stage of depressurization were observed at all pressures because of the change of fluid flow path from reservoir to wellbore. Compared with traditional borehole design, slotted-liner design showed advantage in controlling water production under low BHP (2.5 MPa). Using wellbores with different perforation locations, it was observed that perforation location does not pose a significant impact on the behaviour of gas production; whereas, middle perforation away from the aqueous-rich and hydrate-rich region yielded the least water production. The experimental results from this study demonstrated the possibility of employing slotted-liner well and varying the perforation location in reducing water production from methane hydrate-bearing sediments. Our findings can pave way for the testing of novel wellbore designs to further enhance gas recovery and reduce water production from hydrate reservoirs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Depressurization; Energy recovery; Hydrate-bearing sediments; Production behaviour; Slotted-liner; Wellbore design","Boreholes; Bottom hole pressure; Energy resources; Flow of fluids; Gas hydrates; Hydration; Location; Methane; Oil field equipment; Recovery; Sediments; Well testing; Depressurizations; Energy recovery; Hydrate bearing sediments; Slotted-liner; Wellbore; Gas industry; design method; energy resource; gas hydrate; induced response; industrial production; methane; pressure effect; recovery; technical efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070418556

Urbanization has critical implications for global land cover. Relevant literature has provided evidence attributing climatic effects to urban expansion; however, few studies have investigated the effect on public health and pollutant sensitivity to emissions. This study aimed to characterize the effect of urbanization-induced changes in regional climate on ozone (O3), to evaluate ozone sensitivity to nitrogen oxide (NOx) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, and to estimate premature mortalities due to O3 exposure. We employed atmospheric models with the higher-order decoupled direct method to simulate effects of urbanization on O3 and to determine O3 sensitivity to NOx and VOC emissions. China-specific concentration response functions were utilized to estimate cardiovascular and respiratory mortalities due to ozone exposure. Urbanization increased O3, which translated to a 39.6% increase in O3-induced premature mortality (1,100 deaths). Moreover, O3 has become less/more sensitive to unit changes in NOx and VOC emissions in various cities. Urban greening may reduce urban temperature, but it may increase O3 in some cities due to the additional VOC emissions of greening. These findings highlight the strong interactions between land use policies, urban climate adaptation strategies, and air quality policies, suggesting the need of cobeneficial strategies and policies. We proposed a precision environmental management concept that emphasizes the importance of considering the specific atmospheric condition and composition of a city when formulating its environmental policies. ©2019.

We used data from the Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas version 5, which include about 2 million pCO2 measurements in the tropical Pacific. Unlike many previous studies that estimated pCO2 fields from relationships with other variables like sea surface temperature, we developed gridded products of monthly means using a technique to interpolate measured pCO2 values. Large seasonal variation of pCO2 appears in the cold tongue region (EQ–20°S, east of 120°W) corresponding to the seasonal variation of coastal upwelling, and in the off-equatorial region where the thermodynamic effect on pCO2 dominates. Consistent with previous findings, pCO2 along the equator declines during El Niño due to weakening of the easterly winds and therefore reduced upwelling of CO2 rich subsurface water. We also quantified the spatial distribution of the long-term pCO2 trend beyond the area-averaged trend presented previously. The long-term trend of pCO2 is positive in all regions with an area average of 1.8 ± 0.1 μatm yr−1. However, along the equator the trend is &gt; 2 μatm yr−1 linked to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation forcing. Using the same methodology, we also analyzed about 20,000 surface nutrient measurements from the Global Ocean Data Analysis Project version 2, World Ocean Database 2013, and ship-of-opportunity sampling by the National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan. We present the spatial patterns of reduced surface nutrient concentration in the central to eastern tropics along the equator during El Niño, but there are not enough data to characterize the trends of nutrients in the tropical Pacific. Decorrelation analyses are also applied using covariance between pCO2 anomalies separated by a lag increment for zonal, meridional, and temporal directions. The e-folding scale of pCO2 is estimated to be 6° in latitude, 13° in longitude, and 2 months with a signal-to-noise ratio of 4, which are used as input for the interpolation as well as an assessment of ideal observation density and frequency. Decorrelation analyses such as this are critical for evaluating existing observing system design and informing future sampling strategies. © 2019 The Authors",,"Carbon dioxide; Nutrients; Oceanography; Signal to noise ratio; Tropics; Environmental studies; Nutrient concentrations; Observing system designs; Pacific decadal oscillation; Sea surface temperature (SST); Ship of opportunities; Spatiotemporal variability; Water partial pressure; Surface waters; carbon dioxide; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; signal-to-noise ratio; spatial distribution; spatiotemporal analysis; surface water; Japan; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075437752

In order to improve the methane recovery from dairy manure, soil, which has the potential of enhancing methane production from biomass, was used in an AD system as an additive. The results showed that the AD process performance and methane production efficiency were significantly improved by soil; an improvement in daily methane production, reduced time to steady state, enhancement of the methane content, and reduction in carbon dioxide content were obtained. The maximum methane production was obtained at a feedstock: soil ratio of 2.5:1 with yellow soil addition, which was 147.7 L/kg volatile solids (VS) and 25.4% higher than that of the control. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene and synthetic solution with cations equivalent to those of yellow and black soil revealed that soil addition mainly stimulated the growth of bacterial genera Ochrobactrum and Clostridium and archaeal genera Methanosaeta and Methanosarcina. The method of ion extraction was used to extract ions from the soil, and the ions were verified to be a main contributor to methane production improvement. By mimicking the cation components of soil, a synthetic solution was prepared and used in the AD system. The results showed that the cations contained in the ion liquid played a key role in improving methane production. The contribution of VS in the soil to the AD system was studied and found to have no significant effect on the improvement in methane production. It was found that the cations in soil played a key role in enhancing AD efficiency. Therefore, the simplified, low cost, and efficient approach used in this study had good practicability and could be used for treating other various biowastes with high energy recovery, which has the potential of promoting the development of AD technology. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Dairy manure; Methane production; Soil cations","Carbon dioxide; Fertilizers; Liquid methane; Manures; Methane; Positive ions; Soils; 16S ribosomal RNA; Dairy manures; High-throughput sequencing; Methane production; Methane recovery; Microbial communities; Process performance; Synthetic solutions; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068956336

Although adverse health effects gradually emerge, research determining individual vulnerability is limited. This study estimated the relationship between air pollution and obesity. Individual information of 13,414 respondents from 125 cities is used in the analysis. This study employs ordinary least squares (OLS) and multinomial logit model (m-logit) to estimate the impact of air pollution on obesity. We choose different air pollution and Body Mass Index (BMI) indicators for estimation. Empirical results show Air Quality Index (AQI) is significantly positively associated with the BMI score. As AQI adds one unit, the BMI score increases 0.031 (SE = 0.002; p &lt; 0.001). The influence coefficients of particle size smaller than 2.5 µm (PM2.5), particle size smaller than 10 µm (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) to the BMI score are 0.034 (SE = 0.002; p &lt; 0.001), 0.023 (SE = 0.001; p &lt; 0.001), 0.52 (SE = 0.095; p &lt; 0.001), 0.045 (SE = 0.004; p &lt; 0.001), 0.021 (SE = 0.002; p &lt; 0.001), 0.008 (SE = 0.003; p = 0.015), respectively. Generally, air pollution has an adverse effect on body weight. CO is the most influential pollutant, and female, middle-aged, and low-education populations are more severely affected. The results confirm that the adverse health effects of air pollution should be considered when making the air pollution policies. Findings also provide justification for health interventions, especially for people with obesity. © 2019 by the authors.

Thirteen carbonyl compounds were quantified, with average total mixing ratios of 11.29 ± 3.85 ppbv at ZY and 8.72 ± 3.75 ppbv at JX. Formaldehyde (HCHO), acetaldehyde (CH3CHO) and acetone (CH3COCH3) were the three most abundant atmospheric carbonyl compounds, accounting for &gt;85% of the total carbonyl compound mixing ratio at both sites. HCHO exhibited highest concentrations during summer and lowest concentrations during winter at ZY and JX. In contrast, CH3CHO and CH3COCH3 showed an opposite seasonal trend, suggesting that HCHO may be mainly generated by photochemical reactions in summer, while CH3CHO and CH3COCH3 might be originate from primary emissions in winter. Diurnal variations were assessed, with HCHO exhibiting peak values at midnight in all seasons, with levels associated with diesel-fuel vehicle emissions. High ratios of C1/C2 and C2/C3 were observed in summer at ZY and JX, suggesting biogenic sources significantly contribute to carbonyl compound formation. Furthermore, linear regression analysis showed a high HCHO contribution from primary sources in winter (73.5% at ZY, 58.6% at JX) and secondary sources in summer (67.2% at ZY, 47.4% at JX).

By improving the “green development indicator system” formulated by the National Development and Reform Commission of China, the green development index (GDI) of Shaanxi Province from 2007 to 2016 was measured and compared with Shaanxi's ecological footprint (EF) and related indicators. The results showed that (1) the GDI in Shaanxi Province increased from 42.774 in 2007 to 64.971 in 2016, while during the same period, the per capita EF increased from 1.994 ha/cap to 2.719 ha/cap, the ecological deficit increased from 0.782 ha/cap to 1.500 ha/cap, and the ecological pressure index increased from 1.645 to 2.176.

This study attempts to examine the impacts of export on carbon intensity by proposing a novel framework that targeting at the gap between export aggregate carbon intensity (EACI) and self aggregate carbon intensity (SACI) which constitute the total carbon intensity to reveal export effects. Multi-region input-output model was used to calculate EACI and SACI in 44 world regions in 2014. LMDI approach was further adopted to decompose the gap between EACI and SACI from sectoral perspective. Some main results are concluded. (1) On global scale, exports increased 7.2% in carbon intensity. On national scale, exports showed increased effects on most countries (42/44). The regional EACI/SACI ranged from 0.79 to 3.53. (2) Sectoral aggregate carbon intensity (ACI) of export decreased EACI by 51 g/$, while sectoral aggregate structure (AS) of export increased EACI by 186 g/$, resulting in 135 g/$ increase in EACI globally. (3) For most regions, although ACI of carbon-intensive sectors (Elec., Metal, Nonmetal, Trans., Chem. and Coke&petrol.) in exports was lower than that in self, the high AS of these sectors in exports resulted in EACI higher than SACI, causing pulling force of export on global carbon intensity. Thus reducing carbon-intensive industries’ weights in exports would have great effects on global and national carbon intensity mitigation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon intensity; Input-output model; International export; LMDI; Sectoral structure","Aggregates; Climate change; Economics; Sustainable development; Carbon intensity; Environmental pollutions; Environmental sustainability; Global climate changes; Input output model; International export; LMDI; Multi-region input-output models; Carbon; carbon emission; economic growth; emission inventory; environmental economics; environmental indicator; global change; input-output analysis; international trade; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069544015

As the world's biggest developing country, China is participating in combating climate change by promoting a low carbon economy within the context of global warming. This paper summarizes the pathways of China's low carbon economy including the aspects of energy, industry, low carbon cities, circular economy and low carbon technology, afforestation and carbon sink, the carbon emission trading market and carbon emission reduction targets. There are many achievements in the implementation of low carbon policies. For example, carbon emission intensity has been reduced drastically along with the optimizing of energy and industry structure and a nationwide carbon trading market for electricity industry has been established. However, some problems remain, such as the weakness of public participation, the ineffectiveness of unified policies for certain regions and the absence of long-term planning for low carbon cities development. Therefore, we propose some policy recommendations for the future low carbon economy development in China. Firstly, comprehensive and long-term planning should be involved in all the low carbon economy pathways. Secondly, to coordinate the relationship between central and local governments and narrow the gap between poor and rich regions, different strategies of carbon emission performance assessment should be applied for different regions. Thirdly, enterprises should cooperate with scientific research institutions to explored low carbon technologies. Finally, relevant institutions should be regulated to realize comprehensive low carbon transition through reasonable and feasible low carbon pathways in China. These policy recommendations will provide new perspectives for China's future low carbon economy development and guide practices for combating climate change. © 2019 The Author(s).","China; Economy; Low carbon; Pathway","afforestation; carbon emission; climate change; developing world; economic system; emission control; emissions trading; environmental issue; environmental policy; global warming; local participation; participatory approach; performance assessment; policy implementation; China",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075599993

However, it is a critical challenge in materials chemistry to rationally shape the local nanoscale curvatures of colloidal nanoparticles during the growth owing to the constraints of their flat facets. Here we demonstrate a synthetic mechanism that could cooperatively mediate local nanoparticle surface curvature patchiness and shape symmetries during one-step colloidal growth. The idea is to tailor host-guest supramolecular recognition using fluorocarbon and hydrocarbon molecules that regulate interfacial energy during the nanoparticle growth. Such delicate regulation enables a degree of freedom in control over the local nanoparticle curvatures during the growth, resulting in intriguing plasmonic properties. More interestingly, a morphological shape transformation was induced by such curvature changes from anisotropic nanorods to isotropic nanospheres. This unique approach of the spontaneous curvature/structural transformation of plasmonic nanoparticles exploits the mutual interplay between competing supramolecules and colloidal growth. It may ultimately allow for accurate controlling nanoscale objects with varied degree of complexity that could open the door to a myriad of surface chemical, optical, and biomedical applications. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,"Colloids; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Medical applications; Molecules; Nanorods; Plasmonics; Supramolecular chemistry; Biomedical applications; Colloidal nanoparticles; Hydrocarbon molecules; Plasmonic nanostructures; Plasmonic properties; Shape transformation; Spontaneous curvature; Supramolecular recognition; Plasmonic nanoparticles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075269695

In this work, the Environmental Benefits Mapping and Analysis Program tool is applied to estimate the health and economic impacts of projected changes in O3 and PM2.5 in the U.S. in future (2046–2055) decade relative to current (2001–2010) decade under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 climate scenarios. Future annual-mean O3 reductions under RCP 4.5 prevent ~1,800 all-cause mortality, 761 respiratory hospital admissions (HA), and ~1.2 million school loss days annually, and result in economic benefits of ~16 billion, 29 million, and 132 million U.S. dollars (USD), respectively. By contrast, the projected future annual-mean O3 increases under RCP8.5 cause ~2,400 mortality, 941 respiratory HA, and ~1.6 million school loss days annually and result in economic disbenefits of ~21 billion, 36 million, and 175 million USD, respectively. Health benefits of reduced O3 double under RCP4.5 and health dis-benefits of increased O3 increase by 1.5 times under RCP8.5 in future with 2050 population and baseline incidence rate. Because of the reduction in projected future PM2.5 over CONUS under both scenarios, the annual avoided all-cause deaths, cardiovascular HA, respiratory HA, and work loss days are ~63,000 and ~83,000, ~5,300 and ~7,000, ~12,000 and ~15,000, and ~7.8 million and ~10 million, respectively, leading to economic benefits of ~560 and ~740 billion, ~240 and ~320 million, ~450 and ~590 million, and ~1,400 and ~1,900 million USD for RCP4.5 and 8.5, respectively. Health benefits of reduced PM2.5 for future almost double under both scenarios with the largest benefits in urban areas. RCP8.5 projects larger health and economic benefits due to a greater reduction in PM2.5 but with a warmer atmosphere and higher O3 pollution than RCP4.5.

Based hourly observations at 23 sites in western China from June 2016 to May 2017, concentrations of most pollutants were higher outside the Tibetan Plateau, lowest in summer and highest in winter, the exception being O3. This was partially because meteorological conditions in winter were found to the most unfavorable to pollutant dispersion and dilution than other seasons. Pollutant concentrations at most sites were correlated with the residential emissions which were higher in winter, but anti-correlated with the industrial emissions which were lower during the winter holiday period. The Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) simulations of four pollution control strategies indicated that reduction of residential emissions is crucial to alleviate PM2.5, PM10, and CO pollution in western China, although reduction of industrial and transport emissions can reduce SO2 and NO2, respectively. Since PM2.5 and PM10 were also found to be the species most and next frequently responsible for extremely serious pollution in western China, respectively, we recommend pollution control regulations that target residential emissions. We have carried out a comprehensive analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics of six air pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, SO2, NO2, and O3) in western China, based on abundant in situ observations, and then analyzed their relationship with meteorological and emission factors.

China is the world's largest carbon dioxide emitter, and China's Low-Carbon Pilot (CLCP) policy has significantly reduced carbon dioxide emissions and achieved expected benefits. However, is environmental quality improving at the expense of economic growth? This article selects macro panel data of 286 Chinese prefecture-level cities and micro data of Chinese industrial enterprises from 2001 to 2013, takes the CLCP policy implementation by five provinces and eight cities as a quasi-natural experiment, uses difference-in-differences (DID) method to investigate the causal effect of CLCP policy on regional economic growth and enterprise behavior. The results are as follows. First, the CLCP policy significantly promotes regional economic growth. Moreover, as the implementation time of the policy continues, environmental regulation has a greater effect of promoting economic growth. Second, although the CLCP policy significantly increases various production costs, it also promotes the growth of enterprises' output and benefits. Third, under the pressure of enterprise cost increase caused by environmental regulation, enterprises choose the positive way of strengthening internal management, improving efficiency and increasing innovation instead of choosing the negative way of trans-regional transfer, and finally achieve an improvement in output and benefits. © Author(s) 2019.","Behavior of enterprise; CLCP policy; DID; Economic growth",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078448962

The proposed approach pivots on global climate models and their downscaled simulation data for future climate prediction. For scour hazard analysis, the climate simulation data are converted to flow discharge data using hydrologic modeling. Because future climates involve considerable uncertainties, different climate futures and global climate models are considered. In addition, long-term regional analyses are adopted to reduce these uncertainties. The proposed approach is applied to bridges over the Lehigh River in the Lehigh River watershed. With data from various public databases, the long-term regional risk of bridge scour is assessed using various global climate models under three climate change scenarios. The impact of climate change on bridge scour risk is quantified in monetary terms.

The effects of crop abandonment on soil restoration may depend on soil properties and climatic conditions of an area. In particular, soil hydraulic properties affect the vegetation recovery process. The objective of this study was to investigate the succession changes in water flow as a result of changes in soil hydraulic properties after crop abandonment under drought and non-drought conditions, and under water uptake by co-occurring perennial plants to clarify the observation that typical perennial grass species are seldom observed in abandoned fields. Soil hydraulic properties were measured in croplands which had been abandoned for different periods (2, 9, and 18 years ago) and in a grazed grassland site (control site). Hydrological processes in the soil profiles were simulated with soil hydraulic properties under drought and non-drought summer conditions with water uptake from perennial grass species. Suctioning the surface soils increased with the period of abandonment, with this trend being particularly obvious in a drought year. Soil water appears to be restricted in the later succession stage of abandoned fields and in grazed grassland for drought-tolerant plants. Dry soil and climate conditions are important factors determining the intrusion of the typical perennial grass, Stipa krylovii, into degraded abandoned fields. A water availability with low pressure (plant can use with low pressure) made difficult the intrusion of typical perennial grasses to abandoned cropland. This abiotic relation between soil hydraulic properties and climate conditions may play an important role for plant succession in abandoned cropland. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","unsaturated hydraulic conductivity; water restoration","grassland; hydraulic conductivity; perennial plant; semiarid region; soil degradation; soil profile; soil property; water flow; water uptake; Mongolia; Poaceae; Stipa krylovii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075134486

The N addition and decreased precipitation treatments had a positive effect on mean CO2 efflux (2.61 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1 for control, 4.26 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1 for N addition, 3.62 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1 for reduction in precipitation) and mean rates of CH4 uptake (0.00088 μmol CH4 m−2 s−1 for control, 0.00154 μmol CH4 m−2 s−1 for N addition, 0.00151 μmol m−2 s−1 for reduction in precipitation) during the growing season. The combined N addition and reduction in precipitation also led to increased soil CO2 efflux and CH4 uptake, but the combined response was weaker than the response to single variable treatments (3.10 μmol CO2 m−2 s−1 and 0.00130 μmol CH4 m−2 s−1 interaction), indicating antagonistic effects of the combined treatment. At the seasonal scale, changes in soil CO2 and CH4 efflux were complex, especially in the spring freezing and thawing period, during which pulses of CO2 efflux and CH4 uptake occurred. Decreased precipitation altered the composition of the bacterial community in the winter and growing seasons, and composition of the microbial community also showed a seasonal change. However, changes in microbial community structure under N addition, precipitation reduction and their interaction might be important factors leading to an increase or decrease in soil carbon efflux. Highlights: How global changes (N addition and decreased precipitation) affect soil C flux. Seasonal effects of global changes on soil C flux were analysed quantitatively. Decreased precipitation and N-addition increased soil CO2 flux and decreased soil CH4 flux.

To address this problem, the low-carbon characteristics of the circular economy provide a theoretical basis for reducing carbon emissions in this sector. Using a life cycle assessment approach, in the present study, we compared the differences in traditional and biogas-based circular economic models of pig farming by analyzing the carbon footprint inventories. Based on the carbon emission reduction in the circular economic model, we estimated the environmental and economic benefits under carbon trading. Using pig farming in Liaoning Province, China, as an example, the circular economic model could effectively reduce the global warming potential of large-scale pig farming by 3,091,891.8 t carbon dioxide equivalents by diverting otherwise-heaped pig excrement for biogas generation. Under carbon trading, the reduction in carbon emissions under the circular model could generate an economic benefit of USD 30.92 million. Therefore, the carbon emission reductions of this model could have major environmental and economic benefits. Based on micro-parameters examined at the provincial scale in China, the findings of this analysis can serve as a reference for the formulation of government policies to realize global environmental benefits and develop a circular economy in livestock and poultry farming. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biogas; Carbon footprint; Carbon trading; Circular economy; Life cycle assessment","Agriculture; Artificial life; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Economic analysis; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Mammals; Biogas generation; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon trading; Circular economy; Environmental benefits; Global warming potential; Liaoning Province; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070579272

Next, to promote cooperative pollution control among the provinces in the study region, the minimum cost-remaining savings method was applied to build a regional cooperation model for benefit allocation. To illustrate the model, it was applied to SO2 pollution control in China's Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region as an empirical example based on data from 2015. Compared with the current system (separate control of air pollution), the cooperative econometric model of regional air pollution increased employment by 1.339 × 106 persons (by 3.1%). At the same time, the total comprehensive control cost for air pollution decreased by US$23.73 × 106, thereby decreasing the comprehensive cost of pollution control by 9.6%. Through the benefit allocation model, the comprehensive control cost savings were US$11.88 × 106 for Beijing, US$10.14 × 106 for Tianjin, and US$1.71 × 106 for Hebei. Sensitivity analysis was performed to validate the cooperative econometric model. This demonstrated that the model was effective, stable, and practical. The present results can therefore provide an important reference to support regional decision-making, while promoting cooperation and win-win for participants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Cooperative econometric model; Employment; Minimum costs-remaining savings method; Sensitivity analysis","Air pollution; Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Employment; Resource allocation; Sensitivity analysis; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Bi-objective optimization; Comprehensive controls; Econometric model; Minimum costs-remaining savings; Negative externalities; Regional air pollution; Regional cooperation; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069910155

However, regional emissions allowances have not been fully discussed based on Japan's INDCs target, which considers the regional socio-economic features. Given this, this study points out a soft-path for a fair and efficient quota allocation by proposing an integrated bilevel equilibrium model within a hierarchical structure consisting of the national government and 47 prefectural governments. This proposed model can be changed into a single level solvable equilibrium model, which can be solved by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method. The major findings show that Hokkaido, Tokyo and Osaka were allowed the largest emissions quotas, while Tottori, Saga and Okinawa had the lowest emissions quotas. And the equity is necessary to be considered along with improving the emissions efficiency when reallocating carbon emission quotas, otherwise, the initiative to reduce emissions will not take place in prefectures with higher efficiency performance. Based on the findings, energy policy implications can be generated based on the above quantitative analysis to form a fair and efficient emission quota system at a sub-national level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biobjective bilevel equilibrium model; Carbon emission quotas; Particle swarm optimization method; Regional energy policy; Zero sum gains-data envelopment analysis","Carbon; Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Energy policy; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Public policy; Bilevel; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; Hierarchical structures; National governments; Particle swarm optimization method; Particle swarm optimization method (PSO); Zero sums; Greenhouse gases; algorithm; carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; emission control; energy policy; optimization; policy analysis; policy approach; pollution policy; regional policy; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071471484

Herein, we develop a facile approach to embed Co nanoparticles to hollow TiO2 nanorods (HTONR) to form a hybrid catalyst (Co/HTONR) by one-step calcination of a self-assembly of cobalt(II) and tetrabutyl titanate. After coating with a carbon nanolayer, the photocatalytic activity of the material towards CO2-to-CO conversion was boosted, CO generation rate of up to 54,000 μmol h-1 g-1 was observed in the first hour of reaction. The average production rate of 28,500 μmol h-1 g-1 with a selectivity of 78.1% for the transformation can be achieved even though the irradiation time was prolonged to 3 h. The excellent efficiency was partially attributed to the carbon nanolayer improving the electron transmission properties and accordingly enhanced the catalytic activities comparison to that of Co@TiO2. Additionally, the introduction of hollow TiO2 nanorods increases the local CO2 concentration owing to its adsorption. And existence of -OH group on the surface of TiO2 facilitated the key kinetic step of proton transfer during CO2 photoreduction, which is further confirmed by an investigation of catalytic efficiencies as a function of amount of H2O. © 2019 IEEE.","CO; CO 2 reduction; Co@TiO 2 /C hybrid catalyst; photocatalysis; visible light","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cobalt compounds; Irradiation; Light; Nanorods; Photocatalytic activity; Self assembly; TiO2 nanoparticles; Titanium dioxide; Catalytic efficiencies; CO2 concentration; Efficient catalysts; Electron transmission; Photocatalytic reduction; Solar-light-driven; Tetra-butyl titanate; Visible-light irradiation; Catalyst activity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083371234

This study applies the method of multi-scale input-output analysis (MSIO) to analyze the consumption-based carbon emissions of Tianjin in 2012. This method can estimate the carbon emissions embodied in imported products. The results reveal that the production-based carbon emissions of Tianjin were 1.52 × 108 tonnes CO2 in 2012, which had increased over 50% since 2007. Meanwhile, the consumption-based carbon emissions of Tianjin city were 2.55 × 108 tonnes CO2, 1.71 times higher than those in 2007 and 1.67 times the amount of production-based carbon emissions in 2012. Regarding the total embodied carbon emissions involved in the Tianjin economy in 2012, about 6% were from foreign countries, over 60% were from other regions of China, and only one-third were territorial-based or production-based carbon emissions. Correspondingly, Tianjin respectively exported 11% and 34% of the total embodied carbon emissions to foreign countries and other regions in China, while over half were embodied in the local final demand. Tianjin was a carbon budget importer in domestic trade and an exporter in international trade in both 2007 and 2012. However, when both domestic and international trades are considered, Tianjin had shifted from a carbon budget exporter in 2007 to an importer in 2012. Since 2007, the carbon nexus between Tianjin and other regions in China had become much closer (carbon emissions embodied in domestic trade increased 103.47%), but the connection with foreign countries became looser (carbon emissions embodied in international trade decreased 21.96%). Compared to Beijing in 2012, it is evident that there were less carbon emission transfer issues for Tianjin city. © 2019 by the authors.","Consumption-based carbon emissions; Multi-scale input-output analysis; Tianjin; Urban carbon emissions","carbon budget; carbon emission; emission control; environmental economics; input-output analysis; international trade; trade-environment relations; Beijing [China]; China; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075891077

The implementation is achieved by separating the original fuel jet into two parallel jets which will be used as rich and lean streams. An effort has been made to develop a 13-step reaction mechanism and NOx evolution UDFs (user defined functions) for better understanding the interactions between MILD combustion and fuel-rich/lean technology. The experiment of the reference case (Combustion and Flame 156.9 (2009): 1771-1784) is well reproduced by the present numerical simulation, indicating high reliability of developed models. The validity of the further reduction of NOx emission is assessed by the comparison among inner-fuel-rich (IFR), outer-fuel-rich (OFR), and reference cases resulting from the adjustment of the fuel supply through the two fuel-rich/lean jets. The results show that both IFR and OFR configurations succeed in achieving further reduction of NOx emission as compared with the reference case, which stems from both thermal and fuel paths. Specifically, the decrease of thermal-NO emission originates from the contraction of high-temperature regions (&gt;1800 K), where nearly 94% reduction occurs within the temperature range of 1800 K and 1950 K while only 6% within 1950 K and 2030 K despite their high temperature sensitivity. The reduction of the fuel-NO emission is mainly attributed to the promoted NO reduction on char surface and neutralization with HCN and NH3. Generally, the NOx emission can be minimized by enlarging the equivalence ratio difference between rich and lean jets, and the OFR configuration exhibits a higher potential than the IFR counterparts. However, since a relatively high temperature (1623 K) secondary air was used in the experiment, the maximum NOx reduction potential was limited to only 2.5%. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","clean coal technologies; fuel-rich/lean technology; MILD combustion; nitrogen evolution; NOx prediction model","Ammonia; Coal; Emission control; Fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Reduction; Clean coal technologies; Combustion furnaces; High temperature sensitivity; MILD combustion; Moderate and intense low oxygen dilutions; NOx prediction; Reaction mechanism; User Defined Functions; Coal combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071289267

Hydrogen can only be a clean and sustainable fuel if it is generated from renewable energy sources (RES). Thus, it is important to evaluate viability of RES for hydrogen production. This study developed a two-stage fuzzy MCDM (Multi-criteria decision-making) approach to select the most efficient RES. In the first stage, fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) obtained the relative weights of four criteria for the selection of best RES. These criteria included commercial potential, environmental impacts, economic benefits, and social acceptance. In the second stage, data envelopment analysis (DEA) measured the relative efficiency of RES using weights of criteria as outputs, and the cost of RES-based electricity generation as input. The results indicated that wind and solar are the most efficient sources of hydrogen production in Pakistan. Municipal solid waste (MSW) and biomass can also be considered a feedstock for the hydrogen economy. Geothermal reported to be the less efficient source and thus is not recommended at present.

The present study explored the relationship between urban compactness and energy-related per capita GHG emissions among different countries using panel data models. To obtain the energy-related GHG emissions, the GHGs emitted by the energy sector were calculated on a per capita basis according to the “2006 IPCC guidelines for national GHG inventories”. Urban compactness was assessed by two indicators, namely population density and the compactness index, of which the latter measures the overall physical compactness of urban land patches. The case study of the 28 EU member countries during 2000–2012 demonstrated that the two indicators did not correlate with each other and they affected energy-related per capita GHG emissions in contrasting ways. That is to say, population density and the overall physical compactness of urban land patches exerted significant negative and positive influences on energy-related per capita GHG emissions, respectively.

Understanding the causes of SAD patterns is a major stepping stone toward understanding of how ecological communities are organized. While SAD patterns have been well studied in marine environments and forests, knowledge of SADs in response to environmental or human-induced gradients is limited, especially in desert environments. In this study, we used structural equation modeling to analyze the effects of grazing disturbance and climate on plant SADs in a desert steppe of Inner Mongolia, China, aiming to shed light on the assembly of plant communities in this region. We found both grazing disturbance and climate influenced SADs but through different pathways and with different magnitude. Grazing intensity affected SADs by reducing evenness and richness of common species, while increases in annual mean temperature and annual rainfall affected SADs by increasing richness of rare species. Climate had 30% greater effect on community structure than grazing disturbance, highlighting the role of climate in community assembly in desert environments where biological processes are highly constrained by water. We further found geometric series was associated with low annual rainfall and low richness, and log-normal with high annual rainfall, high richness and evenness. Geometric best fit for majority of the cases (60%) regardless of grazing intensity suggesting niche differentiation on the local scale is the principal community assembly process operating in the study region. Environmental filtering and niche differentiation may be concurrently operating to structure plant communities in this region. © 2019 The Ecological Society of Japan","climate; community assembly; desert steppe; grazing disturbance; niche differentiation","abundance; anthropogenic effect; community ecology; community structure; disturbance; environmental factor; niche; plant community; rainfall; species evenness; species richness; steppe; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073947089

Such differences can influence the way residents regulate indoor thermal environment to maintain their comfort, particularly in hot summer and cold winter (HSCW) climate. This study aims to better understand the differences in the perceptions of thermal comfort and related adaptive behaviours between urban and rural residents. Thermal comfort field experiments are conducted in the central region of China that has climatic characteristics of HSCW. A total of 513 and 2171 survey responses have been collected and matched with concurrent environmental measurements in typical residential buildings in Wuhan city (urban) and Luotuoao village (rural), respectively. The majority of survey respondents accept their indoor thermal environments, even though instrumentally measured physical conditions fall well beyond the comfort zone prescribed in the international standards. The differences of indoor thermal comfort between rural and urban residents are attributed to clothing habits, daily activity patterns, housing openness and potential thermal expectation.

In addition, the effect of demand-response on the operation of a MES is studied. Firstly, based on uncertainties of a MES, a probability distribution model is introduced. Secondly, with the objectives of maximizing operating revenue, and minimizing operational risk and carbon emissions, a multi-objective coordinated dispatching optimization model was constructed. To solve this model, this paper linearizes objective functions and constraints via fuzzy satisfaction theory, then establishes the input-output matrix of the model and calculates the optimal weight coefficients of different objective functions via the rough set method. Next, a comprehensive dispatching optimization model was built. Finally, data from a MES in Longgang commercial park, Shenzhen City, were introduced for a case study, and the results show that: (1) A MES can integrate different types of energy, such as wind, photovoltaics, and gas. A multi-energy cycle is achieved via energy conversion and storage devices, and different energy demands are satisfied. Demand-response from users in a MES achieves the optimization of source-load interaction. (2) The proposed model gives consideration to the multi-objectives of operating revenue, operational risk, and carbon emissions, and its optimal strategy is obtained by using the proposed solution algorithm. (3) Sensitivity analysis results showed that risks can be avoided, to varying degrees, via reasonable setting of confidence. Price-based demand-response and maximum total emission allowances can be used as indirect factors to influence the energy supply structure of a MES. In summary, the proposed model and solution algorithm are effective tools for different decision makers to conceive of dispatching strategies for different interests. © 2019 MDPI AG.

However, neither the current observable indicators nor the current indicators based on response surface modeling (RSM) can fulfill this requirement. Therefore, this study developed new observable RSM-based indicators and applied them to ambient fine-particle (PM2:5/ and ozone (O3) pollution control in China. The performance of these observable indicators in predicting O3 and PM2:5 chemistry was compared with that of the current RSM-based indicators. H2O2HCHO=NO2 and total ammonia ratio, which exhibited the best performance among indicators, were proposed as new observable O3 and PM2:5 chemistry indicators, respectively. Strong correlations between RSM-based and traditional observable indicators suggested that a combination of ambient concentrations of certain chemical species can serve as an indicator to approximately quantify the response of O3 and PM2:5 to changes in precursor emissions. The observable RSM-based indicator for O3 (observable peak ratio) effectively captured the strong NOx-saturated regime in January and the NOx-limited regime in July, as well as the strong NOx-saturated regime in northern and eastern China and their key regions, including the Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta.

Moreover, analysis of these newly developed observable response indicators suggested that the simultaneous control of NH3 and NOx emissions produces greater benefits in provinces with higher PM2:5 exposure by up to 1.2 μgmμ3 PM2:5 per 10% NH3 reduction compared with NOx control only. Control of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions by as much as 40% of NOx controls is necessary to obtain the co-benefits of reducing both O3 and PM2:5 exposure at the national level when controlling NOx emissions. However, the VOC-to-NOx ratio required to maintain benefits varies significantly from 0 to 1.2 in different provinces, suggesting that a more localized control strategy should be designed for each province.

While recent studies have assessed the effects of O3 on terrestrial carbon fluxes, the potential impacts on atmospheric CO2 concentrations have not been quantified. Here, we use a regional climate model (RegCM-CHEM4) coupled with the Yale Interactive terrestrial Biosphere model YIBs to estimate the effects of O3 exposure on atmospheric CO2 over China. Compared to simulations without O3 effects, sensitivity experiments with O3 damage show a significant reduction (12.1 ± 4.4%) in the gross primary productivity (GPP), up to 35% in summer. Meanwhile, terrestrial carbon sink is suppressed by 112.2 ± 22.5 Tg C for 2013 at the national level. Strong inhibitions of O3 on carbon fluxes are found in North, Northeast and South Central China, where O3 levels are high. Consequently, we find a significant increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations due to O3-induced terrestrial carbon sink reduction. The increases of CO2 are more evident in the growing season. The maximum CO2 enhancement reaches as high as 6 ppm in Yunnan and Guizhou provinces. Our assessments indicate that tropospheric O3 has a detrimental impact on plant carbon uptake and leads to more CO2 accumulating in the atmosphere. Such impacts of O3 should be taken into account in global carbon cycle and future climate change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; CO2 concentration; O3 exposure; Terrestrial carbon flux","Climate change; Climate models; Forestry; Ozone; Photosynthesis; Plants (botany); Troposphere; Carbon fluxes; China; CO2 concentration; Global carbon cycle; Gross primary productivity; O3 exposure; Regional climate modeling; Terrestrial biosphere; Carbon dioxide; carbon; carbon dioxide; ozone; air-soil interaction; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sink; climate modeling; concentration (composition); growing season; modeling; net primary production; ozone; plant; regional climate; Article; atmosphere; biosphere; carbon cycle; carbon sink; China; climate; climate change; controlled study; growing season; land use; nonhuman; plant; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; simulation; summer; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072171834

However, the collective development of economy and urbanization poses a challenging problem in terms of reducing CO2 emissions. One of the prerequisites for solving this problem is to examine the simultaneous impacts of economic growth and urbanization on CO2 emissions. Within an extended STIRPAT framework, the present study aims to thoroughly investigate the combined nonlinear effects of economic growth and urbanization on CO2 emissions using provincial panel data from China that spans the period of 1997–2016. Considering the heterogeneity and dynamicity across the panel, this is the first attempt to comprehensively explore the selected variables and the CO2 emissions nexus by building a new two-way fixed-effects panel data partially linear additive model. The results show an inverted “U-shaped” nonlinear impact of economic growth on CO2 emissions, but urbanization has a different influence, revealing a “roller coaster” pattern with three turning points. The results also suggest that the factor of energy consumption will lead to an increase in CO2 emissions, while technology diffusion and industrial upgrading can facilitate the reduction of CO2 emissions. To provide an in-depth understanding of these impacts, nonlinear marginal analyses are performed at different stages of socioeconomic advancement. In addition, the consistency of the empirical results and the merits of the suggested method are corroborated by the different estimation techniques. The conclusion recommends that the evaluation of carbon pollution needs to be heightened by further research from multidimensional perspectives, and the concepts of green production and low-carbon development should be promoted to achieve the sustainable goals of the whole society. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Co2emissions; Economic growth; Panel data partially linear additive model; Urbanization","Additives; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Energy utilization; Industrial emissions; Pollution; Additive models; Co2emissions; Economic growths; Estimation techniques; In-depth understanding; Low-carbon development; Technology diffusion; Urbanization; Economic and social effects; additive; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; energy use; industrial development; panel data; pollution incidence; socioeconomic impact; technology diffusion; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070332125

During the last few years, significant progress has been made in improving the well-known industrial platform organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae with regard to its glycerol utilization capability, particularly in synthetic medium. This provided a basis for future metabolic engineering focusing on the production of valuable chemicals from glycerol. However, profound knowledge about the central carbon catabolism in synthetic glycerol medium is a prerequisite for such incentives. As a matter of fact, the current assumptions about the actual in vivo fluxes active on glycerol as the sole carbon source have mainly been based on omics data collected in complex media or were even deduced from studies with other non-fermentable carbon sources, such as ethanol or acetate. A number of uncertainties have been identified which particularly regard the role of the glyoxylate cycle, the subcellular localization of the respective enzymes, the contributions of mitochondrial transporters and the active anaplerotic reactions under these conditions. The review scrutinizes the current knowledge, highlights the necessity to collect novel experimental data using cells growing in synthetic glycerol medium and summarizes the current state of the art with regard to the production of valuable fermentation products from a carbon source that has been considered so far as ‘non-fermentable’ for the yeast S. cerevisiae. © 2019 The Authors","Anaplerotic reactions; Carbon source; Catabolism; Glycerol; Glyoxylate cycle; Mitochondrial transporters; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Yeast","Carbon; Glycerol; Metabolic engineering; Metabolism; Anaplerotic reactions; Carbon source; Catabolism; Glyoxylate cycles; Mitochondrial transporters; Yeast; alcohol; bioengineering; biotechnology; carbon; chemical reaction; fungus; industrial technology; metabolism; mitochondrion; reaction kinetics; substrate; yeast; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; carbon; glycerol; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; fermentation; metabolic engineering; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Carbon; Fermentation; Glycerol; Metabolic Engineering; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064427176

However, faced with the demand for a large number of experts in air pollution protection, people with real expertise for air pollutant management are difficult to find. Therefore, individualized recommendation is an effective and sustainable method for enhancing the professional level of managers and is good for improving the quality of air pollutant management. Thus, this paper initially proposes a novel framework to recommend strengths in air pollutant management. This framework comprises four stages: data preprocessing is the first stage; then, after constructing ability classifications and ability assessment strategies, activity experiences are transformed into corresponding ability values; next, a multilayer perceptron deep neural network (MLP-DNN) is used to predict potential types according to their ability values; finally, a hybrid system is constructed to recommend suitable and sustainable potential managers for air pollutant management. The experiments indicate that the proposed method can assess the full picture of people's strengths, which can recommend suggestions for building a scientific and rational specialties recommendation system for governments and schools. This method can have significant effects on pollutant emission reduction by enhancing the professional level of managers with regard to air pollutant management. © 2019 by the authors.","Air pollutants; Health risk; Recommendation; Sustainable management","air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission control; fossil fuel; fuel consumption; health risk; pollution control; public health; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074828920

Current policies are rather short-term driven and weak regarding sectoral coupling and regional integration. As in China economic activities and population on the one hand and renewable energy resources on the other have a very imbalanced distribution, long-term integrated energy system modelling needs to consider specific regional challenges of efficiency improvement, coal reduction, transport decarbonization and multi-sector electrification. Three scenarios are constructed, namely a Current Policy Scenario (CPS), Natural Gas &amp; Nuclear Scenario (NGNS) and Renewable &amp; Import Scenario (RIS) based on a normative storyline-and-modelling approach. The simulation results show that regional CO2 emissions could be significantly reduced in all sectors with the adjustment of economic structure, adopted efficiency measures, fuels to replace coal and oil products and multi-sector electrification supported by enhanced power import capacity. The scenario analysis provides insights for a strategic implementation of long-term integrated energy transition options towards decarbonization for metropolitan regions both from supply and demand sides. © 2019","CO2 targets; Eastern China; Energy system transition; Regional integration; Renewable energy; Scenario analysis","Carbon dioxide; Coal deposits; Decarbonization; Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Renewable energy resources; Eastern China; Energy systems; Regional integration; Renewable energies; Scenario analysis; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074690301

Air quality data collected at the PRD Regional Air Quality Monitoring Network during 2006–2015 were analyzed for assessing the effectiveness of pollution control measures and for estimating the trends of premature mortality attributable to ambient PM2.5 and O3. Statistically significant decreasing trends were detected for PM2.5 (−1.74 to −1.83 μg m−3 yr−1), PM10 (−2.70 to −2.78 μg m−3 yr−1), NO (−0.61 to −0.74 μg m−3 yr−1), NO2 (−1.20 to −1.22 μg m−3 yr−1), and SO2 (−3.46 to −4.01 μg m−3 yr−1), while an increasing trend was found for O3 (0.70–0.86 μg m−3 yr−1) during the study period. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of control measures implemented in the last decade for primary pollutants and also indicate the challenges for controlling secondary pollutants. The PM2.5-related premature deaths varied little, e.g., from 40.6 thousand deaths in 2006 to 40.4 thousand deaths in 2015, due to the two contrasting factors, i.e., the decreased PM2.5 concentration and increased population. The increases in both O3 concentration and exposed population resulted in a significant rising trend for the O3-related premature deaths, which increased from 2.7 thousand deaths in 2006 to 4.5 thousand deaths in 2015, at a rate of 165 deaths yr−1. Consistent with the spatial distribution of air pollution and population density, high levels of premature deaths from PM2.5 and O3 were located in the central PRD including Guangzhou, Foshan, Dongguan, and Shenzhen. Decreasing PM2.5 concentration is the most effective way in reducing the regional mortality burden from air pollution in the near future. Besides controlling primary emissions of PM2.5, reducing VOCs emissions is also important for limiting atmospheric oxidizing capacity and associated secondary PM2.5 formation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Health burden; Long-term trend; Ozone; Particulate matter; Pearl River Delta (PRD)","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Air quality; Gems; Ozone; Population statistics; Quality control; Rivers; Long-term trend; Outdoor air pollution; Particulate Matter; Pearl River delta; Pearl River Delta region; Population densities; Regional air quality; Scientific community; River pollution; atmospheric pollution; health impact; mortality; ozone; particulate matter; pollution effect; trend analysis; air analysis; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; China; control strategy; ecosystem monitoring; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; human; particulate matter; pollution control; population density; premature mortality; priority journal; trend study; air pollution; environmental exposure; premature mortality; river; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Exposure; Mortality, Premature; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068460887

The results showed that the WPSH fluctuated in this period and intensified this air pollution with local emissions. The episode was divided into four stages according to WPSH center locations to diagnose the air pollution. Visibility declined below 10 km twice while fine particulate matte (PM2.5) concentration was up to 89.05 μg/m3 during this episode. As a consequence of high temperature (28.33 ± 1.25 °C) resulted from WPSH, atmospheric oxidation at high level (140.81 ± 56.49 μg/m3) was the driving force of secondary aerosols generations. Oxidation determined photo-chemical reactions with the pathways of gas-phase and heterogeneous formation. Sulfate was formed from gas-phase oxidation by SO2 in daytime while heterogeneous reaction occurred at night. Nitrate generation was dominated by not only excess ammonium but also intense oxidation. Reconstruction light extinction results coupling with trajectories revealed that (NH4)2SO4, NH4NO3 and OM were the priority factors to the reduction of atmospheric visibility. These findings provided new insights of air pollution episode diagnosis and indicative function of WPSH impacts on local air quality in Southeast China. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution episode; Formation processes; Influencing mechanisms; Light extinction; Oxidation; Western Pacific subtropical high","Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Gases; Light extinction; Nitrogen compounds; Sulfur compounds; Tropics; Visibility; Air pollution episodes; Atmospheric oxidation; Atmospheric visibility; Formation process; Heterogeneous formation; Heterogeneous reactions; Influencing mechanisms; Western Pacific; Oxidation; ammonia; nitrate; sulfate; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; coastal zone; concentration (composition); governance approach; oxidation; particulate matter; air pollution; Article; atmosphere; China; controlled study; gas; high temperature; latitude; oxidation; particulate matter; photochemistry; priority journal; secondary organic aerosol; subtropical high; visibility; China; Fujian; Xiamen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069710472

Furthermore, by applying regression analysis to explore regional heterogeneity, we find that it has a stronger effect on industrial sulfur dioxide reduction in the Central China than it does in the Eastern and Western China, and it also exerts a positive influence on economic growth in the Western China.

Then Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) molecular simulations were performed to state multicomponent (single, binary, ternary and quaternary systems among flue gas and CH4) and competitive adsorption behaviors. The results show that the adsorption amount of individual gas in the mixed components adsorption systems increases with the pressures and bulk mole fractions increasing. While the advantages of selective separation for competitive ones, especially for CO2, decrease. The order of adsorption amount of gases in the mixture depends on not only adsorption ability but also bulk mole fraction. With the same bulk mole fraction of CH4, the selectivities of CO2/CH4 that in the systems injecting flue gas are larger than that injecting pure CO2. With the same 0.99 mmol/g adsorption amount of CO2, injection of flue gas is more beneficial to desorption of CH4 than injection of CO2 due to the large partial pressure of N2. The advantages of competitive adsorption for CO2 can be explained by stronger favorable adsorption sites therefore stronger van der Waals energy and electrostatic energy between CO2 and coal. Water in coal goes against the gases adsorption, especially for CO2, because the preferential adsorption sites are occupied by water. The conclusions of this research lay a theoretical foundation for the application of flue gas-ECBM technology. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Adsorption sites; CH4 recovery; CO2 storage; Competitive adsorption; Flue gas","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Coal storage; Flue gases; Flues; Fossil fuel power plants; Gases; Macromolecules; Metal recovery; Molecular structure; Monte Carlo methods; Van der Waals forces; Adsorption site; CO2 storage; Coal-fired power plant; Competitive adsorption; Grand canonical Monte carlo; Preferential adsorption; Theoretical foundations; Van der Waals energies; Adsorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071880090

In this study, the atmospheric impact of gaseous and particulate pollutants emitted in the exhaust of typical ships was estimated based on real-world measurements obtained under conditions of various engine speeds and fuel types. The results showed that PM2.5 emission factors (EFs) ranged between 0.38 ± 0.01 and 1.05 ± 0.04 g/kg fuel, and tended to increase with engine speed. The EFs of volatile organic compounds (VOCs; including 57 species), which varied between 63 ± 4 and 156 ± 6 mg/kg fuel at different engine speeds, were determined largely via the modified combustion efficiency. The ozone formation potential (OFP), dominated by alkanes and aromatics, was between 0.33 ± 0.01 and 0.83 ± 0.05 g O3/kg fuel. Secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP), dominated primarily by aromatics, varied between 2.7 ± 0.1 and 8.7 ± 0.7 mg SOA/kg fuel. Switching from heavy fuel oil to diesel oil significantly reduced pollutant emissions with the exception of NOx. Reductions in the EFs of VOCs, PM2.5, and total suspended particles were 67%, 42%, and 66%, respectively. The average fuel-mass-based EFs of OFP and SOAFP from ship emissions were ∼2.3- and ∼2.6-fold greater than those exhausted from on-road diesel vehicles, respectively, indicating that ship emissions could be an important source for ground-level ozone and organic aerosol formation, particularly in coastal regions. The results suggest that emission abatement technologies should be applied to marine diesel engines and stringent regulations on VOC species, particularly aromatics, should be imposed to improve regional air quality. © 2019","Ozone formation; Particulate matter; Secondary organic aerosol; Ship emissions; VOC species","Aerosols; Air quality; Aromatization; Diesel engines; Fuels; Marine engines; Ozone; Ships; Speed; Volatile organic compounds; Atmospheric environment; Organic aerosol formation; Ozone formation; Ozone formation potentials; Particulate Matter; Secondary organic aerosols; Ship emissions; Total suspended particles; Particles (particulate matter)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073025692

As a result, the energy efficiency of rail transportation is becoming a popular research topic. Energy-efficient train operation involves four types of control: maximal traction, cruising, coasting, and maximal braking. With the rapid development of energy storage devices (ESDs), this paper aims to develop an integrated optimization model to obtain the speed trajectory with the constraint of on-board ESD properties such as capacity, initial state of energy (SOE), and the degradation of the on-board ESD. Mixed integer linear programming is implemented on the discretized distance-based model to find the solution. In addition to the optimal speed trajectory, the on-board ESD discharge/charge operation strategy will be obtained. Results show that with high on-board ESD capacity, a train tends to apply more braking to recover more energy by using ESD; high initial SOE leads to more traction operation but undermines the energy-recovering process; degradation of on-board ESD influences the train operation and net energy consumption by affecting discharge/charge frequency. Additionally, in the case with on-board ESD, more than 11.6% of net energy consumption can be reduced compared with the one without on-board ESD. This paper indicates that the proposed method is an effective and robust way to study how on-board ESD influences optimal train operation as well as to achieve optimal train speed trajectory with on-board ESD. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","energy conservation; mixed integer linear programming (MILP); on-board energy storage device (ESD); Rail transportation; speed trajectory","Braking; Electrostatic devices; Energy conservation; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Integer programming; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Speed; Traction control; Trajectories; Urban transportation; Distance-based models; Integrated optimization models; Mixed integer linear programming; Mixed integer linear programming (MILP); Net energy consumption; On-board energy storage; Rail transportation; Speed trajectories; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058173753

Increased incorporation of legume crops in agricultural practices offers a sustainable alternative. Legumes, in their symbiosis with nitrogen fixing bacteria, rhizobia, reduce the need for fertilizers and also respond to the need for increased production of plant-based proteins. Not all combinations of rhizobia and legumes result in efficient nitrogen fixation, and legume crops therefore often need to be inoculated with compatible rhizobial strains. Recent research has demonstrated that some rhizobia are also very efficient N2O reducers. Several nutritionally and economically important legumes form root nodules in symbiosis with bacteria belonging to Bradyrhizobium. Here, the host-ranges of fourteen N2O reducing Bradyrhizobium strains were tested on six legume hosts; cowpea, groundnut, mung bean, haricot bean, soybean, and alfalfa. The plants were grown for 35 days in pots in sterile sand supplemented with N-free nutrient solution. Cowpea was the most promiscuous host nodulated by all test strains, followed by groundnut (11 strains) and mungbean (4 strains). Three test strains were able to nodulate all these three legumes, while none nodulated the other three hosts. For cowpea, five strains increased the shoot dry weight and ten strains the shoot nitrogen content (pairwise comparison; p &lt; 0.05). For groundnut the corresponding results were three and nine strains. The symbiotic effectiveness for the different strains ranged from 45 to 98% in cowpea and 34 to 95% in groundnut, relative to fertilized controls. The N2O reduction capacity of detached nodules from cowpea plants inoculated with one of these strains confirmed active N2O reduction inside the nodules. When released from senescent nodules such strains are expected to also act as sinks for N2O produced by denitrifying organisms in the soil microbial community. Our strategy to search among known N2O-reducing Bradyrhizobium strains for their N2-fixation effectiveness successfully identified several strains which can potentially be used for the production of legume inoculants with the dual capacities of efficacious N2-fixation and N2O reduction. © Copyright © 2019 Woliy, Degefu and Frostegård.","Bradyrhizobium; denitrification; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide reductase; symbiotic nitrogen fixation","nitrous oxide; Article; bacterial metabolism; Bradyrhizobium; cowpea; germination; host range; legume; multilocus sequence typing; nitrogen fixation; nitrous oxide reduction; nodule dry weight; nodule number; peanut; phylogeny; plant growth; plant parameters; shoot dry weight; shoot nitrogen content; soil microflora; soybean; symbiosis; symbiotic effectiveness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076886567

This tally represents about 6–10% of the world's post-1500 recognised extinctions. The actual number of extinctions is likely to be far more than those recognised in formal lists. Mammals have suffered the highest proportional rate of extinction (ca. 10% of the endemic mammal fauna). There are four main distributional features of these extinctions: (i) consistent with global patterns, island endemic species are disproportionately represented; (ii) many non-island extinct species had highly restricted mainland ranges; but conversely (iii) many extinct mammals had extensive ranges; and (iv) there have been no recognised extinctions of species confined to Australia's mainland monsoonal tropics. Extinctions have occurred largely continuously since Australia's European settlement, with at least three extinctions in the last decade. Mammal extinctions were caused mainly by introduced predators; plant extinctions by habitat loss; frog extinctions by disease; reptile extinctions by an introduced snake; and invertebrate extinctions by a range of anthropogenic processes. Causality has changed over time, with recent extinctions more likely to be associated with disease, introduced reptiles and introduced fish and less likely to be associated with hunting and introduced mammalian predators.

Considering that the area of drylands is projected to increase by 11%–23% by 2,100, understanding the impacts of warming on the functions and services furnished by these arid and semi-arid ecosystems has numerous implications. In a unique 13-year ecosystem warming experiment in a south-western U.S. dryland, we investigated the consequences of rising temperature on Achnatherum hymenoides, a widespread, keystone grass species on the Colorado Plateau. We tracked individual- and population-level responses to identify optimal strategies that may have been masked if considering only one level of plant response. We found several factors combined to affect the timing and magnitude of plant responses during the 13th year of warming. These included large warming-induced biomass increases for individual plants, an 8.5-day advancement in the growing season and strong reductions in photosynthetic rates and population cover. Importantly, we observed a lack of photosynthetic acclimation and, thus, a warming-induced downregulation of photosynthetic rates. However, these physiological responses were concurrent with warmed-plant increases in growing season length and investment in photosynthetic surfaces, demonstrating the species’ ability to balance carbon fixation limitations with warming. These results, which bring together ecophysiological, phenological, reproductive and morphological assessments of plant responses to warming, suggest that the extent of change in A. hymenoides populations will be based upon numerous adaptive responses that vary in their direction and magnitude. Plant population responses to climatic warming remain poorly resolved, particularly for Earth's drylands, and our in situ experiment assessing multiple strategies offers a novel look into a warmer world.

Mathematical optimization techniques can assist in identifying dietary patterns that both improve nutrition and reduce environmental impacts. Here we review 12 recent studies in which such optimization was used to achieve nutrition and environmental sustainability aims. These studies used data from China, India, and Tunisia, and from 7 high-income countries (France, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Most studies aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (10 of 12) and half aimed also to reduce ≥1 other environmental impact, e.g., water use, fossil energy use, land use, marine eutrophication, atmospheric acidification, and nitrogen release. The main findings were that in all 12 studies, the diets optimized for sustainability and nutrition were more plant based with reductions in meat, particularly ruminant meats such as beef and lamb (albeit with 6 of 12 of studies involving increased fish in diets). The amount of dairy products also tended to decrease in most (7 of 12) of the studies with more optimized diets. Other foods that tended to be reduced included: sweet foods (biscuits, cakes, and desserts), savory snacks, white bread, and beverages (alcoholic and soda drinks). These findings were broadly compatible with the findings of 7 out of 8 recent review articles on the sustainability of diets. The literature suggests that healthy and sustainable diets may typically be cost neutral or cost saving, but this is still not clear overall. There remains scope for improvement in such areas as expanding research where there are no competing interests; improving sustainability metrics for food production and consumption; consideration of infectious disease risks from livestock agriculture and meat; and researching optimized diets in settings where major policy changes have occurred (e.g., Mexico's tax on unhealthy food). © The Author(s) 2019.","carbon; dietary patterns; diets; greenhouse gases; mathematical optimization; sustainability","adult; agriculture; animal husbandry; catering service; diet; environmental protection; feeding behavior; female; human; male; meta analysis; nutritional status; nutritional value; plant; theoretical model; vegetarian diet; Adult; Agriculture; Animal Husbandry; Conservation of Natural Resources; Diet; Diet, Healthy; Diet, Vegetarian; Feeding Behavior; Female; Food Supply; Humans; Male; Models, Theoretical; Nutritional Status; Nutritive Value; Plants",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075114930

According to the EU 2020 Climate and Energy Package, in the nearest future the polish energy industry, will have to significantly modernize most of its power plants. The dynamically changing situation results in higher demand for various analysis (concerning both energy and economic aspect) helping with setting the frames for the future functioning of power engineering companies. One of the Polish power companies, PEC Legionowo, is reshaping its infrastructure to meet the new requirements and from this particular company, authors are using the acquired data for the test case. The first conceptual project related to the development of the PEC Legionowo energy system is currently being realized in terms of increasing its energy efficiency and reducing harmful exhaust emissions. Because PEC Legionowo is obligated to significantly reduce emissions by 2022, they are seriously considering reducing coal-based production. The resulting energy gap is planned to be covered by among others installing high-efficiency combined heat and power (CHP) systems.This article analyzes and verifies the model of an existing CHP plant and checks the modernization possibilities of the existing installation in terms of reducing emission. The new installation of gas boilers designed to replace coal-fired boilers is being validated, to meet the new emission requirements while still meeting the demand for heat and electricity.For modelling a test case, the combined techno-economic optimization and analysis software energyPRO is used. The software optimizes the operation of the modeled system according to all input conditions, such as generation and economic data obtained from a functioning CHP plant in the Polish industry.The results show the quantitative and economic difference related to the introduced changes in the heat and power plant system. The analysis also focuses on the size of the investment outlay and the return time of the project. © 2019, Aalborg University press.

This is because the impact of an environmental policy on an economy-wide system will depend on factors that differ from one region to the next. In this paper, we develop a static CGE model for Liberia that is capable of analyzing both a uniform and a partial carbon tax policy. Under the uniform policy instituted to ensure mitigation in the range of 20–50%, an economic dividend is found for energy, employment, and welfare. In particular, energy consumption increases by between 5 and 15.5%, respectively. Interestingly, under a second best policy which exempts economically strategic sectors from the tax, no economic dividend is found for all three variables. This time, energy use declines by between 2 and 9%. These suggest that a uniform environmental tax policy is a more viable option for Liberia, in particular, as it does not only generate economic dividend for employment and welfare, it also incentivizes Liberia's adoption and use of renewable energy technologies. In general, based on the results obtained, further conditions for the feasibility of a double dividend are proposed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Double dividend; Energy consumption; Environmental tax; Renewable energy; Transitional economy","Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Renewable energy resources; Taxation; Double dividend; Environmental benefits; Environmental policy; Environmental taxes; Renewable energies; Second-best policy; Transitional economies; Use of renewable energies; Environmental protection; alternative energy; energy use; environmental economics; environmental policy; environmental tax; policy implementation; pollution tax; research work; transitional economy; Liberia [West Africa]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071266299

Therefore, studying the state of grassland carrying resources in Kazakhstan is particularly important for understanding the responses of grassland ecosystems to climate change and human activities. Based on Kazakhstan's remote sensing data and animal husbandry statistics, this study an-alyzes the patterns of changes in grassland ecosystems in Kazakhstan based on the supply and consumption of these ecosystems. The results show that: 1) From 2003 to 2017, the number of livestock raised in Kazakhstan showed a trend of sustained and steady growth. Due to freezing damage, the scale of livestock farming decreased in 2011, but a spatial difference in the livestock farming structure was not obvious. 2) The fluctuation of grassland supply in Kazakhstan has increased, while the consumption due to animal husbandry has also continued to in-crease, resulting in an increasing pressure on the grassland carrying capacity. 3) Between 2003 and 2017, the overall grassland carrying status of Kazakhstan have been abundant, but the grassland carrying pressure index has shown a steadily increasing trend, the grassland carrying pressure is growing, and it is mainly determined by grassland productivity. The greater pressure in lower Kyzylorda state, the southern Kazakhstan state of the culti-vated land and the northern Kazakhstan state has gradually expanded to include the agro-pastoral zone and the semi-desert zone. © 2019, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

The paper uses the IPAT-E (I = Human Impact, P = Population, A = Affluence, T = Technology, E = Energy) model to determine and classify the influencing factors of CO2 emissions. Based on the provincial panel data, the paper used the partial least squares (PLS) method to establish a structural equation model (SEM), and analyzes the path coefficient between CO2 emissions and its influencing factors. The paper contains 16 indicators from 2001 to 2016. Empirical results show that affluence, technology and energy have a significant positive impact on CO2 emissions at the national level. And the affluence factor under the influence of population factor has the greatest impact. From a regional perspective, affluence factor has a significant positive impact on CO2 emissions in the Northeast, East, Northwest, Southwest, and Central South China, with the largest impact on the Southwest. Technology factor has a small positive impact on East, Northwest and Southwest China. Energy factor has a significant positive impact on the Northeast, North, East China, Northwest and Central South China, with the greatest impact on North China. Affluence and technology factors have a negative impact on CO2 emissions in North China. In addition, the population has a greater impact on affluence, with minimal impact on the Southwest.

Recognising that these trends are likely to persist into the future, it is important to understand the US Arctic policymaking apparatus, how geopolitical and environmental factors affect the creation and implementation of such policies through the presidency and how the resulting presidential policies may impact US leadership in the region for years to come. Consequently, this article examines how the distinct styles and preferences of Presidents Obama and Trump interact with growing climate change and defence challenges in the region within the US Arctic policymaking process. We illustrate this interaction through examples at both domestic and international policy levels and then place it in the larger context of the differing presidential approaches to institutionalisation when setting policy. Ultimately, we conclude that not only do presidential priorities regarding climate change, rising international engagement, and institutionalisation critically influence Arctic policymaking, but how a future president views these issues will heavily impact the direction of policies affecting the region. © The Authors 2020.

Based on a survey of around 600 biogas plant operators, the fractions of excess heat from the cogeneration units in these plants are analysed. A heuristic is developed to match biogas plants (heat sources) with local settlements (heat sinks) in order to determine a least-cost district heating supply for residential buildings. Two criteria are employed, namely the CO2 abatement costs and the payback period, which represent the macro- and microeconomic perspectives respectively. Based on the survey, the mean fraction of excess heat is 40%, which is in agreement with other empirical studies. Extrapolating this fraction to the German biogas plant stock, which is selected as a case study, leads to technically feasible CO2 savings of around 2.5 MtCO2/a. Employing the criteria of CO2 abatement costs and payback period yields about 2 MtCO2/a below CO2 abatement costs of 200 €/tCO2 and below a payback period of 9 years. This represents about 0.25% of the total German CO2 emissions in 2016 or around 2.5% of all CO2 in residential buildings. Alternative threshold values of 80 €/tCO2 and 5 years payback period reduce the carbon reduction potential to about 0.5 MtCO2 and 0.75 MtCO2 respectively. These relatively high average costs are related to the typically low population density in rural regions where biogas plants are located.

The framework utilizes wavelet spectrum to obtain the characteristic periods of PM2.5 concentration and traffic volume, and utilizes cross-wavelet spectrum to explore the hysteresis response of PM2.5 concentration with respect to traffic volume. Different from traditional research work which handle pollutants and traffic data of macro scales, our study examines the micro-scale relationship of PM2.5 concentration and traffic volume. We conduct experiments from four urban streets of Beijing, and reveal two micro-scale rules: (a) the characteristic period of PM2.5 concentration approximates the characteristic period of traffic volume, and both of them are significantly affected by the traffic signal cycle; (b) PM2.5 concentration exhibits a time delay within 0.3-0.9 minutes with respect to traffic volume.

Although a significant number of studies on the detection and tracking of vehicles have been conducted, none of them focused on the role of vertical vehicle dynamics. For the first time, this paper analyzes and discusses the influence of road anomalies and vehicle suspension on the performance of detecting and tracking driving objects.

Reflectance spectroscopy has proven to be a promising technique for SOC quantification in the laboratory and increasingly from air- and spaceborne platforms, where hyperspectral imagery provides great potential for mapping SOC on larger scales with regular updates. When applied on larger scales, soil prediction accuracy decreases due to the inhomogeneity of samples. In this paper, we examined if spectral clustering of the LUCAS EU-wide topsoil database is successful without using other covariates than the spectral database and can improve SOC model performance compared to a reference model that was calibrated on the whole database without clustering. Different clustering methodologies were tested, including a k-means clustering based on principal component analysis or based on spectral feature variables, combined with partial least squares regression (PLSR) models, and a clustering based on a local PLSR approach which builds a different multivariate model for each sample to be predicted. Furthermore, in order to allow for subsequent application to hyperspectral remote sensing data, atmospheric water wavelengths were removed from the analyses. The local PLSR approach achieved best results and was additionally applied to LUCAS spectra resampled to the upcoming hyperspectral EnMAP sensor which led to good results: R2 = 0.66, RMSEP = 5.78 g kg− 1 and RPIQ = 1.93. The k-means clustering approach showed slightly better results than the reference model. Overall, our results showed similar performances for SOC prediction models compared to other approaches using PLSR with a larger spectral range and other soil parameters as covariates. This study shows that (i) it is possible to transfer the local PLSR approach onto a wavelengths reduced spectral library and to predict estimations of SOC at low-cost with reasonable accuracy based on large scale soil databases; and (ii) that the local regression approach is a valuable tool for SOC prediction models based solely on spectral data without the use of other soil covariates. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cluster analysis; Europe; Reflectance spectroscopy; Soil organic carbon; Soil spectral library","Climate change; Cluster analysis; Database systems; Food supply; Forecasting; Least squares approximations; Organic carbon; Principal component analysis; Reflection; Remote sensing; Soils; Spectroscopy; Europe; Hyper-spectral imageries; Hyperspectral remote sensing data; Multivariate modeling; Partial least squares regressions (PLSR); Reflectance spectroscopy; Soil organic carbon; Spectral libraries; K-means clustering; cluster analysis; database; organic carbon; remote sensing; soil carbon; spectroscopy; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068747213

Properties of glasses were characterized by such techniques as Archimedes´ method, XRD, absorption spectroscopy, various types of luminescence spectroscopy and decay curves. Glass performs the enhanced compaction with increment of Tb2O3 content. XRD pattern represents the amorphous nature of glass system. Tb3+ in glass absorbs photons in visible light and near infrared region. The strong green emission around 544 nm via 5D4 → 7F5 transition of Tb3+ were generated under three types of excitation such as ultraviolet–visible light (photoluminescence), X-ray (radioluminescence) and electron (cathodoluminescence). The Gd3+ - Tb3+ energy transfer plays an important role for strong green emission of glass. The intensity of this luminescence increases with increment of Tb2O3 concentration. All luminescence decay curves represent in the forms of non-single/multi-component exponential functions. The values of all decay time are in the order of millisecond.

However, corrosion is a challenging issue in the whole chain process of CO2-EOR production if water presents and mild steel pipeline is used. In this paper, the corrosion risk of pipeline at different stages of CO2-EOR production is systematically assessed based on a detailed analysis of the fluid characteristics. According to the fluid state of CO2, water and crude oil, current understandings on the corrosion behavior of steel materials in multiphase flow conditions are reviewed. Furthermore, the intermittent water wetting phenomena and the fluid behavior of water droplets or clusters in an electrolyte/non-electrolyte emulsion are correlated with the steel corrosion performance, providing new insights into the corrosion phenomena. Besides application of corrosion resistant materials and corrosion inhibitors, tailoring of processing parameters, such as enhancing the water entrainment, shortening the water contact time, and reducing the solution corrosivity, is highly recommended as an effective method for corrosion control in aggressive CO2-EOR production conditions. Based on these, some important future research topics on the corrosion in multiphase fluids are suggested. © Copyright © 2019 Wang, Song and Zhang.","CCS; CO2-EOR; corrosion mechanism; multiphase flow corrosion; pipeline","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Corrosion resistance; Corrosive effects; Electrolytes; Emulsification; Multiphase flow; Pipeline corrosion; Pipelines; Risk assessment; Steel corrosion; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); CO2-EOR; Corrosion mechanisms; Corrosion performance; Corrosion-resistant materials; Enhanced oil recovery; Processing parameters; Solution corrosivity; Enhanced recovery",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075336781

Elevated CO2 decreased the abundances of genera, including Pseudarthrobacter, Gaiellales_uncultured, Microlunatus, Gemmatimonas, Gemmatimonadaceae_uncultured, Ramlibacter, Massilia, Luteimonas, Acidobacteriaceae_uncultured, Bryobacter and Candidatus_Solibacter. These genera were probably fast-growing bacteria and sensitive to labile C. In contrast, eCO2 stimulated the growth of genera Novosphingobium, Acidimicrobiales_uncultured, Bacillus, Flavisolibacter and Schlesneria, which were able to assimilate complex C compounds. Moreover, the increased population of Novosphingobium under eCO2 might have accelerated electron flow from the oxidation of organic C. Correspondingly, eCO2 did not affect the concentration of the dissolved organic C but increased the plant-derived 13C in the rhizosphere. These results indicated that an eCO2-induced increase in non-labile C in rhizodeposits contributed to the increase in population size of a number of the plant-C-metabolizing genera that might become the mechanism for the turnover of fresh C in the rhizosphere, modifying the soil C cycle under eCO2 environments. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science","13c labelling; illumina sequencing; microbial community; mollisols; stable isotope probing","agricultural soil; bacterium; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; community structure; microbial community; Mollisol; rhizosphere; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soybean; stable isotope; Acidimicrobiales; Acidobacteriaceae; Bacillus (bacterium); Bacteria (microorganisms); Gemmatimonadaceae; Gemmatimonas; Glycine max; Luteimonas; Massilia; Microlunatus; Novosphingobium; Ramlibacter; Solibacter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068121413

With natural refrigerant gaining momentum worldwide, it is important to ascertain if the use of natural refrigerant reduce greenhouse gas emissions from refrigeration when the broader energy system in a cost-effective manner is considered. This study employs a generic process chain analysis framework to examine the life cycle costs and benefits of refrigerant replacement. The case study data are collected from a supermarket in China which has recently changed from a R22 system to a R134A-R744 system. There are three key findings from this study. First, the values of the life cycle greenhouse gas abatement costs can be significantly influenced by the costs and emissions due to electricity usage. Under a 15% discount rate, the reference values of the greenhouse gas abatement cost are found to be 207.28 and 1.40 $/t-CO2e with and without the costs and emissions due to electricity use respectively. Next, under the current state of technology development, cost reductions should be prioritised for natural refrigerant based system to become commercially attractive.

In the past decade, the research of photocatalysts has been shifted from inorganic to abundant organic polymeric catalysts. Polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) has emerged as a promising photocatalyst for solar energy conversion on account of its superior physicochemical properties. However, its practical applications are still hindered by several limitations, including high-charge recombination probability and weak visible-light absorption, etc. As a result of facile structure modifications at the nano- and molecular levels, the structure engineering of PCN has been proven as an efficient solution. This review highlights a panorama of the latest research advancements regarding the structure engineering of PCN at the nano- and molecular scales. A perspective about the challenges and future trends in the structure engineering and applications of PCN is provided at the end of the review. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.Photocatalytic technology has been considered as a green and sustainable way to alleviate the increasing pressure on the energy crisis and environmental pollution. As an emerging organic photocatalyst, polymeric carbon nitride (PCN) has drawn great attention for solar energy conversion because of numerous characteristics such as suitable electronic structure, excellent chemical stability, and facile preparation. Rational structure tuning of PCN at different scales has become a useful strategy for improving photocatalytic performance. In this review, we highlight recent development in tailoring PCN from the nano to molecular scale for photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction and degradation, etc. The synthetic methods and the corresponding optimized properties are introduced in detail.

Most previous studies have focused on the direct CH4 emissions of economies, but overlooked the upstream CH4 emissions along global supply chains induced by the final consumption of economies. Using a global multi-regional input-output analysis, this study aims to explore the evolution of CH4 emissions embodied in international trade and final consumption in major economies during 2000–2012. The results show that China, the EU, USA, India and Brazil were the top five economies with high volumes of consumption-based CH4 emissions from 2000 to 2012. In particular, China's consumption-based CH4 emissions showed an observable growth trend, while the EU, the USA and Japan showed a downward trend. It's estimated that growing amounts of CH4 emissions (i.e., the volume increase from 77.1 Mt in 2000 to 95.9 Mt in 2012) were transferred globally via international trade, primarily as exports from China, Russia and other large developing economies to consumers in major developed economies. Russia–EU, China–USA and China–EU formed the main bilateral trading pairs of embodied emission flows. Further analysis found that per capita consumption-based CH4 emissions was closely related to their per capita GDP. Quantifying the CH4 emissions embodied in trade and final demand of major economies can provide important basis for understanding economy-wide emission drivers to design global and regional CH4 reduction scheme from a consumer perspective. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Consumption-based accounting; Global supply chains; International trade; Methane emissions; Multi-regional input-output analysis","Climate change; International trade; Supply chains; Developed economies; Developing economies; Economy-wide emissions; Global climate changes; Global supply chain; Input output analysis; Methane emissions; Percapita consumption; Methane; methane; consumption behavior; emission control; emissions trading; input-output analysis; international trade; methane; supply chain management; air and air related phenomena; Article; China; commercial phenomena; consumer attitude; economic development; European Union; gross national product; Japan; methane emission; Russian Federation; United States; Brazil; China; Europe; India; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070676677

Due to the low carbon emission performance (CEP) and the high industry portion of the northern provinces in China, evaluating the CEPs of industrial sectors in northern China is necessary. By considering the different CEP assessments in regional and industrial research, a dual-perspective assessment of CEP was presented to narrow the gap between the regional and industrial perspectives. The dual model of slack-based measure (SBM) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) was combined with the global Malmquist-Luenberger index (GMLI) proposed to measure the static CEP and the dynamic change of the CEP of six provinces in northern China from 2006-15 for the regional and industrial perspectives, respectively. A comparison of the results under the different perspectives proved the irrationality of our evaluation under the sole perspective. For example, for Jilin Province, the CEPs of Mining and Processing of Nonmetal and Other Ores (Sector 4) ranked in the top 30% in the regional perspective. However, in the industrial level, the CEPs of Mining and Processing of Nonmetal and Other Ores (Sector 4) ranked lower. The CEPs of the Production and Supply of Electric Power and Heat Power (Sector 20) of Heilongjiang Province ranked in the bottom 30% in a regional perspective but ranked first at the industrial level. We also found the advantage sectors in the CEP under the region-sector dual perspective. For example, for Jilin Province, the Processing of Petroleum, Coking, and Processing of Nuclear Fuel (Sector 10) and the manufacture of Transport Equipment (Sector 16) were the advantageous sectors. The dual-perspective assessment aimed to evaluate the CEP under diverse views. It also provided a more reliable path to reduce CO2 emissions for managers and regulators. © 2019 by the authors.","Dual-perspective; GMLI (global Malmquist-Luenberger index); Industrial evaluation; Regional assessment; SBM (slack-based measure) model; The northern province of China","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; electrical power; emission control; environmental economics; local government; parameterization; China; Heilongjiang; Jilin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074852393

Depending on the molar ratio of Au:Rh, the nanoparticles prepared by borohydride co-reduction of corresponding metal salt solutions had a size of 3.5–6.7 nm. The particles consisted of well-dispersed noble metal atoms with some enrichment of Rh in their surface region. NO conversion of AuRh/Al2O3 shifted to lower temperatures with increasing Rh content, reaching highest activity and highest N2 selectivity for the monometallic Rh/Al2O3 catalyst. This behavior is attributed to the enhanced adsorption of CO on the bimetallic catalyst resulting in unfavorable cationic Rh clusters Rh+-(CO)2.

Given that industrial CO2 feeds are often contaminated with CO, a closer investigation of the CO2RR under CO2/CO co-feed conditions is warranted. Here, we report mechanistic insights into the CO2RR reactivity of CO2/CO co-feeds on Cu-based nanocatalysts. Kinetic isotope-labelling experiments—performed in an operando differential electrochemical mass spectrometry capillary flow cell with millisecond time resolution—showed an unexpected enhanced production of C2H4, with a yield increase of almost 50%, from a cross-coupled 12CO2–13CO reactive pathway. The results suggest the absence of site competition between CO2 and CO molecules on the reactive surface at the reactant-specific sites. The practical significance of sustained local interfacial CO partial pressures under CO2 depletion is demonstrated by metallic/non-metallic Cu/Ni–N-doped carbon tandem catalysts.

This study focused on the variation trends of SO4 2−, NO3 − and NH4 + (SNA) of PM2.5 during this effective improvement period, through a five-year PM2.5 sampling project in urban area. Measurement showed that SNA presented a noticeable decline trend, from 16.6 ± 19.8 μg/m3 to 9.7 ± 13.3 μg/m3 for SO4 2−, from 16.5 ± 16.2 μg/m3 to 13.1 ± 16.9 μg/m3 for NO3 −, from 10.2 ± 10.1 μg/m3 to 9.1 ± 9.9 μg/m3 for NH4 +. However, their proportions presented different variations, a decline trend from 14.3 ± 7.7% to 12.9 ± 6.6% for SO4 2−, a raise trend from 15.2 ± 7.2% to 16.0 ± 7.7% for NO3 − and from 9.6 ± 3.7% to 11.7 ± 4.4% for NH4 +. The concentration and proportion of SNA significantly increased in heavy polluted days (HPD) compared to non-heavy polluted days (NHPD) through 2013–2017. The ratio of NO3 −/SO4 2− was lower in HPD than NHPD in 2013–2015. However, it was generally larger in 2016 and 2017, indicating the importance of NO3 − in the formation of PM2.5 pollution. SOR increased obviously through 2013–2017, which was mainly owed to the enhanced atmospheric oxidation and the regional transport related to regional annual emission variations. HPD mainly occurred in autumn and winter, which was generally related to the south and east wind. RH was a major cause for SNA pollution. Higher increment of SNA concentration as well as SOR and NOR was observed when the RH increased from 40-60% to 60–80%. © 2019 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Heavy polluted days; PM2.5; Relative humidity; SNA; Wind vector",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072315426

Kazakhstan is an important energy export country and a pivot of the “Belt and Road Initiative” (BRI). Despite its emissions are relatively small compared with huge emitters such as China and the US, Kazakhstan also faces great pressure in terms of CO2 emission reduction and green development. Accurately accounting CO2 emissions in Kazakhstan from both production and consumption perspectives is the first step for further emissions control actions. This paper constructs production-based CO2 emission inventories for Kazakhstan from 2012 to 2016, and then further analyses the demand-driven emissions within the domestic market and international trade (exports and imports) using environmentally extended input-output analysis. The production-based inventory includes 43 energy products and 30 sectors to provide detailed data for CO2 emissions in Kazakhstan. The consumption-based accounting results showed that certain sectors like construction drive more emissions and that the fuel consumption in different sectors varies. Furthermore, Russia and China are major consumers of Kazakhstan's energy and associated emissions, with the construction sector playing the most important role in it. The results suggested that both technology and policy actions should be taken into account to reduce CO2 emissions and that the BRI is also a good chance for Kazakhstan to develop a “Green Economy”. © 2019 The Authors","CO2 emissions; Consumption-based; Emission inventory; Kazakhstan; Multi-regional input-output analysis; Production-based","carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; construction industry; emission inventory; environmental economics; fuel consumption; green economy; input-output analysis; international trade; Kyoto Protocol; market conditions; air pollution control; Article; carbon footprint; combustion; developing country; economic aspect; economic development; energy balance; energy consumption; energy yield; environmental policy; Kazakhstan; renewable energy; socioeconomics; China; commercial phenomena; international cooperation; China; Kazakhstan; Russian Federation; Carbon Dioxide; China; Commerce; Internationality; Kazakhstan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071000557

Our results reveal a trend of decreasing inequality in carbon intensity in China, and the study also found that the contribution made by eastern China to that inequality decreased continuously, while the share of inequality in western China increased consistently during the study period. Spatial Markov chains were also applied to identify the spatiotemporal dynamics of inequalities in Chinese cities. The results show that there is a strong effect of the emission status of neighboring cities’ on a city's emission dynamics and the effect of self-reinforcing agglomeration was significant. Based on a multi-level model, the study further revealed that the disparity in China's carbon intensity levels was sensitive to the regional hierarchy across a variety of mechanisms acting as potential influencing factors. We found that technological progress and population density have a potential to mitigate the intensities driven by economic development, trade openness, road density, secondary industry proportion, and investment intensity.

The JCM calculates the spot price of emission rights, classifies regions in the trading market for emission rights into buyers and sellers, and calculates the optimal cooperative pollution abatement quantity. Compared with a non-cooperative control mode, the JCM generated benefits of US$2485.19 × 106. We then used a Game Quadratic Programming (GQP) method to distribute the benefits, and applied the JCM to a case study of the abatement of sulfur dioxide in China's Shanxi, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces. We found that: (i) Compared with a JCM that does not account for employment, employment under the JCM increased by 3.20 × 103 people, and the pollution control cost decreased by US$11.20 × 106 under the JCM that considered employment. The effect of the latter model is better than that of the former. (ii) Employment under the JCM increased by 18.80 × 104 people compared with that under a territorial control mode, reducing the cost by US$99.73 × 106.

A comprehensive understanding of the regional characteristics and evolution trends of the atmospheric pollutant emissions caused by energy consumption in China, and on a global scale, can facilitate a better understanding of the sources of atmospheric pollutants and the evolution of environmental issues. The scientific energy policies and measures taken to prevent air pollution have important theoretical and practical significance. In order to prevent air pollution and achieve sustainable economic development while economic growth is progressing, this study analyzes the factors that impact atmospheric pollutants. These factors are the energy consumption structure, energy intensity, economic growth, population, industrial structure, and FDI (Foreign Direct Investment). The study uses panel data from 2000 to 2016 for all Chinese provinces. Based on the analysis of the mechanism between the energy consumption structure and air quality, the dynamic panel data model and panel threshold model are proposed to study the effect of the above factors on atmospheric pollutants. The empirical results indicate that the first lag period of the atmospheric pollutants has a positive effect on the current air quality; that is, there is “inertia”. China's coal-based energy consumption structure has promoted air pollution across the nation overall and in the eastern, central, and western regions. The results of the panel threshold for economic growth indicate that the differences among the regions are significant. The country has three thresholds, and each region has a double threshold. The results of this study will benefit policymakers who are striving to improve the air quality by its consideration of the actual influencing factors, and it will help the policymakers to make the inverted U-shaped curve or inverted N-shaped curve more significant and lasting. It is then necessary to optimize the energy structure to avoid unrealistic and blind behavior. © 2019","Atmospheric pollutants; Energy consumption structure; Panel threshold model","Air quality; Atmospheric structure; Economics; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Investments; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Atmospheric pollutant emissions; Atmospheric pollutants; Energy consumption structure; Foreign direct investments; Fossil energy consumption; Regional characteristics; Sustainable economic development; Threshold model; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069546875

The fact cities differ in their levels of development and stages of industrialization points to the need for tailor-made low-carbon policies. This study is the first to consider cities' different phases of industrialization when analyzing city-level emission patterns and drivers, as well as the decoupling statuses between economic growth and their emission levels in China. The results of 15 representative cities at different phases of industrialization show that various decoupling statuses, driving factors and decoupling efforts exist among cities, and that heterogeneity among these factors also exists among cities at the same industrialization phase. For further decomposition, energy intensity contributed the most to emissions reduction during the period 2005 to 2010, especially for cities with more heavy manufacturing industries, whereas industrial structure was a stronger negative emission driver during the period 2010 to 2015. Based on those findings, we suggest putting into practice a diversified carbon-mitigation policy portfolio according to each city's industrialization phase rather than a single policy that focuses on one specific driving factor.

In this process, dramatic growth of CO2 emissions embodied in international trade attracted attention of relevant studies. Existing literatures have paid much attention on the empirical research of CO2 flows between developed and developing countries, while studies of CO2 emissions embodied in North-North trade were often overlooked. To partly fill the research gap, the study assessed CO2 emissions embodied in Germany-US trade during 2000–2015, which was viewed as an example of the empirical research on CO2 flows in North-North trade. On the basis of the estimation, we conducted a structural decomposition analysis on CO2 emissions embodied in Germany-US trade. The decomposition focused on five driving forces that dominated the change of CO2 emission flows. The result showed that Germany ran both the surplus of export CO2 emissions and surplus of trade volume with the US. The share of Germany-US export CO2 emissions to total export CO2 emissions of Germany was greater than US-Germany export CO2 emissions to total export CO2 emissions of the US, which, to some extent, indicated significance of the US in Germany's external trade was greater than importance of Germany in overseas trade of the US. Decline of the two ratios above showed a trend of transferring CO2 emissions to developing countries by the two countries. By comparison of sectoral CO2 distribution, the categories of “manufacturing” and “services” dominated most emissions in the trade. According to structural decomposition analysis, CO2 emission intensity and per capita final consumption caused most growth and reduction of emissions in the first 10 years, while in the next 5 years production structure of two countries played the most important role in change of embodied emissions. And the trend seemed to continue in the future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Decomposition; Embodied emission; Input-output; North-north trade","Decomposition; Developing countries; International trade; Driving forces; Embodied emissions; Empirical research; Input-output; Production structures; Reduction of emissions; Structural decomposition analysis; Total exports; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; developing world; globalization; input-output analysis; international trade; Article; carbon footprint; case study; China; controlled study; decomposition; environmental policy; geographic distribution; Germany; human; limit of quantitation; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; population research; priority journal; United States; Germany; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069580397

Positive net monetary exports for Japan were actually a kind of economic losses of the US, while positive net export CO2 emissions, or net CO2 emissions embodied in US-Japan trade, were regarded as pollution transfer from U.S. to Japan. However, due to lack of unified measurement units and standards between the two research fields, it is difficult to directly assess whether positive effects of U.S. via carbon transfer outweigh negative effects caused by economic losses. The study transforms absolute values of net monetary exports and net export CO2 emissions from 2000 to 2011 in US-Japan trade into two ratios: the ratio of net monetary exports to GDP of U.S. and the ratio of net embodied CO2 emissions to total CO2 emissions of the US. By comparison, the result shows that on average, net monetary exports between U.S. and Japan accounted for 0.45% of American GDP, while ratio of net export emissions to aggregate consumption-based CO2 emissions of U.S. kept about 0.20% during the research period concerned, which indicated that negative effects of economic losses in U.S. outweighed positive effects via carbon transfer in US-Japan trade. Furthermore, a structural analysis of CO2 emissions embodied in US-Japan trade during the 11 years is given. The most significant driver was emission coefficients, defined as CO2 emissions per unit of energy consumption. The driving force of emission coefficients led to dramatic reduction in CO2 flows from Japan to the US and thus caused decrease of net export emissions, which also explained the major reason for the low ratio of export emissions to total CO2 emissions of the US. Finally, according to sectoral distributions of CO2 flows between Japan and the US, emission sources of two countries presented different characteristics. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Economy-environment nexus; Emission coefficients; Multi-regional input-output analysis; Structural decomposition analysis; US-Japan trade","Carbon; Commerce; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Losses; Aggregate consumption; Carbon emissions; Economy-environment nexus; Emission coefficient; Emission sources; Input output analysis; Structural decomposition analysis; Unified measurements; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070197736

This paper discusses the decoupling relationship between the economy and CO2 emissions of China's metal industry (MI) and then adopts an integrated decomposition approach (which reveals the roles of technology and efficiency) to investigate the drivers of CO2 emissions. The main findings indicate that, during 2000–2016: (1) China's MI experienced four decoupling stages (i.e., weak decoupling, expansive negative decoupling, expansive coupling, and strong decoupling) and was characterized by weak decoupling. Overall, China's MI showed a clear tendency toward strong decoupling. (2) Potential energy intensity change, investment efficiency decline, and production technological progress were three pivotal factors contributing to emission abatement. Industrial structure regulation and energy-saving technology advancement also made a small contribution to emission abatement and the decoupling state. (3) Investment scale expansion was the primary factor promoting emission growth and impeding the progress of decoupling. Meanwhile, the energy structure adjustment during the sampling period failed to inhibit emissions but restricted decoupling. Finally, possible policies for mitigating carbon emissions in China's MI are provided. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Decomposition model; Decoupling index; Efficiency improvement; Technological progress","Carbon dioxide; Energy conservation; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Investments; Mineral industry; Mineral resources; Potential energy; Smelting; Carbon dioxide emissions; Decomposition model; Decoupling index; Efficiency improvement; Energy intensive industries; Energy structure adjustments; Energy-saving technologies; Technological progress; Industrial economics; carbon dioxide; abatement cost; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; economic growth; efficiency measurement; environmental economics; metals industry; Article; carbon footprint; China; decomposition; economic development; energy; energy conservation; energy yield; metal industry; priority journal; sampling; technology; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069577904

Sixteen priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) associated with PM2.5 and PM10 were analyzed for their seasonal variations, sources, health risks, and influencing factors. The results showed that the annual average concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were 111 and 185 μg/m3, respectively, exceeding the National Ambient Air Quality Standard of China (35 μg/m3 for PM2.5 and 70 μg/m3 for PM10 in Grade II). The annual averages of PM2.5- and PM10-bound total PAHs were 63.1 and 66.8 ng/m3, respectively, with a PM2.5 decrease in the order of winter (115 ng/m3) &gt; &gt; spring (47.6 ng/m3) &gt; summer (33.2 ng/m3) &gt; autumn (30.8 ng/m3) and a PM10 decrease in the order of winter (127 ng/m3) &gt; &gt; spring (55.6 ng/m3) &gt; autumn (32.6 ng/m3) &gt; summer (30.2 ng/m3). The most abundant PAHs were benzo[a]anthracene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, and fluoranthene. The PM2.5- and PM10-bound PAHs were originated mainly from traffic emissions (51.0% and 43.4%), followed by combustion of biomass (20.4% and 23.6%) and coal (16.8% and 23.1%). Pressure and relative humidity were positively correlated with PM2.5 and PM10 as well as PM2.5- and PM10-bound PAHs, while temperature, visibility and wind speed had negative correlations. The annual means of TEQs (toxic equivalency quantities) for the 16 PAHs in PM2.5 and PM10 were 10.1 and 10.2 ng/m3, respectively, being attributed to 7 carcinogenic PAHs (&gt; 95%). The ECRs (lifetime excess cancer risks) for PM2.5- and PM10-bound PAHs were 1.12 × 10−3 and 1.17 × 10−3, i.e., 1125 and 1169 lung cancer cases per million, respectively. The ILCRs (incremental lifetime cancer risks) due to PM2.5- and PM10-bound PAHs for adults (1.21 × 10−6 and 1.26 × 10−6) were larger than those for children (2.09 × 10−7 and 2.17 × 10−7), with acceptable carcinogenic risks. The ambient levels of PM and most PM-bound PAHs as well as their TEQs, ECRs and ILCRs exhibited a spatial pattern of the suburban site &gt; the urban site and a seasonality with winter and spring &gt; summer and autumn. The results suggest that it is important to control PM2.5 and PM10 for local air quality improvement and special attention should be paid to PM and PM-bound PAHs in suburban areas, particularly in winter and spring. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Health risk; Particulate matter; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; Source","Air quality; Aromatization; Atmospheric humidity; Coal combustion; Diseases; Health risks; Mineral oils; Particles (particulate matter); Urban growth; Wind; Air quality improvement; Annual average concentration; Atmospheric particulate matter; National ambient air quality standards; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Source; Toxic equivalency quantities; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; air quality; atmospheric pollution; health risk; PAH; particulate matter; seasonal variation; semiarid region; traffic emission; urban area; China; Shaanxi; Xian",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068038369

The Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) Region has experienced heavy PM2.5 pollution within China. In this study, a six-year time series (January 2013–December 2018) of PM2.5 mass concentration data from 102 air quality monitoring stations were studied to understand the spatio-temporal variation characteristics of the BTH region. The average annual PM2.5 mass concentration in the BTH region decreased from 98.9 µg/m3 in 2013 to 64.9 µg/m3 in 2017. Therefore, China has achieved its Air Pollution Prevention and Control Plan goal of reducing the concentration of fine particulate matter in the BTH region by 25% by 2017. The PM2.5 pollution in BTH plain areas showed a more significant change than mountains areas, with the highest PM2.5 mass concentration in winter and the lowest in summer. The results of spatial autocorrelation and cluster analyses showed that the PM2.5 mass concentration in the BTH region from 2013–2018 showed a significant spatial agglomeration, and that spatial distribution characteristics were high in the south and low in the north. Changes in PM2.5 mass concentration in the BTH region were affected by both socio-economic factors and meteorological factors. Our results can provide a point of reference for making PM2.5 pollution control decisions. © 2019 by the authors.

Chronic airway inflammation, airflow restriction and airway hyper-responsiveness are its main manifestations. In recent decades, the prevalence and mortality of asthma have been increasing all over the world, which seriously threatens public health. Research suggests that air pollution is associated with the increased incidence of asthma. PM2.5 is one of the most complex pollutants in the atmospheric environment and harmful to human health. It is related to the incidence of asthma. However, the molecular mechanism of PM2.5 in the development of asthma is still unclear. In this study, we established a mouse model of asthma using CRE to observe the effect of PM2.5 on the symptoms of asthmatic mice and its possible molecular mechanism. The results showed that PM2.5 could significantly increase airway resistance and pulmonary inflammation, increase the number of inflammatory cells, eosinophils, macrophages, neutrophils and lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in asthmatic mice. Moreover, PM2.5 could reduce the contents of antioxidant enzymes such as CAT, GSH, GSH-Px and T-SOD in lung tissue of mice, and increase the ROS level. PM2.5 can promote the expression of microRNA-206 in lung tissue of mice. miR-206 can target the 3’-UTR of SOD1 to inhibit SOD1 expression, which leads to the increase of ROS level and aggravates pulmonary inflammatory response and asthma symptoms in asthmatic mice. This study found the possible molecular mechanism of PM2.5 aggravating asthma, and miR-206 may be a potential target for asthma treatment. © 2019 The Authors","Asthma; MicroRNA-206; ROS; SOD1","antagomir; catalase; cytokeratin; glutathione; glutathione peroxidase; interleukin 13; interleukin 4; interleukin 5; microRNA; microRNA 206; superoxide dismutase; transcription factor Nrf2; unclassified drug; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; cytokine; microRNA; Mirn206 microRNA, mouse; reactive oxygen metabolite; Sod1 protein, mouse; 3' untranslated region; airway resistance; ambient air; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; asthma; cell nucleus transplantation; controlled study; disease exacerbation; eosinophil; female; flow cytometry; lung alveolus macrophage; lung function; lung lavage; lung parenchyma; lymphocyte; macrophage; mouse; neutrophil; nonhuman; oxidative stress; particulate matter; priority journal; protein electrophoresis; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; upregulation; air pollutant; animal; asthma; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; C57BL mouse; cell culture; cytology; drug effect; enzymology; epithelium cell; genetics; immunology; leukocyte count; lung; male; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Animals; Asthma; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; Cells, Cultured; Cytokines; Disease Progression; Epithelial Cells; Female; Leukocyte Count; Lung; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; MicroRNAs; Particulate Matter; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxide Dismutase-1",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072039429

The results showed that the addition of adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) or malonic acid (MA) reduced CO2 emission during chicken manure composting. However, only the addition of MA reduced CO2 emission during lawn waste and garden waste composting. In addition, both of the two inhibitors promoted HS formation, especially for ATP. Structural equation models further confirmed that ATP and MA reduced CO2 emission by inhibiting the decomposition of amino acid by microorganisms. Meanwhile, ATP promoted the conversion of amino acid and soluble sugars to HS, while MA only promoted the conversion of soluble sugars to HS.

Yet the impacts of the environmental tax on individual regions with different socioeconomic statuses, which are crucial for social justice and public acceptance, remain unclear. Based on a Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) table and a nationally regulated tax payment calculation method, this study analyzes the distributional impacts of an environmental tax based upon province's consumption from both inter-provincial and rural-urban aspects. The national tax revenue based on the current levy mechanism is estimated to be only one seventh of the economic loss from premature mortality caused by ambient particulate matter (PM2.5). The taxation may slightly alleviate urban-rural inequality but may not be helpful with reducing inter-provincial inequality. We further analyze two alternative levy mechanisms. If each province imposes taxes to products it consumes (rather than produces, as in the current mechanism), with the tax rate linearly dependent on its per capita consumption expenditure, this would moderately increase the national tax revenue and significantly reduce inter-provincial inequality. To better compensate for the economic costs of air pollution and reduce regional inequality, it would be beneficial to increase the tax rate nationwide and implement a levy mechanism based on provincially differentiated levels of consumption and economic status. © 2019 Science China Press","Air pollution; China; Environmental taxation; Inequality; Input-output analysis; Levy mechanisms","Air pollution; Economic analysis; Environmental regulations; Losses; Ambient particulate Matter; China; Environmental pollutions; Environmental taxation; Inequality; Input output analysis; Percapita consumption; Socio-economic status; Taxation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073835656

Such temporal growth and spatial divergence will have a significant influence on efforts to mitigate CO2 emissions. Given the research gap on the impact of the structural transition in population on PCCE, we constructed an econometric model using the dynamic panel method. The results reveal that the population structural transition has a significant nonlinear impact on PCCE, as the rate of population growth in China decelerates. Both demographic ageing and urban-rural migration have a stronger impact on PCCE than other factors. This effect, however, decreases beyond a certain threshold. An increase in the number of households due to urbanization and family downsizing has resulted in a positive effect on PCCE, without a threshold turning point. The research also finds that an increased share of the service sector in employment can reduce PCCE only if the sector employs more than 31.56% of the total employed population. Overall, these findings indicate that policymakers should pay attention to the prominence of the demographic structural transition for effective climate policy. Key policy insights Policymakers should address rising per capita carbon emissions (PCCE) and their spatial divergence in future climate policies, not just total CO2 emissions. The transitioning demographics of ageing and urbanization in China show a nonlinear, inverted U-shaped effect on PCCE instead of a continuously positive effect. Based on the nonlinear effect of employment structure on PCCE, policymakers should focus on the relationship between the structural transition of the economy and PCCE in future climate mitigation policies. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Ageing; China; employment structure; number of households; per capita CO2 emissions; urban-rural population migration","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; developing world; emission inventory; employment; environmental economics; environmental policy; future prospect; policy approach; policy making; population migration; population structure; urban-rural migration; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074288735

The prepared p-CDs can be obtained in high yield (48.7%) and emit bright yellow-green SSF under 365 nm UV light. The absolute PL quantum yield (PLQY) of p-CDs in solid state was measured to be 20.5%, which is much higher than that in aqueous solution. This interesting phenomenon shows that p-CDs not only successfully conquer the aggregation-caused fluorescence quenching (ACQ) effect, but also achieve enhanced fluorescence emission, which was rarely reported in previous literatures as CDs in solid state always reduce their fluorescence emission due to the excessive resonance energy transfer (RET) or direct π-π interactions. In addition, the relationship between the feed ratio of precursors and optical properties of the CDs were also investigated detailedly. Based on their strong SSF, the p-CDs were successfully used in rapid latent fingerprints detection and white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs) preparation with high quality. In summary, this research not only developed a new type of CDs with strong enhanced SSF, but also offered a valuable reference for design SSF-emitting CDs with high yield. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dots; Latent fingerprints; Light-emitting diodes; Solid-state fluorescence","Carbon; Diodes; Energy transfer; Fluorescence; Light emitting diodes; Optical properties; Quantum theory; Quenching; Carbon dots; Enhanced fluorescence emission; Fluorescence emission; Latent fingerprint; Resonance energy transfer; Solid-state fluorescence; White light emitting diodes; White lightemitting diodes (WLEDs); Palmprint recognition; Carbon; Diodes; Energy Transfer; Fluorescence; Optical Properties; Quenching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066971751

In order to investigate simultaneously controlling these two air pollutants, two simulation-based regional emission control experiments were designed using a nested air quality prediction model system (NAQPMS). One emission control scenario (“Conventional Control”) implemented the strictest control measures in Jinan and surrounding areas and resulted in a 15.7% reduction of O3 and a 21.3% reduction of PM2.5 on days polluted by O3 and PM2.5, respectively. The other emission control scenario (“Source-tagging Control”), by contrast, used online source-tagging modeling results from NAQPMS to select emission reduction regions based on their source contributions to the O3 and the PM2.5 in Jinan and resulted in a 16.2% reduction of O3 and a 22.8% reduction of PM2.5 on days polluted by O3 and PM2.5, respectively. Compared to Conventional Control, this scheme produced smaller reductions in emissions from areas with low contributions to the O3 and PM2.5 concentrations in Jinan as well as in the total emissions of primary pollutants (the reduced emissions was only 61% of that needed by Conventional Control), and the area and the population affected by these reductions decreased by 12% and 31%, respectively. However, this study demonstrates that Source-tagging Control is more efficient than Conventional Control in reducing simultaneous pollution by O3 and PM2.5 through regional measures. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Emission control; O3; PM2.5; Simultaneous pollution; Source-tagging method","Air quality; Emission control; Air quality prediction; Control experiments; Conventional control; PM2.5; PM2.5 concentration; Simulation-based designs; Source contributions; Source-tagging method; Quality control; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); design method; emission control; experimental study; methodology; ozone; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution control; simulation; China; Jinan [Shandong]; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074534764

Despite tremendous efforts, developing highly active and selective CO2 reduction photocatalysts remains a great challenge. Herein, a metal oxide heterostructure engineering strategy that enables the gas-phase, photocatalytic, heterogeneous hydrogenation of CO2 to CO with high performance metrics (i.e., the conversion rate of CO2 to CO reached as high as 1400 µmol g cat−1 h−1) is reported. The catalyst is comprised of indium oxide nanocrystals, In2O3− x(OH)y, nucleated and grown on the surface of niobium pentoxide (Nb2O5) nanorods. The heterostructure between In2O3− x(OH)y nanocrystals and the Nb2O5 nanorod support increases the concentration of oxygen vacancies and prolongs excited state (electron and hole) lifetimes. Together, these effects result in a dramatically improved photocatalytic performance compared to the isolated In2O3− x(OH)y material. The defect optimized heterostructure exhibits a 44-fold higher conversion rate than pristine In2O3− x(OH)y. It also exhibits selective conversion of CO2 to CO as well as long-term operational stability. © 2019 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

China’s current administrative management is a vertical nested structure, and the characteristics of high-scale regions have a non-negligible impact on low-scale areas. Taking the county scale of the basic unit of economic and social development as the research scale, according to the panel data of the Yangtze River Delta from 2008 to 2016, a two-level hierarchical linear model (HLM) for carbon emission intensity is constructed, especially considering the characteristics of high-scale regions (i.e., low-carbon pilot cities) at the second level, and is combined with the mediating effect test method to analyze the impact path of urban development on carbon emissions intensity. The results show that (1) there is a spatial nesting relationship between regions of different scales, and the city scale can explain 85.21% of the carbon emissions intensity, which is much higher than the county scale. (2) There is an N-shaped curve relationship between urban development and carbon emissions intensity. After considering the high-scale factor (low-carbon pilot cities) at the city scale (the second level of the HLM), if a high-scale city is a low-carbon pilot city, then improvement in the level of urbanization in the county can promote a reduction in carbon intensity. (3) The impact path of urban development ⇄ per capita gross domestic product (the proportion of secondary industry, patent application volume) → carbon emissions intensity and urban development → the proportion of tertiary industry → carbon emissions intensity is significant. However, the path of the proportion of tertiary industry → urban development → carbon emissions intensity is not significant. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emission intensity; China Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration; Hierarchical linear model (HLM); Hierarchical nesting structure; Mediating effect; Urbanization","carbon emission; empirical analysis; hierarchical system; numerical model; panel data; social development; urban development; urbanization; China; Yangtze River; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; city; city planning; empirical research; industry; river; urbanization; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Empirical Research; Industry; Rivers; Urban Renewal; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072227806

Using a sample of 2511 firms that were listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges in 2014 and 2015, we find that institutional pressure arising from government evaluation has a positive influence on corporate carbon reduction engagement. Moreover, the positive effect is stronger for non-state-owned enterprises (NSOEs) than for state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The subsequent analysis shows that carbon reduction engagement in NSOEs is positively associated with firms' access to state-owned bank loans. We further observe that there is a momentum of carbon reduction engagement due to institutional pressure.

Developments in nanofabrication techniques have enabled the patterning of a wide range of nanomaterial designs over macroscale (&gt;in.2) areas. Periodic metal nanostructures show long-range diffractive interactions when the lattice spacing is close to the wavelength of the incident light. The collective coupling between metal nanoparticles in a lattice introduces sharp and intense plasmonic surface lattice resonances, in contrast to the broad localized resonances from single nanoparticles. Plasmonic nanoparticle lattices exhibit strongly enhanced optical fields within the subwavelength vicinity of the nanoparticle unit cells that are 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of individual units. These intense electromagnetic fields can manipulate nanoscale processes such as photocatalysis, optical spectroscopy, nonlinear optics, and light harvesting.This Account focuses on advances in exciton-plasmon coupling and light-matter interactions with plasmonic nanoparticle lattices. First, we introduce the fundamentals of ultrasharp surface lattice resonances; these resonances arise from the coupling of the localized surface plasmons of a nanoparticle to the diffraction mode from the lattice. Second, we discuss how integrating dye molecules with plasmonic nanoparticle lattices can result in an architecture for nanoscale lasing at room temperature. The lasing emission wavelength can be tuned in real time by adjusting the refractive index environment or varying the lattice spacing. Third, we describe how manipulating either the shape of the unit cell or the lattice geometry can control the lasing emission properties. Low-symmetry plasmonic nanoparticle lattices can show polarization-dependent lasing responses, and multiscale plasmonic superlattices-finite patches of nanoparticles grouped into microscale arrays-can support multiple plasmon resonances for controlled multimodal nanolasing.Fourth, we discuss how the assembly of photoactive emitters on the nanocavity arrays behaves as a hybrid materials system with enhanced exciton-plasmon coupling. Positioning metal-organic framework materials around nanoparticles produces mixed photon modes with strongly enhanced photoluminescence at wavelengths determined by the lattice. Deterministic coupling of quantum emitters in two-dimensional materials to plasmonic lattices leads to preserved single-photon emission and reduced decay lifetimes.

Through the design of the pilot water-cooled incinerator, the operating parameters and the characteristics of alkali ash deposition of the waste incinerator were tested. The pilot incinerator is a natural-cycle steam boiler, has a full water-cooled II-type structure, with liquid slag discharge, and the furnace design has selected reasonable volumetric heat load and flue gas residence time. Combustion distribution is the core parameter affecting the combustion of waste liquid. Studies have shown that increasing the primary air rate and the excess air coefficient are beneficial to improve the combustion performance of waste liquid, increase steam production, and reduce CO and SO2 emissions in flue gas, but also increase the concentration of NO. When the excess air ratio was 1.2, and the primary air ratio was 0.65, the NO concentration in the tail flue gas was less than 10 ppm, and the SO2 concentration was zero. The TG-DTA method measured that when the alkali ash melting temperature was less than 587 ◦C, the alkali ash had strong adhesion in the high temperature zone of the incinerator and less deposition in the low temperature region of the tail. The alkali ash deposition rate and relative deposition rate were used to quantitatively study the characteristic of alkali ash deposition. © 2019 by the authors.","Combustion; Deposit; Incinerator; Plant Chemical Polyol; Waste Liquor","Alcohols; Chemical plants; Coal fired boilers; Combustion; Cooling water; Deposition rates; Deposits; Engines; Flue gases; Flues; Gas emissions; Liquids; Refuse incinerators; Residence time distribution; Slags; Temperature; Tungsten compounds; Combustion characteristics; Combustion performance; Excess air coefficient; High temperature zones; Low temperature regions; Operating parameters; Plant Chemical Polyol; Waste liquors; Waste incineration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076412471

Ion molecular reaction-mass spectrometry was applied to determine NO, NO2, and NH3 concentrations at a time resolution of 0.6 s. Catalyst aging was shown to result in a significant increase in the amount of NH3 formed, which has received limited attention in the literature to date. The selectivity toward NH3 formation has been shown to increase with the decrease in the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of a TWC induced by thermal aging. NH3 has been shown to mainly form within the exhaust temperature range of 250-550 °C. Typical lambda and rich operational condition duration periods found in vehicle test procedures were also employed to investigate their effects on NH3 formation. The results suggest that a decrease in the lambda and/or an increase in the duration of rich operating conditions will lead to an increase in the selectivity toward NH3 formation. Improving the OSC of TWCs and effectively controlling the lambda near to 1.0 with limited duration in rich operating conditions are therefore significant factors in the reduction of NH3 emissions.

Despite that cities cover only &lt;3% of the Earth's land surface area, they emerged as focal points of human activities, and confront numerous environmental challenges as a result of changes in landscapes, hydroclimate, ecosystems, and biodiversity. In particular, the built environment usually experiences exacerbated heat stress induced by global climate and landscape changes, commonly known as the urban heat island effect. Urban irrigation, as a climate adaptation and mitigation strategy, is effective in cooling the built environment, but exhibits large uncertainties in the trade-off between water use and heat mitigation capacity. Here we show the efficiency of cooling effect induced by irrigation of urban vegetation, represented by a novel metric, viz. urban water capacity, analogous to the heat capacity, across the contiguous United States (CONUS) during summertime via numerical simulations. The urban water capacity is calculated as the average irrigation depth per degree of urban temperature reduction; the values are 4.52 ± 0.77 mm day−1 °C−1 and 7.27 ± 1.27 mm day−1 °C−1 (mean ± standard deviation) for surface and near-surface air cooling, respectively, over the CONUS. The robustness of urban water capacity is further exemplified in an extreme heat wave event, during which the warming anomaly is partially offset by the additional cooling from urban irrigation. Estimates of water capacity provide a quantitative metric for evaluating the efficacy of irrigation in urban planning under current heat stress and future warming. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Extreme heat wave; Heat mitigation; Irrigation; Regional hydroclimate; Urban water capacity; Water–heat trade-off","Biodiversity; Climatology; Economic and social effects; Irrigation; Specific heat; Thermal stress; Environmental challenges; Heat waves; Mitigation strategy; Quantitative metric; Regional hydroclimate; Trade off; Urban Heat Island Effects; Urban waters; Atmospheric temperature; cooling; global warming; heat island; heat wave; irrigation; regional climate; trade-off; water use; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071397242

While much progress has been made in developing total Nr deposition budgets for the U.S., current budgets remain limited by key data and knowledge gaps. Analysis of National Atmospheric Deposition Program Total Deposition (NADP/TDep) data illustrates several aspects of current Nr deposition that motivate additional research. Averaged across the continental U.S., dry deposition contributes slightly more (55%) to total deposition than wet deposition and is the dominant process (&gt;90%) over broad areas of the Southwest and other arid regions of the West. Lack of dry deposition measurements imposes a reliance on models, resulting in a much higher degree of uncertainty relative to wet deposition which is routinely measured. As nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions continue to decline, reduced forms of inorganic nitrogen (NHx = NH3 + NH4 +) now contribute &gt;50% of total Nr deposition over large areas of the U.S. Expanded monitoring and additional process-level research are needed to better understand NHx deposition, its contribution to total Nr deposition budgets, and the processes by which reduced N deposits to ecosystems. Urban and suburban areas are hotspots where routine monitoring of oxidized and reduced Nr deposition is needed. Finally, deposition budgets have incomplete information about the speciation of atmospheric nitrogen; monitoring networks do not capture important forms of Nr such as organic nitrogen. Building on these themes, we detail the state of the science of Nr deposition budgets in the U.S. and highlight research priorities to improve deposition budgets in terms of monitoring and flux measurements, leaf- to regional-scale modeling, source apportionment, and characterization of deposition trends and patterns. © 2019","Ammonia; Dry deposition; Organic nitrogen; Oxidized nitrogen; Reactive nitrogen; Wet deposition","Ammonia; Ecosystems; Meteorological problems; Nitrogen oxides; Uncertainty analysis; Dry deposition; Organic nitrogen; Oxidized nitrogen; Reactive nitrogen; Wet deposition; Budget control; ammonia; dry deposition; flux measurement; monitoring; nitrogen oxides; organic nitrogen; oxidation; regional climate; trend analysis; wet deposition; acidity; Article; biodiversity; biosphere; budget; conceptual framework; environmental management; environmental monitoring; geographic distribution; methodology; nitrogen deposition; oxidation; precipitation; priority journal; suburban area; United States; urban area; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069826081

Yet very little empirical research aimed at understanding this kind of energy transition has been published to date. In this paper, we present findings from an analysis of five large, mainstream (CBC, Globe and Mail, National Post, Vancouver Sun, Toronto Star) and Indigenous (APTN) Canadian media outlets from 2008 to 2017 (n = 153). Using Etuaptmumk (Two-Eyed Seeing) and energy justice frameworks, we are interested in the ways Indigenous Peoples are being written about and perceived among the Canadian public. We use content analysis to understand more about the types of issues being brought forth into the public eye, and critical discourse analysis to assess each outlet's telling and framing of these stories. Findings indicate that stories of Indigenous opposition to large scale hydro development dominate our sample – articles of protest, lawsuits, and threats to nation-to-nation-building that are more commonly seen in extractive industries. Stories covering other technologies (e.g. solar, wind) showcase excitement, positive socio-economic benefit, and opportunities for reconciliation. Second, and against the backdrop of historical misrepresentation of Indigenous Peoples, we find what some may deem exemplars of fair coverage of Indigenous Peoples and renewable energy. Despite the absence of overt racist phrases — as seen in the recent past — authors rarely attend to the colonial history that has created structural issues prevalent in communities today.

Because mangrove roots are woody and their epibionts are used to ever-changing conditions in highly variable environments, mangrove habitats may be more resilient to global change stressors than other marine foundation species. Using a large-scale mesocosm experiment, we examined how ocean warming and acidification, under a reduced carbon emission scenario, affect the composition and structural complexity of mangrove epibiont communities and the use of mangrove habitat by juvenile fishes. We demonstrate that even a modest increase in seawater temperature of 1.2 °C leads to the homogenisation and flattening of mangrove root epibiont communities. Warming led to a 24% increase in the overall cover of algal epibionts on roots but the diversity of the epibiont species decreased by 33%. Epibiont structural complexity decreased owing to the shorter stature of weedy algal turfs which prospered under elevated temperature. Juvenile fishes showed alterations in mangrove habitat use with ocean warming and acidification, but these were independent of changes to the root epibiont community. We reveal that the quality of apparently resilient mangrove habitats and their perceived value as habitat for associated fauna are still vulnerable under a globally reduced carbon emission scenario. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Epibionts; Flattening; Homogenisation; Mangroves; Mesocosm; Ocean acidification; Ocean warming; Structural complexity","Acidification; Animals; Carbon; Climate change; Fish; Homogenization method; Oceanography; Epibionts; Flattening; Mangroves; Mesocosms; Ocean acidifications; Ocean warming; Structural complexity; Ecosystems; sea water; sea water; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; community response; complexity; epibiont; future prospect; habitat structure; homogeneity; mangrove; ocean acidification; sea surface temperature; temperature anomaly; acidification; Article; carbon dioxide tension; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; epibiont; fish; mangrove; marine species; mesocosm; nonhuman; pH; priority journal; sea; species diversity; warming; water temperature; chemistry; climate change; ecosystem; greenhouse effect; sea; temperature; wetland; algae; Animalia; Pisces; Rhizophoraceae; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Global Warming; Oceans and Seas; Seawater; Temperature; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068564472

The main focus of this survey is on the coverage of countries, modeling methodologies, periods as well as empirical conclusions. The literature survey in this research paper is based on the causality's direction between (i) economic growth and carbon emission; (ii) economic growth and energy consumption; (iii) energy consumption and carbon emissions. From reviewing these studies, general remark can be assumed that the literature which has been produced is paradoxical. Firstly, most of the earlier studies have reported that economic growth and energy consumption are significant sources of carbon emission, however, the role of economic growth in carbon emission is highly reported in highly developing countries. On contrary, in case of developed countries, carbon emission is not linked with economic development. Secondly, in case of developing countries, higher energy consumption leads to increase the economic growth. For developed countries, there are less evidence of dependence between energy consumption and economic growth. Lastly, in both developing and developed countries, higher energy consumption has reported the main culprit for carbon emission Focusing on the implications, the governments and industries have to replace the non-renewable energy sources with renewable sources to generate electricity, run the industrial operations and for transportation purposes etc. Comprehending the literature survey has provided the basis to address the designing as well as implementing effective environmental as well as energy policies. © 2019 The Authors","Carbon emission; Economic consumption; Economic growth; Literature survey","Carbon; Developing countries; Economics; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Industrial emissions; Renewable energy resources; Surveys; Carbon emissions; Economic consumption; Economic development; Economic growths; Generate electricity; Industrial operations; Literature survey; Non-renewable energy sources; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070532629

We have shown, as a proof of concept, that it is possible to establish an anaerobic starter culture using strains isolated from spent MWFs which are capable of reducing COD or, most significantly, methanogenesis in this biocidal waste stream. Bacterial strains (n = 99) and archaeal methanogens (n = 28) were isolated from spent MWFs. The most common bacterial strains were Clostridium species (n = 45). All methanogens were identified as Methanosarcina mazei. Using a random partitions design (RPD) mesocosm experiment, we found that bacterial diversity and species–species interactions had significant effects on COD reduction but that bacterial composition did not. The RPD study showed similar effects on methanogenesis, except that composition was also significant. We identified bacterial species with positive and negative effects on methane production. A consortium of 16 bacterial species and three methanogens was used to initiate a fluidized bed bioreactor (FBR), in batch mode. COD reduction and methane production were variable, and the reactor was oscillated between continuous and batch feeds. In both microcosm and FBR experiments, periodic inconsistencies in bacterial reduction in fermentative products to formic and acetic acids were identified as a key issue. © 2019 The Authors.

Results show that emissions to air and lead times of freight delivery vehicles can be drastically reduced when appropriate infrastructure and resources are provided. Changing the type of unloading areas can reduce NOX emissions by up to 95%, while lead times can be reduced by 78% if staff helps with unloading. Some configurations are more suitable to lower emissions to air while others are more effective in reducing lead times. Consequently, decision makers can use this model to explore how adjustments in infrastructure and available resources impact emissions and delivery vehicle lead times. Furthermore, it can act as a basis tool to analyze policies and laws to facilitate sustainable retail street operations in the future. © 2019","City logistic; Discrete-event simulation; Freight vehicle parking; Lead time; Local emission; Unloading operation","Decision making; Discrete event simulation; Freight cars; Sales; Unloading; Vehicles; City logistics; Freight deliveries; Freight vehicle; Global emissions; Leadtime; Local emissions; Policies and laws; Simulation studies; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071938599

While the resulting problem of carbon leakage has been well studied, its mitigation has received relatively less attention. We devise a proactive carbon policy via a bi-level modelling approach by considering the impact of an emission cap that limits the cost of damage from a regional power market. In particular, a welfare-maximising policymaker sets the cap when facing profit-maximising producers and the damage costs from their emissions at two nodes. A partial-coverage policy could degrade maximised social welfare and increase total regional CO2 emissions with potential for carbon leakage due to a higher nodal price difference. A modified carbon policy that considers CO2 emissions from both nodes tightens the cap, which increases maximised social welfare and decreases total CO2 emissions vis-à-vis the partial-coverage policy, albeit at the cost of greater scope for carbon leakage as it causes nodal prices to diverge. As a compromise, an import-coverage policy, implemented by California, that counts only domestic and imported CO2 emissions could alleviate carbon leakage at the cost of lower maximised social welfare with higher total emissions vis-à-vis the modified-coverage policy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bi-level modelling; Carbon leakage; Regional electricity markets","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Costs; Power markets; Asymmetric carbons; Carbon leakage; Modified carbon; Partial coverage; Regional electricity markets; Regional power market; Social welfare; Total emissions; Electric power system interconnection; carbon emission; emissions trading; energy market; environmental economics; leakage; policy analysis; policy implementation; power generation; price dynamics; welfare economics; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072011955

As this phenomenon could be enhanced by both global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and urban expansion, urban planners and policymakers should integrate both in their assessment. One way to consider these two concepts is by using urban climate models at a high resolution. In this study, the influence of urban expansion and GHG emission scenarios is evaluated at 100 m spatial resolution for the city of Brussels (Belgium) in the near (2031–2050) and far (2081–2100) future. Two possible urban planning scenarios (translated into local climate zones, LCZs) in combination with two representative concentration pathways (RCPs 4.5 and 8.5) have been implemented in the urban climate model UrbClim. The projections show that the influence of GHG emissions trumps urban planning measures in each period. In the near future, no large differences are seen between the RCP scenarios; in the far future, both heat stress and risk values are twice as large for RCP 8.5 compared to RCP 4.5. Depending on the GHG scenario and the LCZ type, heat stress is projected to increase by a factor of 10 by 2090 compared to the present-day climate and urban planning conditions. The imprint of vulnerability and exposure is clearly visible in the heat risk assessment, leading to very high levels of heat risk, most notably for the North Western part of the Brussels Capital Region. The results demonstrate the need for mitigation and adaptation plans at different policy levels that strive for lower GHG emissions and the development of sustainable urban areas safeguarding livability in cities. © 2019",,"climate modeling; emission; greenhouse gas; numerical model; policy making; range expansion; risk assessment; rural population; spatial resolution; urban planning; vulnerability; article; Brussels Capital Region; carbon footprint; city planning; climate; heat stress; human; risk assessment; urban area; Belgium; city; city planning; climate change; greenhouse gas; heat; risk assessment; theoretical model; Belgium; Brussels [Belgium]; Belgium; Cities; City Planning; Climate Change; Greenhouse Gases; Hot Temperature; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070774498

This study compared the reef-building capacity of shallow-water inner, patch, and outer reefs in the two islands of Pohnpei and Kosrae, Federated States of Micronesia. We identified which reefs were likely to keep up with sea-level rise under different climate-change scenarios, and estimated whether there were differences across habitats in the threshold of percentage coral cover at which net carbonate production becomes negative. We also quantified the influence of A. solaris on carbonate production. Whereas the northwestern outer reefs of Pohnpei and Kosrae had the highest net rates of carbonate production (18.5 and 16.4 kg CaCO3 m-2 yr-1, respectively), the southeastern outer reefs had the lowest rates of carbonate production (1.2–1.3 and 0.7 kg CaCO3 m-2 yr-1, respectively). The patch reefs of Pohnpei had on average higher net carbonate production rates (9.5 kg CaCO3 m-2 yr-1) than the inner reefs of both Pohnpei and Kosrae (7.0 and 7.8 kg CaCO3 m-2 yr-1, respectively). A. solaris were common on Kosrae and caused an average reduction in carbonate production of 0.6 kg CaCO3 m-2 yr-1 on Kosraean reefs. Northern outer reefs are the most likely habitats to keep up with sea-level rise in both Pohnpei and Kosrae. Overall, the inner reefs of Pohnpei and Kosrae need ~ 5.5% more coral cover to generate the same amount of carbonate as outer reefs. Therefore, inner reefs need special protection from land-use change and local pollution to keep pace with sea-level rise under all climate-change scenarios. © 2019 van Woesik, Cacciapaglia.

Thr is converted to glycine and acetyl CoA, and the glycine is metabolized specifically to regulate trimethylation of lysine (Lys) residue 4 in histone H3 (H3K4me3). DNA methylation and methylation of other H3 Lys residues remain unimpaired by Thr deprivation in mES cell culture medium. Similarly, hES cells require methionine (Met) to maintain the Met-SAM (S-adenosyl methionine) cycle of 1-carbon metabolism also for H3K4me3 formation. H3K4me3 is needed specifically to regulate and maintain both mES and hES cell proliferation and their pluripotent states. Better understanding of this regulation is essential since treatment of human diseases and disorders will increasingly involve hES cells. Furthermore, since ES cells are derived from their progenitor cells in preimplantation blastocysts, they serve as models of 1-carbon metabolism in these precursors of all mammalian tissues and organs. One-carbon metabolism challenges, such as a maternal low protein diet (LPD) during preimplantation blastocyst development, contribute to development of metabolic syndrome and related abnormalities in adults. These 1-carbon metabolism challenges result in altered epigenetic DNA and histone modifications in ES progenitor cells and the tissues and organs to which they develop. Moreover, the modified histones could have extracellular as well as intracellular effects, since histones are secreted in uterine fluid and influence early embryo development. Hence, the mechanisms and transgenerational implications of these altered epigenetic DNA and histone modifications warrant concerted further study. © Copyright © 2019 Van Winkle and Ryznar.","embryonic stem cells; epigenetic histone modification; folate; inner cell mass; metabolic syndrome; methionine metabolism; one-carbon metabolism; threonine metabolism","3 hydroxynorvaline; amino acid; carbon; DNA; histone; methionine; threonine; Article; carbon metabolism; cell fate; cell growth; cell metabolism; cell proliferation; DNA modification; embryonic stem cell; epigenetics; genital system; growth inhibition; histone methylation; histone modification; human; human embryonic stem cell; lipid raft; mouse embryonic stem cell; nonhuman; protein restriction; protein synthesis; signal transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076685002

Especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), GHG emissions from these processes might increase steeply in coming decades, due to tripling demand for food until 2050 to match the steep population growth. This study assesses the impact of achieving cereal self-sufficiency by the year 2050 for 10 SSA countries on GHG emissions related to different scenarios of increasing cereal production, ranging from intensifying production to agricultural area expansion. We also assessed different nutrient management variants in the intensification. Our analysis revealed that irrespective of intensification or extensification, GHG emissions of the 10 countries jointly are at least 50% higher in 2050 than in 2015. Intensification will come, depending on the nutrient use efficiency achieved, with large increases in nutrient inputs and associated GHG emissions. However, matching food demand through conversion of forest and grasslands to cereal area likely results in much higher GHG emissions. Moreover, many countries lack enough suitable land for cereal expansion to match food demand. In addition, we analysed the uncertainty in our GHG estimates and found that it is caused primarily by uncertainty in the IPCC Tier 1 coefficient for direct N2O emissions, and by the agronomic nitrogen use efficiency (N-AE). In conclusion, intensification scenarios are clearly superior to expansion scenarios in terms of climate change mitigation, but only if current N-AE is increased to levels commonly achieved in, for example, the United States, and which have been demonstrated to be feasible in some locations in SSA. As such, intensifying cereal production with good agronomy and nutrient management is essential to moderate inevitable increases in GHG emissions. Sustainably increasing crop production in SSA is therefore a daunting challenge in the coming decades. © 2019 The Authors.

Heat pump technology is considered to be one of the environmentally friendly solutions to increase energy efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of buildings. Heat pumps have been finding their way into the Lithuanian market since 2002, and currently there are many good practice examples present in the country, especially in the residential and public sectors. Heat pump use is economically advantageous in the Baltic Region, and the market share of these systems is growing. Studies have reported seasonal performance factor (SPF) ranges within 1.8 and 5.6. The lower SPF values are typically attributable to air source heat pumps, whereas the higher efficiency is achieved by ground or water source heat pump applications. While the traditional heat pump techniques are well established in the region, there is a slow uptake of new technologies, such as solar-assisted heat pumps, absorption heat pumps and heat pumps integrated into foundations, tunnels or diaphragm walls. This paper provides a critical review of different heat pump technologies, using Lithuania as a cold climate case study to overview the market trends within the European context. Potential trends for the heat pump technology development in terms of application areas, cost-benefit predictions, as well as environmental aspects, are discussed. © 2019 by the authors.","Ground and water source heat pump (ASHP; GSHP; Space heating; domestic hot water (DHW); air; WSHP); coefficient of performance (COP); seasonal performance factor (SPF); energy pile; energy tunnel","Carbon footprint; Coefficient of performance; Commerce; Competition; Cost benefit analysis; Environmental technology; Hot water distribution systems; Piles; Space heating; Water; Absorption heat pumps; Domestic hot water; Environmental aspects; GSHP; Household energy demands; Seasonal performance; Solar assisted heat pump; Water source heat pump; Air source heat pumps",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075989310

Final effluent from both the plants was compared for its suitability to recharge a potable water supply aquifer. The two treatment approaches included a carbon-based treatment process (flocculation/sedimentation, ozone-biofiltration, granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption, ultraviolet (UV) disinfection; 20,000 L/day) and a membrane-based treatment process (ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis, UV-hydrogen peroxide advanced oxidation; 160,000 L/day). Both processes were found to be reliable in producing water that met all United States Safe Drinking Water Act's primary maximum contaminant levels (MCLs). The carbon-based process often exceeded the secondary MCL for total dissolved solids due to background salinity in the source water. Results showed that both systems performed comparably with respect to removal of pathogens, fecal indicators, and contaminants of emerging concern. Total organic carbon (TOC) was removed to below 0.5 mg/L by the membrane-based process. For the carbon-based process, GAC media exhaustion over the course of the pilot operation resulted in an increase in finished water TOC from <0.5 to ∼4 mg/L. Disinfection byproducts, including trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids were not measured above their respective MCL after 8 h of free chlorine contact in a simulated distribution system test.

The climatology factors can be in the form of land degradation, land-use changes, and population increase. The land-use changes can identify when there is a conversion of recharge area into a built area. The conversion may happen because there is potency for a flood area to transform into a place of cities development and settlements. When the population increases, space needed also enlarges. Consequently, the surface flow increase and can cause a flood. Padang - Indonesia, has high rainfall intensity around 3,329 to 4,296 mm/year, which results in a frequent flood. The worst flood occurred on 26 September 2018 and 2 November 2018, which washed away a bridge and caused a 3-meter high puddle.

At over 50% private power systems ownership, the majority of urban Nigerian households rely on conventional self-generation utilising expensive petrol and diesel-powered generators. Despite the high upfront costs of a sizeable PV module, some households are choosing such sustainable alternative power. This paper investigates the motives for PV adoption in urban Nigeria following innovation diffusion and adoption theories. Using interviews, PV adopter data were collected on key drivers for uptake and results analysed. Field survey analysis established the key motives for uptake as power outages, energy cost-savings, including generator use fuel fraud, awareness and access to finance while key barriers include high capital costs and lack of finance. The results point to the need for regulatory and political intervention.

While the risk of severe damages increases with the level of global warming (Dell et al., 2014; IPCC, 2014b, 2018; Lenton et al., 2008), mitigating costs increase steeply with more stringent warming limits (IPCC, 2014a; Luderer et al., 2013; Rogelj et al., 2015). Here, we show that the global warming limit that minimizes this century's total economic costs of climate change lies between 1.9 and 2?C, if temperature changes continue to impact national economic growth rates as observed in the past and if instantaneous growth effects are neither compensated nor amplified by additional growth effects in the following years. The result is robust across a wide range of normative assumptions on the valuation of future welfare and inequality aversion. We combine estimates of climate-change impacts on economic growth for 186 countries (applying an empirical damage function from Burke et al., 2015) with mitigation costs derived from a state-of-the-art energy-economy-climate model with a wide range of highly resolved mitigation options (Kriegler et al., 2017; Luderer et al., 2013, 2015). Our purely economic assessment, even though it omits non-market damages, provides support for the international Paris Agreement on climate change. The political goal of limiting global warming to ""well below 2 degrees"" is thus also an economically optimal goal given above assumptions on adaptation and damage persistence. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

As EOR and other methods of enhancing production such as hydraulic fracturing have become more prevalent, environmental concerns about the impact of both new and historical hydrocarbon production on overlying shallow aquifers have increased. Noble gas isotopes are powerful tracers of subsurface fluid provenance and can be used to understand the impact of EOR on hydrocarbon systems and potentially overlying aquifers. In oil systems, produced fluids can consist of a mixture of oil, water and gas. Noble gases are typically measured in the gas phase; however, it is not always possible to collect gases and therefore produced fluids (which are water, oil, and gas mixtures) must be analyzed. We outline a new technique to separate and analyze noble gases in multiphase hydrocarbon-associated fluid samples. An offline double capillary method has been developed to quantitatively isolate noble gases into a transfer vessel, while effectively removing all water, oil, and less volatile hydrocarbons. The gases are then cleaned and analyzed using standard techniques. Air-saturated water reference materials (n = 24) were analyzed and results show a method reproducibility of 2.9% for 4He, 3.8% for 20Ne, 4.5% for 36Ar, 5.3% for 84Kr, and 5.7% for 132Xe.

The preparation of diamine monomers implied the reaction between a phenoxyalkyloxirane (alkyl: H, methyl, isopropyl) and bisphenol A, obtaining the respective aliphatic diols, which produced the corresponding dinitro derivatives. Finally, these derivatives were reduced by using palladium/carbon activated as catalyst and hydrazine as a hydrogen source. Then, six oligomeric poly(ether-azomethine)s (PEAzMs) were obtained from a polycondensation reaction between the new diamines and bis(4-formylbiphenyl-4-yl)dialkylsilane (alkyl: methyl, phenyl) with 84–93% yields. The structural characterization of the diamines and PEAzMs was performed by elemental analysis, infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H, 13C, and 29Si). Furthermore, polymers were analyzed by solubility tests, gel permeation chromatography, ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy, thermogravimetry, and differential scanning calorimetry analysis. The results showed PEAzMs with 2–11 repetitive units, where the design of the monomers allowed to obtain improved solution processability in comparison with previously reported silylated poly(azomethine)s and good thermal stability. Additionally, all samples showed high transparency in the UV–vis region. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

The statistical downscaling model reacted as the climate model to generate the long-term pattern of the local climates affected by the greenhouse gases. Analysis 2 refers to the reservoir optimization but excluded the climate changes assessment in the analyses. The non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm version II (NSGA-II) was applied in both analyses to optimize the water use due to the multi-objectives demand, maximizing water release, minimizing water shortage and maximizing reservoir storage. The formation of Pareto optimal solutions from both analyses was measured and compared. The results showed the Analysis 1 potential to produce consistence monthly flow with lesser error and higher correlation values. It also produced better Pareto optimal solution set and considered all the objectives demands.

The CLustEr-based Validated Emission Recalculation (CLEVER) method makes use of instantaneous speed data and link-based traffic characteristics in order to refine on-road GHG inventories. The CLEVER approach first clusters road links based on aggregate traffic characteristics, then assigns representative emission factors (EFs), calibrated using the output of microscopic emission modeling. In this paper, cluster parameters including number and feature vector were calibrated with different sets of roads within the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), while assessing the spatial transferability of the algorithm. Using calibrated cluster sets, morning peak GHG emissions in the GTA were estimated to be 2,692 tons, which is lower than the estimate generated by a traditional, average speed approach (3,254 tons). Link-level comparison between CLEVER and the average speed approach demonstrates that GHG emissions for uncongested links were overestimated by the average speed model. In contrast, at intersections and ramps with more congested links and interrupted traffic flow, the average speed model underestimated GHG emissions. This proposed approach is able to capture variations in traffic conditions compared to the traditional average speed approach, without the need to conduct traffic simulation. Implications: A reliable traffic emissions estimate is necessary to evaluate transportation policies. Currently, accuracy and transferability are major limitations in modeling regional emissions. This paper develops a hybrid modeling approach (CLEVER) to bridge between computational efficiency and estimation accuracy. Using a k-means clustering algorithm with street-level traffic data, CLEVER generates representative emission factors for each cluster. The approach was validated against the baseline (output of a microscopic emission model), demonstrating transferability across different cities. © 2019, © 2019 A&WMA.",,"Computational efficiency; K-means clustering; Machine learning; Roads and streets; Speed; Speed control; Traffic control; Emission inventories; Greater Toronto Area; Machine learning approaches; Metropolitan regions; Spatial transferability; Traffic assignment models; Traffic characteristics; Transportation policies; Greenhouse gases; accuracy; age; algorithm; Article; calibration; city; comparative study; exhaust gas; greenhouse gas; k means clustering; machine learning; parameters; priority journal; traffic; velocity; air pollutant; chemistry; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; machine learning; procedures; theoretical model; traffic and transport; Air Pollutants; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Machine Learning; Models, Theoretical; Transportation; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074185047

This paper studied a number of hazardous air pollutants in an industrial and metropolitan complex area in order to determine their ambient abundance and potential health impacts. The target pollutants in this study are benzene, formaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, arsenic, 2,3,7,8-TCDD, and diesel particulate matter (DPM). A cancer risk assessment was conducted to determine the health effects of exposure to the six HAPs by using the AERMOD model. Results indicated that the emission of benzene, formaldehyde, 1,3-butadiene, arsenic and DPM was 184.5; 227.3; 68.0; 238, and 316 ton year–1, respectively, and the emission of 2,3,7,8-TCDD was 4,994 mg-TEQ year–1 . Benzene (86%), formaldehyde (69%), and 1,3-butadiene (77%) were mainly emitted from on-road mobile sources. Arsenic (70%) and 2,3,7,8-TCDD (about 100%) were mainly emitted from stationary sources and DPM was emitted from diesel engines, port operations and ocean-going vessels. Spatial air toxic distribution indicated that the highest concentration of DMP, benzene, formaldehyde, and 1.3-butadiene occurred on the highway and in the downtown district due to their high traffic volume. DPM occupied more than 80% of total cancer risk in the region, followed by 1,3-butadiene, benzene, formaldehyde, arsenic, and 2,3,7,8-TCDD. In the industrial and residential complex area, about 99% of the cancer risk stemmed from on-road vehicles and port operations due to hazardous air pollutant emissions, especially DPM. The control scenario was made huge efforts to reduce the emission, however the results indicated only reduced the overall cancer risk assessment by 10%–15%. Policy makers have to think carefully about whether implementing the kind of emissions regulations simulated in this control scenario will need to be enhanced with additional measures to further reduce the risk of air pollution for human health. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","AERMOD model; Hazardous air pollutants (HAPs); Risk assessment","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Arsenic; Benzene; Diesel engines; Diseases; Formaldehyde; Hazardous materials; Hazards; Health risks; Industrial emissions; Risk perception; Roads and streets; Aermod models; Cancer risk assessments; Diesel particulate matters; Emissions regulations; Hazardous air pollutant emissions; Hazardous air pollutants; On-road mobile sources; Residential complexes; Risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074457449

We used laboratory experiments to quantify the thermal tolerance and acclimation potential of four fishes (Notropis leuciodus, N. rubricroceus, Etheostoma rufilineatum, E. chlorobranchium) that are endemic to the southern Appalachian Mountains (USA), exhibit different historical elevational limits, and represent the two most species-rich families in the region. All-subsets selection of linear regression models using AICc indicated that species, acclimation temperature, collection location and month, and the interaction between species and acclimation temperature were important predictors of thermal maxima (Tmax), which ranged from 28.5 to 37.2°C. Next, we implemented water temperature models and stochastic weather generation to characterize the magnitude and frequency of extreme heat events (Textreme) under historical and future climate scenarios across 25 379 stream reaches in the upper Tennessee River system. Lastly, we used environmental niche models to compare warming tolerances (acclimation-corrected Tmax minus Textreme) between historically occupied versus unoccupied reaches. Historical warming tolerances, ranging from +2.2 to +10.9°C, increased from low to high elevation and were positive for all species, suggesting that Tmax does not drive warm-edge (low elevation) range limits. Future warming tolerances were lower (−1.2 to +9.3°C) but remained positive for all species under the direst warming scenario except for a small proportion of reaches historically occupied by E. rufilineatum, indicating that Tmax and acclimation potentials of southern Appalachian minnows and darters are adequate to survive future heat waves. We caution concluding that these species are invulnerable to 21st century warming because sublethal thermal physiology remains poorly understood.

This is particularly relevant in ocean environments, where microorganisms constitute the majority of biomass and control most of the major biogeochemical cycles, including those that regulate Earth’s climate. Coastal marine environments provide goods and services that are imperative to human survival and well-being (for example, fisheries and water purification), and emerging evidence indicates that these ecosystem services often depend on complex relationships between communities of microorganisms (the ‘microbiome’) and the environment or their hosts — termed the ‘holobiont’. Understanding of coastal ecosystem function must therefore be framed under the holobiont concept, whereby macroorganisms and their associated microbiomes are considered as a synergistic ecological unit. Here, we evaluate the current state of knowledge on coastal marine microbiome research and identify key questions within this growing research area. Although the list of questions is broad and ambitious, progress in the field is increasing exponentially, and the emergence of large, international collaborative networks and well-executed manipulative experiments are rapidly advancing the field of coastal marine microbiome research. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"climate; fishery; human; microflora; Climate; Fisheries; Humans; Microbiota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074274914

The calculated data of the regional climate model for the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) RCP-8.5 plan to assess the impact of changes in physical abiotic factors on the forest ecosystems were used in the work. Two key parameters were taken into account in calculations that could be affected by expected climate change that are forest fires and plant productivity. The forecast is carried out according to three scenarios for the development of the forest complex of Russia: inertial, basic and strategic. The overall carbon balance of Russia is expected to be at the level of 187.5-251.2 MtC per year, depending on the scenarios of forest management and growth of forests productivity, these data accord the current values. Maintaining a positive carbon balance in forests will require the development of measures to improve fire control in forestry, timber technologies and reforestation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Biospherics; Carbon; Climate change; Climate models; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Productivity; Reforestation; Timber; Economic development; Forest ecosystem; Impact of changes; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Plant productivity; Regional climate modeling; Russian federation; Timber technology; Forecasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077782755

Here, we explore the future mitigation pathways for the BTH region to investigate the possibility of air quality attainment by 2030 in that region, by developing two energy scenarios (i.e., baseline energy scenario and enhanced energy scenario) and two end-of-pipe scenarios (i.e., business as usual scenario and best available technology scenario) and simulating future air quality for different scenarios using the WRF/CMAQ model. Results showed that without stringent energy and industrial structure adjustment, even the most advanced end-of-pipe technologies did not allow the BTH region to attain the 35 μg/m3 target. Under the most stringent scenario that coupled the enhanced structure adjustment measures and the best available end-of-pipe measures, the emissions of SO2, NOx, PM2.5 and NMVOCs (nonmethane volatile organic compounds) were estimated to be reduced by 85%, 74%, 82% and 72%, respectively, in 2030 over the BTH region. As a result, the simulated annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei could decline to 23, 28 and 28 μg/m3, respectively, all of which achieved the 35 μg/m3 target by 2030. Our study identified a feasible pathway to achieve the 2030 target and highlighted the importance of reshaping the energy and industrial structure of the BTH region for future air pollution mitigation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality improvement; Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei; Emission scenarios; PM2.5","Volatile organic compounds; Air quality improvement; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Best available technologies; Emission scenario; Industrial structure adjustments; Non-methane volatile organic compounds; PM2.5; Tianjin; Air quality; nitric oxide; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; air quality; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric structure; particulate matter; pollution control; volatile organic compound; World Health Organization; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality standard; Article; China; community multiscale air quality; concentration (parameter); controlled study; energy resource; energy transfer; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; feasibility study; geographic distribution; industrial waste; particulate matter; pollution transport; priority journal; total quality management; weather research and forecasting; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069648490

Lu2O3 possesses good thermo-physical properties, has relatively low phonon energies, and can be grown in good quality. Moreover, Pr3+ ions possess several low-energy levels that in principle, can give rise to mid-infrared emission. For these reasons, we investigated this material as a potential mid-infrared emitter. From absorption measurements, we identified absorption from the first five multiplets. Moreover, low temperature measurements allowed us to extract the Stark sublevel positions of all these five multiplets and we revised the classical Dieke diagram for Pr3+ in this compound. We also observed near-and mid-infrared emission bands under diode laser pumping. The pump power dependence of the corresponding emission intensities proved the main energy transfer mechanisms that populate the lower lying levels to be cross-relaxation processes and permitted us to discern among the various possibilities and assign the different emission bands to specific transitions. In particular, we observed for the first time MIR emission at 4.4 and 7 μm in this compound, that is, in the latter case, an emission energy equal to less than three phonons in this crystal host. © 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.",,"Energy transfer; Low temperature effects; Lutetium compounds; Phonons; Pumping (laser); Temperature; Temperature measurement; Absorption measurements; Cross-relaxation process; Energy transfer mechanisms; Low-temperature measurements; Mid-infrared emission; Mid-infrared emitters; Spectroscopic characterization; Thermo-physical property; Infrared devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076549104

In total, 121 species of pathogenic micromycetes affecting the leaves of woody plants in botanical gardens and city and belonging to 2 divisions, 14 orders, and 46 genera have been revealed. Most of these species belong to the Ascomycota division (86.8%). The Basidiomycota division is represented by fungi from the order Pucciniales. Among all observed pathogens, 21 species belong to powdery mildew fungi, 15 species belong to rust fungi, and 84 species represent anamorphic fungi. A study of 108 woody plant species growing in Siberian cities has revealed 101 species of leaf pathogens, while 158 woody plant species growing in arboreta have been inhabited by 105 pathogen species. All fungal species revealed during this study, except for three species (Mycopappus alni, Venturia acerina, and Phyllosticta westendorpii), have been observed in Siberia earlier. However, some fungus–host plant associations are apparently new to science, suggesting that complexes of cryptic species differing in their host range and geographic range may occur. The main sources for tree mycobiota formation in Siberia include the invasion of pathogens together with alien plant species, the transition of pathogens from native to alien plant species, the enhancement of a pathogenicity of saprotrophic fungi, and the expansion of fungi onto new hosts. The majority of pathogens (65−75% of the total number of revealed fungi) locate on native plants. Alien plants are infected mainly by (native) pathogens. Only eight pathogen species have been introduced in Siberia with alien plants; three of them originate from the Far East (Cercospora gotoana, Phyllosticta phellodendricola, and Erysiphe palczewskii), while five are of European origin (Cladosporium syringae, Phyllosticta vincae-minoris, Erysiphe syringae, Erysiphe alphitoides, and Erysiphe berberidis). In Siberia, the lateness of phenological phases of plants originating from mild climatic zones, may be favorable for the development of fungal pathogens, such as Erysiphe alphitoides, causing the powdery mildew of oak trees. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","alien species; arboreta; cities; foliar pathogens; fungi; native species; Siberia; woody plants","deciduous tree; fungus; home range; host range; introduced species; native species; pathogenicity; phenology; urban ecosystem; woody plant; Far East; Siberia; Ascomycota; Basidiomycota; Cercospora; Cladosporium; Erysiphales; Erysiphe; Erysiphe alphitoides; Erysiphe syringae; Fungi; Fungi imperfecti; Gymnocephalus; Mycota; Phyllosticta; Uredinales; Venturia (fungus)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076487326

Vulnerability assessments address this need and are common across a range of disciplines and geographies; however, the practice of vulnerability assessment has revealed challenges that warrant further examination in a specific context. The U.S. Forest Service, a national forest-management agency in charge of 78 million hectares, has developed a collection of climate change vulnerability assessments to support adaptation by forest managers. We conducted a qualitative document analysis, informed by a series of research interviews with scientists, of 44 vulnerability assessments developed for the U.S. Forest Service. We found that partnerships between research scientists and land managers were central to the development of vulnerability assessments in the U.S. Forest Service. Assessment processes vary across settings. As the practice has developed, vulnerability assessments increasingly cover larger spatial extents and a broader range of resources associated with forest management. We identified ways in which vulnerability assessments can support decision-making, including approaches already in use and opportunities to improve practice. In particular, we discuss how vulnerability assessments are well-positioned to support the development of land-management plans, which set strategic management direction for periods of at least a decade. This paper provides baseline knowledge on a fundamental aspect of a large national forestry agency's climate change adaptation strategy, with many findings transferable to the study of other forest-management organizations. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change adaptation; Science-management partnerships; U.S. Forest Service; Vulnerability assessment","Climate change; Decision making; Managers; Assessment process; Climate change adaptation; Document analysis; Science managements; Scientific information; Strategic management; U.S. Forest Service; Vulnerability assessments; Forestry; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; forest management; vulnerability; Decision Making; Development; Forest Management; Forestry; Land; Research; Scientists; Vulnerability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075447891

For this purpose, we attempt to examine the relationship urbanization and CO2 emissions by applying the panel smooth transition regression model for 47 African countries during the spanning time 1990–2014. Our results reveal that the nexus between urbanization and CO2 emissions is non-linear. Our highlights recorded a monotonic nexus confirming the existence of the EKC hypothesis for the urbanization. In addition, our empirical results determine the threshold of the transition which takes the value of 42.01. Moreover, the estimated slope parameter implies that the nexus between urbanization and CO2 emissions smoothly switches from one regime to another regime but relatively rapid. Hence, it is extremely important to understand this nexus to take seriously climate change vulnerabilities. Indeed, the African economies are invited to establish efficiently the low-carbon and reduce the spatial heterogeneity to generate the green development path and provide effective structures for a platform for sustainable cities. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Africa; CO2 emissions; PSTR model; Urbanization","assessment method; carbon emission; climate change; heterogeneity; hypothesis testing; Kuznets curve; urbanization; Africa; carbon dioxide; resin cement; tight junction; Africa; chemistry; climate change; economic development; urbanization; Africa; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Economic Development; Resin Cements; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074499531

In this paper, EOMs were extracted from chlorella vulgaris (CV-EOMs), scenedesmus meyen (SM-EOMs) and microcystis aeruginosa (MA-EOMs) to explore their photosensitive efficiencies and mechanisms. All of the EOMs showed higher photosensitive efficiencies than natural organic matter (NOM). The quenching assays and competitive kinetics experiments confirmed the dominant role of 3EOMs* in accelerating CTC photodegradation. The quantum yield coefficients of 3EOMs* (fTMP) of CV-EOMs, SM-EOMs, MA-EOMs, NOM were 139.89 ± 5.46, 125.35 ± 4.69, 91.76 ± 3.53, and 72.84 ± 4.45 L/(mol-photon), respectively. Specific chemical constituents and structure of EOMs were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-CIR-MS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The results showed the positive linear correlation of fTMP with content of carbonyl groups in EOMs. In addition, reduction of carbonyl groups in EOMs by NaBH4 significantly decreased CTC photodegradation rate. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation suggested the susceptible excitation of carbonyl groups in EOMs under solar light was ascribed to the lowest required energy of electronic transition from HOMO to LUMO (assigned as n-π* transition). The energy of triplet excited-states benzophenone, p-methoxy acetophenone and acetophenone (the EOMs model compounds) was calculated to be 284.92, 288.85 and 265.50 kJ/mol, which were higher than that of CTC (i.e., 217.46 kJ/mol), indicating the energy transfer from excited triplet state to excited triplet state CTC was possible.

The areas they occupy are normally small, and survey platforms and sensors allowing high-resolution spatial characterization are necessary. We have developed a cold seep habitat mapping strategy that involves both ship and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) as platforms for multibeam echosounder, synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) and a digital photo system. Water column data from the shipborne multibeam echosounder data are initially used to detect gas flares resulting from fluid flow from the seabed. The next phase involves mapping of flare areas by SAS, mounted on an AUV. This yields an acoustic image with a resolution up to 2 cm over a swath of c. 350 m, allowing detection of seep-related features on the seabed. The last phase involves digital photographing of the seabed, with the AUV moving close to the seabed, allowing recognition of bubble streams, seep-related features and giving a first order documentation of the fauna. The strategy was applied to a 3775 km2 large area on the continental shelf, northern Norway. This is a passive continental margin, with thick deposits of oil- and gas-bearing sedimentary rocks. Extensive faulting and tilting of layers provide potential conduits for fluid flow. The seabed is glacially influenced with a highly variable backscatter reflectivity. More than 200 gas flares have been identified, and a similar number of cold seep habitats have been characterized in high spatial detail. Two case studies are shown. In the first area, there is a close spatial relation between active gas seepage and carbonate crust fields. The second case study shows that carbonate crust fields are not necessarily spatially associated with currently active seeps, but represent dormant or formerly active gas expulsion. An important finding is that the bathymetric resolution of shipborne multibeam echosounders will often be too low to detect cold seep habitats. This means that a nested multi-resolution approach involving a multitude of platforms and sensors is required to provide the full picture. © Copyright © 2019 Thorsnes, Chand, Brunstad, Lepland and Lågstad.","authigenic carbonate crusts; autonomous underwater vehicle; cold seep habitat; gas flares; high-resolution; synthetic aperture sonar; water column backscatter data",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076882137

At least twelve distinct clades, or ecotypes, of Prochlorococcus have been discovered so far, and follow distinct distribution patterns over horizontal and vertical gradients in the oligotrophic ocean. However, multiple ecotypes (and sub-ecotypes) of Prochlorococcus always coexist in varying proportions. While laboratory experiments and genomic analysis suggest that ecotypes contribute differently to biogeochemical cycles, no studies have tested the differential activity of coexisting ecotypes in natural assemblages of Prochlorococcus. Here, we performed DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) experiments in on-deck incubations of oceanic microbial communities with 13C-labeled bicarbonate to identify ecotypes actively assimilating carbon. In addition, we identified cells in G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle to determine the ecotypes engaged in cell division. We found that closely related ecotypes and sub-ecotypes could exhibit differential activity in carbon assimilation and cell division. In the case of cell division, the most actively dividing ecotype was among the most abundant ecotypes. In the case of carbon assimilation, both a rare OTU and an abundant OTU were the most active. We discuss how intrinsic genomic characteristics, acclimation state, microbial interactions, and physical dynamics of the ocean could contribute to these patterns of activity. Together, these experiments suggest that Prochlorococcus community structure is an important facet of Prochlorococcus contributions to the ocean ecosystem that should be studied further to predict the influence of Prochlorococcus on global processes. © Copyright © 2019 Thompson and Kouba.","carbon assimilation; cell cycle; ecotype; Prochlorococcus; stable isotope probing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076687241

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of Er:YAG laser irradiation on superficial roughness of deciduous dental enamel and bacterial adhesion. Fifty-four samples of deciduous enamel were divided into three groups (n = 18 each). G1_control (nonirradiated); G2_100 (7.5 J/cm2) and G3_100 (12.7 J/cm2) were irradiated with Er:YAG laser at 7.5 and 12.7 J/cm2, respectively, under water irrigation. Surface roughness was measured before and after irradiation using a profilometer. Afterwards, six samples per group were used to measure bacterial growth by XTT cell viability assay. Adhered bacteria were observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Paired t-, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Kruskal-Wallis and pairwise Mann–Whitney U tests were performed to analyze statistical differences (p &lt;.05). Before treatment, samples showed homogenous surface roughness, and after Er:YAG laser irradiation, the surfaces showed a significant increase in roughness values (p &lt;.05). G3_100 (12.7 J/cm2) showed the highest amount of Streptococcus mutans adhered (p &lt;.05). The increase in the roughness of the tooth enamel surfaces was proportional to the energy density used; the increase in surface roughness caused by laser irradiation did not augment the adhesion of Streptococcus sanguinis; only the use of the energy density of 12.7 J/cm2 favored significantly the adhesion of S. mutans. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","bacterial adhesion; enamel; erbium laser; preventive dentistry; roughness; streptococci","bacterium adherence; dental caries; drug therapy; enamel; growth, development and aging; human; physiology; radiation response; scanning electron microscopy; solid state laser; Streptococcus; Streptococcus mutans; Streptococcus sanguinis; surface property; Bacterial Adhesion; Dental Caries; Dental Enamel; Humans; Lasers, Solid-State; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Streptococcus; Streptococcus mutans; Streptococcus sanguis; Surface Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070066049

Prefabrication is regarded as a cleaner production and sustainable construction approach, which has been utilized for public residential building construction in Hong Kong to achieve more productive, safer and higher-quality construction process with less negative impacts on the environment. Previous studies explored the life cycle carbon assessment of prefabricated buildings, but no unified embodied carbon assessment model or reporting format has been established in Hong Kong. This paper aims to contribute a better systematic understanding of the embodied carbon of prefabricated high-rise public residential buildings at different levels of unit of analysis and to identify appropriate measures for effective embodied carbon reduction. The research was carried out through a case study using a typical 30-storey public residential building in Hong Kong. The embodied carbon was calculated and reported at five levels of unit of analysis, i.e. material, component, assembly, flat and building. The cradle-to-end of construction embodied carbon of the case building was found to be 561 kg CO2/m2. Off-site activities accounted for 27.3% of the total embodied carbon, most of which were contributed by the production of façades (6.9%), bathrooms (6%), kitchens (4.5%) and slabs (4.2%). Embodied carbon from the manufacturing of materials was mainly attributed to concrete (59.2%) and steel (20.1%). The results reveal that the embodied carbon could be reduced significantly by adopting low carbon concrete such as replacing the ordinary Portland cement with blast furnace slag cement (with 22.8% reduction potential) and utilizing cement substitutes (25% pulverized fly ash (PFA)) (with 9.8% reduction potential). However, other measures were revealed to only impose marginal effect, such as decreasing the thickness of walls (with 1.9% reduction potential) and optimizing prefabrication rate (with 1.5% reduction potential), which was believed to be hindered by the high transportation carbon to and in Hong Kong. The developed five-level analytical framework paves the foundation for future standardization and benchmarking of prefabricated buildings’ embodied carbon and the findings provide strategies for the most effective carbon reduction of prefabricated buildings in cities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon reduction; Embodied carbon; High-rise building; Life cycle assessment; Prefabrication","Blast furnaces; Concretes; Fly ash; Housing; Life cycle; Pollution control; Portland cement; Prefabricated construction; Slag cement; Slags; Sustainable development; Tall buildings; Carbon reduction; Embodied carbons; High rise building; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Prefabrication; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073053455

A long-term trial in California's Mediterranean climate revealed impacts of management on SOC in maize-tomato and wheat–fallow cropping systems. SOC was measured at the initiation of the experiment and at year 19, at five depth increments down to 2 m, taking into account changes in bulk density. Across the entire 2 m profile, SOC in the wheat–fallow systems did not change with the addition of N fertilizer, winter cover crops (WCC), or irrigation alone and decreased by 5.6% with no inputs. There was some evidence of soil C gains at depth with both N fertilizer and irrigation, though high variation precluded detection of significant changes. In maize‒tomato rotations, SOC increased by 12.6% (21.8 Mg C/ha) with both WCC and composted poultry manure inputs, across the 2 m profile. The addition of WCC to a conventionally managed system increased SOC stocks by 3.5% (1.44 Mg C/ha) in the 0–30 cm layer, but decreased by 10.8% (14.86 Mg C/ha) in the 30–200 cm layer, resulting in overall losses of 13.4 Mg C/ha. If we only measured soil C in the top 30 cm, we would have assumed an increase in total soil C increased with WCC alone, whereas in reality significant losses in SOC occurred when considering the 2 m soil profile. Ignoring the subsoil carbon dynamics in deeper layers of soil fails to recognize potential opportunities for soil C sequestration, and may lead to false conclusions about the impact of management practices on C sequestration. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbon sequestration; compost; cover crops; irrigation; Mediterranean; organic amendments","carbon sequestration; compost; cover crop; inventory; irrigation; Mediterranean environment; organic soil; soil amendment; soil carbon; soil profile; topsoil; California; United States; Lycopersicon esculentum; Zea mays; carbon; nitrogen; agriculture; California; carbon sequestration; composting; soil; Agriculture; California; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Composting; Nitrogen; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070289747

Therefore, the effective utilization of renewable resources towards a cost-optimal achievement of the “Energy Transition” goals is becoming more complex. We argue that addressing these complexities requires a method, which, in addition to a fine technological and regional characterization, takes into account the heterogeneity of the investment decisions of actors while optimizing the total system. This paper describes methodological improvements via the well-known energy system optimization model generator called The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM System (i.e. TIMES), which enhances the representation of the actors' investment realities regarding wind and photovoltaic technologies applied to the case of the German supply sector. Firstly, the actors are disaggregated by their main economic features, including cost of capital, representing their different investment valuations and budget restrictions. Then, Germany is divided into four regions to reflect the spatially variable renewable resources and electricity demand affecting actors’ optimal decisions. Lastly, the grid development costs and losses are considered, especially for power transmission across the regions. The newly developed TIMES Actors Model (TAM) incorporating these improvements is then tested to separately study the impact of CO2 taxes as a policy instrument and a national renewable quota as a target for the sector. The results showed that CO2 taxes and renewable targets affect the system quite differently, specifically regarding the optimal role that actors are expected to play within regions to meet the objectives of energy transitions at least system costs as well as regarding the power transmission between the regions. By means of these findings, actors can be targeted more properly by actor- and region-specific policy instruments demonstrating which actor should invest where and into which technology, so that the energy transition can take place more quickly and at lower system costs. A comparison of the improved versus original versions of the model reveals the potential contribution of improving the representation of actors that have been so far overlooked in the energy system modelling practice. © 2019 The Authors","Actor heterogeneity; Energy system optimization; Investment decisions; Supply sector; TIMES model generator","Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Power transmission; Renewable energy resources; Actor heterogeneity; Energy system optimizations; Investment decisions; Supply sector; TIMES modeling; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073614154

Using the data of YRD cities from 2011–2017, the spatial durbin model (SDM) is presented to investigate how compactness (in terms of urban density, jobs-housing balance, and urban centralization) and poly-centricity (in terms of the number of centers and polycentric cluster) affect PM10 emissions. After controlling some variables, the results suggest that more jobs-housing-balanced and centralized compactness tends to decrease emissions, while poly-centricity by developing too many centers is expected to result in more pollutant emissions. The effect of high-density compactness is more controversial. In addition, for cities with more private car ownerships (&gt;10 million within cities), enhancing the polycentric cluster by achieving a more balanced population distribution between the traditional centers and sub-centers could reduce emissions, whereas this mitigated emissions effect may be limited. The difference between our study and western studies suggests that the correlation between high-density compactness and air pollution vary with the specific characteristics and with spatial planning implications, as this paper concludes. © 2019 by the authors.

Therefore, it is important to address how local government responds to catalyse sustainable development under an environmental decentralisation regime. Prior studies focusing on environmental decentralisation come mainly from developed countries, whereas our paper examines how local governments in China involved in a low-carbon pilot programme react to stringent environmental regulations (ERs) from central government, reflected by changes in land transfer of pollution-intensive industries (PIIs). Our results show that a low-carbon pilot programme reduces land transfer of PIIs by 34.45 ha, due mainly to a decrease in the number of small PII projects. Meanwhile, our research furthers the understanding of environmental decentralisation literature by showing that public awareness, fiscal imbalance, and market-oriented reform can improve local enforcement. Besides, our study contributes to understanding the mixed effect of ERs on firm location, which is likely to be driven by the socio-economic conditions of jurisdictions. Our study also provides practical implications for catalysing sustainable development in those countries with traits of environmental decentralisation and disparate development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental regulations; Local government; Low-carbon pilot programme; Pollution-intensive industries","Carbon; Environmental regulations; Location; Planning; Pollution; Central government; Decentralisation; Developed countries; Local government; Low carbon; Market oriented reforms; Public awareness; Socio-economic conditions; Sustainable development; carbon; decentralization; environmental policy; law enforcement; learning; local government; regulatory framework; sustainable development; Article; China; controlled study; decentralization; environmental change; environmental management; environmental protection; fiscal policy; geography; government; land use; law; mathematical model; priority journal; program development; social status; sustainable development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068361668

In order to refine predictions of likely future changes in benthic communities resulting from these impacts, we must first better constrain their responses to natural seasonality in environmental conditions. Epibenthic time series data (July 2008-May 2014) have been collected from Station L4, situated 7.25 nautical miles south of Plymouth in the Western English Channel. These data were analysed to establish patterns in community abundance, wet biomass and composition, and to link any observed patterns to environmental variables. A clear response to the input of organic material from phytoplankton blooms was detected, with sediment surface living deposit feeders showing an immediate increase in abundance, while predators and scavengers responded later, with an increase in biomass. We suggest that this response is a result of two factors. The low organic content of the L4 sediment results in food limitation of the community, and the mild winter/early spring bottom water temperatures allow the benthos to take immediate advantage of bloom sedimentation. An inter-annual change in community composition was also detected, as the community shifted from one dominated by the anomuran Anapagurus laevis to one dominated by the gastropod Turitella communis. This appeared to be related to a period of high larval recruitment for T. communis in 2013/2014, suggesting that changes in the recruitment success of one species can affect the structure of an entire community. © Copyright Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom 2019.","Benthic community; benthic epifauna; bottom-water temperature; natural variability; phytodetrital input; supply side ecology; time series; Western English Channel","algal bloom; benthos; biomass; bottom water; community composition; environmental factor; eutrophication; food limitation; gastropod; phytoplankton; recruitment (population dynamics); seasonality; time series analysis; water temperature; England; English Channel; Plymouth [England]; United Kingdom; Anapagurus; Gastropoda; Turitella",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070662823

Covalent doping of SWCNTs has recently been discovered as an efficient approach in enhancing their emission intensities. We perform pump-probe studies of SWCNTs that are covalently doped with sp3 quantum defects and reveal strikingly different exciton formation dynamics and decay mechanisms in the presence of the defect sites. We show that, in highly doped SWCNTs, ultrafast trapping of excitons at the defect sites can outpace other photodynamic processes and lead to ground-state photobleaching of the quantum defects. Our fitting of the transient data with a kinetic model also reveals an upper limit in the quantum defect density for obtaining highly luminescent SWCNTs without causing irreversible damage. These findings not only deepen our understanding of the photodynamics in covalently doped SWCNTs but also reveal critical information for the design of bright near-infrared emitters that can be utilized in biological, quantum information, and nanophotonic applications. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","exciton trapping; ground-state photobleaching; pump-probe spectroscopy; quantum defects; single-walled carbon nanotubes; stimulated emission","Defects; Excitons; Ground state; Infrared devices; Nanotubes; Particle beams; Photobleaching; Probes; Quantum optics; Stimulated emission; Exciton trapping; Near infrared emitters; Optical and electrical properties; Photodynamic process; Pump-probe spectroscopy; Quantum defects; Single-photon source; Single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNTs); Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN); carbon nanotube; chemistry; kinetics; luminescence; quantum theory; semiconductor; Kinetics; Luminescence; Nanotubes, Carbon; Quantum Theory; Semiconductors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074766510

Traditional debates tend toward global solutions, blaming either dramatic climate change or dispersals of Homo sapiens to new regions. Inherent limitations to archaeological and paleontological data sets often require reliance on scant, poorly resolved lines of evidence. However, recent developments in scientific technologies allow for more local, context-specific approaches. In the present article, we highlight how developments in five such methodologies (radiocarbon approaches, stable isotope analysis, ancient DNA, ancient proteomics, microscopy) have helped drive detailed analysis of specific megafaunal species, their particular ecological settings, and responses to new competitors or predators, climate change, and other external phenomena. The detailed case studies of faunal community composition, extinction chronologies, and demographic trends enabled by these methods examine megafaunal extinctions at scales appropriate for practical understanding of threats against particular species in their habitats today. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

In an online choice experiment, using a real donation mechanism, a sample of 95 members of the Danish public are provided 27 € and asked to make 16 donation choices among different climate policy options. The climate policies are described in terms of two main outcome variables: future effects on income in 2100 and present-time provision of co-benefits from climate policy. Both outcomes are described for three specific regions of the world, Western Europe, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. For each participant, one policy choice is drawn at random to be realized. The total amount donated by participants is used to purchase and withdraw CO2 quotas and credits in the European Emission Trading Scheme and as donations to the UN Adaptation Fund. The results indicate that distributional outcomes matter for people when they donate to climate policy and that elements of both inequity aversion and general altruism influence the choice of climate policy. The findings contribute towards an empirical foundation for the use of equity weights in determining the social cost of carbon, with the implication that the price on greenhouse gas emissions should be higher due to the concern for distributional impacts. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Greenhouse gases; Choice experiments; Emission trading scheme; Empirical foundations; Policy choices; Social cost of carbon; Social preference; Sub-saharan africa; Western Europe; Gas emissions; adaptive management; emissions trading; environmental policy; experimental study; greenhouse gas; preference behavior; social behavior; United Nations; Southeast Asia; Sub-Saharan Africa; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073950165

Non-perturbing optical diagnostic techniques are capable of measuring temperatures in such environments but are often technically complex and validation is challenging, with correspondingly large uncertainties, often as large as 2 % to 5 % of temperature. This work aims to reduce these uncertainties by developing a portable flame temperature standard, calibrated via the Rayleigh scattering thermometry technique, traceable to ITS-90, with an uncertainty of 0.5 % of temperature (k = 1). By suitable burner selection and accurate gas flow control, a stable, square, flat flame with uniform post-flame species and temperature is realised. Following development, the standard flame is used to validate two IR emission spectroscopy systems, both measuring the line-integrated emission spectra in the post-flame region. The first utilises a Hyperspectral imaging FTIR spectrometer capable of measuring 2D species and temperature maps and the second, a high-precision single line-of-sight FTIR spectrometer. In the central post-flame region, the agreement between the Rayleigh and FTIR temperatures is within the combined measurement uncertainties and amounts to 1 % (k = 1) of temperature. © 2019, The Author(s).","Combustion; Emission spectroscopy; ITS-90; Rayleigh scattering; Standard; Temperature","Emission spectroscopy; Flow of gases; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Gas emissions; Hyperspectral imaging; Optical data processing; Rayleigh scattering; Spectrometers; Standards; Temperature; Temperature measurement; Uncertainty analysis; Combined measurements; Combustion efficiencies; Gas temperature measurements; Gas turbine combustor; International Temperature Scale of 1990; ITS-90; Measuring temperature; Optical diagnostic techniques; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074757184

A favourable countermeasure to this predicament is the fabrication of a vehicle that takes advantage of the earth’s most abundant resource “Air” as an energy source. The compressed air vehicle is an eco-friendly vehicle which works on air. This research work aims at designing a cheaper, more efficient and aesthetically appealing automobile while efficiently running on this renewable energy. The car model has been designed using the software solid works and tested on ANSYS workbench followed by rigorous trials to ensure its optimal performance and safety. The designed car can reach speeds ranging from 10-20 km/h while being eco-friendly and sustainable at the same time.

In large parts of the Arctic, reindeer (or caribou) are the only large herbivores present. Recent studies show that reindeer have the potential to mitigate recent warming-induced shrub encroachment in the Arctic and the associated greening of high-latitude ecosystems. This will potentially have large scale consequences for ecosystem productivity and carbon cycling. To date, information on variation in the interactions between reindeer and plants across Arctic landscapes has been scarce. We utilized a network of experimental sites across a latitudinal gradient in the Scandinavian mountains where reindeer have been excluded from 59 study plots for at least 15 years. We used this study system to test the effect of long-term exclusion of reindeer on the abundance of major plant functional groups, the greenness indexes Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), soil mineral nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P), and species richness, and to determine whether the effect of reindeer exclusion is dependent on reindeer density, productivity, soil fertility or climate. We found that NDVI and LAI, lichen and deciduous shrub abundances were largely reduced while soil mineral N was enhanced by reindeer. The direction and amplitude of other plant functional group responses to reindeer exclusion differed between forest and tundra as well as shrub- and herbaceous-dominated vegetation. Higher reindeer densities were related to decreased plant species richness in low-productive sites and to increased species richness in productive sites. The relative reduction in LAI and associated absolute reductions of deciduous shrubs in response to reindeer were positively related to reindeer density, while the relative reduction in NDVI was not. Further, relative reductions in LAI and NDVI in response to reindeer were unrelated to climate and soil fertility. Synthesis. Our results provide long-term experimental evidence highlighting the role of reindeer density in regulating plant species richness, global climate change induced greenness patterns and shrub encroachment at regional scales in the Arctic. These findings emphasize the need to consider reindeer in models predicting vegetation patterns and changes in high-latitude ecosystems. © 2019 The Authors.

By changing shoot-emitted volatiles, below-ground herbivores may use the plant to extend their capacity to interact with above-ground con- and heterospecifics. We investigated the attractiveness of Triadica sebifera plants infested by larvae of a specialist beetle or root-knot nematodes to above-ground herbivores. We then determined the contribution of leaf volatiles to the observed recruitment patterns using olfactometer experiments. We also identified volatiles through gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and electroantennography, and conducted field experiments to confirm their effects. Leaf volatiles induced by the root-feeding larvae attracted above-ground conspecific adults in laboratory and field experiments, but repelled a heterospecific specialist weevil, whereas induction by root-knot nematodes had no effects on either. Greater leaf consumption by conspecific adults increased root nutrients, decreased root defences and facilitated root feeding larval performance. Thus, larvae and adults appear to manipulate their host plant, which increases aggregation above-ground and feeding below-ground. Synthesis. The resulting colonization dynamics may shape the composition of plant rhizosphere and phyllosphere herbivore communities by enhancing conspecific establishment and reducing colonization by other herbivores. By modifying above-ground volatiles and above-ground herbivore behaviour, root feeders could mediate plant and leaf herbivore interactions and benefit via plant responses to above-ground feeding. © 2019 The Authors.

However, limited studies have been completed to evaluate the productivity and environmental consequences following the introduction of maize to paddies in this area. Four cropping systems were practiced in our experimental field plots: traditional double rice (R-R), maize-rice rotation (M–R), rice-maize rotation (R-M) and double maize cropping (M-M). The two-year study showed that conversion to maize-related cropping patterns led to a substantial change in GHG emissions, carbon footprint and net soil carbon budget (NSCB) on a short-term timescale. Although the M-M treatment resulted in a 13.5% higher annual grain yield than the R-R treatment, it showed a tremendous increase in total CO2 eq emissions of 47.7% and higher soil carbon loss, thus, it had a higher carbon footprint than the R-R treatment by 30.7% (p &lt; 0.05). The annual sequence of rice and maize rotation showed different features in system functions as well. The R-M rotation could not be an option to replace R-R cropping because of its higher carbon footprint and soil carbon loss. However, compared to the R-R treatment, the M–R rotation increased the annual grain yield by 18.3% (p &lt; 0.05) and, showed comparable total CO2 eq emissions and a lower carbon footprint (1.67 kg CO2 eq. kg−1). Nevertheless, the M–R treatment still displayed a high soil carbon loss (-2127 kg C ha−1 by NSCB analysis) after two crop seasons of cultivation, while the R-R cropping maintained the soil carbon gain.

To fill this gap, we investigated monthly PM2.5 concentrations in all of China’s outdoor tourist attractions. Our results indicated that summer is the healthiest time to travel in the Northeast, South, Southwest, and Northwest of China. Without air pollution management, our results also indicated that more than one third of the outdoor attractions would become unhealthy throughout the year.

This results in limitations to the accurate quantification of forest cooling/warming on local air temperature. Taking into consideration the forest air space, this study proposes a three-layered (canopy, forest air space and soil [CAS]) land surface energy balance model to simulate air temperature within forest spaces (Taf) and subsequently to evaluate its biophysical effects on forest cooling/warming, i.e., the air temperature gradient (∆Ta) between the Taf and air temperature of open spaces (Tao) (∆Ta = Taf − Tao). We test the model using field data for 23 sites across 10 cities worldwide; the model shows satisfactory performance with the test data. High-latitude forests show greater seasonal dynamics of ∆Ta, generating considerable cooling of local air temperatures in warm seasons but minimal cooling or even warming effects during cool seasons, while low-latitude tropical forests always exert cooling effects with less interannual variability. The interannual dynamics of ∆Ta are significantly related to the seasonality of solar geometry and canopy leaf phenology. The differences between forest canopy temperature (Tc) and Tao, which are the two most important terms attributed by the CAS model in impacting Taf, explain a large part of forest cooling and warming (May–July: R2 = 0.35; November–January: R2 = 0.51). The novel CAS model provides a feasible way to represent the energy balance within forest ecosystems and to assess its impacts on local air temperatures globally. © 2019 The Authors","Climate warming mitigation; Forest biophysical effects; Forest cooling/warming; Land-atmosphere model; Local environmental health; Radiative transfer equation","Atmospheric temperature; Biophysics; Climate models; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Energy balance; Interfacial energy; Land surface temperature; Sandwich structures; Surface measurement; Atmosphere modeling; Climate warming; Environmental health; Forest biophysical effects; Forest cooling/warming; Radiative transfer equations; Forestry; air temperature; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; boundary layer; climate effect; cooling; energy balance; forest cover; forest ecosystem; quantitative analysis; radiative transfer; surface energy; warming; air temperature; article; atmosphere; canopy; city; climate warming; cooling; energy balance; environmental health; geometry; latitude; phenology; plant leaf; quantitative analysis; seasonal variation; soil; tropical rain forest; climate change; ecosystem; forest; season; temperature; theoretical model; tree; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Forests; Models, Theoretical; Plant Leaves; Seasons; Soil; Temperature; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071274705

With flexibility, however, comes the potential for the clustering of greenhouse gas emissions. To understand whether emissions trading leads to localized clustering of emissions changes, we perform a systematic, spatio-economic assessment of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). We analyze the spatial pattern of emissions changes from individual plants across the EU as well as how the pattern changes during the first two phases of the ETS implementation. Our findings indicate that there was clustering of emissions changes at the EU and country level which peaked at the start of the second phase but declined as the EU ETS matured. We also found that iron and steel, coke ovens, and refining have greater clustering and volatility compared to other industries. Based on the air quality implications of these clustered emissions, certain countries and industry types might need additional attention during the ETS design or redesign process. This study makes a novel contribution by systematically evaluating the spatio-temporal and equity implications of emissions distribution in cap-and-trade systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cap-and-Trade; Climate change; Environmental policy; Greenhouse gas emissions","coke; iron; steel; air quality; climate change; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental policy; European Union; greenhouse gas; spatiotemporal analysis; trade-environment relations; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; European Union; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollution; greenhouse gas; industry; spatiotemporal analysis; Air Pollution; European Union; Greenhouse Gases; Industry; Spatio-Temporal Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071657782

The building and the floodlights of the surrounding soccer fields use electricity mainly in the evening. That is why the installation of a photovoltaic (PV) system in combination with a battery storage system is evaluated in the pre-project phase. The environmental footprint of the PV system with multi-crystalline silicon modules and of current, future, and second-life lithium-ion batteries is quantified within the life cycle assessment of the building. The self-consumption share of PV electricity increases from 31% to 62% if a 60 kWp PV system is complemented by a 100 kWh battery storage. The complementary grid electricity mix strongly influences the environmental impacts of electricity consumed by the cloakroom and club building. The installation of a PV system and a battery storage leads to a 10% to 17% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with the full coverage of the electricity demand by the average Swiss supply mix. The addition of a current battery system does not yield any further reduction compared with the “PV only” option.

Increasing levels of confidence in how instantaneous vehicle energy states are captured is needed to take full advantage of the fuel consumption and emissions reduction potential of the vehicle to move towards more sustainable transportation systems. While many strategies for model validation exist, the majority rely on ascertaining comparisons with global system characteristics, for instance, total fuel consumption over a fixed driving event. However, these methods do not necessarily account for the rapidly fluctuating energy states which need to be understood to optimise the vehicle’s energy management strategy. The current work proposes a new validation approach which captures these instantaneous characteristics taking advantage of the high signal sampling rates available from modern data acquisition equipment rather than relying on drive cycle average or cumulative global behaviours. The method proposed provides a holistic view of the behaviours demonstrated by the vehicle model and identifies regions of poor system validation targeting areas for further model refinement. The algorithm is demonstrated on a new post-transmission, parallel mild-hybrid-electric bus. The model was developed in the MATLAB Simulink modelling environment. The validation algorithm is tested against vehicle dynamometer and test track data. With an increasing volume of mild and full hybrid vehicle configurations emerging, validation strategies such as the one proposed here are increasingly important for the design of energy management strategies to deliver the full potential benefits of the vehicle. The algorithm is proposed in a step by step method which can be automated to limit required user input. © IMechE 2019.","bus; hybrid; modelling; powertrain; Simulation; validation","Buses; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Emission control; Energy management; MATLAB; Models; Powertrains; Signal sampling; Data acquisition equipment; Energy management strategies; hybrid; Hybrid electric vehicle systems; Simulation; Sustainable transportation systems; validation; Validation strategies; Hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061031333

Forest fires are becoming more frequent and severe, yet gaps exist in the modeling of fire on vegetation and carbon dynamics. Strategies for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from wildfires include increasing tree harvest, largely based on the public assumption that fires burn live forests to the ground, despite observations indicating that less than 5% of mature tree biomass is actually consumed. This misconception is also reflected though excessive combustion of live trees in models. Here, we show that regional emissions estimates using widely implemented combustion coefficients are 59%–83% higher than emissions based on field observations. Using unique field datasets from before and after wildfires and an improved ecosystem model, we provide strong evidence that these large overestimates can be reduced by using realistic biomass combustion factors and by accurately quantifying biomass in standing dead trees that decompose over decades to centuries after fire (“snags”). Most model development focuses on area burned; our results reveal that accurately representing combustion is also essential for quantifying fire impacts on ecosystems. Using our improvements, we find that western US forest fires have emitted 851 ± 228 Tg CO2 (~half of alternative estimates) over the last 17 years, which is minor compared to 16,200 Tg CO2 from fossil fuels across the region. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbon; climate change mitigation; fire; forests; GHG emissions; modeling","carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; greenhouse gas; snag; wildfire; United States; ecosystem; fire; forest; tree; wildfire; Ecosystem; Fires; Forests; Trees; Wildfires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068763334

Across many regions a typical dairy intensification pathway is for dairy farms to specialize on milk production and reduce the co-production of beef (i.e. ‘dairy-beef’). Dairy-beef thus reduces and beef needs to be produced elsewhere if beef production is to be maintained. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies quantifying the environmental implications of dairy and beef production have largely focused on the farm level and not captured system connections. Further LCA work has generally represented the ‘average’ farm of a region, consequently ignoring the range in farm management observed in practice and few studies consider a range of LCA environmental footprints other than carbon footprints. For the first time, we present comprehensive LCA results for multiple environmental burdens based on a large panel dataset for commercial dairy and suckler-beef farms. We present a 15-year LCA assessment of a total of 738 dairy (3624 data points in 15 years) and 1887 suckler-beef (10,340 data points in 15 years) UK farms for five major LCA footprints. We also explore the footprint implications of compensating for reduced dairy-beef through producing this ‘displaced’ beef on suckler-beef farms. We found a substantial variation in farm footprints not captured in ‘average farm’ studies. Dairy-beef was much more efficient than beef produced on suckler-beef farms in terms of footprints per unit of beef output. Reducing dairy-beef and replacing it on a suckler-beef farm generally significantly increased environmental burdens. A reduction in carbon footprint was also associated with a reduction in other burdens suggesting no trade-off between local and global emissions. Increasing dairy farm diversification via higher dairy-beef output per unit of milk reduced burdens by up to 11–56%, on average, depending on burden and sensitivity run. We conclude that overspecialization of dairy farms in milk production increases the combined burdens from beef and milk, and that more intensive beef systems that make more efficient use of forage land play a crucial role in mitigating these burdens. © 2019 The Authors","Beef farm intensification; Commercial farm panel data; Dairy farm diversification; Environmental footprint; Life Cycle Assessment; Livestock production","Beef; Carbon footprint; Dairies; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Farms; Large dataset; Dairy farms; Environmental footprints; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Livestock production; Panel data; Life cycle; agricultural intensification; dairy farming; life cycle analysis; livestock farming; panel data; specialization; agricultural land; article; carbon footprint; forage; life cycle assessment; livestock; milk production; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; specialization; agriculture; animal; bovine; dairying; milk; pollution; red meat; United Kingdom; Agriculture; Animals; Carbon Footprint; Cattle; Dairying; Environmental Pollution; Milk; Red Meat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070937181

The main objective of the work in this paper was to determine and compare the energy and environmental impacts of placing housing in theWatershed according to profitability and environmental sustainability criteria, respectively, in the context of increasing urbanization. Future population and employment for the Watershed have been projected by the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission. Housing requirements for the projected populations in each municipality were computed, and their location was influenced by the local zoning ordinances. Suitability analysis using ArcGIS 10.6 generated areas for development based alternatively on profitability and local sustainability. CommunityViz 5.2 Scenario 360 software was used to place buildings within the appropriately-zoned areas. Using Argonne National Laboratory's Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET1 2018) software and water quality monitoring information from the Philadelphia Water Department, impacts were directly estimated. The impacts were related to effects on ecosystem functioning, ecosystem goods and services, and broad value estimated for the latter. The effects were used to indicate what might be appropriate policies to reduce the negative environmental consequences of residential development in the watershed. Unexpectedly, the environmental impacts of the profitable and sustainable scenarios were not very different. This suggests that profitability and sustainability need not be mutually exclusive. © 2019 by the authors.","Ecosystem goods and services; Philadelphia metro region; Policy options; Profitability; Residential development; Urban sustainability; Watershed","ArcGIS; environmental impact; land use change; profitability; residential development; sustainability; urbanization; water quality; watershed; Delaware; Pennsylvania; Philadelphia; United States; Wissahickon Creek",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074830501

The Chengdu-Chongqing Urban Agglomeration (CCUA), a less developed area located in the southwest of China with higher vehicle population and special topographic features, was selected as the research area. The aims of this study were to establish multi-year vehicular emission inventories for ten important air pollutants in this area and to analyze emission control policy scenarios based on the inventories. The results showed that the ten vehicular pollutant emissions had differences during the past decade, and CO2 and NH3 increased markedly between 1999 and 2015. Chengdu and Chongqingwere the dominant contributors of vehicular emissions in the CCUA. Eight scenarios based on these inventories were designed and the alternative energy replacement scenario was studied from the life-cycle perspective. Compared with the business as usual scenario, elimination of substandard vehicles scenario is the most effective policy to control NOx, PM2.5, PM10, and CH4 emissions; the radical alternative energy replacement scenario could decrease the vehicular NMVOC, CO2, N2O, and NH3 emissions; the elimination of motorcycles scenario could decrease the vehicular CO emissions; and the raising fuel standards scenario could reduce vehicular SO2 emissions significantly (by 94.81%). The radical integrated scenario (combining all of the reduction control measures mentioned above) would achieve the maximum emission reduction of vehicular pollutants CO, NMVOC, NOx, PM2.5, PM10, CO2, N2O, and NH3 compared with any scenario alone. © 2019 by the authors.","Emission inventory; Scenario analysis; The CCUA; Vehicular pollution","agglomeration; alternative energy; atmospheric pollution; emission control; emission inventory; environmental protection; pollution policy; replacement; scenario analysis; traffic emission; vehicle component; Chengdu; China; Chongqing; Sichuan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075869719

However, the understanding of the kinetics, evolved gases, and mechanisms for biomass pyrolysis is limited. We first propose a novel temperature response mechanism for the pyrolysis of sugar cane residue using thermogravimetric analysis-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry-mass spectrometry (TG-FTIR-MS) combined with Gaussian model and two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D COS). The existence and contribution of distinct peaks in TG-FTIR spectra were innovatively distinguished and quantified, and the temperature-dependent dynamics of gas amounts were determined using Gaussian deconvolution. The 2D-TG-FTIR/MS-COS results revealed for the first time that the primary sequential temperature responses of gases occurred in the order: H2O/CH4 &gt; phenols/alkanes/aromatics/alcohols &gt; carboxylic acids/ketones &gt; CO2/ethers &gt; aldehyde groups/acetaldehyde. Subtle sequential changes even occurred within the same gases during pyrolysis. The quantity dynamics and sequential responses of gases were fitted to the combined effects of the order-based, diffusion, and chemical reaction mechanisms for the component degradation. The combination of TG-FTIR-MS, Gaussian model, and 2D COS is a promising approach for the online monitoring and real-time management of biomass pyrolysis, providing favorable strategies for pyrolysis optimization, byproduct recovery, energy generation, and gas emission control in engineering and environmental applications.

Here we examine the connections between climate mitigation and climate adaptation, specifically, between low-carbon energy systems and extreme events. The article specifically addresses the question, how do responses to extreme climate risks enhance or limit capacity to promote city-level greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation? As a step toward answering this question, we present a framework for considering windows of opportunity that may arise as a result of extreme events and how these windows can be exploited to foster development and implementation of low-carbon energy strategies. Four brief case studies are used to provide empirical background and determine the impact of potential windows of opportunity. Some general conclusions are defined. In particular, the existing energy system structure is an important determinant of impact and potential for energy transitions. Well-developed and articulated governance strategies and ready access of effective and economically efficient alternative energy technology were key to transitions. However, prospects for inequity in development and implementation of low-carbon solutions need to be considered. Finally, exploiting windows of opportunity afforded by extreme events for developing low-carbon economy and infrastructure also can provide resilience against those very events. These types of responses will be needed as extreme events increase in frequency and magnitude in the future, with cities as primary sites of impact and action.

This paper illustrates the potential usefulness of such predictions for building a climate service for agricultural needs. In particular, we assess the forecast quality of multi-model climate predictions in estimating two user-relevant drought indices, Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), at multi-annual timescales during European summer. We obtain high skill for predicting five-year average (forecast years 1-5) SPEI across Southern Europe, while for the same forecast period SPI exhibits high and significant skill over Scandinavia and its surrounding regions. In addition, an assessment of the added value of initialized decadal climate information with respect to standard uninitialized climate projections is presented. The model initialization improves the forecast skill over Central Europe, the Balkan region and Southern Scandinavia. Most of the increased skill found with initialization seems to be due to the climate forecast systems ability to improve the extended summer precipitation and potential evapotranspiration forecast, as well as their ability to adequately represent the observed effects of these climate variables on the drought indices. © 2019 The Author(s).

Our approach has been to utilize an already established fusion design, FESS-FNSF, which is a tokamak-based machine with 518 MW fusion power, a 4.8-m major radius, a 1.2-m minor radius, and a machine average neutron wall loading of ~1 MW/m2. For this design, we propose a PFC concept that integrates a flowing LM first wall (FW) and an open-surface divertor. The flowing LM first removes the surface heat flux from the FW and then proceeds to the lower section of the vacuum chamber to form a large area LM surface for absorbing high peak surface heat flux in the divertor region. In pursuing the application of large open LM surfaces in the FNSF, two new computer codes have been developed and then applied to the analysis of free-surface magnetohydrodynamic flows and heat transfer, including fast thin flowing liquid layers over the solid FW (liquid wall), a tublike divertor, and a fast flow divertor. The analysis is aimed at optimization of the liquid wall design by matching certain proposed design criteria and also at evaluation of the maximum heat fluxes, using liquid lithium (Li) as a working fluid. It was demonstrated that the flowing Li FW (at ~2 cm and ~10 m/s) can tolerate a surface heat flux of ~1 MW/m2, while the open-surface Li divertor can remove a maximum high peak heat flux of 10 MW/m2. The paper also focuses on the underlying science. One such example is the evaluation and characterization of heat transfer mechanisms and heat transfer intensification in the tublike Li divertor. © 2019, © 2019 American Nuclear Society.","divertor; first wall; free-surface flows; Fusion Nuclear Science Facility; liquid metal; Plasma-facing components","Facings; Fusion reactor divertors; Heat transfer; Liquid metals; Lithium; Magnetohydrodynamics; Magnetoplasma; Metal analysis; divertor; First wall; Free-surface flow; Fusion energy systems; Heat transfer intensifications; Heat transfer mechanism; Magneto-hydrodynamic flow; Plasma-facing components; Heat flux",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072085112

One of the changes in climate components can cause changes in rainfall in an area. While changes in rainfall conditions in an area can cause increased vulnerability of a region to potential of drought. In this research, the effects of climate change on the drought potential in Sumbawa Island region was investigated, where this region is one of the areas prone to drought in Indonesia. Climate projection until 2040 was carried out using the Conformal Cubic Atmospheric Model (CCAM) model with 14 km spatial resolution and monthly temporal resolution. While the drought index is calculated by the SPI (Standardize Precipitation Index) method where positive numbers tend to mean wet, lift between -1 to 1 is neutral, and increasingly negative numbers tend to mean dry. It is known that in 2040 January was known that there would be no drought on Sumbawa Island with values ranging from -1 to 2. While in August of 2040, the potential for drought disaster should be watched out. This is because in this month the drought index value ranges from -2.5 to - 2. The potential for drought itself is known to increase in August 5 years until 2040 when compared with 5-year data, 2025 and 2030 in August in the Bima region. Meanwhile, based on time series analysis, it is estimated that there will be some extreme dry conditions, in August 2022, 2024, 2028, 2030, and 2033. Knowing these extreme conditions, it is hoped that this will become the basis for regional planning systems, starting from planning infrastructure and social systems to climate change mitigation and adaptation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Drought; Global warming; Rain; Regional planning; Time series analysis; Atmospheric model; Climate change mitigation; Climate projection; Extreme conditions; Precipitation indices; Rainfall condition; Spatial resolution; Temporal resolution; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077024971

These secondary products may be in the form of pollutants and liberated in the atmosphere. In this paper, an analysis was performed for green house gas (GHG) emission from municipal solid waste disposal for Faridabad city, India. Land filling and waste-to-energy methods were considered for GHG emission and analysis was performed based on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) model. GHG emission and linear pinch analysis (LPA) were performed based on the 50% collection efficiency in Faridabad city over a period of 10 years (2015–2025). Two scenarios of emission forecasting, such as land filling and waste to energy (incineration), were incorporated in this study. Hybrid analysis was presented for emission forecasting and emission reduction to develop a sustainable municipal solid waste management system for Faridabad. A target of 20% and 30% reduction in GHG emission was formulated with the help of LPA. The result shows that GHG in Faridabad city has been continuously changed from 2015 to 2025.The result represented here could be a decision support matrix for municipalities to develop integrated municipal solid waste management system for upcoming smart cities in India. Moreover, another novelty of this study reflects that cities having approximate same population, waste characteristics, and waste management technology could adopt this model for saving of GHG inventory and target-based reduction. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","carbon dioxide; green house gases; methane; Municipal solid waste; pinch analysis; sanitary land filling; waste to energy","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Decision support systems; Emission control; Filling; Forecasting; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; Collection efficiency; Decision support matrix; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Land-fillings; Management technologies; Pinch analysis; Waste characteristics; Waste to energy; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060565508

In this paper, we reported a systematic approach to remove sp2 carbon content from NDs particles by annealing method to enhance the interfacial molecular bonding between reinforcement and matrix. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Fourier Transform Infra-Red Spectrophotometer (FTIR) studies revealed that annealing of NDs occurs at 450 °C, indicating that the decrease in resistivity is based on the sp2/sp3 carbon ratio of NDs. Thus, it is interesting to study the properties of annealed NDs/epoxy nanocomposites with small filler concentrations varying from 0.1 wt% to 0.5 wt%. In this paper, the Dielectric properties (dielectric constant and dielectric strength), thermal conductivity, impact strength, micro-hardness, and compressive behaviour of NDs/epoxy nanocomposites were investigated. Dispersion of NDs at very low concentration was ensured with the help of UV-vis-NIR absorbance spectra analysis. It was observed that the dielectric constant (ϵ′) was enhanced with NDs loading and reached an optimum value at 0.3 wt% of the loading of NDs whereas the dielectric strength showed a reverse pattern.

This creates a demand for more efficient conservation strategies that focus on multiple benefits at once. For instance, conservation actions that deliver returns for both aboveground carbon (AGC) and tree species diversity (TSD) would be an advance when compared to carbon-focused initiatives. Here we address this issue by identifying AGC-TSD hotspots in Savanna, Atlantic Forest and Semi-Arid Woodland vegetation domains in southeast Brazil. We modelled Fisher's alpha as an indicator of TSD, using remote sensing, climate and terrain-related data to train the random forests algorithm. We thus defined, mapped and characterized the areas that deliver returns for both AGC and TSD (“hotspots”), identifying the hotspots owners (whether within public or private lands). Our results suggest that among the group of predictor variables, precipitation, valley depth, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and tree cover percent, are the main indicators of diversity across the state. The spatial patterns of carbon and diversity roughly coincide and indicate that Atlantic Forest has higher values for both indicators. AGC and TSD are weak related, so there is a potential risk for biodiversity if only a carbon-focused conservation approaches are considered across the studied domains. We estimate that 61% of the hotspots are located in unprotected areas within private properties making them highly susceptible to loss. Together, these hotspots account for 6,131,453 Mg of AGC and show mean values of Fisheŕs alpha of approximately 26. Our study reinforces the need to select natural areas on private lands to be considered as priority areas for protection. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aboveground carbon; Climate; Co-beneficial conservation; Remote sensing; Terrain-data; Tree species diversity","Biodiversity; Carbon; Conservation; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Landforms; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Above-ground carbons; Climate; Conservation actions; Conservation strategies; Normalized difference vegetation index; Predictor variables; Terrain data; Tree species diversity; Forestry; biodiversity; carbon; climate change; conservation status; ecosystem service; NDVI; remote sensing; satellite data; savanna; semiarid region; species diversity; tree; woodland; Biodiversity; Carbon; Conservation; Ecosystems; Plants; Remote Sensing; Atlantic Forest; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071402655

Replacing FESOM1.4 by FESOM2.0 promises a higher efficiency of the new climate setup compared to its predecessor. The new setup allows for long-term climate integrations using a locally eddy-resolving ocean. Here it is evaluated in terms of (1) the mean state and long-term drift under preindustrial climate conditions, (2) the fidelity in simulating the historical warming, and (3) differences between coarse and eddy-resolving ocean configurations. The results show that the realism of the new climate setup is overall within the range of existing models. In terms of oceanic temperatures, the historical warming signal is of smaller amplitude than the model drift in case of a relatively short spin-up. However, it is argued that the strategy of “de-drifting” climate runs after the short spin-up, proposed by the HighResMIP protocol, allows one to isolate the warming signal. Moreover, the eddy-permitting/resolving ocean setup shows notable improvements regarding the simulation of oceanic surface temperatures, in particular in the Southern Ocean. ©2019.

Lime application is the most common practice to mitigate soil acidity. There are complex economic interactions between application of lime and nitrogen fertilizer, with the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of these inputs adding further complexity. We employ a non-linear dynamic optimization model to determine economically optimal application strategies for lime and nitrogen fertilizer accounting for the social cost of the resulting emissions of greenhouse gases. The model is applied in three zones with different rainfall levels, in the northern wheatbelt of Western Australia. Rainfall has important influences on results through its effect on the dissolution and leaching of lime, leaching of nitrogen, and the yield potential of crops. Results show that nitrogen-related decisions, such as the type of nitrogen fertilizer and crop rotation, have a substantial impact on optimal lime application rates and resulting emissions. For example, the use of ammonium sulfate, rather than urea, reduces emissions. Similarly, by allowing a reduction in nitrogen fertilizer use the incorporation of legume crops like lupin can reduce emissions by 50%, relative to a wholly non-legume crop rotation. Although carbon pricing reduces emissions, the magnitude of the reductions is modest in all modeled scenarios. The private cost to farmers of a carbon tax in this case study region is small, although the net social benefit of the carbon tax in this case study is smaller still, even without accounting for the transaction costs of operating the tax system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon pricing; Emissions; Lime application; Nitrogen; Optimization; Soil acidity","acidity; carbon isotope; crop production; dissolution; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; leaching; lime; optimization; pollution tax; soil fertility; soil nitrogen; Australia; Western Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071900887

Inspired by the recently reported Sb(V) reductase belonging to the dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (DMSOR) family, this study was undertaken to use metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to unravel whether any DMSOR family genes in the bioreactor had the potential for Sb(V) reduction. A search through metagenomic-assembled genomes recovered from the microbial community found that some DMSOR family genes, designated sbrA (Sb(V) reductase gene), were highly transcribed in four phylogenetically disparate assemblies. The putative catalytic subunits were found to be representatives of two distinct phylogenetic clades of reductases that were most closely related to periplasmic nitrate reductases and respiratory arsenate reductases, respectively. Putative operons containing sbrA possessed many other components, including genes encoding c-type cytochromes, response regulators, and ferredoxins, which together implement Sb(V) reduction. This predicted ability was confirmed by incubating the enrichment culture with 13C-labeled CH4 and Sb(V) in serum bottles, where Sb(V) was reduced coincident with the production of 13C-labeled CO2. Overall, these results increase our understanding of how Sb(V) can be bio-reduced in environments. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Antimonate reduction; Dimethyl sulfoxide reductase family; Methane oxidation; Molybdenum-containing","Dimethyl sulfoxide; Genes; Methane; Microorganisms; Antimonate; Arsenate reductase; Catalytic subunits; Metatranscriptomics; Methane oxidation; Microbial communities; Periplasmic nitrate reductase; Response regulators; Antimony compounds; antimonate reductase; arsenate reductase; cytochrome; ferredoxin; nitrate reductase; oxidoreductase; unclassified drug; antimony; bacterial protein; oxidoreductase; bioreactor; enzyme; enzyme activity; gene; genomics; methane; microbial community; nitrate; oxidation; phylogenetics; reduction; amino acid sequence; antimony contamination; Article; Betaproteobacteria; Burkholderiales; Clostridia; contamination; enzyme active site; gene cluster; genetic code; Magnetospirillum; metagenomics; methanotroph; Methylocystaceae; Methylomonas; Methylophilus; microbial community; microbial diversity; omics; operon; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; Sporomusaceae; Xanthomonadaceae; bacterium; classification; enzymology; genetics; metabolism; multigene family; phylogeny; Antimony; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Multigene Family; Operon; Oxidoreductases; Phylogeny",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073928974

Gas sweetening processes that are routinely used rely on processes such as amine-based adsorption-desorption cycles, membrane separation, and cryogenic technologies which are energy-intensive and reject CO2. This work explores the mechanism and nature of active sites for hydrogenation (HYD) of CO2 in the presence of H2S on MoS2, a sulfur-tolerant catalyst, using steady-state kinetics studies and density functional theory calculations. In the absence of H2S, this reaction is positive order in CO2 and H2 and negative order in CO and H2O; the system, further, shows no H/D kinetic isotope effect, thereby indicating that C-O scission is rate-controlling. The specific mechanism at play, namely, redox or associative, could, however, not be adequately resolved with the available data. In the presence of H2S, the rate first drops (until about 60 ppm co-feed) and, then, increases (at &gt;200 ppm), indicating a complex functional relationship of the reaction system with H2S. A combination of the ab initio phase diagram, kinetic experiments, and H2S/D2 scrambling studies indicate that (i) the edge structure of the molybdenum sulfide catalyst varies substantially with reaction conditions and co-feeds, (ii) multiple types of sites are at play, in particular, a sulfur-poor site that is active but prone to H2S poisoning and a sulfur-rich site that is less active but tolerant to sulfur with a preponderance of data pointing to these being coordinative unsaturated (CUS) and brim sites, respectively, on the metal edge, and (iii) H2S inhibits CO2 HYD by dissociatively adsorbing on these CUS sites at low co-feeds (0-60 ppm), reacts with CO2 to produce COS and CO at high co-feeds (&gt;1000 ppm) and assists (or co-catalyzes) HYD by probably acting as a hydrogen shuttle at intermediate co-feeds.

The requirement of two-component systems reduces the light emission efficiency from the molecules and limits their applications in solid-state electronic applications and quantum computing devices.

In order to hedge the risk in spot markets and ensure the incomes, it is crucial for generation companies (Gencos) to determine the optimal GRT scheme at their risk preferences. In this paper, a power portfolio optimization methodology is proposed considering the bidding behaviours in spot markets, independent system operator (ISO) centralized dispatching, and the cross-region GRTs. Specifically, various risks for Gencos are modelled including spot price fluctuation and system component failures. Then, a bi-level optimal portfolio (BLOP) model is established where the Gencos maximize their total incomes with subject to the ISOs which minimize the local dispatching costs simultaneously. The BLOP model is transformed into a solvable single-level mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPCE) through the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The numerical results on a realistic Chinese testing system illustrate the effect of GRTs for income assurance of Gencos and the necessity to consider the stochastic contingencies in portfolio decisions. Specifically, it is a preferred option for Gencos to exploit approximately 77% of spot power to GRT at the normal state, which can increase the total income by 266.21%. At contingency states, the optimal GRT ratios are 70–80%, the corresponding income grows nearly twice more than pure spot trades. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bi-level model; Cross-region; Generation company (Genco); Generation right trade; Karush-Kuhn-Tucker; Power portfolio","Commerce; Electric power generation; Electric utilities; Financial data processing; Power markets; Stochastic systems; Bi-level models; Cross-region; Generation companies; Generation right trades; Karush kuhn tuckers; Power portfolio; Financial markets; carbon emission; electricity; emission control; methodology; numerical model; optimization; power generation; risk assessment; stochasticity; testing method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073701455

However, it can be difficult to decide whether the beneficial effects of cover crops on some ecosystem services are likely to outweigh their harmful effects on other services, and thus to decide whether they should be promoted by agricultural policy in specific situations. We used meta-analysis to quantify the effects of cover crops on five ecosystem services (food production, climate regulation, soil and water regulation, and weed control) in arable farmland in California and the Mediterranean, based on 326 experiments reported in 57 publications. In plots with cover crops, there was 13% less water, 9% more organic matter and 41% more microbial biomass in the soil, 27% fewer weeds, and 15% higher carbon dioxide emissions (but also more carbon stored in soil organic matter), compared to control plots with bare soils or winter fallows. Cash crop yields were 16% higher in plots that had legumes as cover crops (compared to controls) but 7% lower in plots that had non-legumes as cover crops. Soil nitrogen content was 41% lower, and nitrate leaching was 53% lower, in plots that had non-legume cover crops (compared to controls) but not significantly different in plots that had legumes. We did not find enough data to quantify the effects of cover crops on biodiversity conservation, pollination, or pest regulation. These gaps in the evidence need to be closed if cover crops continue to be widely promoted. We suggest that this novel combination of multiple meta-analyses for multiple ecosystem services could be used to support multi-criteria decision making about agri-environmental policy. © 2019","Catch crops; Conservation agriculture; Conservation evidence; Conservation practices; Evidence synthesis; Green manures","agricultural land; arable land; catch crop; conservation management; cover crop; ecosystem service; green manuring; Mediterranean environment; meta-analysis; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072033596

When low electricity demand occurs during the nighttime, additional benefits of overnight energy storage can also occur. Lower nighttime ambient temperatures can lead to efficiency improvements throughout the grid, including power generators, transmission and distribution systems, and chillers. For ice thermal energy storage, these benefits have even been shown to enable net reductions in primary energy consumption compared to normal cooling operations. The energy and emissions impacts of ice storage depend strongly on the diurnal temperature variation and power fleet characteristics in a given region, but previous analysis only examined a single location with relatively high humidity. This study extends the previous analysis to arid regions with high diurnal temperature variation, using Phoenix, AZ and Flagstaff, AZ as case studies, and to a region with high solar penetration, using Los Angeles, CA as a case study. This study demonstrates that the larger temperature variations in Arizona lead to higher round-trip efficiencies, with average primary energy-based effective round-trip efficiencies of 127% in Flagstaff, 107% in Phoenix, and 90% in Los Angeles, with site round-trip efficiencies of 133%, 127%, and 99%, respectively. These high round-trip efficiencies result in net reductions in carbon emissions of 34% in Flagstaff and 24% in Phoenix, but an increase of 53% in Los Angeles due to the absence of solar production overnight. Additionally, the lower icemaking efficiency during warm daytime temperatures makes ice storage poorly-suited for storing excess solar generation compared to other storage approaches. However, the presence of a mature commercial market and the possibility of gaining over 100% effective round-trip efficiency create a strong case for ice thermal energy storage as an energy storage approach for reducing both primary energy consumption and carbon emissions, particularly if fleet efficiencies are higher and carbon intensities are lower overnight. © 2019","Carbon emissions analysis; CO2 emissions reduction; Energy analysis; Energy storage; Ice energy storage; Round-trip efficiency; Thermal energy storage","Carbon; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Energy storage; Energy utilization; Fleet operations; Heat storage; Ice; Solar power generation; Temperature distribution; Thermal energy; Carbon emissions; CO2 emissions; Efficiency improvement; Energy analysis; Energy storage systems; Primary energy consumption; Round trip; Transmission and distribution systems; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071673850

Nowaday, water contamination has become a dangerous problem to natural ecosystems, economic growth and human society, rising the necessity to better understand the temporal variabilities of pollutants as in aquatic systems. Totally 25 sampling stations were quantified from southwest northeast and post-monsoon on 2010 in lower reaches of Thamirabarani wetland, Tuticorin district, Tamil Nadu. Multivariate statistical techniques were used to investigate the temporal variations and to detect the major pollution factors. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that 16 studied water quality variables had significant temporal differences (p>0.01). Using cluster analysis, the 25 sampling sites were divided into three groups (no, moderate and high pollution) based on the similarity of water quality variables. The investigative results suggested that the wetland water pollution primarily resulted from discharging domestic and agricultural wastewater and providing perilous evidence for water resource conservation in the lower reaches wetland of Thamirabarani river, Tuticorin. © 2019-Kalpana Corporation.","Multidimensional data analysis; Thamirabarani river; Water pollution; Wetland",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076731201

Until now, little seismic reservoir response is observed, only at two out of 16 sites seismic events with ML&gt;2.0 were detected: at Unterhaching, in 2008, six events with ML&gt;2 occurred soon after the onset of circulation; at Poing, in 2016, 5 years after circulation started, two events with ML∼2.1 occurred, both located near the injection well. The analysis of the reactivation potential allows to connect seismicity to fault structures. In the Bavarian Molasse Basin, fault structures generally exhibit low seismic reactivation potential, as long as they trend ENE-WSW. By Monte-Carlo simulation, the geological uncertainty and the sensitivity of the individual parameters are quantified. They show that critically pre-stressed fault segments, e.g. at Unterhaching, combined with minimum change of the hydraulic reservoir conditions can lead to a dramatic increase of the reactivation potential of seismicity. For uncritical fault segments, e.g. at the Poing site, two self-enforcing effects are discussed which increase the reactivation potential over time: first, stress field modification by thermo-hydraulic effects and, second, fault alteration by carbonate dissolution can reduce the fault friction and cohesion. Both effects increase the sensitivity of the reactivation potential to the fault friction and can bring previously uncritical fault segments to critical state. Finally, the possible impact of coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical and chemical processes at hydrothermal systems on the reactivation potential is highlighted: at fault segments with high reactivation potential hydro-mechanical effects may dominate whereas at low reactivation potential thermo-mechanical processes can potentially yield to a slow rotation of the stress field. © 2019","Bavarian Molasse Basin; Geothermal energy; Induced seismicity; Injection induced effects; Probabilistic approach; Reactivation potential","Critical current density (superconductivity); Friction; Geothermal energy; Geothermal prospecting; Injection (oil wells); Intelligent systems; Monte Carlo methods; Stresses; Geological uncertainty; Geothermal exploration; Molasse basin; Probabilistic approaches; Reactivation potential; Reservoir conditions; Thermo-hydraulic effects; Thermomechanical process; Induced Seismicity; fault; geothermal energy; geothermal system; hydrothermal system; induced seismicity; probability; Molasse Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067204574

To mitigate the negative impact of pollution, some cities have implemented air quality strategies that regulate emissions from multiple sources. However, when such strategies are applied in isolation they may fail to comply with stringent environmental goals. To support the development of comprehensive urban air quality policy, we propose an optimization model that suggests a portfolio of mitigation actions that captures realistic aspects of air quality policy-making such as implementation cost, pollution goals, interdependencies between alternatives, and managerial and regulatory constraints. We illustrate the advantages of our model with a real case study in Bogotá, Colombia's capital and one of the largest cities of Latin America, where new legislation established a PM10 air quality standard. To achieve the environmental goal, our model suggests an optimal portfolio consisting of six mitigation actions targeting mobile and stationary sources. Interventions in the transport sector alone generate 70% of the emissions reduction. The PM10 goal is achieved with a net incremental cost of US$1 billion with respect to the no-intervention scenario. The optimization model and results presented in this article were formally adopted as the official air quality policy in the city. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Air quality; Integrated assessment modeling; PM10; Urban pollution","Air pollution; Air quality; Air quality standards; Emission control; Health risks; Laws and legislation; Optimization; Emissions reduction; Implementation cost; Integrated assessment models; Optimal portfolios; Optimization modeling; PM10; Risk to human health; Urban pollutions; Urban growth; air quality; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; emission control; integrated approach; modeling; optimization; particulate matter; urban policy; urban pollution; Bogota; Colombia; Latin America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070763236

The reduction of particle emission may be achieved by changes in jet engine design. This, however, will only affect new aircraft. Previous studies have shown that the use of alternative jet fuels feature a co-beneficial reduction of soot emission beside an improved carbon footprint. In the present study, a CFM56-5C4 engine was operated on a test rig with three different fuel types: one reference kerosene, a catalytic hydrothermolysis jet fuel (ReadiJet) and an unblended alcohol-to-jet (ATJ) fuel. Due to the absence of aromatics in the ATJ fuel, ASTM jet fuel requirements are not met, but the use of this fuel led to a reduction of 70% in particle mass compared to the reference fuel. The ReadiJet fuel has higher aromatic content, lower fuel hydrogen content and, thus, an increase in particle emission was observed. For the present engine, the highest soot reductions were observed at lower power settings. In accordance to previous studies, the soot emission showed a good correlation to the hydrogen content of the fuels and the emission reduction matches the estimations of the imFOX model. In order to compare test rig studies to field studies, transient processes must be considered because they govern take-off conditions. Four experiments with different transient thrust patterns were performed on the test rig with regular Jet A-1. If the thrust changes were not very rapid (e.g. 5 s to ~90% thrust) the results could be reproduced with a set of pseudo-stationary processes to a sufficient extend. This emphasizes the relevance of test-rig studies for real in-field measurements and local air quality studies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aircraft exhaust; Biofuels; Kerosene; Soot emission; Transient operation","Air quality; Aircraft engines; Alcohol fuels; Alternative fuels; Biofuels; Carbon footprint; Dust; Emission control; Hydrogen; Jet engines; Jet fuel; Kerosene; Machine design; Soot; Aircraft exhausts; Aircraft jet engines; Contrail formation; Emission reduction; Particle emissions; Soot emissions; Stationary process; Transient operation; Hydrogen fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070105040

Also, the difference between using prosuming electricity as a community (i.e., energy sharing) and prosuming it as an individual household was calculated. Results show that all investigated technologies have substantial GHG emission reduction potential. A strong moderating factor is the existing electricity generation mix of a country: the GHG emission reduction potential is highest in countries that currently have high hourly emission factors. GHG emission reduction potentials are highest in southern Europe (Portugal, Spain, Italy) and lowest in countries with a high share of nuclear energy (Belgium, France). Hence, from a European GHG emission reduction perspective, it has most impact to install PV in countries that currently have a fossil-fueled electricity mix and/or have high solar irradiation. Lastly, we have seen that energy sharing leads to an increased GHG emission reduction potential in all countries, because it leads to higher PV capacities. © 2019 MDPI AG.

We present the results of a discrete choice experiment (DCE) conducted in face-to-face interviews. In a study in Malawi, farmers responded to a series of questions about different cropping techniques and tree planting options to improve soil fertility and climate change resilience. A combination of financial and non-financial incentives was proposed to increase adoption and success rates. The results show that for different policy objectives, different climate smart packages are suitable. Our results demonstrate that farmers prefer options that secure the production of maize and include crops with both domestic use and local markets. The drought-resistant crop sorghum was unpopular among respondents; achieving SDG 13 through this CSA approach would therefore require high incentive payments. If CSA is to help achieve multiple goals e.g. poverty and inequality reduction (SDGs 1 and 10) as well as SDGs 2 and 13, a range of CSA packages, with different types of crops, rotation versus intercropping techniques and incentive levels, should be offered to smallholders. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","choice experiment; climate smart agriculture; Malawi; pro-poor; sustainable development","alternative agriculture; climate change; discrete choice analysis; farmers attitude; incentive; smallholder; sustainable development; Malawi; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070996216

Sub-Antarctic islands are predicted to experience rapid warming during the next century; therefore, establishing trajectories of change in vegetation communities is essential for developing conservation strategies to preserve biological diversity. We present a Late-glacial-early Holocene (16 500–6450 cal a bp) palaeoecological record from Hooker's Point, Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas), South Atlantic. This period spans the Pleistocene-Holocene transition, providing insight into biological responses to abrupt climate change. Pollen and plant macrofossil records appear insensitive to climatic cooling during the Late-glacial, but undergo rapid turnover in response to regional warming. The absence of trees throughout the Late-glacial-early Holocene enables the recognition of far-travelled pollen from southern South America. The first occurrence of Nothofagus (southern beech) may reflect changes in the strength and/or position of the Southern Westerly Wind Belt during the Late-glacial period. Peat inception and accumulation at Hooker's Point is likely to be promoted by the recalcitrant litter of wind-adapted flora. This recalcitrant litter helps to explain widespread peatland development in a comparatively dry environment, and suggests that wind-adapted peatlands can remain carbon sinks even under low precipitation regimes. © 2019 The Authors.

The numerical simulation showed that nanotubes become bistable systems at rather large diameters. They can be in two stable states in spite of the interaction with substrates: in an open state with a hollow internal cavity and in a collapsed state. The interaction with a plane substrate leads to the nanotube flattening, making its transition to a collapsed state more energetically preferable (the stronger the interaction, the more preferable is the transition). It is shown that a change in the multilayer nanotube shape due to its interaction with the substrate or due to its collapse leads to a sharp increase in the number of its collective eigenmodes, in which all its layers take part. The energy profile of the transition is found between the steady states of the nanotube; the profile is a strongly asymmetric double-well potential with the first narrow minimum, which corresponds to the collapsed state and the second broad minimum, which corresponds to the nanotube open state. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","bistability; double-well potential; multi-walled nanotube; nanotube collapse; plane substrate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074720182

The cumulative N2O emissions were quantified over a period of 146 days throughout the cultivation of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench). Labile and stable soil carbon (C) fractions and C contents in classes of aggregates (macroaggregates &gt;0.250 mm and microaggregates &lt;0.250 mm) were determined. The cumulative N2O emissions were larger in the CC-CT system, intermediate in the CC-NT and CLS-NT systems, and smaller in the Cerrado. The decomposition of crop residues during the crop succession (first and second crop seasons) and the presence of a grass forage (with grazing and not grazed) in both systems (CLS-NT and CC-NT, respectively) explain the differences in N2O fluxes between the land uses. Smaller cumulative N2O emissions were observed in the integrated system (CLS-NT), which could be attributed to the greatest increase in soil C in its most stable SOM fractions (fulvic acid) and occlusion in microaggregates. This confirms the hypothesis that the accumulation of C in the most stable SOM fractions of the soil, unavailable to the microbiota, results in smaller N2O emissions. Principal component analysis also revealed that aggregation is a key attribute that correlates with soil N2O emissions. Thus, conservation systems such as CLS-NT had larger average diameter of aggregates and the smallest N2O emissions among the agroecosystems. Highlights: Relations between SOM fractions and N2O emissions were studied in integrated systems The accumulation of stabilized C fractions reduces N2O emissions Soil structure (aggregation) and SOM stability partially explain N2O fluxes Integrated crop–livestock promotes better soil conditions, reducing N2O emissions. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science","Brazilian Cerrado; ecological intensification; ferralsols; greenhouse gas emissions","agricultural emission; agricultural intensification; cerrado; continuous cropping; Ferralsol; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; long-term change; multivariate analysis; nitrous oxide; soil emission; soil organic matter; sorghum; Brazil; Sorghum bicolor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066916827

The current trend in emission control techniques of automobile exhaust is to reduce CO2 emission. We know that CO2 is a greenhouse gas and it leads to global warming. Conversion of CO2 into carbon and oxygen is an energy-consuming process compared to the catalytic converters. The best way to reduce CO2 is to capture it from the source, store it and use it for industrial applications. To physically capture the CO2 from the engine exhaust, adsorbents like molecular sieves are utilized. In comparison to other CO2 separation methods, adsorption technique consumes less work and energy. Moreover, the sieves can be regenerated, reused and recycled once it is completely saturated. In this research work, zeolite X13 was chosen as a molecular sieve to adsorb CO2 from the exhaust. A chamber was designed to store the zeolite and it is attached to the exhaust manifold. The selected engine was a single-cylinder Briggs and Stratton petrol engine. The experiments were conducted in two phases, the first phase to adsorb and the second phase to regenerate. Temperature pressure swing adsorption was chosen as the preferred process for the regeneration. This study was conducted by varying chamber length in three measurements and sieve quantities. The gas separated from the sieves during regeneration is tested using AVL Ditest analyser to study the percentage of CO2 adsorbed from the engine exhaust. From the results, it was found that 70% of the CO2 emissions were absorbed using low cost zeolite sieves. © 2019 SAE International.

A theoretical steady-state model that simulates the behaviour of the CO2 system is developed and validated against field measurements obtained from an existing refrigeration system in a food-retail building located in the United Kingdom. Five heat recovery strategies are analysed by modifying the mass flow and pressure level in the condenser. The model shows that a reduction of 48% in natural-gas consumption is feasible by the installation of a de-superheater and without applying any advanced operating strategy. However, the CO2 system can fully supply the entire space-heating requirements by adopting alternative control strategies, albeit by penalising the coefficient of performance (COP) of the compressor. Results show that the best energy strategy can reduce total consumption by 32%, while the best economic strategy can reduce costs by 6%.

Application of pig slurries can result in very large losses of N through NH3 volatilization, thus decreasing the N use efficiency (NUE) of the applied manure. Shallow incorporation has been shown to significantly abate these losses. In this field study, we assessed the impact of contrasting weather conditions on the effectiveness of shallow injection to abate NH3 emissions from pig slurry application to a Mediterranean soil. As potential trade-offs of NH3 abatement, greenhouse gas emissions were also measured under conditions of high soil moisture. Compared with surface application of slurry, shallow injection effectively and significantly decreased NH3 losses independently of weather conditions, but reductions of NH3 emission were greater after heavy rainfall. In contrast, under these conditions, shallow injection triggered higher emissions of N2O and CH4.

Design/methodology/approach: The sample includes state or city subsidized child care programs in the USA which were traditionally African-American programs that experienced an influx of Latino immigrant enrollment. Instruments included structured observations of classroom peer play and cultural artifacts. Hierarchical multiple regression was run to determine whether cultural artifacts and child ethnic composition within classrooms contributed to the prediction of high-peer play over positive emotional climate alone. Findings: The final model indicates that cultural artifacts reflective of African-American culture positively predict high levels of peer play, while Mexican-American cultural items are negatively predictive. In classrooms with a majority African-American population, predicted high-peer play is 7.994 greater than that predicted for majority of Latino classrooms. Research limitations/implications: Positive emotional climate in these programs was not very high, and it is not clear whether the findings discussed in this report would hold in contexts that exhibit much higher levels of positive emotional climate. It is also not clear that the inclusion of cultural artifacts in contexts in which African-American children are the minority or in racial-ethnically heterogeneous classrooms would lead to the same findings. Practical implications: ECE classroom should make specific choices as to what culturally relevant materials to include in early childhood classrooms. Teachers of young children of color must facilitate children’s engagement with these materials by ensuring that they are representative of the children’s cultural experiences and by supporting children’s engagement with peers through the formation of emotionally positive classroom climates. Social implications: This study points to interesting relationships between what teachers have in classrooms and children’s engagement with each other within those contexts. The findings from this study also exemplify that a one-size-fits-all approach toward childhood development may be counterproductive. Children bring with them ethnic and cultural heritages, which when combined with the preschool culture, create unique experiences for them that should not be ignored or controlled for analysis, but rather, understood. Originality/value: This study provides a unique analysis of seldom considered contexts by examining the use of culturally relevant materials in urban, early childhood contexts. Teachers of young children have been found to consider a focus on race and ethnicity as unnecessary or to engage in a colorblind approach with young children. This study demonstrates how paying careful consideration to the cultural environment in classrooms also supports children’s exploration and play quality. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","African-American; Culture; Early childhood education; Emotional climate; Ethnicity; Latino; Mexican-American; Multicultural; Multicultural education; Peer play; Preschool; Race",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075074230

An exceptional drought occurred the first year of the study and decreased mean predawn (ΨPD) and midday (ΨMD) leaf water potential to −2.9 MPa and −3.6 MPa, respectively, and decreased average monthly midday Gs to near zero for at least one month in both treatments. Stomatal closure occurred at a ΨMD of −3.0 MPa in both treatments. Leaf water potentials and transpiration recovered quickly following significant rain events that terminated the drought and mortality was similar among years and treatments (2.8%). Longleaf pine responded to drought treatment with greater stomatal control of plant water loss rather than adjustments in leaf area, the sapwood to leaf area ratio, or leaf water potential at the turgor loss point (ΨTLP). Annual transpiration per unit leaf area was reduced 16% by drought treatment, but greater stomatal control of water loss in response to drought treatment was associated with decreases in growth efficiency and volume, and no improvement in water use efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Canopy stomatal conductance; Growth; Leaf water potential; Longleaf pine; Sapwood area to leaf area ratio; Throughfall exclusion; Transpiration","Agronomy; Climate change; Drought; Efficiency; Evapotranspiration; Growth (materials); Plant shutdowns; Plants (botany); Transpiration; Wood products; Canopy stomatal conductance; Leaf area ratios; Leaf water potential; Longleaf pine; Throughfall exclusion; Forestry; canopy exchange; climate change; coniferous tree; drought stress; evapotranspiration; forest management; growth response; sap flow; stomatal conductance; throughfall; transpiration; Agronomy; Drought; Efficiency; Forestry; Transpiration; Wood Products; Pinus palustris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070854650

Box 5003, Ås, NO-1432, Norway","A whole-farm model, HolosNorBeef was developed to estimate net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from suckler beef production systems in Norway. The model considers direct emissions of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from on-farm livestock production including soil carbon (C) changes, and indirect N2O and CO2 emissions associated with leaching, volatilization and inputs used on the farm. The emission intensities from average beef cattle farms in Norway was estimated by considering typical herds of British and Continental breeds located in two different regions, flatlands and mountains, with different resources and quality of feed available. The flatlands was located at a low altitude in an area suitable for grain production and mountains was located at higher altitude in a mountainous area not suitable for grain production. The estimated emission intensities were 29.5 and 32.0 kg CO2 equivalents (eq) kg‐1 carcass for the British breeds and 27.5 and 29.6 kg CO2 eq kg‐1 carcass for the Continental breeds, for flatlands and mountains, respectively. Enteric CH4 was the largest source accounting for 44–48% of total GHG emissions. Nitrous oxide from manure and soil was the second largest source accounting for, on average, 21% of the total emissions. Carbon sequestration reduced the emission intensities by 3% on average. When excluding soil C the difference between locations decreased in terms of GHG emission intensity, indicating that inclusion of soil C change is important when calculating emission intensities, especially when production of feed and use of pasture are included. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Beef cattle; Farm scale model; Greenhouse gas emissions; Soil carbon; Suckler cow production","agricultural modeling; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cattle; greenhouse gas; leaching; livestock farming; manure; nitrous oxide; volatilization; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069848227

As previous research has shown, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) emitted from plants can react with other urban air constituents (e.g., NOx, HO radical) and thus negatively affect regional air quality. In this pilot study, BVOC emissions from Cannabis plants were analyzed at four grow facilities. The concentrations of measured BVOCs inside the facilities were between 110 and 5,500 μg m−3. One adult Cannabis plant emits hundreds of micrograms of BVOCs per day and thus can trigger the formation of tropospheric ozone (approximately 2.6 g day−1 plant−1) and other toxic air pollutants. In addition, high concentrations of butane (1,080– 43,000 μg m−3), another reactive VOC, were observed at the facilities equipped with Cannabis oil extraction stations. Implications: High concentrations of VOCs emitted from Cannabis grow facilities can lead to the formation of ozone, secondary VOCs (e.g., formaldehyde and acrolein), and particulate matter. Our results highlight that further assessment of VOC emissions from Cannabis facilities is needed, and this assessment is one of the key factors for developing policies for optimal air pollution control. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Tara Oceans Coordinators","Ocean microbial communities strongly influence the biogeochemistry, food webs, and climate of our planet. Despite recent advances in understanding their taxonomic and genomic compositions, little is known about how their transcriptomes vary globally. Here, we present a dataset of 187 metatranscriptomes and 370 metagenomes from 126 globally distributed sampling stations and establish a resource of 47 million genes to study community-level transcriptomes across depth layers from pole-to-pole. We examine gene expression changes and community turnover as the underlying mechanisms shaping community transcriptomes along these axes of environmental variation and show how their individual contributions differ for multiple biogeochemically relevant processes. Furthermore, we find the relative contribution of gene expression changes to be significantly lower in polar than in non-polar waters and hypothesize that in polar regions, alterations in community activity in response to ocean warming will be driven more strongly by changes in organismal composition than by gene regulatory mechanisms.

Proper and efficient management of municipal solid waste (MSW) is vital for achieving sustainable development as the dilemmas associated with energy management, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, waste-to-energy (WTE) cycle, climate change and economy are addressed. Ineffective waste management technique leads to adverse impacts on the environment, public health and lifestyle of future generations. Motivating governmental organizations across the world to take proactive measures to mitigate waste management techniques with less environmental impact and high financial return. A comparison study of five different MSWM techniques based on cost-benefit analysis and mitigation cost breakdown is presented in this paper to identify the most effective and efficient small-scale MSWM systems. The mitigation analysis utilizes the data obtained from the literature to calculate the greenhouse gas reductions, current net and the carbon mitigation cost of each method considering basic landfill technique as the baseline reference. Hybrid techniques like mechanical biological treatment (MBT) in combination with WTE outperforms the other techniques with lowest carbon mitigation cost ($27.3/metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) without carbon emanation rate (CER) and $43.4/ MTCO2e with CER) and reduced GHG emission. Whereas the conventional WTE is ranked second with mitigation costs of $26.5/ MTCO2e without CER and $42.5/ MTCO2e with CER but this technique also offers the largest reductions in terms of greenhouse gases (1.06 million tons/tons of municipal solid waste) which make it stand out from others. Based on the results obtained from the study the economic and environmental impact caused by the usage of WTE or the hybrid MBT in small-scale MSWM system is proven to be highly beneficial and the introduction of carbon credit schemes reduces the carbon mitigation cost of each technique to a greater extent. © 2019, Engineering and Technology Publishing.

The study encompassed 37 patients with histologically proven peripheral stage I NSCLC in the period June 2010-March 2015. All underwent the planned full dose of carbon-ion radiotherapy, administered with relative biological effectiveness of 52.8 Gy and 60 Gy (divided into four fractions over 1 week) for T1 and T2a tumors, respectively. The 2-year local control rate was set as the primary endpoint, while overall survival, progression-free survival, and the incidence rates of acute and late adverse events were secondary endpoints. The patients were followed up for 56.3 months overall and 62.2 months in the surviving patients, respectively. The actuarial local control rates were 91.2% after 2 years, and 88.1% after 5 years. No differences were found between the T1 and T2a tumors in the 5-year local control rate (90.9% vs 86.7%, P =.75). The actuarial overall survival rates achieved 91.9% for 2-year and 74.9% for 5-year period. T1 tumors showed actuarial 5-year overall survival rates of 80%, compared to 66.7% in T2a tumors. Two patients with T2a tumors and either severe emphysema or bronchiectasis experienced lung toxicity ≥ grade 2, in contrast to T1 patients who only experienced mild toxicities (lower than grade 2). The findings suggest that carbon-ion radiotherapy is effective and safe for peripheral stage I NSCLC; however, further clinical evaluations are needed to confirm its therapeutic efficacy.

We show that differences between the regions lie in how land-surface warming (driven by reduced transpiration) interacts with their climatological atmospheric circulations, regardless of their reliance on evapotranspiration. Various atmosphere-only experiments from two General Circulation Models are used. We find that over New Guinea, land-surface warming amplifies moisture convergence from the ocean and increases rainfall. In the Congo, no clear rainfall changes emerge as the land-surface warming effect is offset by migrations of rainfall. In Amazonia, the interaction of land-surface warming with the climatological circulation pattern leads to a precipitation-change dipole, with reduced rainfall in central and eastern Amazonia and increased rainfall in the west. ©2019.

Air pollution tolerance index (APTI) of these plant species was determined from the measured concentrations of total chlorophyll content (TCC), ascorbic acid (AAC), relative water content (RWC), and pH of the leaf extract. TCC and AAC concentrations in leaves species were determined with UV–visible spectrophotometer. NO2 concentration was determined with Aeroquel (New Zealand), and PM2.5 was determined with Aerocet (USA). The measured NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations at each sampling location were used to establish a relationship with the determined APTI values. The average value of TCC, AAC, and RWC was found much lower in traffic site compared than that of the control site. High pollution stress on plants was also found in traffic sites showing 30% lower APTI values. The plants become sensitive if the APTI value is smaller than or equal to 12 (APTI ≤ 12). However, the average APTI values in different seasons showed a significant variations and followed the sequence—rainy season (8.10) &gt; summer (7.34) &gt; winter (6.69). The plants had the highest sensitivity towards pollutants during winter time. The average APTI values also varied depending on the locations and plant species with a total average of 7.38 ± 1.17, which indicates the sensitivity of plants towards pollution. On average, the measured concentration of NO2 was 223 ± 0.15 μg m−3 and PM2.5 mass was 125.7 ± 0.05 μg m−3. The APTI values showed a strong negative correlation with traffic emitted pollutants NO2 (R2 = 0.86) and PM2.5 (R2 = 0.70) indicating threats towards the plants survival. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Air pollution resistivity; Fine particulate matter; Nitrogen dioxide; Plants sensitivity; Traffic emission","Air pollution; Ascorbic acid; Nitrogen oxides; Water pollution; Artocarpus heterophyllus; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Negative correlation; PM2.5 concentration; Relative water content; Sampling location; Sensitivity studies; Visible spectrophotometers; Plants (botany)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100732167

One of the basic problems is the selection of input data of adequate quality in combination with a uniform configuration of the modeling systems. Simultaneously, the primary aim is to obtain predictions of satisfying accuracy. In the article the results of the evaluation for the CALMET/CALPUFF modeling system in near-field and complex terrain were presented. Research was conducted based on three experimental databases for the dispersion model evaluation, i.e. Martin's Creek (SO2), Lovett (SO2) and Tracy Power Plant (SF6). Each experiment concerned an area characterized by different topography, meteorological conditions, emission source features and the location of tracer substance monitors (SO2, SF6). The aim of the study was to determine the optimal settings for the CALMET/CALPUFF models with regard to the digital elevation model dataset (GTOPO30, SRTM3, NED), grid resolution (ranging from 100 to 4000 m) and the terrain adjustment methods available in the CALPUFF model (MCTADJ = 0, 1, 2 and 3). The results of the CALMET/CALPUFF accuracy evaluation showed, that the use of the digital elevation model (DEM) with a horizontal accuracy of approximately 90 m and a vertical accuracy of 15 m (SRTM3) is sufficient. Application of more accurate data (NED) resulted in comparable model evaluation outcomes. Using both dense and coarse grids resulted in FB and/or FBRHC higher than 0.6. Omitting the terrain adjustment method in the CALPUFF model results in the twofold underestimation of the measurements. The best results of the CALMET/CALPUFF accuracy evaluation for each experiment (|FB| < 0.30, FAC = 1.0, NAD ≤ 0.15, VG < 1.12, IOA > 0.5) were achieved for the grid resolution of 400 m with the use of a partial plume path adjustment method (MCTADJ = 3). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution modeling; Complex terrain; Evaluation of the dispersion model; Grid resolution","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Digital instruments; Dispersions; Geomorphology; Odor control; Sulfur hexafluoride; Surveying; Topography; Air Pollution Modeling; Complex terrains; Digital elevation model; Dispersion modeling; Experimental database; Grid resolution; Meteorological condition; Uniform configurations; Landforms; air quality; atmospheric pollution; complex terrain; digital elevation model; dispersion; meteorology; numerical model; parameterization; pollutant source; pollution monitoring; spatial resolution; topography; accuracy; air quality; Article; atmospheric dispersion; California Meteorological model; California Puff model; data base; environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; geographic and geological parameters; grid resolution; meteorology; nonbiological model; plume; plume dispersion; prediction; priority journal; terrain adjustment method; terrain data; topography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067896508

It is based on a comparative analysis of online survey results conducted among government officials working on climate adaptation in six countries of the region: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica, Paraguay and Uruguay. The article addresses four key issues. First, it identifies some of the critical knowledge deficits (missing or incomplete information) that affect climate adaptation policy making and implementation. Second, it addresses the obstacles and difficulties facing collaborative processes of knowledge production (co-production) between scientists and public policy actors. Third, it analyzes factors affecting knowledge uptake and use by policymakers. Finally, it identifies some of the main knowledge deficits specifically affecting the monitoring and assessment of climate adaptation policies and measures. Overall, the article provides a diagnosis of the main knowledge gaps facing climate adaptation policy in the Latin American countries studied. The results of this diagnosis can serve as input for a research and action agenda aiming to strength the interaction between science and policy on climate adaptation in Latin American countries. Key policy insights The countries covered by the study suffer strong knowledge deficits related to the design, implementation and evaluation of adaptation policy. Collaborative modes of knowledge production in the field of climate adaptation do not tend to sustain over time. Climate change co-production processes tend to be project based, linked to specific initiatives rather than to institutionalized long-term policymaking or planning processes. The fragmentation and lack of integration of the knowledge available on the different aspects of climate adaptation issues deeply affect their usability in policy processes. Weak state capabilities to co-produce, manage and use knowledge in the policy process constitute a main barrier affecting the science-policy interface on climate adaptation issues. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Greenery and water implemented in urban outdoor spaces have been promoted as effective strategies to counteract UHIE while Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) have been identified as convenient solutions to increase resilience to flooding. However, since many SUDS are green-based, they also benefit urban microclimate and outdoor thermal comfort. In this work, the effectiveness of SUDS as passive strategies to simultaneously improve outdoor thermal comfort and reduce stormwater runoff is assessed. The analysis is carried out on a neighbourhood in Ostia (Rome), selected as representative of Mediterranean climate. The case study area is modelled on ENVI-met in three different scenarios: the current condition is compared with two future developments in which green and water-based mitigation strategies are implemented or in which soil sealing continues based on current trend. Moreover, for each scenario, stormwater runoff has been determined using the Soil Conservation Service curve number method. Results show that the implemented mitigation strategies allow achieving improved thermal comfort conditions and at the same time they can reduce runoff. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Drainage; Energy efficiency; Floods; Soil conservation; Soils; Storm sewers; Storms; Thermal comfort; Comfort conditions; Mediterranean climates; Mitigation strategy; Outdoor thermal comfort; Soil conservation service - curve numbers; Storm water runoff; Sustainable urban drainage systems; Urban Heat Island Effects; Runoff",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076255338

For this purpose, a multi-cylinder engine was mapped in stationary conditions using two different combustion modes. First, the engine was tested under the baseline stoichiometric combustion with a spark plug ignition system. Second, the engine map was obtained using a stratified prechamber ignition system under lean conditions. Later, the experimental data was used as input for a computer model that simulates the vehicle operation with both concepts under different driving cycles. To run the model under real-world driving conditions, experimental data was acquired in a specific region in southern Brazil in conditions of heavy and free flow. Moreover, the conditions of the study were extended including two homologation cycles, the FTP-75 and WLTC. The results for the different cycles show similar average exhaust emissions and fuel consumption between WLTC and the real conditions of free flow traffic, and also between the FTP-75 and the real conditions of heavy flow traffic. The results also point out the potential of the prechamber ignition system to achieve a reduction of the engine-out CO and NOx emissions greater than 50% and 85%, respectively, as compared to the baseline stoichiometric combustion with a spark plug ignition, without penalizing the fuel consumption. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Driving cycle; Lean combustion; Pre-chamber; Vehicular application","Commercial vehicles; Fuels; Ignition systems; Spark plugs; Driving cycle; Lean combustion; Multicylinder engine; Pre-chamber; Real-world driving cycles; Real-world drivings; Stationary conditions; Vehicular applications; Ignition; combustion; computer simulation; emission control; exhaust emission; stoichiometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070500248

In the United States, however, skepticism of climate science and political motives remains dominant in much of the country. A common challenge for local government stakeholders in the US is to frame climate policies in terms that are acceptable to citizens in order to overcome politically polarized inaction. We examine why some communities are successful at framing policies as climate change while others are not. We utilize data from a 2012 survey of 232 cities across the US Great Plains region that asks which of 14 mitigation policies and 14 adaptation policies have been adopted within the past decade, and participants identified those policies that were specifically framed as climate change. We test the influence of factors from three clusters of variables: the policy environment, the attitude of local government officials, and the community atmosphere toward climate change, on the propensity to frame climate policies. Results suggest local leadership is sufficient for framing one policy, but community atmosphere eclipses government attitudes and becomes the driving factor in cities where two or more climate policies are explicitly framed as such. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate policy; framing; local government; US Great Plains",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074024067

Furanic biomass derivatives, such as furfural, are substrates with a number of value-added chemical outlets via partial oxidation, most notably furoic acid (FA), a potential precursor to 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA). Pairing such partial oxidations with H2 evolution or other reduction reactions (e.g. CO2) in an electrochemical cell presents an opportunity to perform electrolysis at lowered voltages, while coproducing products that are more valuable than O2. Here, we have utilized differential reactor studies with online electrochemical mass spectrometry (OLEMS), as well as in situ infrared spectroscopy attenuated total reflectance-surface-enhanced infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy (ATR-SEIRAS), to probe the oxidative reaction pathways of furfural on platinum catalysts in acidic electrolyte. We find furfural electro-oxidation selectivity to depend on potential, with the largest shifts corresponding to the transition of Pt to Pt-oxide. Below 1.2 VRHE, FA and 5-hydroxyfuroic acid are the primary products. At higher potential, selectivity shifts predominantly toward 5-hydroxy-furan-2(5H)-one (HFN), with the appearance of maleic acid (MA) as well. ATR-SEIRAS and OLEMS indicate that decomposition and overoxidation to CO2 occurs via decarbonylated or decarboxylated ring intermediates, while MA is less easily activated toward further oxidation once it is formed. Significant oxidative currents are only achieved at potentials where the surface is cleared of CO, which is derived from spontaneous decarbonylation of furfural on the metallic Pt surface. As potential is increased, selectivity to C4 and C5 oxygenates over CO2 is then promoted by a high steady-state surface coverage of organic intermediates that inhibit rapid adsorption and addition of oxygen from the discharge of water. Based on these findings, we propose a reaction pathway and directions for the design of more active and selective electrocatalysts.

Expression of crp increases during pneumonic plague as the pathogen depletes glucose and forms large biofilms within lungs. To better understand control of Y. pestis Crp, we determined a 1.8-Å crystal structure of the protein-cAMP complex. We found that compared to Escherichia coli Crp, C helix amino acid substitutions in Y. pestis Crp did not impact the cAMP dependency of Crp to bind DNA promoters. To investigate Y. pestis Crp-regulated genes during plague pneumonia, we performed RNA sequencing on both wild-type and Δcrp mutant bacteria growing in planktonic and biofilm states in minimal media with glucose or glycerol. Y. pestis Crp was found to dramatically alter expression of hundreds of genes in a manner dependent upon carbon source and growth state. Gel shift assays confirmed direct regulation of the malT and ptsG promoters, and Crp was then linked to Y. pestis growth on maltose as a sole carbon source. Iron regulation genes ybtA and fyuA were found to be indirectly regulated by Crp. A new connection between carbon source and quorum sensing was revealed as Crp was found to regulate production of acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) through direct and indirect regulation of genes for AHL synthetases and receptors. AHLs were subsequently identified in the lungs of Y. pestisinfected mice when crp expression was highest in Y. pestis biofilms. Thus, in addition to the well-studied pla gene, other Crp-regulated genes likely have important functions during plague infection. IMPORTANCE Bacterial pathogens have evolved extensive signaling pathways to translate environmental signals into changes in gene expression. While Crp has long been appreciated for its role in regulating metabolism of carbon sources in many bacterial species, transcriptional profiling has revealed that this protein regulates many other aspects of bacterial physiology. The plague pathogen Y. pestis requires this global regulator to survive in blood, skin, and lungs. During disease progression, this organism adapts to changes within these niches. In addition to regulating genes for metabolism of nonglucose sugars, we found that Crp regulates genes for virulence, metal acquisition, and quorum sensing by direct or indirect mechanisms. Thus, this single transcriptional regulator, which responds to changes in available carbon sources, can regulate multiple critical behaviors for causing disease. © 2019 Ritzert et al.","Biofilms; Catabolite repression; Crp; Cyclic AMP; Plague; Quorum sensing; Regulation of gene expression; RNA-seq; Structure; Threedimensional structure; Yersinia pestis","bacterial protein; carbohydrate; cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP binding protein; glucose; glycerol; iron; maltose; n acylhomoserine lactone; siderophore; synthetase; bacterial protein; cyclic AMP binding protein; amino acid substitution; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial growth; bacterium culture; bacterium mutant; biofilm; biosynthesis; carbohydrate metabolism; carbon source; controlled study; crystal structure; Escherichia coli; fyuA gene; gel mobility shift assay; gene control; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene repression; malT gene; mouse; nonhuman; pla gene; plague; plankton; priority journal; promoter region; protein DNA binding; protein function; protein protein interaction; ptsG gene; quorum sensing; RNA sequence; species comparison; ybtA gene; Yersinia pestis; biofilm; biological model; biology; chemistry; gene ontology; genetics; growth, development and aging; human; metabolism; microbiology; molecular model; physiology; plankton; procedures; protein conformation; Yersinia pestis; Bacterial Proteins; Biofilms; Computational Biology; Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Ontology; Humans; Models, Biological; Models, Molecular; Plague; Plankton; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Conformation; Quorum Sensing; Yersinia pestis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075324621

Much of the reform is occurring on forest land. At the same time, the country has pledged a significant reduction of its greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, two thirds of which is to be achieved from forests. Hence agrarian reform potentially conflicts with emission reduction commitments. This research analyses how the redistribution of forests, with emphasis on the social forestry program, might affect people's livelihoods and Indonesia's capacity to deliver on its climate change commitments. With reference to Central Kalimantan province, we find that the land reform policy has increased the area distributed to local people through the streamlining of processes. However, ambitious targets and hurried distribution of land have posed significant challenges for processes and implementation. They result in partial understanding of the schemes, rights and responsibilities, inappropriate site allocation and types of forestland being distributed, and inadequate consideration for community capacity and local governance. Importantly, the resources allocated to grant these rights have not been accompanied by equal attention to foster subsequent actual land-based livelihood activities and forest protection. Hence the reform's potential to improve local livelihoods and contribute to climate change mitigation in Central Kalimantan is unlikely to be fully realized in the near future. We suggest that careful consideration be given to the processes of distribution, the type of forests being assigned, attention and support to foster implementation, and monitoring and enforcement of regulations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Indonesia; Land reform; Livelihoods; Social forestry","Emission control; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Timber; Climate change mitigation; Emission reduction; Enforcement of regulations; Indonesia; Livelihoods; Research analysis; Rights and responsibilities; Social forestries; Climate change; Borneo; Capacity; Forestry; Forests; Greenhouse Gases; Indonesia; Land; Processes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064599126

Countries with limited forest monitoring capabilities in the tropics and subtropics rely on IPCC 2006 default ∆AGB rates, which are values per ecological zone, per continent. Similarly, research into forest biomass change at a large scale also makes use of these rates. IPCC 2006 default rates come from a handful of studies, provide no uncertainty indications and do not distinguish between older secondary forests and old-growth forests. As part of the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, we incorporate ∆AGB data available from 2006 onwards, comprising 176 chronosequences in secondary forests and 536 permanent plots in old-growth and managed/logged forests located in 42 countries in Africa, North and South America and Asia. We generated ∆AGB rate estimates for younger secondary forests (≤20 years), older secondary forests ('20 years and up to 100 years) and old-growth forests, and accounted for uncertainties in our estimates. In tropical rainforests, for which data availability was the highest, our ∆AGB rate estimates ranged from 3.4 (Asia) to 7.6 (Africa) Mg ha−1 year−1 in younger secondary forests, from 2.3 (North and South America) to 3.5 (Africa) Mg ha−1 year−1 in older secondary forests, and 0.7 (Asia) to 1.3 (Africa) Mg ha−1 year−1 in old-growth forests. We provide a rigorous and traceable refinement of the IPCC 2006 default rates in tropical and subtropical ecological zones, and identify which areas require more research on ∆AGB. In this respect, this study should be considered as an important step towards quantifying the role of tropical and subtropical forests as carbon sinks with higher accuracy; our new rates can be used for large-scale GHG accounting by governmental bodies, nongovernmental organizations and in scientific research. © 2019 The Authors.

Energy generation in particular is responsible for more than 30% of global emissions, where significant focus has been placed on renewable energy generation, including biomass. On the one hand, there are countries, like the UK, where the biomass stock is insufficient to meet the demand; on the other hand, there are countries, like Brazil, where the stock significantly exceeds the demand. To promote a natural symbiosis, it is necessary to take on the challenge of transporting biomass through long distances in an environmentally and economically efficient manner. This paper aims to assess the efficiency of alternative pathways of international biomass supply-chains. The alternatives involve different biomass origin regions, transportation modes, export ports and processing technologies, including torrefaction. Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) has been used for the first time to assess the efficiency of the alternative biomass supply chain pathways in a Latin American context, considering multiple-criteria relating to economic and environmental performance simultaneously, such as the biomass delivered cost, the environmental impact and the fossil energy consumption. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to analyse the robustness of the results under uncertainty in parameter values. The DEA approach presented can assist the process of planning biomass sourcing and improve decision-making under multiple decision criteria. The results can support medium- and long-term strategic decisions for decision- and policy-makers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Brazil; Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Efficiency assessment; International supply chain; Torrefaction","Binary alloys; Data envelopment analysis; Decision making; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Potassium alloys; Sensitivity analysis; Supply chains; Uncertainty analysis; Uranium alloys; Brazil; Economic and environmental performance; Efficiency assessment; Fossil energy consumption; International supply chains; Processing technologies; Renewable energy generation; Torrefaction; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070086273

In particular, convolutional neural networks are used in conjunction with underlying hidden Markov models and hidden semi-Markov models to infer emission distributions. The proposed approaches are tested on heart sound signals from the publicly available PhysioNet dataset, and they are shown to outperform current state-of-the-art segmentation methods by achieving an average sensitivity of 93.9% and an average positive predictive value of 94% in detecting S1 and S2 sounds. © 2013 IEEE.","convolutional neural networks; hidden Markov models; Phonocardiogram; segmentation","Cardiology; Convolution; Heart; Hidden Markov models; Image segmentation; Network architecture; Neural networks; Phonocardiography; Average sensitivities; Convolutional neural network; Emission distribution; Heart sound signal; Hidden semi-Markov models; Phonocardiograms; Positive predictive values; Segmentation methods; Deep neural networks; adoption; article; convolutional neural network; diagnostic test accuracy study; diastole; heart contraction; hidden Markov model; image segmentation; phonocardiography; predictive value; algorithm; factual database; heart sound; human; Markov chain; phonocardiography; physiology; procedures; signal processing; Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Heart Sounds; Humans; Markov Chains; Neural Networks, Computer; Phonocardiography; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074961316

LTNC was performed by encapsulating the alloy together with solid urea in a silica ampoule, evacuated and backfilled with Ar. Upon heat treatment, pyrolysis of the urea generates molecular species that provide carbon and nitrogen to diffuse into the alloy and, at the same time, “activate” the surface for carbon and nitrogen infusion by removing the alloy's native surface oxide and forming a micrometer-scale nitride layer. The treatment generates an outer zone rich in nitrogen and an inner zone rich in carbon. While the outer zone contains nitride precipitates, the inner zone consists of a uniform solution of interstitially dissolved carbon with atom fractions up to 0.035, orders of magnitude higher than the equilibrium solubility limit of carbon in UNS R31538. The treatment increases the surface hardness of UNS R31538 to 16 GPa, twice as high as that of the as-received state. Moreover, it improves the wear resistance (wear-loss volume) and the accompanying acoustic emissions (“squeaking”) by one order of magnitude. Accordingly, surface engineering by LTNC has potential to improve the performance of load-bearing Co–Cr–Mo components, e.g. in medical implants. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biomedical implants; Concentrated interstitial solute; Co–Cr–Mo alloys; Surface engineering; Wear resistance","Acoustic emission testing; Carbon; Heat treatment; Medical applications; Metabolism; Metal implants; Molybdenum alloys; Nitrides; Silica; Temperature; Urea; Wear of materials; Biomedical applications; Biomedical implants; Carbon and nitrogen; Equilibrium solubilities; Interstitial solutes; Nitride precipitates; Orders of magnitude; Surface engineering; Wear resistance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072188252

The coal-based energy structure will significantly increase the carbon emissions of the city itself and those of the neighboring cities. Population density will increase the city’s own carbon emissions but reduce carbon emissions in neighboring cities due to the siphon effect.

The prepared phosphors were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and UV–Vis absorption spectroscopy. The average crystallite size of CaS:Dy phosphors was found to be in the range of 24–27 nm from the XRD measurements. The PL emission spectrum exhibited two prominent peaks at 480 and 572 nm followed by a weak peak at 665 nm which are due to the transition from 4F to 6H states of Dy3+ ions in the CaS host lattice. The values of Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates, yellow to blue intensity ratio (Y/B) and the correlated color temperature (CCT) of the samples were calculated using the PL emission spectra in order to evaluate the emitted light. The CIE coordinates of CaS:Dy nanophosphors were found to be very close to the standard white light point given by (0.333,0.333).

In Brazil, the principles that underpin the National Solid Waste Policy (PNRS) are consistent with those used by developed countries, namely, the polluter-payer and protector-receiver; cooperation among the different spheres of government, the business sector, and other societal segments; and the shared product life-cycle responsibility (Brasil, 2010a; Novi et al., 2013; Santos et al., 2019). In the latter, selective collection and reverse logistics systems are the primary instruments (Zhang et al., 2011). Thus, the general objective of this work is to compare the technical and economic feasibility of four different sectorial agreements for reverse logistics implemented in Brazil. The specific objective is to describe the possible conflicts of interest of the multistakeholders. The sources of evidence used in this multi-case study were interviews, observations, and documentary research in the period from 2016 to 2018. The first result demonstrated that the economic viability of reverse logistics systems are obtained when the wastes have a commercial value after consumption (packaging and consumer electronics) or when industries organize to charge a fee that covers the costs of recycling and transport (lamps and medicines). The second result shows that there are many stakeholders involved in this process: manufacturers and importers, consumers, private waste and recycling companies, and government represented by municipalities, the Ministry of the Environment (MMA), and state environmental agencies (OEMAs). Each one has different interests and responsibilities: government has to preserve the environment and comply with international agreements on climate change, thus creating laws that ultimately burden companies and cities; profit-maximizing companies evaluate these rules as additional costs in their operations, whereas cities, in which operations are conducted, have low financial and managerial capacity. The stakeholder map reveals that there are overlapping roles among agents, with some being the same for all chains, and the constructed power and level of interest matrix indicates the importance of the process to be conducted by the state to align economic and social-environmental interests. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"business development; comparative study; logistics; policy implementation; recycling; solid waste; stakeholder; waste disposal; waste management; Article; Brazil; comparative study; consumer; cost; environmental impact; environmental sanitation; financial management; government; law; persistent organic pollutant; public policy; recycling; responsibility; soil pollution; solid waste management; stakeholder engagement; water contamination; Brazil; city; solid waste; waste disposal; waste management; Brazil; Brazil; Cities; Recycling; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072159952

This question has challenged policy designers since the earliest programs imposing new prices on pollution, and remains a vital question today. This perspective offers insights on strategies for building greater political support for carbon pricing, based on previous experiences with long-running “auction and invest” programs in the U.S. and abroad, including the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), California's carbon pricing system, and the EU emissions trading system (ETS). Three key insights can be derived from those experiences. First: cap and trade with an auction of allowances is an important option for carbon pricing with distinctive advantages. Second, it is important to generate tangible public benefits from a carbon price that are distributed among citizens in a way that is broadly perceived as fair and addresses potential concerns about higher consumer costs for energy. Third, the most effective form of those public benefits should vary predictably across a few clearly defined categories according to local circumstances. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cap and trade; Carbon pricing; Climate change; Climate policy","Carbon; Climate change; Commerce; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; A-carbon; California; Cap and trade; Carbon pricing; Climate policy; EU Emissions Trading Systems; Political support; Costs; climate change; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental policy; European Union; governance approach; policy analysis; pollution tax; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072165214

Adaptation and prediction are thus necessary to reduce the impact of climate change on future societies. The study of past environments and climate change can be used to improve our understanding of future climate scenarios, providing information about how former environments responded under past climatic conditions. Olive (Olea europaea) fruits and oil have a significant place among the Mediterranean culture where cultivation of olive is an important agricultural activity in the region, particularly in Spain, where commercial olive trees cover 2.5 million ha. Thus it is instructive to understand the primary climatic factors controlling past olive production in this area. In this study we present a synthetic record of Olea occurrences based on seven lake and wetland sediment pollen records from the Sierra Nevada area of southern Spain, for the last ~4500 cal yr BP, which could be used to evaluate the natural and anthropogenic variability of Olea in this area, particularly during the last millennia. Comparison of pollen data with paleoclimatic records strongly suggests that natural millennial-scale variability in Olea is controlled in large part by persistent centennial-scale North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) fluctuations. Our fossil data demonstrate that olive cultivation in this area expanded rapidly at ~950 cal yr BP (1000 CE) and its subsequent variability depended on climate conditions. This study also shows that olive oil production since the beginning of the 20th century was conditioned by climate, suggesting that olive oil industry will be affected by the present aridification tendency in the Mediterranean climates areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Cultivation; Forestry; Olive oil; Agricultural activities; Agricultural practices; Future climate projections; Future climate scenarios; Mediterranean climates; Natural environments; North Atlantic oscillations; Paleoclimatic record; Climate change; aridification; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; cultivation; environmental change; evergreen tree; factor analysis; fossil record; human activity; North Atlantic Oscillation; oil production; paleoclimate; species occurrence; Andalucia; Betic Cordillera; Sierra Nevada [Betic Cordillera]; Spain; Olea europaea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070194044

The chemical properties were explored with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) approach and the results confirmed that the cytosine thin film was grown on undoped-InP surface. The electrical properties of MPS were compared with the Au/undoped-InP Schottky junction (SJ) results. Higher barrier height (BH) was achieved for the MPS junction (0.63 eV) than the SJ (0.57 eV), which demonstrates the BH was influenced by the cytosine interlayer. The BH, ideality factor and series resistance of SJ and MPS junction were derived by Chenug's, Norde functions and ΨS-V plot. The derived BH by these three approaches were almost equal with one another that suggests their steadiness and validity. The Poole-Frenkel emission governed the reverse current conduction mechanism in the lower bias region, whereas Schottky emission was ruled in the higher bias region for both the SJ and MPS junction.

In this research, two cases for core of micro sandwich plate is considered that involve five isotropic Devineycell materials (H30, H45, H60, H100 and H200) and an orthotropic material also two cases for facesheets of micro sandwich plate is illustrated that include piezoelectric layers reinforced by carbon and boron-nitride nanotubes and polymeric matrix reinforced by carbon nanotubes under temperature-dependent and hydro material properties on the elastic foundations. The first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) is adopted to model micro sandwich plate and to apply size dependent effects from modified strain gradient theory. The governing equations are derived using the minimum total potential energy principle and then solved by analytical method. Also, the effects of different parameters such as size dependent, side ratio, volume fraction, various material properties for cores and facesheets and temperature and humidity changes on the dimensionless critical buckling load are investigated. It is shown from the results that the dimensionless critical buckling load for boron nitride nanotube is lower than that of for carbon nanotube. It is illustrated that the dimensionless critical buckling load for Devineycell H200 is highest and lowest for H30. Also, the obtained results for micro sandwich plate with piezoelectric facesheets reinforced by carbon nanotubes (case b) is higher than other states (cases a and c).The results of this research can be used in aircraft, automotive, shipbuilding industries and biomedicine.

The proposed idea is based on the better management of road-side units, that collect road information and then have the ability of changing traffic flows in order to exploit less congested roads.

However, the challenge of meeting its targets lies mainly in the intimate relationship between GHG emissions and energy production, which in turn links to industry and economic growth. The Middle East and North African region (MENA), particularly those nations rich oil and gas (O&amp;G) resources, depend on these as a main income source. Persuading the region to cut down on O&amp;G production or reduce its GHG emissions is hugely challenging, as it is so vital to its economic strength. In this paper, an alternative option is established by creating an economic link between GHG emissions, measured as their CO2 equivalent (CO2e), and the earning of profits through the concept of Social Carbon Cost (SCC). The case study is a small coastal city in Libya where 6% of electricity is assumed to be generated from renewable sources. At times when renewable energy (RE) output exceeds the demand for power, the surplus is used for powering the production of hydrogen by electrolysis, thus storing the energy and creating an emission-free fuel. Two scenarios are tested based on short and long term SCCs. In the short term scenario, the amount of fossil fuel energy saved matches the renewable energy produced, which equates to the same amount of curtailed O&amp;G production. The O&amp;G-producing region can earn profits in two ways: (1) by cutting down CO2 emissions as a result of a reduction in O&amp;G production and (2) by replacing an amount of fossil fuel with electrolytically-produced hydrogen which creates no CO2 emissions. In the short term scenario, the value of SCC saved is nearly 39% and in the long term scenario, this rose to 83%. © 2019","Central electrolyser; Economic benefits; Middle East and North Africa; Social carbon cost; Surplus renewable energy","Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Profitability; Carbon costs; Economic benefits; Electrolysers; Middle East and North Africa; Renewable energies; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065961809

Currently, the bottom area of hypoxic areas can approach 23,000 km2, and the volume, 140 km3.

Compared to rainforest conversion, this alternative land use change reduces net ecosystem carbon losses by 99.7 ± 9.6%. Soil organic carbon (SOC) decreased until 36 years after conversion, due to a fast decomposition of pasturederived carbon, counterbalancing the carbon gains in OP biomass.

In the solar system, the Earth's obliquity is stabilized by interactions with our moon, and the resulting small amplitude variations (∼2.°4) are beneficial for advanced life. Most Sun-like stars have at least one stellar companion, and the habitability of circumstellar exoplanets is shaped by their stellar companion. We show that a stellar companion can dramatically change whether Earth-like obliquity stability is possible through planetary orbital precession relative to the binary orbit or resonant pumping of the obliquity through spin-orbit interactions. We present a new formalism for the planetary spin precession that accounts for orbital misalignments between the planet and binary. Using numerical modeling in Centauri AB, we show the following: There is a stark contrast between the planetary obliquity variations depending on the host star, planetary neighbors limit the possible spin states for Earth-like obliquity stability, and the presence of a moon can destabilize the obliquity, defying our Earth-based expectations. An Earth-like rotator orbiting the primary star would experience small obliquity variations for 87%, 74%, or 54% of solar-Type binaries, depending on the mass of the primary (0.8, 1.0, or 1.2 M o&amp;dot;, respectively). Thus, Earth-like planets likely experience much larger obliquity variations, with more extreme climates, unless they are in specific states, such as orbiting nearly planar with the binary and rotating retrograde (backward) like Venus. © 2019.

We review how climate change will alter PSFs and their potential consequences for ecosystem functioning. Climate change influences PSFs through the performance of interacting species and altered community composition resulting from changes in species distributions. Climate change thus affects plant inputs into the soil subsystem via litter and rhizodeposits and alters the composition of the living plant roots with which mutualistic symbionts, decomposers, and their natural enemies interact. Many of these plant-soil interactions are species-specific and are greatly affected by temperature, moisture, and other climate-related factors. We make a number of predictions concerning climate change effects on PSFs and consequences for vegetation-soil-climate feedbacks while acknowledging that they may be context-dependent, spatially heterogeneous, and temporally variable.

Six years of measurement of air pollutants was conducted from 2005 to 2010 in Shangdianzi (SDZ) regional background station. During the study period, the annual average concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide and ozone (Ox), and fine particle matter less than or equal to 2.5 μm (PM2.5) range from 15.7 to 20.0 μg/m3, 577.7 to 856.0 μg/m3, 90.4 to 101.8 μg/m3, and 39.8 to 62.4 μg/m3, respectively. In this work, Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) and Trajectory Sector Analysis (TSA) methods are applied to identify locations of sources and their relatively contribution of air pollutants at SDZ. PSCF analysis shows that central Inner Mongolia, north Shanxi, west and south Hebei, and west Liaoning are all potential sources of SO2. The North China Plain (NCP) region, especially south Hebei and north Shandong, are major potential source regions for CO, Ox, and PM2.5. Therefore, reducing anthropogenic emissions from the coal industry, biomass burning, agricultural activities, and vehicles in these areas could be an effective way of controlling air pollution at SDZ. Based on the TSA results, the contributions of SO2, CO, Ox, and PM2.5 from long-distance transport are 5.5 μg/m3, 301.4 μg/m3, 14.8 μg/m3, and 25.8 μg/m3, accounting for approximately 22.6%, 32.3%, 13.1%, and 37.5% of the respective air pollutant concentrations at SDZ. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Background station; potential source region; PSCF; transported contribution; TSA","Agricultural robots; Air pollution; Carbon monoxide; Coal industry; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Agricultural activities; Air pollutant concentrations; Annual average concentration; Background station; Potential source contribution function; Potential source regions; PSCF; transported contribution; Air pollution control; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; background level; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution control; sulfur dioxide; agricultural procedures; air pollutant; air pollution control; biomass; China; coal mining; concentration (parameter); environmental protection; motor vehicle; natural resource; particulate matter; air pollution; environmental monitoring; season; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047257307

However, spatial heterogeneity in these “blue carbon” stocks among and within habitats has only recently been examined, despite its considerable implications. Seagrass meadows have potential to store significant amounts of carbon in their sediments, yet studies comparing sediment OC content at regional and meadow scales remain sparse. Here, we collected sediment cores from six temperate eelgrass (Zostera marina) meadows on the coast of British Columbia, Canada, to quantify sediment OC stocks, accumulation rates, and sources, and to examine local and regional drivers of variability. Sediment OC content was highly variable—across all sites, stocks in the top 0–5 cm ranged from 83 to 1089 g OC m−2, while the 15–20 cm stocks exhibited a 24-fold difference, from 59 to 1407 g OC m−2. Carbon accumulation rates ranged from 4 to 33 g OC m−2 yr−1. Isotopic mixing models revealed that sediment OC was primarily terrestrial carbon (41.3%) and canopy-forming kelps (33.3%), with a smaller contribution of eelgrass (25.3%). Here, we show that regional variability in OC content exceeds meadow-scale variability. This result is likely driven by landscape factors, most notably relative water motion, representing a more dominant control on seagrass OC accumulation than meadow-scale factors such as canopy complexity. These findings elicit caution when scaling up seagrass meadow OC content and demonstrate that measures of the hydrodynamic environment could improve estimates of carbon storage in temperate soft sediment habitats. © 2019 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography",,"carbon sequestration; climate change; heterogeneity; meadow; organic carbon; seagrass meadow; British Columbia; Canada; Laminariales; Zostera marina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072783147

A simulation model of the railway system was built and implemented using SIMUL8 computer software. The results from the simulation model suggest that the railway line is being under-utilised. These low utilisation levels of the line presented a case to propose three scenarios that has the potential to carry urban freight by rail through Lichfield Trent Valley to Birmingham New Street Station. The total number of services operated on the line is varied between different scenarios. The proposed three scenarios could not only exploit the existing railway infrastructure by improving the utilisation levels of the currently operating railway line, but also proved to reduce an amount of green-house gases (GHGs) emissions that are caused by heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) moving on the road. After simulating all the proposed scenarios in the SIMUL8 simulation software and analysing the results, scenario number 3 seemed to be the best replacement to the actual system as it presents a case to increase the number of train services running per day by in the line by 108 and causing a drastic improvement in the utilisation levels by an increase of 341.71% to that of the actual system. This proposed system has the potential to eliminate 5400 HGVs moving on the road per day that causes a reduction of CO2 gas by approximately 5.4%.

Episodic accretion plays an important role in the evolution of young stars. Although it has been under investigation for a long time, the origin of such episodic accretion events is not yet understood. Aims. We investigate the dust and gas emission of a sample of young outbursting sources in the infrared to get a better understanding of their properties and circumstellar material, and we use the results in a further work to model the objects. Methods. We used Herschel data, from our PI program of 12 objects and complemented with archival observations to obtain the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and spectra of our targets. We report here the main characteristics of our sample, focussing on the SED properties and on the gas emission lines detected in the PACS and SPIRE spectra. Results. The SEDs of our sample show the diversity of the outbursting sources, with several targets showing strong emission in the far-infrared from the embedded objects. Most of our targets reside in a complex environment, which we discuss in detail. We detected several atomic and molecular lines, in particular rotational CO emission from several transitions from J = 38-37 to J = 4-3. We constructed rotational diagrams for the CO lines, and derived in three domains of assumed local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) temperatures and column densities, ranging mainly between 0-100 K and 400-500 K. We confirm correlation in our sample between intense CO J = 16-15 emission and the column density of the warm domain of CO, N(warm). We notice a strong increase in luminosity of HH 381 IRS and a weaker increase for PP 13 S, which shows the beginning of an outburst. © ESO 2019.","Accretion, accretion disks; Infrared: stars; Protoplanetary disks; Stars: formation; Stars: pre-main sequence; Stars: protostars","Gas emissions; Circumstellar materials; Column density; Complex environments; Embedded object; Emission lines; Local thermodynamic equilibrium; Molecular lines; Spectral energy distribution; Stars",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103656472

A transverse crack formed in the flange neck close to a non-post-weld-heat-treated butt weld, just outside the heat-affected zone (i.e. in the sub-critical region). Although the main factor in the failure was a recent increase in hydrogen partial pressure that placed the operating conditions above the pre-2016 API 941 Nelson curve for carbon steel, there were some pre-existing/dormant contributing factors, namely lack of post-weld heat treatment, bending stress on the piping, the presence of H2S in the process fluid, coarse ferrite-pearlite microstructure (i.e. the grain size effect) and some impurities in the vintage steel. An interesting observation was that the grain boundaries were decorated with a film of light-etching phase that was identified to be cementite by electron backscatter diffraction as opposed to being ferrite that could form upon internal decarburization (i.e. pearlite decomposition). An explanation is provided for the formation of cementite along the grain boundaries.

As cities attempt bold environmental action, understanding how these conflicts play out is crucial. This study uses Deborah Stone's theory of policy paradox combined with insights from sustainability policy and discards studies literatures to analyze how policy makers respond to competing interests and values in the case of waste management in Washington DC. Though DC policy actors agree about the need for sustainability, stakeholders have clashed repeatedly over the city's reliance on waste-to-energy (WTE) incineration for disposal. I argue that WTE in DC can best be understood as a ‘sustainability policy paradox’: a policy paradox that results not only from predictable tensions between environmental and economic interests, but conflicts between environmental objectives that surface in the contemporary context of technocratic uncertainty, the neoliberal state, and climate change. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Municipal sustainability policy; municipal waste management; policy paradox; waste-to-energy (WTE)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074036264

In order to manage the limited availability of renewable sources and to meet users’ requirements, a proper scheduling of both tasks and storage activities is needed. Moreover, the difficulty of storing energy on a large scale represents an opportunity for the micro-grid actors to collaborate for better balancing energy supply and demand. Collaboration may be achieved through the application of suitable energy management policies tackling the specific consumers’ needs. We address the Energy Management Problem in a micro-grid with collaboration among users. Specifically, a building is considered where each apartment can use both Shared and Local energy resources, the former managed by a Building Manager (BM). The problem is formulated through Bi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming, maximizing both the BM and the apartments’ profits and solved through the Augmented ϵ-Constraint approach.

Diesel exhaust emissions including particle number concentration and size distribution along with the particles’ chemical composition and NOx were investigated from a Euro 4 passenger car with a comprehensive set of high time-resolution instruments. The emissions were compared with three fuel standards – European diesel (EN590), Indian diesel (BS IV) and Finnish renewable diesel (Neste MY) – over the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC). Fuel properties and driving conditions strongly affected exhaust emissions. The exhaust particulate mass emissions for all fuels consisted of BC (81–88%) with some contribution from organics (11–18%) and sulfate (0–3%). As aromatic-free fuel, the MY diesel produced around 20% lower black carbon (BC) emissions compared to the EN590 and 29–40% lower compared to the BS IV. High volatile nanoparticle concentrations at high WLTC speed conditions were observed with the BS IV and EN590 diesel, but not with the sulfur-free MY diesel. These nanoparticles were linked to sulfur-driven nucleation of new particles in cooling dilution of the exhaust. For all the fuels non-volatile nanoparticles in sub-10 nm particle sizes were observed during engine braking, and they were most likely formed from lubricant-oil-originated compounds. With all the fuels, the measured particulate and NOx emissions were significantly higher during the WLTC cycle compared to the NEDC cycle. This study demonstrated that renewable diesel fuels enable mitigations of particulate and climate-warming BC emissions of traffic, and will simultaneously help tackle urban air quality problems. © 2019 Metropolia University of Applied Sciences","Black carbon; Combustion; New European Driving Cycle; Renewable fuel; Traffic emissions; Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle","Air quality; Biodiesel; Combustion; Diesel engines; Greenhouse gases; Nanoparticles; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Black carbon; New european driving cycles; Renewable fuels; Test cycles; Traffic emissions; Fossil fuels; air quality; black carbon; chemical composition; combustion; cooling; diesel engine; fossil fuel; nanoparticle; size distribution; thermodynamics; traffic emission; urban pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070211798

Despite the increase of 6°C expected in the next 60 years in South America, numerous vertebrates are still considered as ‘Least Concern’ species by the IUCN due to their large distribution, insufficient widespread threats and insignificant population decline. One example is the lizard Tropidurus torquatus (Squamata: Tropiduridae), commonly found thermoregulating in anthropic environments throughout the Brazilian Cerrado, but restricted to gallery forests in the equator-ward localities. The urban areas in this warmer region have been colonised by other closely related congeners (e.g. Tropidurus oreadicus). This study aimed to understand this divergence of habitat selection by these tropirudids that may explain some of the species responses to past and future climate warming. We collected body temperatures (Tb), micro-environmental temperatures (Ta) and operative (Te) temperatures in four sites along a latitudinal gradient: a pole-ward and two central sites where T. torquatus inhabit urban areas and one equator-ward site where T. torquatus and T. oreadicus occur in the gallery forest and in urban microhabitats, respectively. All three populations of T. torquatus present similar Tb (35.5–36°C) and shared microhabitats with a similar Ta (34–37.3°C). The Te in the equator-ward urban site was considerably higher than in the gallery forest. Tropidurus oreadicus Tb was 38.2 °C (30.1–41.3°C) and was active at a Ta of 30.5–42.3°C. The overlap between the genus Tb, Ta and Te highlights a decrease in the hours of activity that lizards would experience under climate warming. The reduction of hours of activity together with the devastation of natural habitats represents threats and an alarming scenario especially for the equator-ward populations. © 2019 Ecological Society of Australia","conservation; global warming; lizards; thermal ecology; thermoregulation","cerrado; climate change; conservation status; global warming; habitat selection; latitudinal gradient; lizard; microhabitat; Red List; thermoregulation; urban ecosystem; urban site; Brazil; Squamata; Tropidurinae; Tropidurus oreadicus; Tropidurus torquatus; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068501534

It was found that the smog caused by forest fires, open-air burning, and smog emissions from vehicles has been the problems in northern Thailand. Furthermore, the level of particulate matter smaller than 10 microns (PM10) could rise to 383 micrograms per cubic meter of air in some years. This level exceeded by three times the air quality standards of Thailand with a 24-hour average level of 120 micrograms per cubic meter of air. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to study and develop the instruments, methods, and implementations in reducing the effects of climate change by constructing perception and collaboration in decreasing the effects of climate change through STEM Education with undergraduate students. The participants of this study were 67 students majoring in Industrial and Technological Education at Chiang Mai Rajabhat University who had the pre-service student teaching practicum experience in the academic year 2018. The participants of this study could be role models for knowledge management and publicize the knowledge of reducing catastrophic effects of smog among primary and secondary school students, school staff and communities and give aid when an emergency occurred. There were 40 schools in northern Thailand participating in this research project. With reference to the research findings, they revealed that before participating in this research project, the 67 students had knowledge of catastrophes caused by climate change in northern Thailand at a level of 45 percent on average, while their knowledge increased to 88 percent after taking part in this project. In other words, their knowledge increased by 43 percent or there was a significant increase in knowledge to 95 percent. It can be concluded that the students in this study could create a role model of knowledge management, distribute information on how to decrease catastrophe from the smog, and give help efficiently to the 40 schools participating in this research project when there was an emergency (without significant difference). © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

This paper highlights the disconnect between how planners and academics are approaching the task of planning and managing the urban forest for climate change adaptation. Although planners tend to focus on maximizing canopy coverage, academics utilize microclimate simulation to evaluate the impact of different interventions on heat island mitigation. We argue that while the i-Tree suite is the most commonly used tool and is immensely helpful for urban forest planners, cities and communities concerned with heat island mitigation should also leverage microclimate simulation tools to better understand the likely impacts of a plan. This study provides a general critique of the i-Tree tool for planning and illustrates how, when used with a microclimate simulation tool, the siting of street trees can have a greater impact on heat island mitigation. The focus here is on the community-scale impact of trees and a microclimate simulation model of a neighborhood in Chicago, Illinois where tree canopy coverage is less than 10% and consistently declining is presented. We find that when microclimate is considered during the tree siting process, trees have a greater impact on surface and air temperatures during the summer. Reduced ground surface temperatures of around 3 ℃ to 7.5 ℃ were achieved around 13:00 (1:00 pm), whereas the impact of trees from shading had the greatest impact (0.75 ℃ to 7.75 ℃) on nearby buildings in the mid-afternoon (15:00 to 17:00 h). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chicago; Climate adaptation; Microclimate simulation; Urban greening; Urban heat islands","adaptive management; climate change; heat island; microclimate; neighborhood; urban forestry; urban planning; Chicago; Illinois; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070314433

While this goal responds to calls to strengthen global governance of adaptation, it has not yet been operationalized. Further, few studies take stock of current global adaptation governance to inform the implementation of the goal. Against this background this review asks: To what extent is there global governance of climate change adaptation? Can it be characterized as a strong domain of global governance? In what ways is it contested? Global adaptation governance is defined here as occurring when state and non-state actors in the global (including transnational) sphere authoritatively and intentionally shape the actions of constituents towards climate change adaptation as a public goal. Although empirical evidence is scant, it is proposed here that global adaptation governance is indeed emerging. Yet, its further strengthening appears contested. First, measurement of progress towards adaptation as a public goal at the global level is severely challenged by the ambiguity of adaptation and the lack of distinct metrics. Second, the lack of a clear global-level problem-framing, or recognition of adaptation as a global public good, has meant limited legitimacy of global governance initiatives. A consequence of contestation is that governance forms and functions used so far have not been authoritative in how they seek to shape actions. The review concludes by identifying research needs for advancing science and policy on adaptation.

The high roughness of the Cu oxides used in previous studies on this matter adds complexity to this controversy and motivated us to prepare quasi-planar Cu2O thin films that displayed a CO2 reduction selectivity similar to that of oxide-derived copper catalysts reported in previous studies. Most importantly, when the post-mortem thin films were transferred for characterization in an air-free environment, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements confirmed their complete reduction in the course of the CO2 reduction reaction. Thus, our results indicate that the selectivity of the Cu oxides featured in previous studies stems from their enhanced roughness, highlighting the importance of controlled sample transfer upon post-mortem characterization with ex situ techniques. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Grasslands in the NGP are no longer self-regulating adaptive systems. The challenges to these grasslands are widespread and serious (e.g. climate change, invasive species, fragmentation, altered disturbance regimes, and anthropogenic chemical loads). Because the challenges facing the region are dynamic, complex, and persistent, a paradigm shift in how we approach restoration and management of the grasslands in the NGP is imperative. The goal of this article is to highlight four key points for land managers and restoration practitioners to consider when planning management or restoration actions. First, we discuss the appropriateness of using historical fidelity as a restoration or management target because of changing climate, widespread pervasiveness of invasive species, the high level of fragmentation, and altered disturbance regimes. Second, we highlight ecosystem resilience and long-term population persistence as alternative targets. Third, because the NGP is so heavily impacted with anthropogenic chemical loading, we discuss the risks of ecological traps and extinction debt. Finally, we highlight the importance of using adaptive management and having patience during restoration and management. Consideration of these four points will help management and restoration of grasslands move toward a more successful and sustainable future. Although we specifically focus on the NGP of North America, these same issues and considerations apply to grasslands and many other ecosystems globally. © 2019 Society for Ecological Restoration This article has been contributed to by US Government employees and their work is in the public domain in the USA.","adaptive management; anthropogenic chemicals; fragmentation; invasion; prairie; restoration","adaptive management; anthropogenic source; ecosystem resilience; habitat fragmentation; invasive species; paradigm shift; prairie; restoration ecology; sustainability; Great Plains",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075016874

New combinations of unit operations and possibly novel reactors will likely be required to economically convert biomass feedstock into partially upgraded bio-crudes. While some techno-economic assessments show that biofuels from fast pyrolysis may be competitive with petroleum fuels in future, conventional pyrolysis produces a poor quality bio-crude and is only suitable for dry, homogenous feedstock such as woody biomass, agricultural waste (corn stoves, wheat stalk, and rice husk). It is desirable to produce high-quality bio-crudes and to be able to process high-moisture feedstock such as algae, organic waste (food residues), bio-solids and bio-sludge into transportation fuels using the liquefaction approaches. Increased awareness of the environmental damage from burning fossil fuels is driving national and international reduction targets for on CO2 emissions. Liquefaction technologies aimed at producing alternatives to fossil-based transportation fuels/hydrocarbons are likely to receive continued support in the future and the most promising ones could be developed to full commercial scale. This review provides a summary of the current state of development of these technologies and also some of the challenges faced to develop commercially viable transportation fuels via liquefaction routes. This review compares liquefaction routes and provides a summary of techno-economic analyses where data is available and discusses the challenges and opportunities associated with commercial scale-up. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuels; Biomass; Catalysis; Liquefaction; Process development","Agricultural wastes; Biomass; Catalysis; Crude oil; Economic analysis; Feedstocks; Hydrocarbons; Liquefaction; Pyrolysis; Transportation routes; Fossil-based transportation fuels; Hydrothermal liquefactions; Liquid hydrocarbon fuel; Process development; Techno-Economic analysis; Techno-economic assessment; Thermochemical method; Transportation fuels; Biofuels",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072609142

Even traditional public transit is being overhauled by employing similar strategies, leading to the introduction of new services such as on-demand public transit (ODPT). ODPT links a geographical area using a fleet of vehicles that operate with flexible routes and timetables as opposed to its' fixed route and timetable counterparts. Further, strict regulations on reducing the carbon footprint has enforced transport operators to rely on electric vehicle (EV) fleets in public transit. However, in addition to the requirement to compute routes and schedules in real-time for ODPT services, EVs also impose constraints due to reduced driving ranges. This necessitates highly responsive real-time algorithms to cater for the significantly larger number of computations. To this end, we propose a hybrid methodology, which exploits parallel computing techniques using a clustering algorithm to decompose a large problem into smaller sub-problems, which are subsequently solved using a genetic algorithm. The result obtained from this step is used as an initial solution in a global optimization stage to further improve the quality of results. Experiments using the actual road network show that the proposed method not only improves speed of computation but also the quality of results compared to the state-of-the-art. © 2019 IEEE.","electric vehicles; genetic algorithm; hybrid systems; intelligent transportation systems; modelling; shortest path; vehicle mile traveled","Agricultural robots; Carbon footprint; Fleet operations; Genetic algorithms; Global optimization; Intelligent systems; Robotics; Scheduling; Urban transportation; Fleet of vehicles; Geographical area; Hybrid methodologies; Parallel computing techniques; Personal transportation; Quality of results; Real time algorithms; Transport operators; Clustering algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085861540

Drivers adds virtual living states of aquatic products to the real driving environments through augmented reality technology to help themselves control oxygen contents and temperatures, and choose distribution routes. Furthermore, the effectiveness of carbon emission policy is investigated by simulating the impact of the policy on the distribution operations. In the simulation, the carriers take the minimization of overall costs of the distribution operations as the objective. In order to meet the requirements of carbon emission policies, factors of customer demands, road lengths and road congestion are used to determine the distribution. The simulation is implemented based on genetic algorithm: total costs are used as fitness values, and distribution sequences are encoded into chromosomes. And the carbon emission price is introduced as a operating parameter. Through running the simulation, we obtained the overall costs, carbon emission amounts and carbon emission costs. And a linear equation are fitted on the output data passed the reliability test. Based on the linear equation, it is concluded that the increase of the carbon emission price is helpful in reducing carbon emission amount, but it would greatly increase the operation costs of the carriers. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Aquatic product; Augmented reality; Carbon emission policy; Carbon emission price; Genetic algorithm","Augmented reality; Automobile drivers; Costs; Genetic algorithms; Linear equations; Roads and streets; Aquatic products; Augmented reality technology; Carbon emission prices; Carbon emissions; Distribution operations; Distribution route; Operating parameters; Parallel simulations; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044515009

We investigated the assumption that either multiple drought years occurring during a short period (multiyear droughts), or droughts occurring during the recovery period from previous drought (compounded droughts), are detrimental to subsequent growth. There is evidence that drought responses may vary among populations of widespread species, leading us to examine regional differences in responses of the conifer Pinus ponderosa to historic drought frequency in the western United States. More frequent drought conditions incurred additional growth declines and shifts in growth–climate sensitivities in the years following drought relative to single-drought events, with ‘triple-droughts' being worse than ‘double-droughts'. Notably, prediction skill was not strongly reduced when ignoring compounded droughts, a consequence of the temporally comprehensive formulation of our stochastic antecedent model that accounts for the climatic memory of tree growth. We argue that incorporating drought-induced temporal variability in tree growth sensitivities can aid inference gained from statistical models, where more simplistic models could overestimate the severity of drought legacies. We also found regional differences in response to repeated drought, and suggest plastic post-drought sensitivities and climatic memory may represent beneficial physiological adjustments in interior regions. Within-species variability may thus mediate forest responses to increasing drought frequency under future climate change, but experimental approaches using more species are necessary to improve our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie drought legacy effects on tree growth. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","disturbance; hydraulic failure; ITRDB; memory; NSC; pervasive; plasticity; repeat; SAM; tree-ring","coniferous forest; drought stress; environmental disturbance; forest ecosystem; hydraulics; plasticity; stochasticity; temporal variation; tree ring; United States; Coniferophyta; Pinus ponderosa; climate change; drought; ecosystem; forest; ponderosa pine; tree; United States; Climate Change; Droughts; Ecosystem; Forests; Pinus ponderosa; Trees; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068528577

However, few of the previous studies have focused on whether or not environmental regulations can potentially influence carbon emissions through technical efficiency. Therefore, the present study chose to investigate the mediation effects of the technical efficiencies between environmental regulations and carbon emissions using the provincial panel data of energy-intensive industries for the period ranging from 2005 to 2015. The results were as follows: (i) In regard to the entire group of energy-intensive industries, it was found that environmental regulations could not only potentially directly reduce carbon emissions, but also indirectly reduce carbon emissions through technical efficiency. In other words, technical efficiency had played a partial mediation role between the environmental regulations and the carbon emissions; (ii) It was observed that for the different subdivided energy-intensive industries, the different levels of technical efficiency had shown various mediation effects. For example, the mediation effects of technical efficiency in the petroleum processing and coking (PPC) industry; papermaking and paper products (PPP) industry, and raw chemical materials and chemical products (RCMCP) industry, were found to be similar to those of the whole energy-intensive industries. Furthermore, the “Porter Hypothesis” had been verified in the nonmetal mineral products (NMP) industry. However, there were no mediation effects observed in the smelting and pressing of ferrous metals (SPFM) and smelting and pressing of nonferrous metals (SPNM) industries; (iii) In this study, in accordance with the regression results of the double-threshold models, it was found that for the energy-intensive industries as a whole, the carbon emission reduction effects of environmental regulations had become stronger with the increases in technical efficiency. For the PPP and RCMCP industries, there was an inverted U-shaped relationship observed between environmental regulations and carbon emissions when the technical efficiency was taken as the threshold variable. Therefore, based on the research conclusions achieved in this study, some policy recommendations were put forward. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Energy-intensive industry; Environmental regulation; Mediation effect; Technical efficiency","Emission control; Energy efficiency; Mineral industry; Petroleum industry; Smelting; Telecommunication industry; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; Energy intensive industries; Hot research topics; Mediation effect; Petroleum processing; Policy recommendations; Technical efficiency; Environmental regulations; Carbon; Efficiency; Energy; Environmental Regulations; Metals; Paper Products; Research; Smelting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068741069

A series of concrete mixtures with various replacement ratios of primary resources with recycled ones were prepared for this study. The mechanical properties of concrete mixtures were examined and were used for the design of structural elements in the same utilized properties. The two use cycles of a structural element were compared using life cycle assessment (LCA). In the first use cycle, the LCA of the structural element containing only primary raw materials was assessed. In the second use cycle, the LCA of a structural element in which primary materials were partially replaced by recycled ones was assessed. The obtained results confirm the potential use of high-quality recycled aggregate originating from local sources in some applications in building structures. Furthermore, the environmental assessment indicates the benefits of using recycled materials, such as environmental savings, especially the reduction of primary resource use, embodied energy, and embodied emissions, as well as reduction of the pressure on landfill sites. © 2019 by the authors.","Construction and demolition waste; Environmental savings; LCA; Raw material savings; Recycled aggregate concrete; Recycled concrete aggregate; Recycled concrete powder","aggregate; concrete; demolition; environmental assessment; landfill; life cycle analysis; recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074818560

Integral to any approaches to promote carbon sequestering practices in managed soils are reliable, accurate and cost-effective means to quantify soil C stock changes and forecast soil C responses to different management, climate and edaphic conditions. While technology to accurately measure soil C concentrations and stocks has been in use for decades, many challenges to routine, cost-effective soil C quantification remain, including large spatial variability, low signal-to-noise and often high cost and standardization issues for direct measurement with destructive sampling. Models, empirical and process-based, may provide a cost-effective and practical means for soil C quantification to support C sequestration policies. Examples are described of how soil science and soil C quantification methods are being used to support domestic climate change policies to promote soil C sequestration on agricultural lands (cropland and grazing land) at national and provincial levels in Australia and Canada. Finally, a quantification system is outlined–consisting of well-integrated data-model frameworks, supported by expanded measurement and monitoring networks, remote sensing and crowd-sourcing of management activity data–that could comprise the core of a new global soil information system. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Maximum number of faults in power system occurs in the distribution network. Protection of distribution network is dominated by overcurrent (OC) protection application. With the intention to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, different types and size of renewable energy (RE) sources are now integrating into the power grid and most of these distributed generators (DG) are connecting near the load. These small scale distributed RE sources are effectively supporting the local loads and supplying excess electricity to the main grid. Most popular RE sources are solar and wind. When these sources generate at its peak capacity, the local load demand may remain less and therefore most of the generated electricity goes to the grid. OC relays placed at the upstream of the distribution line are set based on the current value through the line. Once this level of current value changes the performance of the OC relay may face challenges.

Therefore, understanding those mechanisms and their main drivers becomes crucial to optimize this waste treatment biotechnology. In this study, seven batch experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of increasing the initial total solids in high-solids anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste. With inoculum-to-substrate ratio = 1.5 g VS/g VS and maximum total solids ≤ 19.6%, mono-digestion of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste showed a methane yield = 174–236 NmL CH4/g VS. With inoculum-to-substrate ratio ≤ 1.0 g VS/g VS and maximum total solids ≥ 24.0%, mono-digestion experiments acidified. Co-digestion of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste and beech sawdust permitted to reduce the inoculum-to-substrate ratio to 0.16 g VS/g VS while increasing total solids up to 30.2%, though achieving a lower methane yield (117–156 NmL CH4/g VS). At each inoculum-to-substrate ratio, higher total solids corresponded to higher ammonia and volatile fatty acid accumulation. Thus, a 40% lower methane yield for mono-digestion was observed at a NH3 concentration ≥ 2.3 g N–NH3/kg reactor content and total solids = 15.0%. Meanwhile, co-digestion lowered the nitrogen content, being the risk of acidification exacerbated only at total solids ≥ 20.0%. Therefore, the biodegradability of the substrate, as well as the operational total solids and inoculum-to-substrate ratio, are closely interrelated parameters determining the success of methanogenesis, but also the risk of ammonia inhibition in high-solids anaerobic digestion. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Batch experiments; Co-digestion; High-solids anaerobic digestion; Methane yield; Organic fraction of municipal solid waste; Thermophilic; Volatile fatty acids","Ammonia; Biodegradability; Economic and social effects; Methane; Municipal solid waste; Volatile fatty acids; Batch experiments; Codigestion; High-solids anaerobic digestion; Methane Yield; Organic fraction of municipal solid wastes; Thermophilic; Anaerobic digestion; ammonia; anaerobic digestion; biodegradation; fatty acid; inhibition; inoculation; methane; methanogenesis; microbial activity; municipal solid waste; physicochemical property; thermophilic bacterium; trade-off; Fagus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061488051

First, we construct a taxonomy of six inter-related forms of invisibility (social marginalization, forced invisibility by migrants, spatial marginalization, neglected diseases, mental health, uneven climatic monitoring and forecasting) which underlie systematic biases in current understanding of these risks in Latin America, and advocate an approach to climate-health research that draws on intersectionality theory to address these inter-relations. We propose that these invisibilities should be understood as outcomes of structural imbalances in power and resources rather than as haphazard blindspots in scientific and state knowledge. Our thesis, drawing on theories of governmentality, is that context-dependent tensions condition whether or not benefits of making vulnerable populations legible to the state outweigh costs. To be seen is to be politically counted and eligible for rights, yet evidence demonstrates the perils of visibility to disempowered people. For example, flood-relief efforts in remote Amazonia expose marginalized urban river-dwellers to the traumatic prospect of forced relocation and social and economic upheaval. Finally, drawing on research on citizenship in post-colonial settings, we conceptualize climate change as an ‘open moment’ of political rupture, and propose strategies of social accountability, empowerment and trans-disciplinary research which encourage the marginalized to reach out for greater power. These achievements could reduce drawbacks of state legibility and facilitate socially-just governmental action on climate change adaptation that promotes health for all. © 2019 The Authors","Bias; Climatic extremes; Governmentality; Healthcare; Inequity; Justice; Marginalization; Rights","climate change; extreme event; governance approach; health care; health risk; health services; marginalization; social justice; vulnerability; climate change; controlled study; geographic distribution; health hazard; human; human impact (environment); mental health; migrant; neglected disease; pollution monitoring; public health; Review; risk assessment; social exclusion; health care delivery; health care disparity; mental health service; resource allocation; social determinants of health; vulnerable population; Latin America; Climate Change; Health Services Accessibility; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Mental Health Services; Neglected Diseases; Resource Allocation; Social Determinants of Health; Social Marginalization; Vulnerable Populations",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071449453

La Réunion, Montpellier, France","Exposure to air pollutants and heat stress from traditional cooking fires is the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in low- and middle-income countries globally and have an adverse effect on the environment. According to the World Health Organization, 3.8 million people die annually prematurely from illness related to household air pollution. Families living in poverty are at the highest risk, especially women and children. In this study, exposure to particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was measured among resource-poor women cassava processors. The test locations were chosen in the peri-urban settlements of Abeokuta in the Ogun State of Nigeria, where household women entrepreneurs roast garri (granulated cassava) for sale in the local market. The measurements were taken for two types of stoves which are generally existing in the study location. First, a rectangular stove (RS) with two operators and, second, a circular stove (CS) with one operator; both stoves used wood as fuel. The emissions were compared with a modern mechanical liquefied petroleum gas burner-based garri roaster (GS). Hours spent per day in front of garri stoves ranged from 6 to 12 h for both stoves, with a frequency of 1 to 3 days of operation per week. It was found that CS operators were spending significantly more time in producing garri, which is due to the low capacity of the CS. The average PM2.5 concentrations for RS and CS were 381 and 273 μg/m3, respectively, estimated to be 21 and 41 μg/m3 on an annual mean level basis. Similarly, for PM10, the mean concentration levels were 1580 and 594 μg/m3 for RS and CS, respectively. The annual mean levels for PM10 were about 89 μg/m3 for both types of stoves. CO exposure during garri processing was up to five times higher than the recommended concentrations with a 4-h mean of 48 and 50 mg/m3 for RS and CS, respectively. NO2 levels were very low, ~ 0 ppm. This investigative research concluded that wood-fired small-scale garri producers in Nigeria are exposed to very unhealthy levels of PM, CO and thermal stress. The concentration levels of both PM and CO were exceeding the global as well as Nigerian ambient air quality standard regulations. Along with air pollution, thermal stress was a significant issue, which is known to exacerbate the negative effect of air pollution on the human body. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon monoxide; Firewood stoves; Food processing; Heat stress; Particulate matter","Air quality; Calcination; Carbon monoxide; Diseases; Food processing; Gas emissions; Heating; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Plants (botany); Thermal pollution; Thermal processing (foods); Thermal stress; Ambient air quality standards; Concentration levels; Heat stress; Low and middle income countries; Mean concentrations; Particulate Matter; Traditional cooking; World Health Organization; Stoves; carbon monoxide; fuel; nitrogen dioxide; carbon monoxide; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; cassava; entrepreneur; food processing; heat wave; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; periurban area; pollution exposure; womens status; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; cassava; controlled study; energy; exposure; food processing; heat stress; human; Nigeria; particulate matter; policy; practice guideline; seasonal variation; temperature stress; urban area; wood; adult; air pollutant; chemistry; child; cooking; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; family size; female; fire; food industry; heat injury; heat shock response; indoor air pollution; Manihot; Abeokuta; Nigeria; Ogun; Manihot esculenta; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Air Pollution, Indoor; Carbon Monoxide; Child; Cooking; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Family Characteristics; Female; Fires; Food Industry; Heat Stress Disorders; Heat-Shock Response; Humans; Manihot; Nigeria; Nitrogen Dioxide; Particulate Matter; Wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074272422

We provide a structured review of the operations research and management science literatures to describe the current operational and policy issues in the electric power industry, with a particular focus on issues surrounding electricity market design, renewable integration, effects of climate policy on electric power infrastructure, rise of electric powered vehicles, energy storage, and the growing interdependence between natural gas and electric power sectors. We identify the current research frontier and classify the existing research into clusters with respect to managerial issues addressed. We offer a forecast for where the electric power industry is going and describe some important public policy issues.

Health impacts from climate change may include increased morbidity and mortality from worsening cardiopulmonary health, worsening allergies, and greater risk of infectious disease and mental illness, including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder from extreme weather events. Family physicians should advise patients to minimize exposure to air pollution, which is potentiated by rising temperatures. Use of self-monitoring devices, tracking local weather information, and awareness of events such as wildfires can alert patients to poor ambient air quality. Vulnerable individuals should avoid intense outdoor exercise and stay indoors or wear protective N95 masks when air quality is in the harmful range. Physicians can teach patients to recognize early symptoms of heat illness and advise adequate hydration and cooling on hot days. Physicians should become aware of the signs and symptoms of vectorborne illnesses to ensure early treatment and limit spread. Physicians should be aware of the climate and health benefits of active transport and plant-based diets when counseling their patients.

Low oxygen concentrations beneath FTWs and wash-out of microbial communities can limit decomposition of organic matter and nitrification of ammonium-N in domestic wastewaters. This study aimed to test the utility of two different configurations of FTWs supplemented with mechanically aerated Biofilm Attachment Surfaces (BAS) to provide post-primary treatment of domestic wastewater. Two pilot-scale FTW treatment trains were developed at a domestic wastewater treatment plant in Hamilton, New Zealand using ten 1 m3 volume tanks, with 1 m2 square floating mats planted with Carex virgata. These were: (1) a single-pass (direct flow-through) system comprising an aerated FTW tank with subsurface BAS followed by four non-aerated FTW tanks in series, where (endogenous carbon inputs from wetland plants, along with organic carbon from the wastewater would promote denitrification; and (2) a recirculating system incorporating a pre-anoxic phase settling tank with FTW and BAS, followed by an aerated FTW tank with BAS from which 4/5 of the outflow was recirculated back to the initial anoxic stage where the (endogenous) organic matter in the incoming wastewater would provide the primary source of carbon to promote denitrification. The remaining 1/5 flowed into three non-aerated FTWs in series. Performance of each treatment stage was monitored monthly for one year from February 2015 to January 2016 for organic matter (BOD5: Biochemical Oxygen Demand; TSS: Total Suspended Solids), nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and E. coli removal. The single-pass system had almost complete removal of both TSS and cBOD5 with &gt;93%, maintaining the final effluent TSS and cBOD5 concentrations at below 5 and 4 mg L−1 respectively. The single-pass system had a lower NH4-N reduction (4.9 g m−2 d−1) compared with that in the recirculating system (6.9 g m−2 d−1), but achieved higher denitrification (1.7 g m−2 d−1) than that in the recirculating system (1.4 g m−2 d−1) as more organic carbon from the inflow wastewater was available in the single-pass system for denitrification. The recirculating FTW system achieved slightly higher removal of Total-P (TP: 44.9%) and Dissolved Reactive Phosphorus (DRP: 29.7%) than those in the single pass FTW system (TP: 36.7%; DRP: 24.3%), and both systems had a similar ~3-log E. coli reduction (from 106 to 103 MPN 100 ml−1) during the one-year experimental period. This one-year pilot-scale FTW study showed that FTWs supplemented with mechanically aerated BAS could be a practically option to retrofit existing waste stabilisation ponds to enhance organic matter, nitrogen and E. coli reduction. Furthermore, they may have some potential advantages over other types of intensified constructed wetlands, since they don't need costly graded gravel (or other solid media), provide ready access to aeration diffusers for maintenance purposes, have low susceptibility to clogging, and can be more readily de-sludged if required. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Floating treatment wetlands; Natural wastewater treatment; Nutrient removal; Organic matter removal; Secondary wastewater treatment","Biochemical oxygen demand; Biofilms; Biofilters; Biogeochemistry; Decay (organic); Denitrification; Effluents; Escherichia coli; Nitrogen; Nitrogen removal; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Oxygen; Phosphorus; Reclamation; Stabilization ponds; Tanks (containers); Wastewater treatment; Wetlands; Dissolved reactive phosphorus; Domestic waste water treatment; Domestic wastewater treatment plants; Floating treatment wetlands; Natural wastewater treatments; Nutrient removal; Organic matter removal; Waste stabilisation pond; Chemicals removal (water treatment); aeration; biofilm; concentration (composition); domestic waste; experimental study; nitrification; nutrient; pollutant removal; recirculating system; wastewater treatment; wetland; New Zealand; Carex virgata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071479993

This study investigates the processes in the inner Arctic that thermodynamically precondition air masses associated with CAOs south of Fram Strait where they lead to negative potential temperature anomalies often in excess of 15 K. Kinematic backward trajectories from Fram Strait are used to quantify the Arctic residence time and to analyze the thermodynamic evolution of these air masses. Additionally, the study explores the importance of cyclonic tropopause polar vortices (TPVs) for CAO formation south of Fram Strait. Results from a detailed case study and the climatological analysis of the 100 most intense CAOs from Fram Strait in the ERA-Interim period reveal that (i) air masses that cause CAOs (CAO air masses) reside longer in the inner Arctic compared to those that do not (NO-CAO air masses), and they originate from climatologically colder regions; (ii) the 10-day accumulated cooling is very similar for CAO and NO-CAO air masses indicating that the transport history and northerly origin of the air masses is more decisive for the formation of an intense negative temperature anomaly south of Fram Strait than an enhanced inner Arctic diabatic cooling; (iii) 40% (29%) of the top 40 (100) CAOs are related to a TPV in the vicinity of Fram Strait; (iv) TPVs confine anomalously cold air masses within their associated low tropospheric cold dome leading to enhanced accumulated radiative cooling. © 2019.

In an effort to improve the charge separation and transfer following efficient exciton generation in such nanocrystals, novel functional nanocomposites were synthesized by the in situ growth of CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals on two-dimensional MXene nanosheets. Efficient excited state charge transfer occurs between CsPbBr3 NCs and MXene nanosheets, as indicated by significant photoluminescence (PL) quenching and much shorter PL decay lifetimes compared with pure CsPbBr3 NCs. The as-obtained CsPbBr3/MXene nanocomposites demonstrated increased photocurrent generation in response to visible light and X-ray illumination, attesting to the potential application of these heterostructure nanocomposites for photoelectric detection. The efficient charge transfer also renders the CsPbBr3/MXene nanocomposite an active photocatalyst for the reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4.

All of these elements have a definite role in the overall development of the DH system. The transition to 4th generation DH (4GDH) involves changes in each of those elements that interact with each other. Therefore, various related processes form the potential energy savings and reduction of CO2 emissions when introducing 4GDH as whole system in all elements. To estimate the potential outcome from such projects it requires complex engineering calculations, which is not always possible without relevant expertise. The article describes a novel simplified methodology for evaluating the potential GHG emission reduction when implementing 4GDH. Thus, it is proposed to use a simplified calculation formula from linear regression model for the calculation of CO2 reduction. © 2019 Ieva Pakere et al., published by Sciendo 2019.","4th generation district heating; greenhouse gas emissions; linear regression model; lowering district heating temperature","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; greenhouse gas; heating; multiple regression; multivariate analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077017426

Pedostratigraphic records of low-order paleovalleys (paleovalley heads and 1st- and 2nd-order paleovalleys) of the Palmas/Caçador summit surface serve as important resources for the identification of landscape component responses (relief, soil, sediment, and vegetation) of plateau areas of southern Brazil in the light of environmental changes driven by climatic variations of the Late Quaternary. We integrated litho-, pedo-, allo- and chronostratigraphic descriptions with carbon stable isotope analysis, phytoliths indices, and 14C and OSL dating. We found that at &gt;44.86 ky BP, there was a change in the hydrodynamics of 2nd-order perennial channels (humid climate) controlled possibly by tectonics. At ~28.35 to &lt;44.86 ky BP, there was a predominance of progressive pedogenesis (Johnson's Model) in wet and cold climates with minimal erosion and stable landscape components. At &gt;23.69 to ~28 ky BP, regressive pedogenesis in dry climate began with a predominance of erosion by overland flows. At &gt;2.60 to ~23.69 ky BP, full regressive pedogenesis occurred under a continuous climate regime of drier characteristics punctuated by millenary climatic fluctuations to a wetter regime of between ≤4.60 and 19.77 ky BP, echoing the results postulated by the Knox's model. During this period, the most pronounced modifications to the landscape were made with a change in vegetation from Campo Cerrado to Campo Limpo; with changes in erosion patterns caused first by overland flows and then earthflows/debris flows; and with the gradual silting (filling and burying) of gullies, valley heads and 1st and 2nd order valley bases. Since 2.60 ky BP the area returned to a predominance of progressive pedogenesis in wet and cold climates. Finally, we found that at the local scale, low-order basins (&lt;4th-order) quickly responded to climate changes and millenary fluctuations with changes in vegetation and changes in the course of pedogenesis and morphogenesis. These results suggest that the responses of low-order bases landscapes to regional climatic changes should be considered in the formulation of evolutionary models of subtropical landscapes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Colluvium; Colluvium-alluvium; Paleosol; Subtropical landscape","alluvial deposit; carbon isotope; climate variation; colluvial deposit; erosion; hydrodynamics; landscape change; overland flow; paleoenvironment; paleosol; pedogenesis; Quaternary; stable isotope; stratigraphy; subtropical region; Brazil",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069653706

Our main interest is formulated as the problem of how the tombolo whether is experiencing continual growth or retreated. This study aims to explain changes of shape and its area of the tombolo morphology for each five-year period along the shoreline based on the influence of wind directions. This study uses Google Earth Pro Image from 1985 to 2015 to map key changes of the shoreline, where the obtained data are analysed using ArcGIS 10.3. Wind data is obtained from the European Centre Medium-Term Weather Forecast (ECMWF) from 1985 to 2015 where the wind data is analysed using Ocean Data View, and WRPlot 5.3 is used to form wind rose diagrams. Shoreline of the tombolo is divided into six segments and studied into five-year periods from 1985 to 2015. The obtained results showed that the wind direction is enough to influence the change of shorelines in the area of the Tombolo.

Specifically, we coupled a joint analysis of small-angle x-ray and neutron scattering experiments on fully hydrated lipid vesicles in the presence of MG2a and L18W-PGLa to all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. In agreement with previous studies, both peptides, as well as their equimolar mixture, were found to remain upon adsorption in a surface-aligned topology and to induce significant membrane perturbation, as evidenced by membrane thinning and hydrocarbon order parameter changes in the vicinity of the inserted peptide. These effects were particularly pronounced for the so-called synergistic mixture of 1:1 (mol/mol) L18W-PGLa/MG2a and cannot be accounted for by a linear combination of the membrane perturbations of two peptides individually. Our data are consistent with the formation of parallel heterodimers at concentrations below a synergistic increase of dye leakage from vesicles. Our simulations further show that the heterodimers interact via salt bridges and hydrophobic forces, which apparently makes them more stable than putatively formed antiparallel L18W-PGLa and MG2a homodimers. Moreover, dimerization of L18W-PGLa and MG2a leads to a relocation of the peptides within the lipid headgroup region as compared to the individual peptides. The early onset of dimerization of L18W-PGLa and MG2a at low peptide concentrations consequently appears to be key to their synergistic dye-releasing activity from lipid vesicles at high concentrations. © 2019 Biophysical Society",,"1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol; 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylethanolamine; antimicrobial cationic peptide; lipid; magainin derivative; peptide-Gly-Leu-amide; phosphatidylethanolamine; phosphatidylglycerol; cell membrane; chemistry; dimerization; lipid bilayer; metabolism; molecular dynamics; temperature; Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides; Cell Membrane; Dimerization; Lipid Bilayers; Lipids; Magainins; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Phosphatidylethanolamines; Phosphatidylglycerols; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074818904

Social interactions and relationships are essential elements for conducting use-inspired research, creating usable knowledge, and providing climate services. The Climate Assessment for the Southwest (CLIMAS) program was founded on theories of use-inspired research and co-producing knowledge with non-academic partners. A recent program evaluation illuminated gaps in these underlying program models and led to the inclusion of social learning systems theory and communities of practice. Using grounded examples, we demonstrate the CLIMAS program’s ongoing role in fostering, maintaining, and expanding a climate resilience social learning system in the U.S. Southwest. Broader implications from the evaluation focus on the importance of establishing and maintaining relationships, increasing institutional and individual flexibility in response to change, and improving the practice of transdisciplinarity. These findings inform new program evaluation metrics and data collection techniques. This paper contributes to current theory and practice of use-inspired science and climate services by identifying and demonstrating how social interactions inform climate knowledge production.

To quantify the potential for reducing energy and environmental impact, building-stock modelling (BSM) is commonly used. Recently, the focus of BSM has expanded to include environmental impacts and life-cycle assessment (LCA). However, impact categories are often limited to climate change and representative buildings are often used. In addition, the future state of the stock is often calculated as a step-change to highlight the technical potential of an ideal future state. The aim of this paper is to assess the environmental impact of the future development of an urban housing-stock under business-as-usual scenarios using a building-specific GIS based model applied to the multi-family building stock of the City of Gothenburg. This paper uses an explorative LCA to account for environmental impacts based on dynamic uptake of common renovation measures and resulting energy savings until 2050. Two main scenarios are used where the renovation logic is based on either end-of-life of components or cost-effectiveness and further divided using limiting factors regarding investment capacity and annual share of the stock to be renovated. Results show possible energy savings of up to 23% and a corresponding 31% reduction in greenhouse-gas emissions. Greenhouse-gas emissions avoided due to reduced energy demand are offset by up to 65% by accounting for material use due to construction related renovation measures. For scenarios that favour construction related interventions, PV panels are responsible for the major part of the environmental impact across the 15 mid-point indicators used. © 2019 The Authors","Building-stock modelling; Explorative LCA; GIS; Renovation; Scenario modelling","Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Investments; Life cycle; Photovoltaic cells; Building stocks; Business-as-usual; Explorative LCA; Gis based models; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Renovation; Scenario modelling; Technical potential; Environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; future prospect; GIS; life cycle analysis; modeling; residential development; urban housing; Goteborg; Sweden; Vastra Gotaland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071659791

Increasingly, spatial datasets (i.e. satellite and other products) and new computational tools are merged with ground observations to address this problem. This paper presents a comparison of approaches of different complexities to spatially interpolate monthly precipitation and daily temperature time series in the upper Aconcagua catchment in central Chile. A generalised linear mixed model (GLMM) whose parameters are estimated through approximate Bayesian inference is compared with simpler alternatives: inverse distance weighting (IDW), lapse rates (LRs), and two methods that analyse the residuals between observations and WorldClim (WC) data or Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS). The assessment is based on a leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), with the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) being the primary performance criterion for both climate variables, while the probability of detection (POD) and false-alarm ratio (FAR) are also used for precipitation. Results show that for spatial interpolation of temperature and precipitation, the approaches based on the WorldClim or CHIRPS residuals may be recommended as being more accurate, easy to apply and relatively robust to tested reductions in the number of estimation gauges. The GLMM has comparable performance when all gauges were included and is better for estimating occurrence of precipitation but is more sensitive to the reduction in the number of gauges used for estimation, which is a constraint in sparsely monitored catchments.</p>. © Author(s) 2019.",,"Bayesian networks; Catchments; Chirp modulation; Gages; Inference engines; Interpolation; Inverse problems; Mean square error; Runoff; Approximate Bayesian inference; Hydrological assessment; Inverse distance weighting; Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV); Performance criterion; Probability of detection; Root mean squared errors; Spatial interpolation; Climate models; accuracy assessment; comparative study; gauge; interpolation; model validation; mountain region; parameter estimation; performance assessment; precipitation (climatology); satellite data; terrain; time series analysis; Aconcagua; Andes; Argentina; Chile; Cordillera Principal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075634246

A literature review identified 22 publications, containing 57 case studies, at least touching on the embodied GHG for different types of rail infrastructure. The cases studies include high speed rail, intercity rail, light rail, commuter rail, heavy rail, freight, and metro rail. The paper examines the GHG impact per kilometre of rail infrastructure reported across the case studies and compares the boundaries, functional units, methods, and data used. Most studies employed process-based LCA for an attributional analysis. The embodied emissions associated with the case studies range from 0.5 to 12 700 tCO2 km-1; much of the variation is dependent on the proportion of the rail line at-grade, elevated, or in a tunnel. However, large ranges in GHG per kilometre remain after controlling for elevated and tunneled distance. Comparing the embodied emissions across the rail types was challenging, due to the large variations in system boundaries, study goals, and inventory methods adopted in the publications. This review highlights the need for standardization across the reporting of embodied GHG for rail infrastructure to better facilitate hot spot detection, engineering design and GHG policy decision making. The statistical model finds that overall ∼941(±168) tCO2e are embodied per kilometre of rail at-grade, and tunneling has 27 (±5) times more embodied GHG per kilometre than at-grade construction. The statistical model is based on the findings of published literature and does not explicitly consider function, geometry, specifications, emphasis on whole lifecycle, legislative constraints, socio-economic factors, or the physical and environmental conditions of the construction site. © 2019 The Author(s).

There is undeniably an abundance of wind resources in Iceland. But what impact would the harnessing of this power have on the country's growing tourism industry? This paper focuses on the dynamics existing between wind farming, residents and tourism. Its overall aim is to evaluate the attitudes of local residents and tourism service providers in Southern Iceland towards the country's first proposed wind farm, which is to be located at the edge of Iceland's Southern highlands, and to critically discuss the causal relationship between the landscape and these attitudes. An on-site questionnaire was distributed to residents in the municipalities adjacent to the proposed wind farm. Interviews were also conducted with residents and tourist service providers. The results indicate that the relationship between residents and the landscape of the proposed site is based on its use as highland pasture and the residents’ romantic conception of the landscape, which for centuries has been characterized by wildness and remoteness. This conception seems to linger on despite gradually increasing hydropower production in the area. The associations made by tourist service providers with the area differ since they are selling a certain image, that of unspoilt nature and wilderness. Wind turbines would be a new and prominent presence in the Icelandic landscape likely to transform the area from its previous perceived wild and natural state. As such, social acceptance of the location of wind farms in the Icelandic highlands is more critical than in the case of more traditional ways of harnessing renewable energy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Iceland; Nature-based tourism; Residents; Tourist service providers; Wilderness; Wind farms; Wind turbines","alternative energy; attitudinal survey; greenhouse gas; resource development; tourism economics; upland region; wind farm; wind power; Iceland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071428037

This study addressed research gaps and updated existing knowledge on long term effect of single biochar application on soil physicochemical properties. A three year field trial was set up on an acidic Alfisol testing the effect of rice husk biochar on select soil quality indicators viz.; soil pH, electrical conductivity, bulk density, water stable aggregates, water holding capacity, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, CEC and C:N ratio sampled at two soil depth (0–10 cm and 10–20 cm). A soil quality index was estimated to provide a quantitative tool for assessing the long term effects of biochar amendment on Alfisol productivity. Biochar amendment at 6–12 t ha−1 proved more efficient at improving soil quality index (SQI = 1.00) on a long term basis. Further, biochar amendment significantly enhanced all determined soil quality indicators after one year of biochar amendment at sampled soil depths. However, the effect of biochar on some soil quality indicators such as electrical conductivity, organic carbon, total nitrogen and C:N ratio diminished after three years, while soil pH, CEC, bulk density – (decreased), water stable aggregates and water holding capacity remained consistently enhanced. Biochar showed more positive long term effect on improving soil physical quality indicators than chemical indicators. Particularly, decreasing soil electrical conductivity, organic carbon, total nitrogen and C/N ratio after three years suggest increased uptake of soluble ions by plants, carbon mineralization and nitrogen flux with plausible soil organic carbon and nitrogen losses. To mitigate these accelerated carbon and nitrogen flux and increase the efficiency of aged biochar in sequestering carbon and nitrogen, re-application of biochar after three years is recommended. Overall, biochar amendment at the dosage of 6–12 t ha−1 is recommended for long term soil quality improvement in the study area and regions of the world with similar soil type and climatic conditions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biochar; Bulk density; Soil organic carbon; Soil pH.

Hierarchical regression was used to examine the effects of sociodemographic, individual, and institutional factors. Results: A higher, or positive, attitude was the strongest influencing factor in adherence to SPs in the final model, followed by administrative support, hospital types, and safety climate, in descending order. These 4 variables accounted for 26.0% of the variance in adherence to SPs. Conclusions: The attitudes of nurses toward SPs is important for increasing the adherence to SP best practices.

The production of timber materials demands lower emissions than concrete and steel. To guide political and industrial priorities, it is vital to estimate the emission effects of increased use of timber. The article reports on a broad study that had the following aims: To forecast the number, types, floor area, and location of new buildings that will be built in Oslo and Akershus counties between 2015 and 2030. To estimate how many of these new buildings (a) will be and (b) could be built with timber as the main construction material. To compare these timber potentials to the present and future availability of nationally and sustainably sourced and manufactured timber. To estimate the effect on GHG emissions when substituting concrete and steel with timber in the production of new buildings in Oslo and Akershus counties between 2015 and 2030. The research is based on official prognoses for population growth. They are combined with building predictions derived from municipal statistics and plans. A GHG reduction factor is extracted from existing studies of the effects of conversion to timber. This factor is used to estimate the GHG saving potentials of different scenarios for timber use. Main results: The forecast of building numbers, categories, sizes and location is a useful tool when discussing environmental, urban, industrial and architectural strategies. Housing in 2–8 stories, not high-rise buildings, represents the biggest potential for increased use of timber in Norway. Scientific consensus is not established regarding timber buildings and emissions. Especially the effects of carbon storage in long-lived products and use of residues for biofuel substitutes fossil fuel are still debated. To convey an order of magnitude, the different emission-saving effects are separated. The estimates of GHG mitigation indicate that conversion to use of timber may have significant effects, but measures in the transport sector are more important for reaching the ambitious emission targets in Oslo and Akershus counties. To be robust, the argument for timber buildings must include the perspective of a green industrial shift based on renewable resources and innovative technology, design and architecture. The vicinity of Norway's biggest and most rapidly growing market for timber buildings and the country's largest forests and timber-based industries represents a unique opportunity for sustainable urban and regional development. © Copyright © 2019 Nygaard, Bashevkin, Groba and Sunter.","sustainable timber buildings; timber architecture; timber building emissions; timber potential; urban timber buildings",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076705308

In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN) is used to predict and to model the relationship between dual fuel emissions and operating parameters of a dual fuel engine fuelled with natural gas and diesel. Data such as engine power for training and testing of the network are acquired experimentally at Engines and Energy Conversion Lab (EECL), Colorado State University Energy Institute. The engine is a tier II 6 cylinder, 6.8 liter, 4-stroke compression ignition engine with a compression ratio of 17:1 and a power rating of 168 kW at 2200 rpm. The engine was operated at 1800 rpm through five different load points in dual fuel operating modes. Emissions data analyzed during the day were carbon monoxides (CO), carbon dioxides (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), nitrogen monoxides (NO), nitrogen dioxides (NO2), oxygen (O2) and total hydrocarbons (THC). A total number of 6005 data points from five different loads have been used for ANN development based on standard a back-propagation algorithm. The ANN model was developed using 70% of the experimental results for training, while the rest of the data was used for performance testing and validation. Results show that the ANN model is able to predict the exhaust emissions of a dual fuel engine with regression coefficients at 0.9381 (training), 0.93533 (validation) and 0.93607 (testing), meanwhile the mean squared errors are in the range of 0.09 to 0.1%.

These reactions are typically conducted under elevated pressures and low temperatures to shift the reversible reactions to the products. However, conducting reaction under such low temperature is kinetically limited. An alternative method that can be applied to ameliorate this limitation is by conducting a dynamic operation. This study focused on model development and reactor approach for dynamic fixed-bed operation intended for CO methanation. One dimensional pseudo-homogeneous reactor model was developed for a typical laboratory scale by neglecting internal and external diffusion based on Weisz-Prater, Anderson, and Mears criteria. The gas phase model was governed for compounds in the bulk phase. The model consisted of the dynamic term, convective term, diffusive term, and source term. The design criteria involving pressure drop, ratio of the height of catalyst bed to particle diameter (LB/dp), ratio of reactor diameter to particle diameter (dr/dp), ratio of bed length to reactor diameter (LB/dr) and axial dispersion were taken into consideration. A kinetic model to complement the simulation was taken from literature. The reactor model was simulated for steady-state and unsteady-state operation with optimum feed composition. The result of steady-state model simulation was considered as a base case and comparison to judge the reactor performance under unsteady-state operation. Modulating the value of the inlet CO fraction in step function was introduced to the unsteady-state model in order to enhance methane production. The simulation results showed that the highest methane production could be achieved by modulating CO inlet fraction between 0.45 and 0.4 with the overall switching time of 25 s. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","CO methanation; energy storage; feed modulation; Ni-based catalyst; reactor design","Catalysts; Chemical reactors; Energy storage; Hydrogenation; Methanation; Methane; Modulation; Natural gas substitutes; Particle size; Temperature; Co methanation; Fixed bed operations; Ni-based catalyst; Reactor designs; Steady-state modeling; Synthetic natural gas; Unsteady state model; Unsteady-state operation; Nickel compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076183708

As such, planners are increasingly interested in climate services. Climate services involve the expert production of forecasts, scenarios, economic analyses, and other data products to help users meaningfully address local changes and variabilities. For instance, in the US state of Louisiana, modelers tailor 50-year storm, precipitation, and sea level rise predictions to help planners select adaptive ecological restoration projects. Modelers do so by downscaling the data, combining it with other social and biophysical information, and framing results in terms of stakeholder interests. In this paper, I question what it means to develop adaptation information that is geared towards specific users and stakeholders. Given the growing recognition that adaptation planning can prove maladaptive, I ask, when do climate services actually exacerbate existing vulnerabilities? To answer, I draw on three cases from Louisiana’s coastal Master Plan and highlight political economic factors informing climate services: influential stakeholders, funding dynamics, the framing of planning decisions, and differential harms and benefits. I argue that when climate data is made relevant to existing interests, budgets, and plans, it can reproduce vulnerabilities and foreclose transformative adaptation. However, marginalized stakeholders can also pressure experts to contextualize data in ways that mitigate vulnerabilities. I conclude that climate services research and practice should expand user-centered approaches by asking climate services for whom and by assessing the winners and losers from climate variability, change, and adaptation actions themselves. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Budget control; Decision making; Economic analysis; Planning; Sea level; Biophysical information; Climate variability; Decision making process; Ecological restoration; Economic factors; Regional climate; Stakeholder interest; User-centered approach; Climate change; adaptive management; coastal zone management; conceptual framework; decision analysis; downscaling; economic analysis; political economy; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; scenario analysis; sea level change; stakeholder; vulnerability; Louisiana; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061646035

Critical to this trade is the classification of woody biomass as ‘renewable energy’ and thus eligible for public subsidies. However, much scientific study on the net effect of this trend suggests that it is having the opposite effect to that expected of renewable energy, by increasing atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide for substantial periods of time. This review, based on recent work by Europe's Academies of Science, finds that current policies are failing to recognize that removing forest carbon stocks for bioenergy leads to an initial increase in emissions. Moreover, the periods during which atmospheric CO2 levels are raised before forest regrowth can reabsorb the excess emissions are incompatible with the urgency of reducing emissions to comply with the objectives enshrined in the Paris Agreement. We consider how current policy might be reformed to reduce negative impacts on climate and argue for a more realistic science-based assessment of the potential of forest bioenergy in substituting for fossil fuels. The length of time atmospheric concentrations of CO2 increase is highly dependent on the feedstocks and we argue for regulations to explicitly require these to be sources with short payback periods. Furthermore, we describe the current United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change accounting rules which allow imported biomass to be treated as zero emissions at the point of combustion and urge their revision to remove the risk of these providing incentives to import biomass with negative climate impacts. Reforms such as these would allow the industry to evolve to methods and scales which are more compatible with the basic purpose for which it was designed. © 2019 The Authors.

The resulting recent forests may need management to improve ecosystem quality, and this could possibly be combined with timber production in specific cases. Temperate deciduous (TD) trees have declined steeply during the past millennium, but some now increase in the recent forests, often mixed with Norway spruce. Removing spruce may benefit these trees and for example oak regeneration, flowering plants and pollination. The total area of forest suitable for restoration in Norway and Sweden is >100,000 ha. We evaluate the cost of selective cutting based on 26 field trials, 13 in each country, and sales from the initial cutting on average just barely compensate for the costs. By resurveying plots from a parallel project in Sweden, we found that about half of the cut volume had regrown after 16 years, and a second thinning may be needed in the near future. Coarse woody debris (CWD) had increased by 78%, indicating increasingly natural conditions. We conclude that selective cutting in recent forests may be part of a strategy to reach restoration and sustainability goals, but that long-term incentives for landowners need to be developed. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

With a current annual building refurbishment rate between 0,4 and 1,2% in the EU it will be impossible to reach this objective. For getting on track, efficient and particularly affordable solutions fulfilling future-proof requirements are needed. This paper introduces the concept of HVACC 4.0, which stands for Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning and Chilling. The system architecture differs from state of the art HVACR, where the R stands for Refrigeration, in at least three points: (1) The innovative thermal storage and collector concept allows to harvest and store ""low temperature heat and cold"" on a daily basis, (2) in heating applications, the disruptive refrigerant cycle allows to more than double the Coefficient of Performance (COP) compared to air-water heat pumps and (3) in cooling applications, the night-time harvesting of cold via unglazed PVT-collectors allows to boost the Energy Efficiency Ratio (EER) by a factor of &gt;10 compared to split devices or cold water aggregates. HVACC 4.0 aims to provide a solution in form of an easy-to-install refurbishment kit. The design criteria for addressing the ""4.0"" in HVACC 4.0 have been (1) to exemplify the principle of ""efficiency 1st"", (2) to maximize the share of Renewable Energies (RE) on total energy consumption, (3) to allow serving next generation low temperature District Grids (DG) and (4) to allow ""more sector coupling"".

Among the several advanced CI engines, dual fuel combustion and RCCI engine are selected to discuss. In the dual fuel combustion with ethanol and diesel, fumigation and dual injection are only discussed. Most studies have shown that the main challenge in using bioethanol in DF mode is the considerable increase of HC and CO emissions, particularly at low load operating conditions. In DF combustion, it is clear from experimental and computational works than the PRR is significantly reduced by introducing the split injection, resulting in the decrease of knock intensity. In addition, diesel post injection or double injection as same as split injection was suggested to reduce HC and CO emissions. DF combustion with ethanol and diesel can be operated from low to high loads (0.2–1.95 MPa IMEP), particularly up to 2.2 MPa IMEP with E85, with very low NOx and soot emissions. The researches on the DF combustion adopted wet ethanol PFI and biodiesel produced from the inedible vegetable oils DI are required in the future. In RCCI combustion, double injection fueling strategy is the most commonly adopted for the diesel injection. It is composed of the early pilot at 60 CAD bTDC to raise the reactivity in the squish region and the second main injection at around 25–30 CAD bTDC to ignite the cylinder charge. The premixed ratios for RCCI with single injection and double injection were studied up to 80%, and 90%, respectively. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","advanced compression ignition engine; Bioethanol; dual fuel combustion; fumigation; reactivity﻿-controlled compression ignition combustion","Bioethanol; Diesel engines; Ethanol; Fuel injection; Fumigation; Ignition; Combustion mode; Compression ignition; Compression ignition engine; Computational work; Diesel injection; Dual fuel combustion; Knock intensity; Operating condition; Dual fuel engines; biofuel; combustion; ethanol; fumigation; literature review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071031084

Infrared transmission spectra of thin films of pure propionitrile ices deposited at low temperature (30–160 K) were collected from 50 cm−1 to 11,700 cm−1 (200–0.85 μm). The far-infrared spectral region was specifically targeted to compare with CIRS far-infrared limb spectra. The temperature and time evolution of C2H5CN ice was thoroughly investigated to better understand discrepancies reported in previously published laboratory studies on the crystalline phase of C2H5CN. Specifically, we observe peculiar temperature and time-driven ice phase transitions, revealed by significant spectral variations in the ice, which stabilizes once a complete crystalline phase is achieved. From these results, the crystalline phase of propionitrile ice was identified at deposition temperatures greater than or equal to 135 K and &lt;140 K. Our findings corroborate previous studies that ruled out pure propionitrile ice as the sole chemical identity of Titan's observed Haystack emission feature. In order to understand and identify the Haystack cloud, we have initiated co-deposition experiments that incorporate mixtures of Titan-relevant organics, many of which have corresponding vapors that are abundantly present in Titan's stratosphere. In this paper, we present the result of one example of a co-deposited ternary ice mixture containing 16% hydrogen cyanide (HCN), 23% C2H5CN, and 61% benzene (C6H6). Although this co-condensed ice mixture is the best fit thus far obtained to match the broad width of the Haystack, it is still not the appropriate chemical candidate. However, it reveals an intriguing result: the strong lattice mode of pure C2H5CN ice is drastically altered by the surrounding molecules as a result of mixing in a co-condensed phase. The laboratory results reported here on propionitrile ice may help to further constrain the chemical identification of Titan's stratospheric Haystack ice cloud, as well as improve on the current state of knowledge of Titan's stratospheric ice cloud chemistry. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Atmosphere; Clouds; Ices; Infrared spectroscopy; Titan",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067232348

Recent research has focused on the cost-benefit potential of different mitigation strategies, which optimize flight trajectories with respect to climate and economy, but most of these mitigation strategies cannot be implemented in the near future due to technical challenges. The objective of this paper is to present an interim mitigation strategy, which bridges this time period. In analogy to military exclusion zones, climate restricted airspaces (CRA) are defined based on 3-D climate change functions, characterizing the environmental impact caused by an aircraft emission at a certain location. Regions with climate costs greater than a threshold value are closed in the corresponding month; others are cleared for air traffic. To estimate the cost-benefit potential of this strategy, a preliminary analysis is conducted on the route from Helsinki (EFHK) to Miami (KMIA). Affected flight trajectories are re-routed optimally around resulting CRA with regard to monetary costs for varying threshold values. Therefore, flight simulation algorithms are developed, which solve a non-linear optimal control problem. For each optimized flight trajectory corresponding average temperature response (ATR) and cash operating costs (COC) are expressed relative to a reference great circle trajectory with constant Mach number and compared with the climate mitigation potential of climate optimized trajectories. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air traffic regulation; Climate mitigation strategy; Cost-benefit analysis; Operations research; Optimal control; Systems design; Trajectory optimization","air traffic control; air transportation; algorithm; climate effect; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; optimization; traffic emission; Finland; Florida [United States]; Helsinki; Miami; United States; Varsinais-Suomi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011890607

Many scientists, industry, policy makers and other stakeholders recognize such pollution as an unnecessary and unacceptable risk to global public health. An attempt to assess and reduce such discharges, however, quickly meets with complex realities that need to be understood to identify effective ways to move forward. This paper charts relevant key actor-types, their main stakes and interests, incentives that can motivate them to act to improve the situation, as well as disincentives that may undermine such motivation. Methods: The actor types and their respective interests have been identified using research literature, publicly available documents, websites, and the knowledge of the authors. Results: Thirty-three different actor-types were identified, representing e.g. commercial actors, public agencies, states and international institutions. These are in complex ways connected by interests that sometimes may conflict and sometimes pull in the same direction. Some actor types can act to create incentives and disincentives for others in this area. Conclusions: The analysis demonstrates and clarifies the challenges in addressing industrial emissions of antibiotics, notably the complexity of the relations between different types of actors, their international dependency and the need for transparency. The analysis however also suggests possible ways of initiating incentive-chains to eventually improve the prospects of motivating industry to reduce emissions. High-resource consumer states, especially in multinational cooperation, hold a key position to initiate such chains. © 2019 The Author(s).","Antimicrobial resistance; management; Environmental pollution; Policy","antibiotic agent; antiinfective agent; antibiotics; antimicrobial activity; concentration (composition); emission control; industrial emission; manufacturing; pathogen; policy making; pollution policy; public health; stakeholder; antibiotic therapy; Article; China; consumer; controlled study; documentation; drug industry; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; government; human; India; intervention study; peer review; pollution control; priority journal; waste water treatment plant; commercial phenomena; industry; legislation and jurisprudence; manufacturing industry; organization and management; prevention and control; water pollution; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Commerce; Manufacturing and Industrial Facilities; Manufacturing Industry; Water Pollution, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074623165

This increase, alongside with the development of stricter emission regulations, forced the manufacturers of combustion systems, especially gas turbines, to develop novel combustion techniques for the control of NOx and CO2 emissions, the latter being a greenhouse gas responsible for more than 60% to the global warming problem. The present review addresses different burner designs and combustion techniques for clean power production in gas turbines. Combustion and emission characteristics, flame instabilities, and solution techniques are presented, such as lean premixed air-fuel (LPM) and premixed oxy-fuel combustion techniques, and the combustor performance is compared for both cases. The fuel flexibility approach is also reviewed, as one of the combustion techniques for controlling emissions and reducing flame instabilities, focusing on the hydrogen-enrichment and the integrated fuel-flexible premixed oxy-combustion approaches. State-of-the-art burner designs for gas turbine combustion applications are reviewed in this study, including stagnation point reverse flow (SPRF) burner, dry low NOx (DLN) and dry low-emission (DLE) burners, EnVironmental burners (including EV, AEV, and SEV burners), perforated plate (PP) burner, and micromixer (MM) burner. Special emphasis is made on the MM combustor technology, as one of the most recent advances in gas turbines for stable premixed flame operation with wide turndown and effective control of NOx emissions. Since the generation of pure oxygen is prerequisite to oxy-combustion, oxygen-separation membranes became of immense importance either for air separation for clean oxy-combustion applications or for conversion/splitting of the effluent CO2 into useful chemical and energy products. The different carbon-capture technologies, along with the most recent carbon-utilization approaches towards CO2 emissions control, are also reviewed. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","carbon capture/utilization; fuel flexibility; high-temperature membrane reactors (HTMRs); lean premixed combustion (LPM); micromixer (MM) combustion technology; oxy-combustion","Bioreactors; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Combustors; Effluents; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen fuels; Mixers (machinery); Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; Perforated plates; Combustion technology; Fuel flexibility; High temperature membrane reactors; Lean premixed combustion; Oxy combustions; Reverse combustion",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069891749

The literature neglects; however, the role of the communities which benefit from the presence of the nurse as contributors to soil ecosystem functions. We hypothesized that the nurse and its beneficiaries synergistically enhance essential ecosystem functions mediated by soil microbiota. To track how plant–plant facilitation impacts plant–soil feedbacks, we selected three nurse species in semi-arid mine tailings and defined three microsites (open space, nurse canopy and nurse + facilitated canopy). In each microsite, we quantified 18 abiotic and biotic variables associated with four functions: reduction in climatic stress, reduction in edaphic stress, soil fertility and soil microbial productivity (decomposition and nutrient cycling). Litter biomass increased from open spaces to the microsite beneath the nurses, and further beneath the nurses and their beneficiaries. Litter biomass was a good predictor of both the reduction in climatic stress and increase in edaphic stress (likely owing to metal bioaccumulation). We attributed increments in soil organics and heterotrophic respiration beneath the nurses and their beneficiaries, compared to nurses alone, to biomass effects through increased litter deposition. Variation in fertility and microbial productivity among microsites shaped by the nurses and their facilitated communities was attributed to both diversity and biomass effects. In particular, fertility was promoted beneath phenotypically diverse facilitated communities, as inferred from ten above- and below-ground traits. However, microbial productivity increased at low levels of root biomass likely due to reduced plant–microbe competition for nutrients. Synthesis. Our results show that facilitated plant communities sheltered by nurse species relieve local abiotic stress and promote plant–microbe interactions, both through biomass and biodiversity effects. These observations shift the conception of facilitated species from simple beneficiaries of the nurse's effects to co-drivers of essential ecosystem functions. © 2019 The Authors.

Microalgal consortia play an important role in inhibiting the alarming fluxes of CO2 through sustainable mechanism of bioconversion of CO2 into biomass. In the present investigation, eight heterogeneous consortia of cyanobacteria and green algae such as MC1, MC2, MC3, MC4, MC5, MC6, MC7, and MC8 for the sustainable utilization of effective CO2 sequestration and biomass production were studied. Two factorial central composite designs (% CO2 and pH) were used for optimization of cellular morphology, growth, and development of consortia. The photosynthetic quantum yield of consortium MC8 was found to be maximum (0.61) in comparison with other consortia. The morphological and physiological behavior of the above consortium was analyzed under C, 5, 10, and 15% concentrations of CO2 resource capture in 250 mL BG-11+ medium. We have identified that 10% CO2 concentrated medium maximally promoted the cellular growth in terms of cell dimension, dried biomass, carbohydrate, and lipid contents in this consortium. As such, the elemental composition of carbon and carbon capturing capability was high at 10% CO2 concentration. However, further CO2 enrichment (15%) led to decline in growth and morphology of cell size as compared to control. The results indicate that the optimum CO2 enrichment in consortia exhibits potent commercial utilization for rapid biomass production and plays a distinguished role in global carbon sequestration and mitigation agent. © 2019, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.","Biomass; Carbohydrates; Carbon dioxide; Central composite design; Lipids; Microalgal consortia","carbon dioxide; algal community; algal growth; Anabaena cylindrica; Aphanothece nageli; Arthrospira platensis; Article; biomass production; Calothrix; carbohydrate analysis; carbohydrate production; carbon capture; carbon sequestration; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Chlorella; cyanobacterium; elemental analysis; Gleocapsa; green alga; laser induced breakdown spectroscopy; lipid analysis; lipid production; Lyngbya; metabolism; microalgal consortium; microbial consortium; Microcystis aeruginosa; Nannochloropsis; nonhuman; Nostoc muscorum; Oscillatoria; photosynthesis; priority journal; productivity; response surface method; Scenedesmus abundance; Scenedesmus dimorphus; Scenedesmus quadricauda; Scytonema; Synechococcus; Synechocystis; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; Westeillopsis prolifica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073262208

It can play a significant role in creating the pathway of a renewable-based energy system in the European energy sector. The North Sea region is very likely to play a key role in the transition to a sustainable energy system. Although different energy modelling approaches allow a versatile use, they lead to the problem of an unclear understanding of specific aspects of sector coupling, and the relevance of existing tools and techniques to model and analyze such a system. This paper is aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of sector coupling and its incorporation in energy system models. Following a thorough literature review on sector coupling and energy system modelling, the paper outlines an approach to select an appropriate tool based on the specific rationales of the research. The paper also presents the open energy modelling framework, ‘Oemof’, as an open model tool to address the complex challenges of energy systems. The conclusions from the literature review provide a detailed understanding of the concept of sector coupling and indicate that it can be advantageous from the viewpoints of decarbonization, flexibility, network optimization, and system efficiency. To solve the coupling barriers, diversified techno-socio-economic circumstances should be taken into account through the use of model collaboration. It is also demonstrated how a list of appropriate tools for model collaboration can be picked up methodologically from an available wide range of models. Finally, ‘Oemof’ is hypothesized as a progressive tool to design a sector-coupled and renewable-based energy system in the North Sea region. © 2019 by the author.","Energy system modelling; Energy transition; North Sea energy system; Oemof; Open science; Sector coupling","Computer science; Energy management; Energy system modelling; Energy systems; Energy transitions; Oemof; Open science; Climate change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076032485

These ever-increasing data demands require not only more and more capacity of the transmission channels but also results in resource over-provision to meet the resilience requirements, thus the unavoidable waste as a result of the data fluctuations throughout the day. In addition, the high energy consumption (EC) and carbon discharge from these data transmissions posing serious issues to the environment we live in. Therefore, to overcome the issues of intensive EC and carbon emission (CE) of massive data dissemination in SCs, we propose an energy-efficient and carbon reduction approach by using the daily mobility of the existing vehicles as an alternative communications channel to accommodate the data dissemination in SCs. To illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, we take the Auckland City in New Zealand as an example, assuming massive data generated by various sources geographically scattered throughout the Auckland region, to the control centres located in the city. Results obtained show that our proposed approach can provide up to four times faster transferring the large volume of data by using the existing daily vehicles’ mobility, than the conventional transmission network. Moreover, our proposed approach offers about 32% less EC and CE than that of conventional network transmission approach. © 2019 by the authors.

Hence, understanding their roles in supporting or avoiding deforestation and forest degradation is important to support national effort in reducing carbon emissions from forest. This study is aimed at: (1) examining communities' needs for forest products and services; (2) analysing communities' interests towards REDD+ activities in reducing emission from deforestation and forest degradation activities; and (3) analysing options to be developed into management plans for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. It examines 9 communities in the provinces of Papua, Central Kalimantan, and Riau. It employs a qualitative approach through stakeholder interviews, focus group discussions and field observations. The study found that communities face some constraints in managing forest ecosystem services that impede their role in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation that can be expected from the utilisation of non-timber forest products and ecosystem services. Communities' interests in joining programs to reduce emission from deforestation and forest degradation are diverse, but their capacity in planning and in systematic forest use, in including carbon conservation programs are relatively low. Hence, strengthening community-level organisational structures and developing robust plans for sustainable management of forest ecosystem services are needed to support communities' participation in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Community-based forest management; Forest ecosystem services; Institutional arrangements; REDD+","Carbon; Deforestation; Developing countries; Emission control; Community-based forest managements; Developing communities; Forest ecosystem; Institutional arrangement; Non-timber forest products; Organisational structure; REDD; Sustainable management; Ecosystems; Carbon; Deforestation; Degradation; Developing Countries; Ecosystems; Forest Products; Management; Services",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065990217

Therefore, the building stocks play a key role in the reduction of GHG emissions through the analysis of the energy performance of buildings, in order to understand their behavior and to identify effective models that will allow expanding investigations in vast areas as districts or cities.This work analyses space heating energy performance of buildings with a multi-scale approach using the main energy-related variables at building, block of buildings and district scale. The purpose of this study is to identify a simple regression model in order to evaluate the space heating energy consumption of a large part of residential buildings in Turin (IT). A cluster analysis was applied in order to find groups of buildings with similar energy consumptions and to identify the main energy-related characteristics of each group. The analysis was developed with the support of a GIS tool to evaluate the buildings characteristics and a statistical software to identify a stable model at urban scale. The identified models evidenced that the space heating energy consumption not only depends on the characteristics of the building itself, but also on the urban characteristics. At urban scale, the most influential variables were: the heating degree days, positively correlated with the space heating consumption, and the albedo that was negatively correlated. Also, socio-economic variables were utilized: the percentage of working people with a positive correlation and the percentage of young inhabitants with a negative correlation. The statistical GIS-based methodology proposed in this study is simple and then replicable to other urban contexts. This kind of analysis can be useful for policy makers in defining specific energy efficiency measures for each group of buildings to identify new more effective energy performance variables and benchmarks for the different groups of buildings and then to improve the energy performance of a city reducing energy consumptions and the relative GHG emissions. © 2019 IEEE.","Linear regression; Residential buildings; Space heating model; Statistical model; Urban scale","Benchmarking; Cluster analysis; Energy utilization; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Logistic regression; Space heating; Energy performance of buildings; Heating energy consumption; Multi-scale approaches; Negative correlation; Positive correlations; Residential building; Statistical software; Urban characteristics; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086765903

This spike in mortality was attributed principally to an influenza epidemic, but the contribution of air pollution and cold temperature has not been investigated. Information on the combined effect of low temperatures, influenza epidemic, and air pollution on mortality is inadequate. The objective of this study was to estimate the excess mortality in the winter of 2016-2017 in the metropolitan area of Milan, and to evaluate the independent short-term effect of 3 risk factors: low temperatures, the influenza epidemic, and air pollution. Methods: We used a case-crossover, time-stratified study design. Mortality data were collected on all people aged &gt; 65 years who died of natural causes, due to respiratory diseases or cardiovascular diseases, between December 1, 2016 and February 15, 2017. Environmental data were extracted from the Regional Environmental Protection Agency. The National Surveillance Network provided data on influenza epidemic. Results: Among the 7590 natural deaths in people aged &gt; 65 years, 965 (13%) were caused by respiratory conditions, and 2688 (35%) were caused by cardiovascular conditions. There were statistically significant associations between the minimum recorded temperature and deaths due to natural causes (OR = 0.966, 95% CI: 0.944-0.989), and cardiovascular conditions (OR = 0.961, 95% CI: 0.925-0.999). There were also statistically significant association between the influenza epidemic and deaths due to natural causes (OR = 1.198, 95% CI: 1.156-1.241), cardiovascular conditions (OR = 1.153, 95% CI: 1.088-1.223), and respiratory conditions (OR = 1.303, 95% CI: 1.166-1.456). High levels of PM10 (60 and 70 μg/m3) were associated with a statistically significant increase in natural and cause-specific mortality. There were statistically significant interactions between PM10 and influenza for cardiovascular-related mortality, and between influenza and temperature for deaths due to natural causes. Conclusions: Excess of mortality in Milan during winter 2016-2017 was associated with influenza epidemic and concomitant environmental exposures, specifically, the combined effect of air pollution and low temperatures. Policies mitigating the effects of environmental risk factors should be implemented to prevent future excess mortality. © 2019 The Author(s).","Air pollution; Cardiovascular mortality; Case-crossover; Influenza; Low ambient temperature; Natural mortality; Respiratory mortality","adverse event; aged; air pollution; city; cold; crossover procedure; epidemic; human; influenza; Italy; mortality; risk factor; season; Aged; Air Pollution; Cities; Cold Temperature; Cross-Over Studies; Epidemics; Humans; Influenza, Human; Italy; Mortality; Risk Factors; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074544719

Additionally, forest managers face increasing challenges to sustaining forests in the face of high uncertainty associated with response to climate change. The Adaptive Silviculture for Climate Change (ASCC) project was developed to provide operational-scale research opportunities to assess and demonstrate various adaptation approaches to forest management in regionally important forest types. The ASCC project framework includes three treatments (resistance, resilience, and transition) representing a gradient of silvicultural approaches aimed at climate change. The first of five ASCC installations is located on the Cutfoot Experimental Forest-Chippewa National Forest (CEF), Minnesota USA, in a mixed-species northern pine forest. Using habitat suitability models under projected future climates, as well as expert opinion, we chose eight future climate-adapted species for planting as part of the transition treatment, consisting of four native species to the CEF: eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.), northern red oak (Quercus rubra L.), bur oak (Quercus macrocarpa Michx.), and red maple (Acer rubrum L.); and four novel species to the CEF: white oak (Quercus alba L.), bitternut hickory (Carya cordiformis Wangenh.), black cherry (Prunus serotina Ehrh.), and ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa C. Lawson). The seedlings were planted under two canopy conditions, a thinned matrix (14–18 m2 ha−1 residual basal area) and 0.2-ha gap openings (through harvesting). We measured how overstory canopy conditions (gap openings versus a thinned matrix) and understory shrub/herbaceous cover affect species performance. We measured 45 plots over the course of three growing seasons (Spring 2016 – Fall 2018), taking measurements of seedling basal diameter and survival, as well as estimates of understory vegetation density. Our findings highlight strong variations in species performance across treatment conditions. While overstory canopy condition was found to be a weak predictor of seedling survival and growth, our results show post-treatment colonization of understory shrub/herbaceous cover being a strong predictor of seedling survival (p &lt; 0.001), with 86.67% (±8.04; 1 standard error) of seedlings surviving in the lowest understory cover class, and 74.23% (±3.04) surviving in the highest understory cover class. Seedling growth did not appear affected by understory shrub/herbaceous cover. Additionally, growth and survival varied significantly among native and novel seedlings, with ponderosa pine exhibiting the highest growth rates at 0.31 cm cm−1 year−1 (±0.004), while also having the lowest survival of any species at 45.66% (±1.2). Results from this study can be directly used by managers to inform planting decisions and species selections that align with management planning to promote forest health and sustainably in the face of climate change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Forest adaptation; Future-adapted; Seedling growth; Seedling survival; Silviculture","Climate models; Ecosystems; Forestry; Managers; Seed; Forest adaptation; Future-adapted; Seedling growth; Seedling survival; Silviculture; Climate change; adaptive management; assessment method; climate change; climate effect; coniferous tree; deciduous tree; ecosystem function; forest ecosystem; forest health; forest management; future prospect; growing season; growth rate; mixed forest; native species; overstory; performance assessment; seedling; silviculture; strategic approach; survival; Coverings; Ecosystems; Forestry; Growth; Pinus Ponderosa; Silviculture; Survival; Chippewa National Forest; Minnesota; United States; Acer rubrum; Carya cordiformis; Pinus ponderosa; Pinus strobus; Prunus serotina; Quercus alba; Quercus macrocarpa; Quercus rubra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070753640

This was done by analysing 30 years of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data and coinciding extreme warm, dry and their compound events in continental Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. In order to better understand the response of vegetation activity to extreme climatic events in relation to soil functioning, the data was segmented into different climate zones and further studied as a function of land cover and soil type. This study demonstrated that extreme climatic events cause substantial reductions in the NDVI with the maximum median impact up to 31%, one month after the occurrence of an extreme climatic event. However, the magnitude of NDVI drop largely depended on land cover and soil type. Our analysis showed that for soil types with root depth limitations, lower water retention capacity and the absence of specific symbiotic species in the soil, vegetation activity was more impacted by climate extremes compared to soil types having favourable growing conditions. Natural land cover types, especially taiga and boreal forest, were most sensitive. Consequently, with the expected increase in extreme events, the now stable and productive ecosystems may become unstable and less capable to absorb the CO2 in the future, thereby enhancing climate change and land degradation. Therefore, it is important to have mitigation policies tailored towards maintaining soil functioning in vulnerable ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Extreme climatic events; Land degradation; Soil functioning; Soil variability; Vegetation activity","boreal forest; extreme event; land cover; land degradation; NDVI; soil analysis; soil type; soil-vegetation interaction; Europe; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067273806

Factors that affect P cycling and transport, including climate and land use, are changing rapidly and can have legacy effects, making future freshwater quality uncertain. Focusing on the Yahara Watershed (YW) of southern Wisconsin, USA, an intensive agricultural landscape, we explored the relative influence of land use and climate on three indicators of water quality over a span of 57 years (2014–2070). The indicators included watershed-averaged P yield from the land surface, direct drainage P loads to a lake, and average summertime lake P concentration. Using biophysical model simulations of future watershed scenarios, we found that climate exerted a stronger influence than land use on all three indicators, yet land use had an important role in influencing long term outcomes for each. Variations in P yield due to land use exceeded those due to climate in 36 of 57 years, whereas variations in load and lake total P concentration due to climate exceeded those due to land use in 54 of 57 years, and 52 of 57 years, respectively. The effect of land use was thus strongest for P yield off the landscape and attenuated in the stream and lake aquatic systems where the influence of weather variability was greater. Overall these findings underscore the dominant role of climate in driving inter-annual nutrient fluxes within the hydrologic network and suggest a challenge for land use to influence water quality within streams and lakes over timescales less than a decade. Over longer timescales, reducing applications of P throughout the watershed was an effective management strategy under all four climates investigated, even during decades with wetter conditions and more frequent extreme precipitation events. © 2019","Climate; Land use; Manure; Phosphorus; Surface water quality; Watershed","Climate models; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Lakes; Manures; Phosphorus; Precipitation (meteorology); River pollution; Surface waters; Water quality; Watersheds; Agricultural landscapes; Biophysical model; Climate; Effective management; Extreme precipitation events; Long-term outcome; Nutrient fluxes; Weather variability; Land use; fresh water; phosphorus; climate change; computer simulation; land use; manure; numerical model; phosphorus; surface water; water quality; watershed; agricultural land; Article; biophysics; climate; concentration (parameter); hydrology; lake; land use; landscape; nutrient uptake; phosphorus cycle; precipitation; priority journal; simulation; stream (river); water management; water quality; watershed; weather; United States; Wisconsin; Yahara River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069835235

In this study, GHG emissions are investigated under both On-Farm and Off-Farm sectors. Data envelopment analysis method is employed for the optimization of GHG emissions and energy flow. The highest and lowest energy consumption are related to tea and kiwifruit production, respectively. Results show that kiwifruit and eggplant have the highest scores in technical efficiency whilst tangerine and tea have the highest values in pure technical efficiency. The largest amount of energy is saved in kiwifruit orchards with 8316.29 MJ ha−1. Nitrogen fertilizer and diesel fuel have the topmost energy saving potential in most crops. Kiwifruit orchards have the highest potential for mitigation of GHG gas emissions (520.79 kg CO2 eq. ha−1). Results show that an appropriate usage of nitrogen fertilizer and replacement by organic fertilizer will mitigate GHG emissions as well as energy consumption. It can be concluded that GHG emissions can be mitigated by energy optimization in all the studied crops. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Crop; Data envelopment analysis; Energy; Greenhouse gas emission; Optimization","Agricultural robots; Citrus fruits; Crops; Data envelopment analysis; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Nitrogen fertilizers; Optimization; Orchards; Surveys; Tea; Energy; Energy optimization; Energy saving potential; Energy usage; Horticultural crops; Organic fertilizers; Pure technical efficiencies; Technical efficiency; Greenhouse gases; data envelopment analysis; diesel engine; energy efficiency; energy planning; greenhouse gas; horticulture; optimization; organic farming; technical efficiency; Gilan; Iran; Actinidia deliciosa; Allium sativum; Citrus reticulata; Corylus; Solanum melongena",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070072532

Our choice in climate data resolution has the potential to complicate predictions of the ecological impacts of climate change, since climate varies from local to global scales and this spatial variation is reflected in climate data. To address this issue, we downscaled LGM and modern (1975–2005) 30-year averaged climate data to 60-m resolution for the entire state of Alaska for 10 different climate variables, and then upsampled each variable to coarser resolutions (60 m to 12 km). We modeled the distributions of novel and disappeared climates to evaluate the locations and fractional area of novel and disappeared climates for each of our climate variables and resolutions. Generally, novel and disappeared climates were located in southern Alaska, although there were cases where some disappeared climates existed within coastal and interior Alaska. Climate resolution affected the fractional area of novel and disappeared climates in three patterns: As the spatial resolution of climate became coarser, the fractional area of novel and disappeared climates (a) increased, (b) decreased, or (c) had no explainable relationship. Overall, we found the use of coarser climate data increased the fractional area of novel and disappeared climates due to decreased environmental variability and removal of climate extremes. Our results reinforce the importance of downscaling coarse climate data and suggest that studies analyzing the effects of climate change on ecosystems may overestimate or underestimate their conclusions when utilizing coarse climate data. © 2019 The Authors.

We investigated the effects of MECP2 deletion from HSCs on their transcriptome and of phosphorylation of MECP2 on HSC phenotype and liver fibrosis. Methods: We isolated HSCs from Mecp2–/y mice and wild-type (control) mice. HSCs were activated in culture and used in array analyses of messenger RNAs and long noncoding RNAs. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses identified pathways regulated by MECP2. We studied mice that expressed a mutated form of Mecp2 that encodes the S80A substitution, MECP2S80, causing loss of MECP2 phosphorylation at serine 80. Liver fibrosis was induced in these mice by administration of carbon tetrachloride, and liver tissues and HSCs were collected and analyzed. Results: MECP2 deletion altered expression of 284 messenger RNAs and 244 long noncoding RNAs, including those that regulate DNA replication; are members of the minichromosome maintenance protein complex family; or encode CDC7, HAS2, DNA2 (a DNA helicase), or RPA2 (a protein that binds single-stranded DNA). We found that MECP2 regulates the DNA repair Fanconi anemia pathway in HSCs. Phosphorylation of MECP2S80 and its putative kinase, HAS2, were induced during transdifferentiation of HSCs. HSCs from MECP2S80 mice had reduced proliferation, and livers from these mice had reduced fibrosis after carbon tetrachloride administration. Conclusions: In studies of mice with disruption of Mecp2 or that expressed a form of MECP2 that is not phosphorylated at S80, we found phosphorylation of MECP2 to be required for HSC proliferation and induction of fibrosis. In HSCs, MECP2 regulates expression of genes required for DNA replication and repair. Strategies to inhibit MECP2 phosphorylation at S80 might be developed for treatment of liver fibrosis. © 2019 The Authors","Epigenetic Factor; lncRNA; MCM; Myofibroblast","long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; methyl CpG binding protein 2; minichromosome maintenance protein; transcriptome; carbon tetrachloride; collagen; Mecp2 protein, mouse; methyl CpG binding protein 2; paracetamol; serine; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antifibrotic activity; Article; cell transdifferentiation; controlled study; gene expression; hepatic stellate cell; liver fibrosis; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; transcriptomics; animal; C57BL mouse; cell culture; cell proliferation; DNA repair; DNA replication; experimental liver cirrhosis; genetics; hepatic stellate cell; knockout mouse; metabolism; pathology; phosphorylation; signal transduction; toxic hepatitis; Acetaminophen; Animals; Carbon Tetrachloride; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; Collagen; DNA Repair; DNA Replication; Hepatic Stellate Cells; Liver Cirrhosis, Experimental; Male; Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Phosphorylation; Serine; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073698394

So far, studies did not account for specificities of outdoor rearing which is quite common in such systems. The present study aimed at evaluating the environmental impacts of pig production systems using local breeds in Europe, while accounting for emissions associated to consumption of grass and mitigation of impacts through soil-C sequestration. Environmental impacts were estimated for 48 farms using local pig breeds: 25 in France (Gascon breed), eight in Italy (Mora Romagnola breed) and 15 in Slovenia (Krškopolje breed). Assessment was performed with and without accounting for pasture-intake emissions and potential soil-C sequestration. The data were obtained from on-farm surveys. Systems with Gascon pigs had the lowest impacts per kg of live weight for global warming and cumulative energy demand, due to lower impacts of feeds. Acidification potential was higher for Krškopolje pigs due to high dietary crude protein content and high AP of feeds, while eutrophication potential was higher for Gascon pigs due to higher phosphorus content of feeds (28% higher than the mean of the other farms). When impacts were expressed per ha of land use, pig production in Gascon farms had the lowest impacts due to more available area per pig, except for eutrophication. Low contribution of soil-C sequestration to climate change mitigation was observed (4.7% on average). However, it may have a substantial contribution for the most extensive pig systems using large land surfaces. Emissions resulting from grazing had a rather low contribution to Global Warming Potential (4%) and Eutrophication (3%), but a substantial one to Acidification impact (9% on average). In the frame of our study, the contribution of emissions related to grazing is moderate because commercial feed supply for outdoor pigs was higher than in extensive systems studied in literature. This study highlighted that main hotspots include feed composition and supply and the origin of feed ingredients. It also suggests that future assessments of extensive pig systems relying on pig foraging on grasslands or rangelands should account for soil-C sequestration and emissions associated to grazing and foraging. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Autochthonous breeds; Hotspots; Life cycle assessment; Pig","Acidification; Carbon; Economics; Eutrophication; Global warming; Land use; Life cycle; Mammals; Soils; Autochthonous breeds; Climate change mitigation; Cumulative energy demands; Environmental assessment; Eutrophication potentials; Global warming potential; Hotspots; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073641166

Emissions from MSW account for 20% of Canadian greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and accordingly, waste legislation in Ontario demands high waste recovery and a moving towards a circular economy. This study evaluates the current municipal solid waste management in the City of Guelph and assesses possible alternative scenarios based on the associated GHG emissions. Waste Reduction Model (WARM) that was developed by the US-EPA has been used to quantify the GHG emissions produced over the entire life cycle of the MSW management scenario. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted to investigate the influence of some scenarios on the overall GHG emissions. It has been found that one ton of landfilled waste generates approximately 0.39 ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2Eq). It was also found that the current solid waste scenario has a saving of 36086 million ton of CO2Eq (MCO2Eq). However, the results showed that the scenario with enhanced waste-to-energy, reduction at source and recycling has resulted in a high avoided emissions (0.74 kg CO2Eq/kg MSW). The anaerobic Digestion scenario caused the lowest avoided emissions of 0.39 kg CO2Eq/kg MSW. The net avoided emissions for reduction at source scenario were found to be the same as that found by the current scenario (0.4 kg CO2Eq/kg MSW). The sensitivity analysis of both reduction at source and recycling rates show a linear inverse proportional relationship with total GHG emissions reduction. © 2019 Widener University School of Civil Engineering.

In this way, the present study aimed to evaluate the GHG emissions and carbon dioxide fixation by duckweed ponds (DWP) applied to treat municipal wastewater in a polishing stage. Two pilot DWP (3000 L) were operated in a series with real wastewater receiving a flow rate of 200 L d−1 and organic load rate of 39 g COD ha−1 d−1. Beyond the standard physicochemical parameters for wastewater monitoring, the gases emissions from pond surface were measures by using a static flux chamber with infrared probes installed inside to detect CO2 and CH4 concentration. Operating the DWP with a load of 18.1 kg TN ha−1 d−1 and 2 kg TP ha−1 d−1, across 425 days of monitoring, higher COD and nutrient removal efficiency was identified (79%, 93% and 84% for COD, TN and TP, respectively). The CO2 emission rate ranged from 3048 to 6017 mg CO2 m−2 d−1 and the fixation rate ranged from 19,592 to 42,052 mg CO2 m−2 d−1. Methane emission was not detected (less than 0.1%). Moreover, low abundance of archaeal community was identified in both DWP. The results showed that in presented conditions, under low COD loading rate DWP could fix at least three times more CO2 than it emits, highlighting the sustainability of this natural technology. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide sink; Duckweed ponds; GHG emissions; Wastewater treatment","Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases; Lakes; Reclamation; Carbon dioxide fixation; GHG emission; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Municipal wastewaters; Nutrient removal efficiency; Physicochemical parameters; Static flux chamber; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; methane; nitrogen; organic matter; phosphorus; carbon emission; carbon fixation; concentration (composition); experimental study; greenhouse gas; pond; wastewater treatment; weed; Article; biomass; carbon dioxide fixation; carbon footprint; chemical oxygen demand; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental monitoring; environmental sustainability; flow rate; Lemna; microbial community; municipal wastewater; nonhuman; nutrient; physical chemistry; pond; priority journal; waste component removal; waste water management; air pollutant; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; chemistry; greenhouse gas; procedures; sewage; waste water; Archaea; Lemna; Air Pollutants; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Sequestration; Greenhouse Gases; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069573182

Smart heating controls have been projected to generate significant energy savings, but there is little evidence to suggest that they are more usable than traditional thermostats, and that they cause residents to use their heating more efficiently. Our study aims to contribute to this evidence, by assessing how the perception and use of heating controls changed for a small group of residents in London, United Kingdom, after their dwellings were upgraded to smart heating controls. The residents were part of an interesting niche supplied by a district heat network (DHN) through slow-response underfloor heating systems, originally controlled by traditional programmable thermostats which residents used infrequently and perceived as complicated. The study focused on assessing one particular heating behaviour of residents: using the controls to program heating schedules that reflect their occupancy patterns, a behaviour of great interest to DHN operators due to its potential to help improve the accuracy of forecasting residential heating demand. The study also assessed residents’ perceptions of the usability of heating controls and of their heating systems’ matching of temperature adjustments. We found that after upgrading to smart thermostats, more residents programmed heating schedules to match their occupancy patterns, but they also increased the frequency of ad-hoc temperature and schedule adjustments, indicating that heating demand may vary significantly outside of pre-set schedules, and not conform as well to predictable patterns as expected. Perceived usability of the heating controls also increased after the upgrade, but perceptions of whether the system matched temperature adjustments showed that respondents still found it difficult to understand the intrinsic slow response of their underfloor heating system. Our findings provide insight into the perception and specific use of heating controls for a unique sample of residents, “twice removed” from the most intuitive methods of heating control and challenged by unique issues with their heating supply and system. However, the study is limited by the small sample size and lack of long-term monitoring of heating behaviour, and we recommend further research on larger samples and over longer timescales in order to investigate long-term change and whether this could improve demand forecasting accuracy and contribute to achieving higher efficiency, and thus reduced emissions, in DHN operation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Domestic energy efficiency; Heating behaviour; Heating schedules; Smart heating controls",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068780687

The DesignBuilder software package was used to model and simulate a sedum-vegetated green roof with 10-cm-thick dry soil on a 350-square meter building. The reduction in cooling load (energy saved during the hot period of the year) due to this green roof was estimated to 7.9 kWh/m2 year. The rest of the estimations were performed based on three scenarios where the roof area available for the implementation of green roof projects in the city was assumed to be 7.8, 45, and 96 million square meters, respectively. In these scenarios, the total energy saving in the hot period of the year was estimated to 61,620, 355,500, and 758,400 MWh, respectively. It was also found that the reduced consumption of fuel in power plants because of the reduced demand for energy would result in 0.7–9 million dollars’ worth of cost-saving every year. The results of the scenario analysis showed that the emission reductions due to the implementation of green roofs would be in the range of 17.5 and 299.3 (ton/year) for PM10, 17.3 and 215.8 (ton/year) for CO, 154.9 and 1905.9 (ton/year) for NOx, and 280 and 3445.9 (ton/year) for SO2. The total reduction in the environmental damage costs of pollutant emissions in the three scenarios was estimated to 2.45, 14.21 and 30.32 million dollars per year, respectively.

Three hundred and forty residents of the Kemerovo Region (a coal-mining region of western Siberia) were lung cancer patients exposed to air pollutants and ionizing radiation (case) and 335 were healthy donors (control). Genotyping was performed by real-time PCR and allele-specific PCR. We discovered that polymorphisms in the XPD gene in men [log-additive model: odds ratio (OR) = 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17-2.31], the ATM gene in women and nonsmokers (codominant model: OR = 0.11, 95% CI: 0.02-0.49 and OR = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.08-0.72, respectively), the APEX1 gene for smokers (recessive model: OR = 2.55, 95% CI: 1.34-4.85), and the NBS1 gene for those who work in the coal industry (overdominant model: OR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.21-0.75) are associated with an increased risk of lung cancer.

When the water vapor was injected into the intake port, the rich equivalence ratio region was distributed in the center of cylinder. In addition, the ISNO (indicated specific nitrogen oxide) values decreased up to 46% more than the values for the condition without the water-vapor-injection. However, the ISSoot (indicated specific soot) exhibited similar values in any conditions. For starts of energizing timing that were BTDC (before top dead center) 25 deg and 15 deg, the ISFC (indicated fuel consumption) values decreased with increased portions of water vapor.

Using natural gas as the low reactivity fuel also provides high knock-resistance and carbon dioxide emission reduction. However, the concept suffers from relatively low combustion efficiency at low engine loads, causing unacceptable methane slip. This study tackles this issue, applying numerical simulations to investigate the application of negative valve overlap to improve combustion efficiency of reactivity controlled compression ignition at low engine loads. The objective is modification of in-cylinder thermal and chemical state before combustion, by varying timing and amount of fuel injected directly into the recompressed hot exhaust gases. The study uses TNO's multi-zone, chemical kinetics-based combustion model with variable valve actuation functionality. The simulation is based on two experimentally validated cases: an uncooled exhaust gas recirculation strategy and a lean burn concept. In both cases, negative valve overlap elevates in-cylinder temperature and cuts methane emissions by 15%, without combustion optimization. Crucially, it enables peak exhaust recompression temperatures above 850 K, sufficient for diesel reforming/oxidation. The lean RCCI strategy takes greater advantage of fuel reforming than the exhaust gas recirculation case. Optimum conditions give almost 99% combustion efficiency and ultra-low methane emissions. Net indicated efficiency is 40.5% (@15% load), despite negative valve overlap's substantial pumping losses. Low-load net efficiency is 5.5 percentage points above the lean strategy baseline and 3 pp. better than the exhaust gas recirculation baseline. This strategy is considered applicable on state-of-the-art dual-fuel gas engines without hardware changes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Fuel reforming; Natural gas; Negative valve overlap; RCCI; Residuals; Variable valve actuation","Carbon dioxide; Chemical modification; Diesel engines; Direct injection; Dual fuel engines; Efficiency; Emission control; Exhaust gases; Fuel purification; Global warming; Ignition; Methane; Natural gas; Nitrogen oxides; Fuel reforming; Negative valve overlap; RCCI; Residuals; Variable valve actuation; Exhaust gas recirculation; cylinder; diesel; emission control; fuel; natural gas; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070237253

However, empirical research on lateral carbon compensation is still insufficient at the provincial level. Therefore, the improved carbon budget method is proposed to construct a provincial carbon budget accounting and evaluate the level of provincial lateral carbon compensation. The findings are concluded as follows: (1) Carbon emission and absorption in China have experienced rapid growth in the period of 2005–2015. (2) There exists an obvious spatial difference in the provincial carbon budget. The amount of provincial carbon emissions is high in the east and low in the west, while the provincial carbon absorption is high in the northeast and southwest and low in the other regions. (3) 30 Provinces in China can be classified into three types, namely those that have to pay for lateral carbon compensation, those that should be refunded, and those in relative equilibrium. (4) Whether a province should pay for or be refunded from lateral carbon compensation is related to the development level of the secondary industry. (5) Inter-provincial lateral carbon compensation will play a significant role in the top-level design of total carbon emission controlling across different provinces in China. Finally, three policy implications are proposed, including constant promotion of the decoupling of provincial economic development and carbon emissions, formulation of accounting standards and methods for lateral carbon compensation, and adoption of multiple lateral carbon compensation methods. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon budget accounting; China; Lateral carbon compensation; Provincial differences","Budget control; Public policy; Accounting standards; Carbon budgets; China; Compensation method; Economic development; Policy implications; Provincial differences; Spatial differences; Carbon; carbon; absorption; carbon budget; carbon emission; emission control; policy approach; absorption; adsorption kinetics; air pollution control; Article; carbon footprint; China; compensation; economic development; environmental economics; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; environmental planning; environmental policy; geographic distribution; industrialization; inter provincial lateral carbon compensation; nonbiological model; pearl growth curve model; priority journal; spatial analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069735117

We discuss the origins of the decline and assess the effects of policy interventions by the Trump administration. We find that, with fierce competition from natural gas and renewables, a further decrease of coal consumption must be expected by the old and inefficient U.S. coal-fired electricity generation fleet. By contrast, we consider the overly optimistic (for coal producers) view of the U.S. Energy Information Agency, and test whether the tide for the U.S. coal industry could turn as a result of three potential support measures: (i) revoking the Clean Power Plan (CPP); (ii) facilitating access to the booming Asian market; and (iii) enhanced support for Carbon Capture, Transport and Storage (CCTS) technology. We investigate the short-term and long-term effects on U.S. coal production using a comprehensive partial equilibrium model of the world steam coal market, COALMOD-World (Holz, Haftendorn, Mendelevitch, & von Hirschhausen, 2016). We find that revoking the CPP could stop the downward trend of steam coal consumption in the U.S., but even allowing for additional exports, will not lead to a return of U.S. coal production to the levels of the 2000s, that is, over 900 Mt per year. When global steam coal use is aligned with the 2°C climate target, U.S. steam coal production drops to around 100 Mt per year by 2030 and below 50 Mt by 2050, even if CCTS is available and exports via the U.S. West Coast is possible. Key policy insights Declining U.S. coal use is primarily caused by competition from natural gas and renewables not by environmental regulation of the coal sector. Without substantial policy support, U.S. coal-fired generation capacity will continue to decline rapidly. Revoking the Clean Power Plan will lead to about one eighth higher U.S. coal production in the next years. Carbon Capture, Transport and Storage does not prevent the rapid decline of coal use required under stringent climate policy. Even in the most extreme pro-coal scenarios with additional export possibilities, U.S. coal production will not return to its pre-2010 levels. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","CCS; clean power plan; coal ports; steam coal; Trump administration; U.S. coal sector","action plan; administrative system; carbon sequestration; coal industry; coal production; coal seam; electricity generation; energy policy; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073481747

With this approach emissions are estimated as the products of estimates of areas of land use change characterized as activity data and estimates of emissions per unit area characterized as emission factors. For the special case of complete deforestation, the emission factor for the aboveground, live tree, biomass (AGB) pool can be estimated as mean biomass per unit area prior to the deforestation which, in turn, can be estimated using a single-date ground sample or a single-date biomass map. Multiple biomass maps at continental and global scales that can be considered for estimation of emissions factors have been forthcoming in recent years. However, regardless of the source of biomass data, estimates of emissions factors must still comply with the IPCC good practice guidelines for accuracy and uncertainty. For emission factors based on a biomass map, compliance requires validation of the map where validation means that independent reference data are used to ensure that the map is free from systematic error. The primary objective of the study was to illustrate methods for validating global AGB maps by assessing their conformity to reference data at the spatial scale of a sub-global validation site. For this study, validation entailed assessing the accuracy of map-based estimates of mean biomass per unit area for a sub-global, approximate 7600-km2 validation site in Minnesota, United States of America (USA). The accuracy assessment was in the form of a test of the hypothesis of whether the map-based estimate is or is not equivalent to an estimate based on independent reference data obtained from either a ground sample or a local biomass map of greater quality than the global map. Design-based, model-based, and hybrid inferential methods were used to conduct the test. The primary conclusions were threefold. First, no map exhibited systematic error; second, the model-based inferential approach produced the smallest standard errors; and third, operationally, differences between validation site estimates of mean biomass per unit area for two global biomass maps and estimates based on reference data were not statistically significantly different. © 2019",,"Trixis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082512377

In the northern North Atlantic nutrient-rich cold Arctic Ocean outflow (of modified Atlantic water) plus Pacific and ice-melt waters flow in the East Greenland Current (EGC) and in the Baffin Island Current which feeds into the Labrador Current. The outflows east of Greenland carry a substantial amount of warm salty North Atlantic water that flows into the Nordic Seas, mixes, recirculates – much of it via the Arctic Ocean - and contributes to both shallow and deep overflows. A key to understanding oceanic control of Earth's climate therefore resides in establishing the changes in these high-latitude currents. We have analysed 28 cores comprising ∼2900 measured samples in the high-latitude N. Atlantic and Arctic Oceans of which >80% pass the reliability test of a correlation coefficient between sortable silt mean and percentage r > 0.5 (McCave and Andrews, 2019, Quat. Sci. Rev. 212, 92–107). There is a close similarity between the pattern of Holocene decrease in the strength of the Irminger Current inflow to the Nordic Seas and outflow recorded in the EGC and in deep overflow east of Reykjanes Ridge. This suggests that the flow of the EGC is strongly influenced by the influx of North Atlantic water, rather than supply of fresher water from ice sheet melt or Pacific origin. In contrast to the flows east of Greenland, those west of Greenland show a slow Holocene increase in flow. The freshest/coldest deep Denmark Strait overflow recorded at Orphan Knoll, as well as Labrador Sea water flow on the slope north of the Grand Banks, also show this gradual increase. This points to control on deep water overflows by the flux of cold fresh water from Greenland and the Arctic, some of which may have come from the Pacific via the Bering Strait. Models also show a Holocene east-west difference in deep-water formation with increase in the Labrador Sea and decrease in the Nordic seas. In almost all cases Holocene flow speed maxima lag the local Holocene Thermal Maxima by between 0 and 1000 years. It is therefore highly unlikely that the local Holocene thermal maxima are responses to increased flow of shallow currents in the adjacent ocean areas. Decelerations in flow speed accompany Holocene coolings, while accelerations accompany warmings. The LGM was a period of slow flow, and meltwater events usually show slowdowns as well. However, Heinrich events show slowdowns in some regions and faster flow in others. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Earth (planet); Flow of water; Ice; Mooring; Seawater; Correlation coefficient; Deep-water formation; Denmark Strait overflows; East greenland currents; Irminger currents; Labrador Current; Labrador sea waters; North Atlantic waters; Ocean currents; cooling; deep water; Holocene; ice sheet; Last Glacial Maximum; latitude; meltwater; sediment transport; upper ocean; water flow; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Baffin Island; Bering Strait; Canada; Denmark Strait; East Greenland Current; Grand Banks; Irminger Current; Labrador Current; Labrador Sea; Norwegian Sea; Nunavut; Reykjanes Ridge",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063946738

In recent years, documents have been adopted in Russia at the government level concerning the introduction of modern innovative technologies in all industries, including the energy sector. On July 1, 2018, a reference book of the best available technologies became operative. This reference book contains a list and analysis of the best available technologies for large coal-fired heat power plants, including atmospheric protection measures. For large thermal power plants, three pollutants are primarily considered: particulate matter, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide. For each of them, the article discusses the best available technologies for reducing emissions into the atmosphere. The atmospheric protection technologies include technologies of the preliminary preparation of fossil fuel for combustion as well as technical purification systems of each pollutant. Sulphur dioxide is the main impurity of emission from coal-fired thermal power plants, and one of the attractive ways to reduce its emissions is the thermal preparation of coal before combustion. This technology has been experimentally tested at ESI SB RAS.

However, adoption of distributed PV in these contexts has been slow due to its high upfront cost. As policies to kick-start the distributed PV market directly are often costly, this paper shows how a policy that first supports cheaper utility-scale PV deployment can create spillovers that lead to complementary cost reductions in distributed PV. Specifically, through interviews with experts in the PV industry, this paper finds that strong utility-scale deployment helps build local PV competencies and ecosystems, thereby facilitating the networks, scale, and value chains needed for distributed PV markets to develop. Harnessing these spillover effects can also reduce the upfront cost of distributed PV significantly and cost-effectively. Results of a dynamic bottom-up techno-economic model based on spillovers across PV components indicate that, in the presence of application spillovers, public financing used to initially support utility-scale PV deployment can leverage significant distributed PV cost reductions. By accelerating the profitability of distributed PV, application spillovers also enable more widespread and equitable distributed PV adoption. The paper concludes with recommendations to policymakers wishing to support more widespread distributed PV adoption in emerging and developing country contexts, with a particular focus on strategies for fostering application spillovers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Deployment policy; Local learning; Solar photovoltaics; Spillovers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068648655

Adaptation and selection mechanisms in hypoxic areas in solid tumors are regulated by Hypoxia Inducible transcriptional factor 1 (HIF1) and other hypoxia mediators and are associated with aggressive clinical behavior in a large spectrum of malignancies. Aggressive forms of lymphatic neoplasias present with solid tumor-like features, also including rapid cell growth, necrosis and angiogenesis, the clinical potential of which is still underestimated.

In this study, we tested whether P × E is considered in climate change studies. Specifically, we evaluated whether population differentiation varies across environments and whether P × E is determined by aspects of the study system and experimental design. Location: Global. Methods: We conducted a literature search in the Thomson Reuters Web of Science database to identify studies assessing population differentiation in a climate change context. We quantified the occurrence of P × E and performed a meta-analysis to calculate the percentage of traits showing P × E in the study cases. Results: We identified 309 study cases (from 237 published articles) assessing population differentiation in 172 plant species, of which 64% included more than one test environment and tested P × E. In 77% of these studies, P × E was significant for at least one functional trait. The overall proportion of traits showing P × E was 33.4% (95% confidence interval 27.7–39.3). These results were generally consistent across life-forms, ecoregions and type of experiment. Furthermore, population differentiation varied across test environments in 76% of cases. The overall proportion of traits showing environment-dependent population differentiation was 53.7% (95% confidence interval 37.9–69.3). Conclusions: Our findings revealed that differences in phenotypic plasticity among populations are common but are usually neglected in order to forecast population responses to climate change. Future studies should assess population differentiation in many test environments (accounting for P × E) that realistically reflect future environmental conditions, assessing climate change drivers that are rarely considered (e.g., multifactor experiments incorporating higher CO2 levels). Our review also revealed the predominant focus of population studies on trees from temperate climates, identifying underexplored life-forms (shrubs, annuals), phylogenetic groups (ferns, ancient gymnosperms) and ecoregions (tropical, arctic) that should receive more attention in future. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; common garden; environment; phenotypic plasticity; population differentiation; population–environment interaction","climate change; community response; garden; genetic differentiation; genotype-environment interaction; meta-analysis; phenotypic plasticity; temperate environment; Filicophyta; Gymnospermae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069811503

Since the settlement of the island (15th century), several destructive landslides have happened. In the Island of Madeira, housing is an important expression of the action of man over nature, thus creating a harmonious landscape between the built and its surroundings. In response to the accentuated Topography, terraced platforms appeared to soften this inclination. Vernacular building traditions are repeatedly cited in the academic literature as exemplary models of environmental practice. Therefore, research that addresses the vernacular traditions of the Island of Madeira may emphasize its potential for continuity and viability for maintenance and rehabilitation. Sustainability is indissolubly linked to vernacular architecture and the lessons learned from this architecture of the past can teach us which knowledge to apply in the future. The demand for sustainable buildings with minimal environmental impact is increasing, thus leading the construction industry to adopt new technologies for building design. Achieved for generations, this architecture shows us the art of a population in the construction. The rural housing of Madeira revealed itself as a wise design, where the masters of the craft created a perfect communion between the space, utility, comfort and the volumetric balance, thus creating a new artificial element that connects perfectly with the natural space. Passive strategies have been used around the world for centuries. In the last decades, inhabitants became dependent on mechanical systems with rising economic and environmental impacts. Learning from the past to understand how houses evolved to respond to the surrounding environment is important. The analysis of the local vernacular dwellings will provide insight into well-adapted popular solutions to deal with the local climatic conditions in order to promote responsive passive building technologies and a sustainable proposal is also presented. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Architectural design; Construction industry; Earth sciences; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Housing; Intelligent buildings; Structural design; Topography; Academic literature; Environmental practices; Learning from the pasts; Maintenance and rehabilitations; Surrounding environment; Sustainable building; Vernacular architecture; Vernacular buildings; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076611117

The fleet composition and driving conditions are characterized by the number of vehicles, their speeds and their types (passenger cars [PCs], light commercial vehicles [LCVs], heavy-duty vehicles [HDVs]) as well as their characteristics (make, model, fuel, engine, EURO emission standard, etc.). The number of vehicles passing on the boulevard is around 20,000 per day with about 44% of Euro 5 and Euro 6 vehicles. The impacts of fleet composition on emission were analyzed by ANOVA. The results show that the fleet composition has a significant impact on emissions for different pollutants. Higher percentage of gasoline PCs between Euro 4 to Euro 6 and Euro 4 diesel PCs induces more BC emission. Higher percentage of old gasoline and diesel vehicles (≤ Euro 3) induces higher emission of toluene, ethylbenzene and m + p- and o-xylene. Furthermore, emission factors estimated in this work were compared to those calculated in other in-situ studies that show a good agreement. For the chassis bench comparison, the in-situ PN and BC emission factors are in the same range as those measured for diesel vehicles without particle filter and gasoline vehicles with direct injection system.

They are known to trap charge carriers preventing them from reaching luminescence centers. This reduces useful photon emission and deteriorates performance. Recent efforts to characterize such defects include experimental works by positron-annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) where extensive positron trapping was reported and attributed to defects made up of both cation and oxygen vacancies. The present study reports first-principles calculations for monovacancy and divacancy defects in YAG by means of conventional and two-component density-functional theory. The defect formation energies and corresponding charge-transition levels in the gap were initially determined. The ability of the lower-energy defects to act as positron-trapping centers was then examined. Corresponding positron lifetimes and binding energies to defects were calculated and compared to the experimental PAS data. The lifetimes of aluminum monovacancies agreed well with experiment if gradient corrections are included in the electron-positron correlation. Association of oxygen with aluminum vacancies was found to lead to stable negatively-charged divacancy complexes which also trap positrons.

Despite important breakthroughs in waste management in LA&C, the region still faces many challenges that require special attention, such as the existence of uncontrolled open dumpsters (33%) or the low recovery rates of waste fractions (below 4%). Moreover, the adoption of sophisticated waste management technologies, such as incineration or anaerobic digestion, is still lagging. This review paper provides environmentally-sound and relevant policy support for municipal solid waste management stakeholders through a critical review of the current situation of the waste management sector in LA&C from an environmental perspective. Thereafter, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) bibliography linked to waste management, namely collection, sorting, recycling and landfilling applications and technologies worldwide, is used in order to understand potential alternative waste management strategies in LA&C, as well as the potential environmental benefits that could be attained. Finally, based on the holistic review and analysis, the adoption of more sophisticated technologies in landfill sites (e.g. landfill gas flaring), waste-to-energy, as well as higher recycling rates, would enhance waste management in the region and mitigate environmental impacts. A holistic view to support policy formulations, including climate action, for the adoption of integrated waste management strategies in LA&C is imperative. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Industrial ecology; Landfill; Life Cycle Assessment; Municipal solid waste; Waste management","Anaerobic digestion; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Health hazards; Land fill; Life cycle; Municipal solid waste; Recycling; Waste management; Environmental assessment; Environmental benefits; Industrial ecology; Integrated waste management; Latin America and the Caribbean; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Management technologies; Waste management strategies; Waste incineration; environmental assessment; holistic approach; industrial ecology; landfill; life cycle analysis; literature review; municipal solid waste; pollution policy; waste management; adoption; anaerobic digestion; attention; Caribbean; climate; ecology; environmental impact; gas flaring; health hazard; human; incineration; landfill; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; publication; recycling; review; sound; waste-to-energy; Latin America",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068860765

Natural capital accounting offers a framework for demonstrating the capacity of agroforestry systems to deliver sustained private benefits to farming enterprises, but traditionally is applied at larger scales than those at which farmers make decisions. Methods: Here we review the current state of knowledge on natural capital accounting and analyse how such an approach may be effectively applied to demonstrate the farm-scale value of agroforestry assets. We also discuss the merits of applying a natural capital approach to agroforestry decision-making and present an example of a conceptual model for valuation of agroforestry assets at the farm scale. Results: Our findings suggest that with further development of conceptual models to support existing tools and frameworks, a natural capital approach could be usefully applied to improve decision-making in agroforestry at the farm scale. Using this approach to demonstrate the private benefits of agroforestry systems could also encourage adoption of agroforestry, increasing public benefits such as biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation. However, to apply this approach, improvements must be made in our ability to predict the types and amounts of services that agroforestry assets of varying condition provide at the farm or paddock scale. © 2019 by the authors.","Agroforestry; Economic benefits; Ecosystem services; Natural capital; Review","Biodiversity; Climate change; Conservation; Decision making; Ecosystems; Productivity; Reviews; Agricultural productivity; Agroforestry; Agroforestry system; Biodiversity conservation; Climate change mitigation; Economic benefits; Ecosystem services; Natural capital; Forestry; adaptive management; agroforestry; biodiversity; conceptual framework; cost-benefit analysis; decision making; ecosystem service; environmental economics; forestry production; sustainable forestry; Biodiversity; Conservation; Decision Making; Ecosystems; Forestry; Productivity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075429962

The continent is also experiencing faster population growth than anywhere else in the world that will lead to proliferation of vehicles. Here, we estimate air pollutant emissions in Africa from future (2030) electricity generation and transport. We find that annual emissions of two precursors of fine particles (PM2.5) hazardous to health, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), approximately double by 2030 relative to 2012, increasing from 2.5 to 5.5 Tg SO2 and 1.5 to 2.8 Tg NOx. We embed these emissions in the GEOS-Chem model nested over the African continent to simulate ambient concentrations of PM2.5 and determine the burden of disease (excess deaths) attributable to exposure to future fossil fuel use. We calculate 48000 avoidable deaths in 2030 (95% confidence interval: 6000-88000), mostly in South Africa (10400), Nigeria (7500), and Malawi (2400), with 3-times higher mortality rates from power plants than transport. Sensitivity of the burden of disease to either population growth or air quality varies regionally and suggests that emission mitigation strategies would be most effective in Southern Africa, whereas population growth is the main driver everywhere else.

In comparison with the graphite fluoride precursors, significant improvement of the energy density in primary lithium battery is achieved when the graphite oxyfluorides are used as cathode. When the Hummer's oxidation was carried out on graphite fluoride with both CF0.60 composition and a homogenous dispersion of non-fluorinated regions into fluorinated lattice, oxidation focused on the remaining sp2 carbon atoms and decomposed them. Defected graphite fluorides were then synthesized. The highest ever measured energy density in primary lithium battery with fluorinated carbons as cathode, i.e. 2825 Wh.Kg−1, was reached with this particular sample.

The frameworks that have been developed to theorise and operationalise resilience tend to be vague, and, in some cases, theoretically weak. The major challenge, we believe, is the lack of clarity on the resilience capacities required to deal with the destabilising events. In this article, we provide a chronology of resilience, on a decade basis, from 1970 to 2016 in order to establish the connections between resilience and capacity literatures, and how these literatures affect the operationalisation of resilience. Based on the resilience and capacity literature review, a new approach to resilience termed Disaster Resilience Integrated Framework for Transformation (DRIFT) is presented, which advances the notion of capacity, as one of the principal bridges between the resilience theory and practice. DRIFT outlines the linkages between context, risk drivers, capacities and processes that are required to deal with the risk in order to achieve positive outcomes. We present the preventive, anticipative, absorptive, adaptive and transformative capacities as distinct elements, although in practice there are overlaps between these capacities. Presenting the capacities as distinct elements allows us to unpack the elements and the processes that may be critical in both theorising and operationalising resilience. Looking to the future, DRIFT is a first step towards developing a global resilience index, to be applied at various scales, including global, regional and local levels. © 2019","Disaster Resilience Integrated Framework for Transformation (DRIFT); Resilience capacities; Resilience indicators; Resilience processes and outcomes; Risk drivers","adaptive management; disaster management; hazard assessment; integrated approach; literature review; planning theory; risk assessment; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069557441

The sample plot was using the method proposed by Matthew Delaney, which was to select ten plot of Tongkonan Garden with a size of 25 × 25 m. The sample plot based on purposive sampling method with consideration of having many trees in the Tongkonan Garden stand. Each of which was divided into eight subplots, namely four subplots in each corner of the Tongkonan Garden and four subplots in the middle, each of which has a diameter of 8 m.

Due to their molecular structure without C–C bonds (C1-fuel) and their high oxygen content of 53.3%, DMC and MeFo are expected to avoid the formation of soot precursors in combustion and thus to distinctly reduce particulate number (PN) emissions. Beyond todays solid particle number (PN) limits, which are based on the definition of the particle measurement program (PMP) using a 23 nm cut-off of the counter, sub-23 nm particles are currently discussed to be a health concern. The measurement of smaller solid particles is not standardized yet and is potentially impeded by the presence of volatile nucleation mode particles below 23nm. Moreover, standard techniques for additionally determining particle size distributions usually are below their sensitivity limit due to the low particle concentrations produced by oxygenate fuels. At the Technical University of Munich, DMC and MeFo were tested as pure substances in their emission and performance behavior compared to conventional gasoline fuel, using a single-cylinder, direct injection SI-engine. Primary (limited: CO, HC, NOx) and secondary (non-limited: CH2O,CH3OH,NH3) gaseous emissions pre- and after a TWC as well as particle number (PN) emissions were investigated. Regarding the challenges of particle number measurements, this work presents our method to also assess the properties of such ultra-low concentration aerosols from engine exhaust considering trends in particle size and potential artifacts caused by volatile, sub-23 nm particles. The method described uses two differently constructed PMP PN counting systems, operating in parallel, using largely different dilution schemes and rates. Both systems are equipped with two condensation particle counters (CPC) each, which are set to cut-off ratios of 23nm and 10nm, allowing to gain further insights using the ratios of the different systems (indication of potential artifacts) as well as ratios of the two CPC (indicating size trends) respectively. The test outcomes of steady-state operating points during lambda-sweeps show positive effects of the fuels on raw gaseous emissions while still maintaining high conversion rates over the TWC. PN emissions drop significantly and are even below ambient concentrations both for DMC and MeFo in DI-mode. However, a higher relative share of sub-23 nm particles is observed among the low number of remaining particles, and the data of both particle systems is used for further analysis of size trends and volatility. While displaying ultra-low pollutant emissions, DMC and MeFo are also potentially CO2neutral substances, and their potential sustainable production using green electricity and waste CO2 will be also summarized. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative fuel; Combustion; DISI direct-injection (DI) spark-ignition (SI); DMC; E-fuel; Emission; Gasoline; MeFo; Nanoparticles; Particle size distribution; PMP; PtL; Solid particle number (PN); Sub-23 nm; Synthetic fuel","Alternative fuels; Ammonia; Beryllium compounds; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Direct injection; Engines; Gasoline; Ignition; Molecular oxygen; Nanoparticles; Neutron emission; Particle size; Size distribution; Synthetic fuels; Waste incineration; Condensation particle counters; Emission characteristics; MeFo; Nucleation mode particles; Particle concentrations; Solid particles; Spark ignition; Ultra low concentration; Particle size analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073700775

One commonality among such studies has been that platooning does provide a positive impact on traffic dynamics through increased average speeds, flow and capacity. Also due to platooning, fuel consumption is reduced and hence positively impacts the environment through reduced emissions. This is even more so when the percentage of automated vehicles is significantly higher than non-automated vehicles. While obvious that today's and near future highways will have automated and non-automated vehicles coexisting, research points towards homogeneity in order to fully realize the benefits of platooning. Research also indicates that when platooning allows maneuvers such as merging and splitting of platoons, these maneuvers present reduced benefits in traffic dynamics and consequently its impact on the environment. In light of these observations, this study presents a highway architecture that implements and controls lane and destination based fixed-routed platoons of automated vehicles with minimal lane changes. The study demonstrates that confining platoons to vehicles of same off-ramp destinations reduces the need for lane changes to a predetermined number, allows for more stable and longer strings of vehicle platoons of up to 24 vehicles per platoon. When compared to conventional traffic, the model presented shows between 135% and 156% increase in average speeds, 70% reduction in travel times and between 39% and 43.5% increase in highway throughput.

Use of saline water irrigation has become an important means for alleviating fresh water scarcity. However, long-term irrigation with saline water may cause salt accumulation in the soil, and further affect nitrogen transformation and N2O emission. For this, we conducted a 10-year field experiment to evaluate the effect of irrigation water salinity and N amount on N2O emission and denitrifier bacteria communities. The experimental design was a 2 × 2 factorial with two irrigation water salinity levels (0.35 and 8.04 dS m−1, representing SF and SH) and two N amounts (0 and 360 kg N ha−1, representing N0 and N360). The results indicated that long-term saline water irrigation significantly increased soil salinity, moisture, and NH4-N content, while decreased soil pH, NO3-N, organic matter, and total nitrogen. Irrigation with saline water significantly inhibited N2O emission, that was associated with a level decreased by 45.19% (N0) and 43.50% (N360) compared with irrigation with fresh water. N2O emission increased as the N amount increased, the N2O emission was 161% higher in the N360 treatment than in the N0 treatment. In the unfertilized plots, saline water irrigation significantly reduced the activity of denitrifying enzymes, the abundance of nirK, nirS, and nosZ, as well as the diversity of denitrifying bacteria communities. In the fertilized plots, saline water irrigation did not significantly affect the abundance of nosZ, while significantly reduced the abundance of nirK and nirS. Saline water irrigation and nitrogen application altered the community structures of denitrifying bacteria with nirK, nirS, and nosZ, irrigation water salinity seemed to be having a greater impact on denitrifying bacteria community in comparison with fertilization. LEfSe analysis demonstrated denitrifying bacterial potential biomarkers increased as the water salinity increased, meaning that saline water irrigation could alter community structures of denitrifying bacteria, and promote the growth of dominant species. Our findings indicate that increased abundance of nosZ, nirK, and nirS would promote N2O emission, and although long-term saline water reduced soil N2O emission, it resulted in continuous increase of soil salinity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Community structure; Denitrifying bacteria; High-throughput sequencing; N2O emission; Saline water",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070824949

However, the relationships of DOC chemical structure and microbial community composition with SOC mineralization, as well as the relative contributions of microbial decomposers and their substrates on the mineralization rate have rarely been examined. In a laboratory experiment, we incubated two typical cropland soils (an Entisol and a Mollisol) of China for 360 days under submerged and non-submerged conditions, and we evaluated the concentration and chemical structure of soil DOC, soil microbial metabolic potential and community composition by using total C/N analysis, solution-state 1H NMR, Biolog EcoPlates, and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, respectively. The results showed that submergence significantly increased DOC concentration (P &lt; 0.01) and microbial activity (P &lt; 0.001) and changed DOC chemical structure in the Entisol (P &lt; 0.01). In the Mollisol, it significantly increased the rate (P &lt; 0.01) and cumulative extent (P &lt; 0.001) of SOC mineralization and DOC concentration (P &lt; 0.01) as well as altering the composition of the microbial community (P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, the SOC mineralization rate was better explained by microbial community composition (Entisol: SPC = −0.71, P &lt; 0.001; Mollisol: SPC = 0.92, P &lt; 0.001) than by DOC concentration (Entisol: SPC = 0.21, P &gt; 0.05; Mollisol: SPC = 0.30, P &lt; 0.05) or DOC chemical structure (Entisol: SPC = 0.12, P &gt; 0.05; Mollisol: SPC = −0.45, P &lt; 0.001). Our study revealed that the bacterial community composition had a close relationship to the rate of submergence-induced SOC mineralization in both soils, but only DOC concentration and chemical structure were effective predictors of mineralization rate in the low-pH Mollisol. © 2019","Concentration and chemical structure of soil DOC; Cropland soils; Soil microbial metabolic potential and community composition; Solution-state 1H NMR; Submergence-induced SOC mineralization","Chemical analysis; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Mineralogy; Organic carbon; RNA; Underwater soils; Bacterial community composition; Community composition; Dissolved organic carbon; Laboratory experiments; Microbial communities; Microbial community composition; Submergence-induced SOC mineralization; Water extractable organic carbon; Structure (composition); carbon; dissolved organic matter; nitrogen; organic carbon; soil organic matter; agricultural land; dissolved organic carbon; microbial community; mineralization; soil organic matter; soil pollution; soil quality; submergence; amplicon; Article; carbon mineralization; chemical structure; concentration (parameter); controlled study; entisol soil; incubation time; metabolic parameters; microbial activity; microbial community; mineralization; mollisol soil; nonhuman; pH measurement; physical chemistry; physical parameters; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; sequence analysis; soil; soil analysis; soil property; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069684342

To be reliable, properly trained models need to be developed that combine output from sensors with weather data; however, many factors can affect the accuracy of the models. The main objective of this study was to explore the impact of several input variables in training different air quality indexes using fuzzy logic combined with two metaheuristic optimizations: simulated annealing (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). In this work, the concentrations of NO2 and CO were predicted using five resistivities from multisensor devices and three weather variables (temperature, relative humidity, and absolute humidity). In order to validate the results, several measures were calculated, including the correlation coefficient and the mean absolute error. Overall, PSO was found to perform the best. Finally, input resistivities of NO2 and nonmetanic hydrocarbons (NMHC) were found to be the most sensitive to predict concentrations of NO2 and CO. © 2019 by the authors.

There is a need to develop a model that is stable and that provides evidence of an objective burden sharing rule so that the environmental agreement is more acceptable. This study approaches this problem via a cooperative game at the global level to make International Environmental Agreements (IEA) more stable. For this purpose, we apply the Shapley value transfer mechanism and find that under the commitment scenario, some regions attain the maximum benefits by joining the coalition. Shapley value transfer improves the coalition size and increases the global benefits at a certain level of abatement under perfect cooperation. Imperfect cooperation leads to lower levels of global benefits. Our findings offer new implications on how to improve the international cooperation for climate change. Commitments by major regions could activate the IEA (e.g., Paris agreement) efficiently. For the maximum global response to climate change, the national governments must reformulate and implement policies to meet their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs).

Our results show that industry is the largest contributor of PM2.5. In addition, the contribution of key energy-related industries was as high as 29.5%, with the thermal power industry being the largest individual contributor. In January, the largest contribution came from residents, reaching 41.3%. Moreover, loose coal burning in rural areas contributed up to 19.4% in winter. Our results also show that the emission reduction scenario had palpable effects on the reduction of air pollution. The more the emissions of SO2, NOX, PM2.5, and PM10 were reduced, the more the average concentration was decreased. The implementation of energy conservation and emission reduction policies by industry and resident is conducive to improving the quality of the atmospheric environment.

Using the most recent generation of harmonized emission scenarios, the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) as input to a global chemistry transport and radiative transfer model, we provide estimates of the projected future global and regional burdens and radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosols under three contrasting pathways for air pollution levels: SSP1-1.9, SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0. We find that the broader range of future air pollution emission trajectories spanned by the SSPs compared to previous scenarios translates into total aerosol forcing estimates in 2100 relative to 1750 ranging from-0:04 in SSP1-1.9 to-0:51 W m-2 in SSP3-7.0. Compared to our 1750-2015 estimate of-0:55 W m-2, this shows that, depending on the success of air pollution policies and socioeconomic development over the coming decades, aerosol radiative forcing may weaken by nearly 95 % or remain close to the preindustrial to present-day level. In all three scenarios there is a positive forcing in 2100 relative to 2015, from 0.51 in SSP1-1.9 to 0.04 W m-2 in SSP3-7.0. Results also demonstrate significant differences across regions and scenarios, especially in South Asia and Africa. While rapid weakening of the negative aerosol forcing following effective air quality policies will unmask more of the greenhouse-gas-induced global warming, slow progress on mitigating air pollution will significantly enhance the atmospheric aerosol levels and risk to human health in these regions. In either case, the resulting impacts on regional and global climate can be significant. © 2017 Georg Thieme Verlag.

This provokes that the emissions levels in real-life conditions exceed the normative values, as shown in the recent scandal related to the NOx emissions from the passenger cars equipped with diesel engines. On the other hand, the upcoming emissions regulations will limit the CO2 emissions to very low levels, which demands a further optimization of the existing technology. One way to reduce the NOx and CO2 emissions is by electrifying the powertrain in a certain degree. The objective of this work is to evaluate the potential of implementing a parallel (P2) hybrid architecture in a compact car (class C) equipped with a diesel 1.6 Euro 6d-temp engine to reduce the emissions and fuel consumption in homologation and real-life driving cycles. This has been done using a 0D numerical vehicle model and the experimental engine maps of fuel consumption and emissions measured at steady state conditions. After that, the transient conditions were simulated in homologation cycles and real-life driving cycles measured by the authors in Spain. The numerical model was validated against experimental tests carried out in an active engine test bench, evidencing differences below 4% under the worldwide harmonized light vehicles test cycle (WLTC). In the real-life cycles, the hybridization of the powertrains improves the fuel consumption for all types of driving cycles (urban, combined and highway). The major benefits are obtained in urban driving cycles, with gains up to 50% in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. In addition, the improvements in real-life conditions are higher than in the urban phase of the homologation cycles. On the contrary, combined real-life cycles (urban + rural + highway) show lower benefits than the homologation cycle. This is due to different energy management strategy that needs to be adapted to each driving situation. Lastly, it was found that, contrarily to the case of the homologation cycle, the NOx emissions are not reduced with the hybridization of the diesel powertrain in real-life conditions. Thus, to achieve 2021 CO2 target (95 g/km) and to reduce aftertreatment systems in diesel engines, other vehicles technologies need to be added to the full hybridization. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Diesel internal combustion engines; Driving cycles; Emissions regulations; Hybrid powertrain","C (programming language); Carbon dioxide; Diesel engines; Energy management; Fuels; Hybrid powertrains; Life cycle; Nitrogen oxides; Aftertreatment systems; Driving cycle; Emissions regulations; Energy management strategies; Hybrid architectures; Steady-state condition; Transient conditions; Urban driving cycles; Automobile engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071548364

Although environmental impacts of wood combustion are worse than those of combustion of coal, a literature review revealed very few works investigating the effects of Biomass Power Plants (BPPs). Coal Power Plants made a significant contribution to atmospheric enrichment in Cr, Pb, Ni, Zn, As, Mn and V. Regarding Biomass Power Facilities (BPFs), waste-to-energy plant emissions were traced by Hg, Mn, Cu, As, V and Fe monitoring and the lichen biodiversity index. Works investigating wood-powered stations showed that emissions are consistent with the geochemical properties of substrates where forestall resources were grown (Al, Ti, V and Co enrichment), as well as the combustion of timber from both Short Rotation Forestries/Coppices and chemically treated demolition wood (Cu, Mn, Cr, As, Sb). Overall Cu, due to frequent detection within contaminants, may be considered a potential tracer of atmospheric emissions of BPFs. Two were the most important results of the review: a) important factors affecting the studies’ outcomes were stack height of the facility, wind speed and direction, monitoring stations density and distance from the point sources, b) improvements in the accurate detection of contamination levels/extent of the affected area and the association between facilities and spatial trend of atmospheric impacts can be obtained by the use of an internal control group, an a posteriori null hypothesis and quantitative relationships between winds and toxic substances. © 2019 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Better experimental design; Biomass power plants; Biomonitors; Coal power plants; Copper; Monitoring conditions",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072620366

Thus, any change in DOM composition, such as changes caused by flood waters as a result of storms and hurricanes, can subsequently affect estuarine environments. To investigate the impact of high flow events on riverine DOM, multidimensional molecular level information on DOM from four South Texas Rivers (Aransas, Lavaca, Mission, and Nueces Rivers) was acquired using high-resolution Ion Mobility Quadrupole Time of Flight Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (IM Q-TOF LCMS). Base-flow samples were collected in May, July, and October of 2016, June of 2017, and March of 2018, while high-flow samples were collected in September of 2017, as well as June and September of 2018. Based on the molecular formulas assigned from IM Q-TOF LCMS, the H/C ratio decreased during high-flow events (1.52 to 1.51 in ESI+ and 1.19 to 1.07 in ESI−), while the O/C ratio increased (0.31 to 0.33 in ESI−). Furthermore, DOM shifted from a protein-like and lipid-like dominated community at base flow conditions, to a lignin, tannin and condensed aromatic structure dominated community during high flow events, based on MS and tandem MS data. These changes in high-flow riverine DOM indicate an increase of terrestrial signal, which is likely a result of mobilization of terrestrial organic matter from the watersheds by flooding. The mobilized DOM, though refractory at high-flow conditions in rivers, could be reactive in coastal regions when conditions change, and thus could potentially fuel microbial activities downstream. In addition, about 3.76–21.8% of DOM molecules contain structural isomers among different flow conditions. This low number of isomer percentages suggests that DOM, as the products of various enzymatic biochemical reactions, is constrained in the number of isomers. Taken together, results from our study provide insights into structural changes of riverine DOM in response to extreme climate events in subtropical regions and have implications in understanding biogeochemical changes in estuaries under a changing climate. © Copyright © 2019 Lu and Liu.","high flow; hurricane harvey; liquid chromatography mass spectrometry; riverine dissolved organic matter; South Texas; structural isomers",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074947287

Developing future projections of regional climate over China is an indispensable step for designing appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies against future climate change. To this end, this study focuses on exploring how the regional climate over China, including the mean and extreme climate, will be affected in the context of global warming throughout this century. The RegCM model is used to develop high-resolution climate scenarios for the whole country of China driven by boundary conditions of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) model under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). RegCM performance on simulating the present climate over China is evaluated and the results indicate that it is capable of reproducing the spatial distributions of temperature and precipitation. Future projections from RegCM suggest that an increase of 2 °C in daily mean temperature is expected in China by the end of the twenty-first century under RCP4.5 while an increase of 4 °C would be seen under RCP8.5. The Tibetan Plateau is likely to expect the most substantial temperature increase as well as the most significant decrease in extreme cold climate in China. In comparison, the annual total precipitation over China is projected to increase by 58 mm/year at the end of the twenty-first century under RCP4.5 and by 71 mm/year under RCP8.5. The projected changes in precipitation show apparent spatial variability due to the influences of local topography and land cover/use. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","China; Climate change; Extreme index; Precipitation; RegCM; Regional climate modeling; Temperature","climate change; climate modeling; extreme event; global warming; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; spatial variation; temperature anomaly; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069859238

Reconstructing microbial metabolic activity rates in these regions has been challenging, due to the technical difficulty of direct rate measurements. In Cariaco Basin, which is the largest permanently anoxic marine basin and an important model system for geobiology, long-term monitoring has yielded time series for the concentrations of biologically important compounds; however, the underlying metabolite fluxes remain poorly quantified. Here, we present a computational approach for reconstructing vertical fluxes and in situ net production/consumption rates from chemical concentration data, based on a 1-dimensional time-dependent diffusive transport model that includes adaptive penalization of overfitting. We use this approach to estimate spatiotemporally resolved fluxes of oxygen, nitrate, hydrogen sulfide, ammonium, methane, and phosphate within the sub-euphotic Cariaco Basin water column (depths 150–900 m, years 2001–2014) and to identify hotspots of microbial chemolithotrophic activity. Predictions of the fitted models are in excellent agreement with the data and substantially expand our knowledge of the geobiology in Cariaco Basin. In particular, we find that the diffusivity, and consequently fluxes of major reductants such as hydrogen sulfide, and methane, is about two orders of magnitude greater than previously estimated, thus resolving a long-standing apparent conundrum between electron donor fluxes and measured dark carbon assimilation rates. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Cariaco Basin; chemolithoautotroph; geobiology; inverse transport modeling; redoxcline","metabolism; metabolite; methane; microbial activity; redox conditions; Atlantic Ocean; Cariaco Basin; Caribbean Sea; sea water; anaerobic growth; archaeon; bacterium; chemistry; chemoautotrophy; metabolism; microflora; theoretical model; Venezuela; Anaerobiosis; Archaea; Bacteria; Chemoautotrophic Growth; Microbiota; Models, Theoretical; Seawater; Venezuela",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071920220

In line with this, various low-carbon city (LCC) indicator systems have been established across the world. However, there are only few studies available investigating if the established LCC indicators have been effectively utilized in practice. Through a comprehensive literature review, this study composed a list of LCC indicators (LCCIL), which were classified into eight dimensions, namely, economy, energy use, social aspect, carbon and environment, urban mobility, solid waste, water, and land use. The quotation frequency of LCCIL indicators in 10 LCC indicator systems addressed in academia was reviewed. The application frequency of LCCIL indicators in 21 global cities was then examined. A comparative study was then conducted between academia and practice across these eight dimensions of LCCIL. The results reveal that (1) LCCIL indicators have not been effectively utilized in practice; (2) None of the LCCIL indicators related to social aspect has been used in practice; 3) The indicator “total carbon emission” has extensively been applied in practice, but it has not been used in academia. 4) The most popular LCCIL dimension in academia has been energy use, while urban mobility has mostly been in practice.

Despite a growing literature on bird-building collisions, little research has been conducted in downtown areas of major cities, and no studies have included stadiums, which can be extremely large, often have extensive glass surfaces and lighting, and therefore may cause many bird collisions. Further, few studies have assessed the role of nighttime lighting in increasing collisions, despite the often-cited importance of this factor, or considered collision correlates for different seasons and bird species. We conducted bird collision monitoring over four migration seasons at 21 buildings, including a large multi-use stadium, in downtown Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA. We used a rigorous survey methodology to quantify among-building variation in collisions and assess how building features (e.g., glass area, lighting, vegetation) influence total collision fatalities, fatalities for separate seasons and species, and numbers of species colliding. Four buildings, including the stadium, caused a high proportion of all collisions and drove positive effects of glass area and amount of surrounding vegetation on most collision variables. Excluding these buildings from analyses resulted in slightly different collision predictors, suggesting that factors leading some buildings to cause high numbers of collisions are not the exact same factors causing variation among more typical buildings. We also found variation in collision correlates between spring and fall migration and among bird species, that factors influencing collision fatalities also influence numbers of species colliding, and that the proportion, and potentially area, of glass lighted at night are associated with collisions. Thus, reducing bird collisions at large buildings, including stadiums, should be achievable by reducing glass area (or treating existing glass), reducing light emission at night, and prioritizing mitigation efforts for glass surfaces near vegetated areas and/or avoiding use of vegetation near glass. © 2019 Loss et al.

Venizelou 70, Kallithea, 176 76, Greece","By accounting for both the supply and demand of ecosystem services (ES), it is possible to identify where ES are not able to satisfy human needs. In addition, human demands for natural resources continue to grow rapidly, risking the short supply of ES. Consequently, understanding the balance between ES supply and demand can facilitate sustainable spatial planning and enhance the quality of life. The ES framework followed in this study allowed us to identify spatial similarities and mismatches between the biophysical capacity of ecosystems to provide benefits and societal needs. Specifically, this study revealed the spatial mismatches between the supply and demand of three ES (food provision, climate regulation, and recreation), through identifying zones where excess supply and demand occur on the Ionian Islands (Western Greece). ES supply was quantified from biophysical indicators, while ES demand was estimated through economic valuation. Due to the complexity of ES and the different type of values (direct and indirect use values), a combination of two valuation methods, namely the market prices and the benefit transfer method, was employed to map ES demand. To reveal the spatial relationship between the supply of services and societal demand, a supply-demand ratio was used. The results showed that cropland and urban areas presented high demand for all three ES, due to the high presence of the human population, along with tourism activities. In comparison, more than 50% of the Ionian Islands are characterized by natural forests and olive orchards, leading large areas to be dominated by excess ES supply or by similar amounts of both ES supply and demand. The hot spot analysis (Getis-Ord Gi* statistic) that was used, delineated zones with high connectivity, which could facilitate the prioritization of conservation areas. For areas where an unsustainable regime exists, we suggested how to maintain or shift current spatial policies to improve the decision-making process. In conclusion, the framework used identified compact ES zones in which diverse landscapes of the Ionian Islands allowed the existence of a balanced situation, signifying that human's demands for ES were for the most part fulfilled. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biophysical indicators; Decision-making; Economic valuation; Ecosystem services; Hot spot analysis; Ionian Islands","bioindicator; decision making; demand analysis; ecosystem service; spatial analysis; spatial mismatch; statistical analysis; sustainable development; valuation; Aegean Islands; Greece; Ionian Islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071138913

Moreover, they are costly and entail a significant carbon footprint in many cases. Innovative biological approaches based on phototrophic microorganisms have recently emerged as promising alternatives to overcome those limitations. This work evaluated the removal of 19 veterinary drugs (i.e., 16 antibiotics, 1 analgesic, 1 anti-parasitic and 1 hormone) from piggery wastewater (PWW) in two open photobioreactors (PBR) operated with a consortium of microalgae-bacteria (AB-PBR) and purple photosynthetic bacteria (PPB-PBR). Multiple hydraulic retention times (HRT), in particular 11, 8 and 4 days, were tested during stage I, II and III, respectively. Ten out of 19 target compounds were detected with inlet drug concentrations ranging from ‘non-detected’ (n.d.) to almost 23,000 ng L−1 for the antibiotic oxytetracycline. Moreover, three of the antibiotics (i.e., enrofloxacin, sulfadiazine and oxytetracycline) were found at concentrations above the analytical linearity range in some or all of the samples under study. AB-PBR supported higher removal efficiencies (REs) than PPB-PBR, except for danofloxacin. Overall, REs progressively decreased when decreasing the HRT. The highest REs (&gt;90%) were observed for doxycycline (95 ± 3%) and oxytetracycline (93 ± 3%) in AB-PBR during stage I. The other drugs, except sulfadimidine that was the most recalcitrant, showed REs above 70% during stage I in the same photobioreactor. In contrast, no removal was observed for danofloxacin in AB-PBR during stage III, sulfadimidine in PPB-PBR during stage III or marbofloxacin in PPB-PBR during the entire experiment. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Algal-bacterial processes; Contaminants of emerging concern; Emerging pollutants; Microcontaminants; PPB; Swine manure","Algae; Antibiotics; Carbon footprint; Fertilizers; Manures; Photobioreactors; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Emerging pollutants; Hydraulic retention time; Micro-contaminants; Oxytetracyclines (OTC); Phototrophic microorganisms; Purple photosynthetic bacteria; Swine manure; Bacteria; danofloxacin; enrofloxacin; oxytetracycline; sulfadiazine; sulfadimidine; tetracycline derivative; veterinary drug; veterinary drug; bacterium; bioreactor; chemical pollutant; drug; manure; microalga; wastewater treatment; Article; bioremediation; Chlorella; Chlorella kessieri; Chlorella minutissima; Chlorella vulgaris; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental management; microbial consortium; nonhuman; piggery wastewater; priority journal; steady state; swine manure; waste component removal; waste water; animal; animal husbandry; bacterium; devices; metabolism; microalga; microbiology; photobioreactor; pig; procedures; Proteobacteria; sewage; waste water; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Photobacteria; Proteobacteria; Suidae; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Bacteria; Microalgae; Microbial Consortia; Photobioreactors; Proteobacteria; Sus scrofa; Veterinary Drugs; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069740172

In this preliminary study, we analyzed and quantitatively assessed the differences between monsoon and inter-monsoon seasons, in terms of radiative effects at surface and columnar heating rate, of clear-sky biomass burning aerosols (no clouds) using ground-based lidar observations obtained with a 355 nm elastic lidar instrument, deployed since 2012 at the Physics Department of Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM). The model-based back-trajectory analysis put in evidence that, during the monsoon seasons (November-March and June-September), the air masses advected towards the observational site transit over active fire hotspot regions, in contrast with the inter-monsoon season. In between the monsoon seasons (April-May, October), the atmosphere over Penang is constituted by local background urban aerosols that originate from road traffic emissions, domestic cooking, and industrial plants emissions. The analysis was carried out using the vertically-resolved profiles of the seasonal averaged aerosol optical properties (monsoon vs. inter-monsoon seasons), e.g., the atmospheric extinction coefficient, to evaluate the seasonal surface aerosol radiative effect and column heating rate differences through the Fu-Liou-Gu (FLG) radiative transfer model. The results put in evidence that the biomass burning advection during the monsoon season (especially during the South West monsoon from June to September) lowers the noon daytime incoming solar shortwave solar radiation reaching the Earth surface with respect to the local background conditions by 91.5 W/m2 (114-69 W/m2). The aerosols also lead to an averaged heating in the first kilometer of the atmosphere of about 4.9 K/day (6.4-3.4 W/m2). The two combined effects, i.e., less absorbed energy by Earth surface and warming of the first kilometer of the boundary layer, increase the low-level stability during monsoon seasons, with a possible reduction in cloud formation and precipitation. The net effect is to exacerbate the haze episodes, as the pollutants rest trapped into the boundary layer. Besides these considerations, the lidar measurements are of great interest in this particular world region and might be used for cal/val of the future space missions, e. g., Earthcare. © 2019 by the authors.","Aerosol optical depth; Biomass burning; Haze; Lidar; Monsoon season; Planetary boundary layer; Radiative transfer","Aerosols; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Biomass; Boundary layers; Budget control; Heating rate; Industrial emissions; Industrial plants; Optical properties; Precipitation (meteorology); Radiative transfer; Uncertainty analysis; Aerosol optical depths; Biomass-burning; Haze; Monsoon season; Planetary boundary layers; Optical radar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075369892

As of crop production, the results show that paddy rice, oilseeds, sugarcane, cocoa, coffee, and sesame production could experience a decline under both moderate and harsh climate conditions in most cases.

Through a case study of the photovoltaics poverty alleviation (PVPA) initiative—an ambitious and experimental programme that explores the synergy between renewable energy and sustainable development by using photovoltaics to generate income for impoverished households and communities—this paper critically examines this top-down mode of experimentation from a multi-level perspective based on Heilmann's experimentation under hierarchy framework. Drawing from empirical evidence collected over two years from a PVPA pilot, we show that China's multi-level approach to experimentation requires dynamic mechanisms that enable not only the adaptation of national-level models to specific locations but also the incorporation of local implementation lessons in national policymaking. The resulting experimental governance thus extends from a combination of top-down mechanisms of control, local responses, and the broader contradictions that emerge from their interactions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Co-benefits; Low-carbon experimentation; Multi-level governance; Renewable energy; Sustainable development","alternative energy; cost-benefit analysis; governance approach; policy implementation; policy making; poverty alleviation; solar power; sustainable development; top-down control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074164384

Nevertheless, little is known about the long-term fate of the carbon that may become stored in fjordic sediments. One of the main reasons for this knowledge gap is that carbon arriving on the seafloor is prone to post-depositional degradation, posing a great challenge when trying to discriminate between an actual change in the carbon deposition rate and post-depositional carbon loss. In this study, we evaluate the use of modern benthic foraminifera as bio-indicators of organic carbon content in six voes (fjords) on the west coast of Shetland. Benthic foraminifera are known to be sensitive to changes in organic carbon content in the sediments, and changes in their assemblage composition therefore reflect synchronous variations in the quantity and quality of carbon reaching the seafloor. We identified four environments based on the relationship between benthic foraminiferal assemblages and organic carbon content in the sediments: (1) land-locked regions influenced by riverine and/or freshwater inputs of organic matter, namely the head of fjords with a restricted geomorphology; (2) stressed environments with a heavily stratified water column and sediments rich in organic matter of low nutritional value; (3) depositional environments with moderate organic content and mild or episodic current activity; and (4) marginal to coastal settings with low organic content, such as fjords with an unrestricted geomorphology.

Therefore, this paper promotes a Drivers-Pressures-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework to investigate the critical socioeconomic influencing factors of SO2 emissions in China at the city level. To solve the heteroscedasticity of the data, this paper analyzes multiple time points (two-year periods) from 2004 to 2016 based on the WLS model to capture the variations of these factors. The empirical results reveal that, during the study period, the urbanization process continuously contributes to the reduction of SO2 emissions in China through the scale effect of population aggregation; the positive contribution made by economic growth has steadily risen; and the optimization of the industrial structure has gradually decreased emissions, demonstrating the benefits of implementing effective desulfurization policies. The positive contribution of industrial land-use intensity is shown to have gradually decreased due to improvements in energy efficiency. The current government policies such as command-controlled environmental regulation and biased government technical input are found to have increased SO2 emissions. Improvements at the corporate level are shown to have helped to improve environmental pollution. The positive contribution effect of markets on SO2 emissions shows a decreasing trend with a degree of fluctuation. These findings provide a comprehensive insight into the task of understanding the key socioeconomic impact factors of industrial SO2 emissions and their dynamics against the backdrop of sustainable development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","China; DPSIR framework; SO2 emissions; Variation effects; Weighted Least squares model","Economics; Energy efficiency; Environmental regulations; Industrial emissions; Land use; Population statistics; Sustainable development; China; Dpsir frameworks; SO2 emissions; Variation effects; Weighted least squares models; Economic and social effects; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; industrial emission; least squares method; literature review; pollution incidence; socioeconomic impact; sulfur dioxide; urban pollution; article; China; city; desulfurization; driver; government; human; industrial area; least square analysis; market; sustainable development; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070912970

Existing studies mainly focus on the causes of national aggregate emission changes. However, considering the large differences among provinces in China and their close economic linkages, it is necessary to develop a provincial-level analysis to shape provincial policies for emission reduction. Using the multi-regional input-output (MRIO) tables of 30 provinces in China and adopting structural decomposition analysis, we analyze how changes in the end-of-pipe treatment, cleaner production, economic production structure, domestic final use, domestic exports and international exports drive national and provincial SO2 emissions. Decomposition results show that during 2002–2010 the absolute value of each effect based on the MRIO model is higher than that based on the national aggregate input-output model, which indicates that the existing studies adopting the national average data conceal the variation in the driving factors and underestimate their contributions to SO2 emission changes. The decomposition results based on MRIO model further show that the end-of-pipe treatment and cleaner production are the major emission reduction factors for all provinces, and the effect of the former has noticeably increased during 2007–2010. For the eastern provinces, interestingly, the economic production structure becomes a major emission reduction factor during the period of 2007–2010. Changes in domestic final demand, domestic exports and international exports exhibit significantly different contributions among provinces. The increased final demand in eastern provinces largely drive SO2 emissions for all provinces. Based on the above findings, policy implications that address the SO2 emission reduction issues are proposed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Multi-regional input-output model; Pollutant emission reduction; Regional difference; Structural decomposition analysis","Aggregates; Digital storage; Emission control; Public policy; China; Input output model; Pollutant emission; Regional differences; Structural decomposition analysis; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070319545

Here, the relationships between boundary layer structure and PM2.5 under different synoptic patterns were analysed. Firstly, the wintertime synoptic circulation patterns in Shanghai have been classified into seven types using the obliquely rotated Principal Components in T-mode (PCT) method based on the 925 hPa geopotential data. Then, the fine-resolution sounding-derived structures of planetary boundary layer (PBL) in these patterns, including PBL height (PBLH), inversion base height, and inversion intensity, combined with the relative humidity (RH) and temperature were analysed with respect to PM2.5. The results showed that three typical patterns, including high pressure located to the west, and those to the southwest and south of Shanghai, accounted for 62.17% of the total number of cases characterized by high PM2.5 concentrations. The north-westerly winds were found to dominate these specific synoptic patterns, causing severe pollution when polluted air masses from the northwest region of China were brought into Shanghai. The local meteorological factors within the PBL also influenced PM2.5 to varying extent in Shanghai under different synoptic conditions. Particularly, the PM2.5 concentrations were anti-correlated with PBLH (R = -0.2 at 0800 Beijing Local Time (BJT); R = -0.3 at 2000 BJT). Also, temperature inversion played an important role in aerosol pollution. The intensity of temperature inversion was slightly correlated with PM2.5 (R = 0.13). The base height of the temperature inversion was more closely anti-correlated with PM2.5 (R = -0.25). The frequent near-surface temperature inversions in the latter two synoptic patterns were unfavourable for the spread and dispersion of aerosol pollutants in the PBL, thus leading to severe aerosol pollution. This study has important implications for better understanding of the association of atmospheric circulation patterns with air pollution episodes in Shanghai. © 2019","Inversion; Planetary boundary layer; PM2.5; Shanghai; Synoptic circulation pattern","Aerosols; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Boundary layers; Climatology; Inversion; Planetary boundary layers; PM2.5; Shanghai; Synoptic circulations; Air pollution; aerosol; air mass; atmospheric circulation; atmospheric pollution; boundary layer; geopotential; haze; high pressure; inverse analysis; particulate matter; relative humidity; synoptic meteorology; winter; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067259333

However, the GHG emissions associated with the operation and construction of URT systems are of public and scientific concern. Although some efforts have been made to reduce GHG emissbions owing to URT, the mitigation potential of construction-related GHG emissions is yet to be exploited. To achieve this potential, innovations and optimization in construction methods and management are required. In this study, the mitigation potential of GHG emissions from prefabricated structures in subway stations is investigated. The results show that the construction of a unit length prefabricated section generates 12.59% less GHG emissions than those of the cast-in-site section. In particular, embodied emissions from building materials drop by 14.38% in prefabricated structures, which is achieved by structural optimization and a lower attrition rate. Moreover, off-site prefabrication enables the adoption of cleaner fuel. In the case station, GHG emissions from natural gases account for 83.86% of the total fuel-based emissions at a prefabrication site; therefore, the fuel-based emissions of prefabrication have been significantly mitigated. Another mitigation source comes from the contribution of reduced labor; it is estimated that an extra 0.780t CO2.eq. is saved for the construction of a 1-m prefabricated section through the saved living facilities of on-site workers. In addition, the adaptability of prefabricated structures is checked under different service levels, and results indicate that the proposed widening scheme loses its mitigation efficiency when the width increment exceeds 2 m. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Construction; GHG emissions mitigation; Prefabricated structures; Service level; Subway station","Construction; Fuels; Gas emissions; Light rail transit; Structural optimization; Subway stations; Urban transportation; Chinese Government; Construction method; Different services; GHG emission; Mitigation efficiency; Prefabricated structures; Service levels; Urban rail transit; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069569240

A big challenge facing the CAM research community is to understand the function of the annotated genes in CAM plant genomes. Recently, a new genome editing technology using CRISPR/Cas9 has become a more precise and powerful tool than traditional approaches for functional genomics research in C3 and C4 plants. In this study, we explore the potential of CRISPR/Cas9 to characterize the function of CAM-related genes in the model CAM species Kalanchoë fedtschenkoi. We demonstrate that CRISPR/Cas9 is effective in creating biallelic indel mutagenesis to reveal previously unknown roles of blue light receptor phototropin 2 (KfePHOT2) in the CAM pathway. Knocking out KfePHOT2 reduced stomatal conductance and CO2 fixation in late afternoon and increased stomatal conductance and CO2 fixation during the night, indicating that blue light signaling plays an important role in the CAM pathway. Lastly, we provide a genome-wide guide RNA database targeting 45 183 protein-coding transcripts annotated in the K. fedtschenkoi genome. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Within three hours, from midday to early afternoon, the contribution of secondary aerosols above the planetary boundary layer (PBL) increased by a factor of three to five, and the coatings on black carbon (BC) also increased and enhanced its absorption efficiency by 50%. This tended to result from the intensive actinic flux received above the PBL which promoted photochemical reactions. The absorption of BC could be further amplified by the strong reflection of solar radiation over the cloud top across the PBL. This enhanced heating effect of BC introduced by combined processes (intensive solar radiation, secondary formation and cloud reflection) may considerably increase the temperature inversion above the PBL. This mechanism should be considered when evaluating the radiative impact of BC, especially for polluted regions receiving strong solar radiation. © 2019 The Author(s).

Comparative phytolith studies are essential for finding phytolith morphotypes with taxonomic relevance. These are used to build reference collections for future palaeoecological and archaeobotanical studies. Biogenic silica extracted from the leaves of six woody species commonly occurring in temperate climate plant communities was examined using light and scanning electron microscope methods (Deciduous broad-leaved species: Corylus avellana, Fagus sylvatica, Quercus robur. Coniferous species: Abies alba, Picea abies, Pinus sylvestris). The element content of phytoliths was analysed by SEM EDX and the phytolith taxonomic diagnostic potential of element content was tested by discriminant analysis. An inventory of phytolith types with their anatomical origin was provided and type-frequencies were assessed. Three species have been systematically screened here for the first time in detail (C. avellana, F. sylvatica, Q. robur). This is the first time that a characteristic cubical phytolith morphotype (“Picea—blocky type”) originating from transfusion tissue was described as a distinct layer encompassing the central cylinder of the needle. High concentrations of aluminium and magnesium in phytoliths are associated with two of three conifer species. A. alba and P. sylvestris could be differentiated statistically on the basis of elemental content. Our findings open up the possibility to identify these taxa based on their phytoliths and it is anticipated that this could be a useful tool for phytolith identification originating from soils and sediments as well. Moreover, Picea—blocky type allows comparative, in situ studies (amongst others isotopic) to provide the possibility of finding further measurable proxies. © 2019, The Author(s).","Biogenic silica; Conifers; Elemental content; Phytolith; Picea abies; SEM EDX",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063006766

The variations in the exposure level are determined by spatiotemporal variations in the PM2.5 concentration and population. To better guide public policies that aim to reduce the population exposure level, it is essential to explicitly decompose and assess the impacts of different factors. This study took advantage of high-resolution satellite observations to characterize the long-term variations in population exposure to outdoor PM2.5 for cities in the GBA region during the three most-recent Five-Year Plan (FYP) periods (2001-2015). A new decomposition method was then used to assess the impact of PM2.5 variations and demographic changes on the exposure variation. Within the decomposition framework, an index of pollution-population-coincidence-induced PM2.5 exposure (PPCE) was introduced to characterize the interaction of PM2.5 and the population distribution. The results showed that the 15-year average PPCE levels in all cities were positive (e.g., 6 μg/m3 in Guangzhou), suggesting that unfavorable city planning had led to people dwelling in polluted areas. An analyses of the spatial differences in PM2.5 changes showed that urban areas experienced a greater decrease in PM2.5 concentration than did rural areas in most cities during the 11th (2006-2010) and 12th (2011-2015) FYP periods. These spatial differences in PM2.5 changes reduced the PPCE levels of these cities and thus reduced the exposure levels (by as much as -0.58 μg/m3/year). The population migration resulting from rapid urbanization, however, increased the PPCE and exposure levels (by as much as 0.18 μg/m3/year) in most cities during the three FYP periods considered. Dongguan was a special case in that the demographic change reduced the exposure level because of its rapid development of residential areas in cleaner regions adjacent to Shenzhen. The exposure levels in all cities remained high because of the high mean PM2.5 concentrations and their positive PPCE. To better protect public health, control efforts should target densely populated areas and city planning should locate more people in cleaner areas. © 2019 by the authors.","City planning; Environmental policy; PM2.5; Public health; Satellite observation","Decomposition; Environmental protection; Housing; Planning; Pollution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Public health; Satellites; Urban planning; Decomposition methods; Environmental policy; High resolution satellites; PM2.5; Rapid urbanizations; Satellite observations; Spatial differences; Spatio-temporal variation; Public policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075367586

Energy transition pursues systematic changes to the low-carbon society, and it can benefit from technological and institutional advancement in smart cities. The integration of the energy transition to smart city development has not been thoroughly studied yet. The purpose of this study is to find empirical evidence of smart cities' contributions to energy transition. The hypothesis is that there is a significant difference between smart and non-smart cities in the performance of energy transition. The Smart Energy Transition Index is introduced. Index is useful to summarize the smart city component's contribution to energy transition and to enable comparison among cities. The cities in South Korea are divided into three groups: (1) first-wave smart cities that focus on smart transportation and security services; (2) second-wave smart cities that provide comprehensive urban services; and (3) non-smart cities. The results showed that second-wave smart cities scored higher than first-wave and non-smart cities, and there is a statistically significant difference among city groups.

Challenges remain since such simple comparisons cannot concretely prove that the simulation of urban climate behaviours is reliable. Studies without systematic model evaluations, being ambiguous or arbitrary to some extent, may lead to some seemingly new but scientifically misleading findings.</p> To tackle these challenges, this article proposes a methodological framework for the model evaluation of high-resolution urban climate simulations and demonstrates its effectiveness with a case study in the area of Shenzhen and Hong Kong SAR, China.

The aridity index (AI), defined as the ratio of annual precipitation (Pre) to atmospheric evaporation (potential evapotranspiration [PET]), represents an efficient indicator of climatic changes. However, the variations and underlying drivers of AI values have not been comprehensively compared in different climatic regions. Using the AI calculated on the basis of bias-corrected precipitation and optimized PET over the period of 1999–2017 and two climate model projections for the coming century, we investigated the response of the AI to climate change and quantified the contributions of climatic factors to AI variations in eight climatic regions in China, that is, the northwest (NW), north-centre (NC), northeast (NE), North China Plain (NCP), east (E), southeast (SE), southwest (SW) and Tibet Plateau (TP). The results indicated that the AI values in seven of the eight climate regions exhibited negative trends from 1999 to 2017, with mean values ranging from −0.0008 in SW to −0.0414 in NC, while the AI values in the TP region showed a significant positive trend, with a value of 0.0124. Pre was the dominant factor for the variations in AI values in all climate regions, with contribution rates from 65 to 308%, followed by decreasing solar radiation in the NW, NC, E, SE and SW regions; deceasing wind speed in NE and NCP; and deceasing actual vapour pressure in the TP. The effect of increasing temperature on the AI trend was offset by other climate factors. By the end of the 21st century, under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 emission scenario, the AI will significantly increase in five of the eight regions to values approximately 16.5% higher than those during 1999–2017, and this increase in the AI will be dominated by increasing PET. Overall, the shift in the dominant AI factor from Pre in recent years to PET in the future indicates that more attention should be given to the response of the AI to global warming. Furthermore, regional differences in climate change and AI values during 2018–2,100 will inevitably influence water availability and urgently require the development of adaptation strategies for different climatic regions. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","aridity index; attribution; climatic regions; global climate models (GCMs)","Evapotranspiration; Global warming; Wind; Anthropogenic climate changes; Aridity index; attribution; Climatic regions; Corrected precipitation; Global climate model; Increasing temperatures; Potential evapotranspiration; Climate models; aridity; climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; comparative study; evapotranspiration; precipitation (climatology); trend analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066893311

Various vehicle emission control policies have been implemented at great cost, but there is a lack of appropriate methods to evaluate the effectiveness of such policies. Here we developed a wavelet transform method (WTM) to evaluate the effectiveness of vehicle emission control policies during the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, taking advantage of high-timeresolution mobile measurements of NO, NOx, BC, CO, SO2, and O3 made around the 4th Ring Road of Beijing. The WTM decomposed on-road mobile measurements into highand low-frequency components, where the former represents immediate vehicle emissions, and the latter represents the atmospheric background in addition to accumulated onroad emissions. The high-frequency component of the WTM (CH_freq:), which represents the concentrations of pollutants from vehicle emissions (Cveh:), was used to evaluate the changes in vehicle emission intensity in the full-APEC period (3-12 November 2014) relative to the pre-APEC (28 October to 2 November 2014) and post-APEC (13-22 November 2014) periods, during which different vehicle emission control policies were implemented. Our results suggest that the Cveh: of NO, NOx, BC, and CO in the full-APEC period were 19.4 %, 17.7 %, 0.0 %, and 50.0 % lower, respectively, than those in the pre-APEC period during daytime and were 50.0 %, 47.3 %, 62.5 %, and 50.0 % lower than those in the post-APEC period during daytime. The Cveh: of NO, NOx, BC, and CO in the full-APEC period were 65.3 %, 65.4 %, 14.3 %, and 50.0 % lower than those in the post-APEC period during night-time.

However, at the same time, port production activities also consume various resources, such as water, electricity, coal, and land. In addition, ports inevitably produce waste-solid, water, gas, and other pollutants-which damages the environment of their hinterland cities, hindering the growth of urban GDP. Therefore, this study sought to build a reasonable system dynamics model to measure the positive and negative effects of ports on cities, and to put forward countermeasures and suggestions for promoting port-city green cooperative development. We selected Shanghai Port as a case study, estimated its parameters with 2010-2017 data, and tested the historical fitness of the model. We then carried out a scheme simulation by changing relevant parameters and comparing coordinated port-city development under different schemes. The simulation results show that increases in sea transportation activity and economic pull coefficients help to propel the growth of port-city GDP to a certain extent, but also cause environmental pollution and resource wastage. Therefore, effective energy-saving and emission-reduction measures are needed to achieve the coordinated development of economic growth and green environmental protection in ports and cities. © 2019 by the authors.","Green development; Port city; Simulation research; System dynamics","cargo; economic growth; emission control; environmental fate; environmental protection; Gross Domestic Product; simulation; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074854503

Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) observed by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) has offered unprecedented opportunities for monitoring land photosynthesis, while its sparse coverage remains a bottleneck for mapping finer-resolution GPP globally. Here, we used the global, OCO-2-based SIF product (GOSIF) and linear relationships between SIF and GPP to map GPP globally at a 0.05° spatial resolution and 8-day time step for the period from 2000 to 2017. To account for the uncertainty of GPP estimates resulting from the SIF-GPP relationship, we used a total of eight SIF-GPP relationships with different forms (universal and biome-specific, with and without intercept) at both site and grid cell levels to estimate GPP. Our results showed that all of the eight SIF-GPP relationships performed well in estimating GPP globally. The ensemble mean 8-day GPP was generally highly correlated with flux tower GPP for 91 eddy covariance flux sites across the globe (R2 = 0.74, Root Mean Square Error = 1.92 g C m-2 d-1). Our fine-resolution GPP estimates showed reasonable spatial and seasonal variations across the globe and fully captured both seasonal cycles and spatial patterns present in our coarse-resolution (1°) GPP estimates based on coarse-resolution SIF data directly aggregated from discrete OCO-2 soundings. SIF-GPP relationships with different forms could lead to significant differences in annual GPP particularly in the tropics. Our ensemble global annual GPP estimate (135.5 ± 8.8 Pg C yr-1) is between the median estimate of non-process based methods and the median estimate of process-based models. Our GPP estimates showed interannual variability in many regions and exhibited increasing trends in many parts of the globe particularly in the Northern Hemisphere. With the availability of high-quality, gridded SIF observations from space (e.g., TROPOMI, FLEX), our novel approach does not rely on any other input data (e.g., climate data, soil properties) and therefore can map GPP solely based on satellite SIF observations and potentially lead to more accurate GPP estimates at regional to global scales. The use of a universal SIF-GPP relationship versus biome-specific relationships can also avoid the uncertainty associated with land cover maps. Our novel, independent GPP product (GOSIF GPP), freely available at our data repository, will be valuable for studying photosynthesis, carbon cycle, agricultural production, and ecosystem responses to climate change and disturbances, informing ecosystem management, and benchmarking terrestrial biosphere and Earth system models. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon cycle; Carbon fluxes; Climate change; Earth system models; Ecosystem models; FLUXNET; Gross primary productivity; Model benchmarking; Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2; Sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence","Aggregates; Agriculture; Benchmarking; Carbon; Chlorophyll; Climate change; Climate models; Earth (planet); Ecosystems; Fluorescence; Information management; Mapping; Mean square error; Observatories; Orbits; Photosynthesis; Plants (botany); Carbon cycles; Carbon fluxes; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Earth system model; Ecosystem model; FluxNet; Gross primary productivity; Model benchmarking; Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2; Uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074661012

However, not all this sandstones are with good physical properties, and hence, the sedimentary characteristics and depositional evolution is believed to be critical to prediction of reservoir. It is determined that wave-dominated clastic littoral deposits with no barrier are the main depositional environment based on the modern sedimentary theory and related data analysis including ancient landform characteristics. And transitional zone, shoreface, foreshore, backshore and dune are considered as the five subenvironments. Through data of high resolution dipmeter logging and imaging logging, different sedimentary structures and other facies marks observed from cores of research regions are demarcated, and thirteen microfacies are further identified.

Following the lead of the first autonomous surface ship by Norway that met to develop the Advanced Autonomous Waterborne Application (AAWA) and introduce of autonomous operation to the region, this study also aims to compare the initiation of action by surface ships to that of the air and land vehicle automation. Design/methodology/approach: The ideas for writing this paper came from meeting and interview with maritime professionals such as ship captains, marine chief engineers and naval architects. Through the review of various international journals, the development of Autonomy and Technology are explored and analysed. Owing to the practical approach of this paper, a qualitative research method is used with collecting and analysing information. Findings: The findings of this paper are as follows: it brings out the importance on the potentials of unmanned vessels and its competitive advantages over existing cargo ships. Besides its contribution to reduce fatigue and workload of navigating officers, the improvement of navigational safety by eliminating human errors and reduction of harmful exhaust emission can make shipping safer and more sustainable. However, as the technology is still under development, it is too early for a final evaluation. That said, as the international regulation body, International Maritime Organisation is required to gain acceptance to future unmanned shipping and to designate routes and impose regulations for their safe operation. Originality/value: Recently, there are many conferences and meetings on autonomous surface vessel focussing on regulation, technology, human-factor, legal and regulatory framework for such ships around the world. This paper summarises the current development of the autonomous surface ships, in term of the design and technology, their interaction and co-existence with manned ships and suggest some operation issues on board an autonomous surface ship during voyage. Taking Hong Kong as an example, this paper attempts to examine the feasibility for introducing the autonomous surface ships in local waters. © 2019, Pacific Star Group Education Foundation.","Autonomy; Hong Kong; Surface ship",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075484435

The approach incorporates an optimization model (a Chance-Constrained Programming (CCP) based multi-objective non-linear programming) integrated with a carbon footprint (CF) model and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) index, a soil water balance model and a groundwater dynamics model. The output of the optimization model constitutes the input to the soil water balance model which is calculated based on soil water content from soil samples representing the basin under study, and the resulting output is the input to the groundwater dynamics model. The output of the groundwater dynamics model is examined by whether the optimal results give rise to soil salinization. The proposed approach has advantages in addressing the tradeoffs of land and water resources for different crops in irrigation districts to reduce soil carbon emissions and improve land and water resources allocation efficiency, dynamically reflecting water transformation among precipitation, surface water, soil water and groundwater, and dealing with nonlinearity and uncertainties. The approach was applied to identify optimal land and water resources allocation schemes in the oasis of Heihe River basin, northwest China. Results demonstrated that in the studied area, soil carbon emissions decreased and water use efficiency increased by the simultaneous allocation of the interactive agricultural land and water resources in space and time. Choosing the violation probabilities in the range of 0.05 and 0.1 might be more beneficial to the comprehensive benefits of the contradictory objectives (i.e. reducing soil carbon emissions and increasing irrigation water use efficiency), because during this range the value of IWUE tended to be the largest and the value of CF was beginning to stabilize. From the perspective of spatial distribution, the value of CF showed an increasing trend from northwest to southeast, while the changes of groundwater table in the southern part were higher than in the northern part of the oasis. As the main limiting factor, increasing water availability led to an increase of cultivated land within a certain range, which significantly affected soil environment, leading to the necessity to contribute towards the efficient utilization of irrigation water resources and field activities to reduce soil pollution. Therefore, the proposed modelling framework can help to comprehensively manage agricultural land and water resources under complexity in an efficient and environmental-friendly way, and thus promote soil environment protection. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural land and irrigation water; Allocation efficiency; Optimization-simulation; Soil carbon emissions; Soil water balance; Uncertainty","Carbon footprint; Climate models; Computer programming; Constrained optimization; Crops; Dynamics; Efficiency; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Irrigation; Nonlinear programming; Resource allocation; River pollution; Soil moisture; Surface water resources; Surface waters; Water supply; Allocation efficiencies; Irrigation waters; Optimization-simulation; Soil carbon emissions; Soil water balance; Uncertainty; Soil pollution; agricultural land; carbon emission; carbon footprint; efficiency measurement; environmental protection; irrigation system; optimization; resource allocation; simulation; soil carbon; soil improvement; soil water; uncertainty analysis; water budget; water use efficiency; China; Gansu; Hei River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067844765

As promising candidates, metal-nitrogen-carbon (MNC) catalysts with metal atoms present as atomically dispersed metal-Nx moieties (MNx, M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) were investigated as model catalysts. The distinct activity for CO formation observed along the series of catalysts is attributed to the nature of the transition metal in MNx moieties because of otherwise similar composition, structure, and morphology of the carbon matrix. We identify a volcano trend between their activity toward CO formation and the nature of the transition metal in MNx sites, with Fe and/or Co at the top of the volcano, depending on the electrochemical potential. Regarding selectivity, FeNC, NiNC, and MnNC had Faradaic efficiency for CO &gt;80%. To correctly model the active sites in operando conditions, experimental operando X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy was performed to follow changes in the metal oxidation state with electrochemical potential. Co and Mn did not change the oxidation state with potential, whereas Fe and Ni were partially reduced and Cu largely reduced to Cu(0). Computational models then led to the identification of M2+N4-H2O as the most active centers in FeNC and CoNC, whereas Ni1+N4 was predicted as the most active one in NiNC at the considered potentials of -0.5 and -0.6 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. The experimental activity and selectivity could be rationalized from our density functional theory results, identifying in particular the difference between the binding energies for CO2*- and H∗ as a descriptor of selectivity toward CO.

Due to this complexation effect, the initiating system BFC/PEGDA has broader ground state light absorption in visible light region than BFC has and could be initiated more efficiently by LED 405nm lamp (visible light source). Moreover, BFC/PEGDA exhibits higher initiating efficiency than BFC/ethyl-4-(dimethylamino) benzoate (EDAB) in initiating monomer such as hexamethylene diacrylate (HDDA). To investigate this unusual phenomenon, steady state photolyisis experiments of BFC, BFC/EDAB and BFC/PEGDA, 1H-NMR, time dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations were carried out. The results showed BFC exhibited weak photostability and photo bleached. The intramolecular motion of BFC induced few BFC performing hydrogen transfer interaction with coinitiator EDAB to produce radicals for polymerization. However, complex BFC/PEGDA has good photostability and this effect restricts the intramolecular motion of BFC which prevented BFC from being bleached and induced more BFC performing hydrogen transfer interaction with PEGDA to produce radicals for polymerization. According to 1H-NMR spectra of BFC in different radiation time and TD-DFT calculations of BFC's isomers, it demonstrated BFC performed intramolecular motion which was mainly caused by the furan rings rotating towards carbonyl on BFC. This strategy of promoting photoinitiator's absorption in the visible light region and its initiating efficiency just through mixing the two compounds together might provide potential application for visible light photoinitiating system. © 2019","Complexation effect; Photoinitiator; Photopolymerization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070904118

In this study, rainwater samples were collected from 2011 to 2016 in Sichuan province to measure the pH values and the concentrations of nine inorganic ions (SO42−, NO3−, NH4+, Cl−, Na+, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, and F−), and then to investigate their spatiotemporal variations. Besides, the dominant sources for the acidic ions in the precipitation were also revealed by statistical model. The results showed that the rainwater continued to be highly acidic, and the Volume-Weighted Mean (VWM) pH value was calculated to be 5.18 during 2011 and 2016. NH4+, Ca2+, NO3−, and SO42− were the dominant water-soluble inorganic ions, accounting for 79.2% of the total ions on average. The remarkable decrease in NO3− and SO42− concentrations (from 75.9 to 54.3 μeq L−1 and from 285 to 145 μeq L−1, respectively) resulted in an increase in the pH value of rainwater from 5.24 in 2011 to 5.70 in 2016. The concentrations of SO42−, NO3−, F−, Na+, and K+ showed remarkably seasonal variation, with the highest value observed in winter, followed by spring and autumn, and the lowest value observed in summer. High VWM concentration of these ions in winter were mainly due to adverse meteorological conditions (e.g., rare rainfall, lower planetary boundary height, and stagnant air) and intensive anthropogenic emissions. SO42−, NO3−, and F− ions peaked in the southeastern Sichuan province, which is a typical industrial region. NH4+ concentrations decreased from 268 μeq L−1 in the east to 10.4 μeq L−1 in the western Sichuan province, which could be related to the development of agriculture in the eastern Sichuan province. Ca2+ peaked in southeastern Sichuan province due to intensive construction activities and severe stone desertification. On the basis of Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis, four sources of inorganic ions in rainwater were identified, including anthropogenic source, crust, biomass burning, and aging sea salt aerosol. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) was used to find the spatial correlations between the socio-economic factors and ions in the rainwater. At the regional scale, the influence of fertilizer consumption and Gross Agricultural Production (GAP) on NH4+ increased from east to west; moreover the influence of Gross Industrial Production (GIP) on SO42− and NO3− also increased. Remarkable decreases of SO42− and NO3− in the rainwater in Sichuan province was related to decreasing SO2 and NO2 emissions caused by implementation of pollutant control strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Acid rain; Chemical composition; Source identification; Southwest China; Spatio-temporal distribution","Acid rain; Agriculture; Air pollution; Air pollution control; Construction industry; Factorization; pH; Chemical compositions; Geographically weighted regression; Positive Matrix Factorization; Source identification; Southwest China; Spatial and temporal variation; Spatiotemporal distributions; Water soluble inorganic ions; Ions; ammonia; calcium ion; chloride; fluorine; ion; magnesium oxide; nitrate; potassium ion; rain; sodium; sulfate; inorganic compound; rain; water; acid deposition; acid rain; correlation; ionic composition; precipitation quality; rainwater; spatial variation; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal variation; acid deposition; acidity; agricultural parameters; analysis; analytical parameters; Article; biomass burning; chemical composition; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; correlational study; desertification; geographic distribution; geographically weighted regression; gross agricultural production; gross industrial production; neutralization capacity; positive matrix factorization; precipitation; procedures; quantitative analysis; seasonal variation; socioeconomics; solubility; spatiotemporal variation; volume weighted mean; wet deposition; acid rain; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; chemistry; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; season; China; Sichuan; Acid Rain; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Inorganic Chemicals; Rain; Seasons; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069965333

This paper constructs a supply chain consisting of the manufacturer and supplier, considers the moral hazard and adverse selection between the government and manufacturer, builds a single-layer principal-agent model and double-layer principal-agent model including the supplier and compares the abatement strategies of the manufacturer in the two models, and designs the government's incentive contracts for the manufacturer of the supply chain on reducing emissions. The results show that H (high cost) manufacturer only obtains the reservation revenue, and L (low cost) manufacturer can obtain additional revenue. The significance of the government paying information rent to L manufacturer is in ensuring that L manufacturer has no motivation to hide type information and that the manufacturer can choose appropriate incentive contracts in an effort to join the supplier in reducing emissions. The manufacturer obtains more revenues by increasing the incentive intensity for the supplier, but this is not necessary for the government, so the government must reach a deal with the manufacturer to avoid the loss of revenues. These findings will be helpful to policy-makers and managers. © 2019","Abatement strategy; Incentive contracts; Principal-agent; Supply chain","Emission control; Risk management; Supply chains; Adverse selection; Incentive contracts; Information asymmetry; Information rents; Principal agent models; Principal agents; Private information; Reducing emissions; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069574824

Due to rising public pressure, emission-reducing measures are increasingly likely to be introduced. Such measures can cover diesel bans or even entire car-free zones, causing drastic effects on delivery networks in urban areas. As an option to reduce the risk of a regulation-induced shock, we present a resilience-oriented network and fleet optimization. We propose an innovative parcel delivery concept for last mile delivery (LMD) operations and develop an optimization model to support tactical planning decisions. Our model minimizes overall operating costs by determining optimal locations for micro depots and it allocates transport vehicles to them. An adjustable CO2-threshold and external costs are included to consider potential regulatory restrictions by city authorities. We implement our model into a decision support system (DSS) that allows analyzing and comparing different scenarios. We provide a computational study by evaluating and discussing our DSS with an example of a mid-sized German city. Our results and findings demonstrate the trade-off between cost and emission minimization by quantifying the impacts of various fleet compositions.

A better knowledge of the formation mechanism and aerosol properties during haze events is helpful for the development of effective mitigation policies. In this study, we present field measurements of aerosol properties at an urban site in Beijing during January and February 2015. A suite of aerosol instruments were deployed to measure a comprehensive set of aerosol chemical and physical properties. The evolution of haze events in winter, dependent on meteorological conditions, consistently involves new particle formation during the clean period and subsequently continuous growth from the nucleation mode particles to submicron particles over the course of multiple days. Particulate organic matter is primarily responsible for producing the nucleation mode particles, while secondary organic and inorganic components jointly contribute to the high aerosol mass observed during haze events. The average effective density and hygroscopic parameter (<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""><i>κ</i></span>) of ambient particles are approximately 1.37&thinsp;g&thinsp;cm<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">-3</span> and 0.25 during the clean period and increase to 1.42&thinsp;g&thinsp;cm<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">-3</span> and 0.4 during the polluted period, indicating the formation of secondary inorganic species from the continuous growth of nucleation mode particles. Our results corroborate that the periodic cycles of severe haze formation in Beijing during winter are attributed to the efficient nucleation and secondary aerosol growth under high gaseous precursor concentrations and the stagnant air conditions, highlighting that reductions in emissions of aerosol precursor gases are critical for remedying secondary aerosol formation and thereby mitigating haze pollution. © Author(s) 2019.",,"aerosol; aerosol composition; aerosol formation; aerosol property; climate change; concentration (composition); haze; seasonal variation; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075902929

Effective and efficient monitoring and mitigation of air pollution require a comprehensive understanding of the air pollution process through a reliable database carrying important information about the spatiotemporal variations of air pollutant concentrations at various spatial and temporal scales. Traditional analysis suffers from the severe insufficiency of data collected by only a few stations. In this study, we propose a rigorous framework for the integration of air pollutant concentration data coming from the ground-based stations, which are spatially sparse but temporally dense, and mobile sensors, which are spatially dense but temporally sparse. Based on the integrated database which is relatively dense in space and time, we then estimate air pollutant concentrations for given location and time by applying a two-step local regression model to the data.

Several studies conducted in the past reported an excess of mortality and morbidity from various diseases at the town level, possibly due to air pollution from the plant. However, the relationship between air pollutants emitted from the industry and adverse health outcomes has been controversial. We applied a variant of the “difference-in-differences” (DID) approach to examine the relationship between temporal changes in exposure to industrial PM10 from the plant and changes in cause-specific mortality rates at area unit level. Methods: We examined a dynamic cohort of all subjects (321,356 individuals) resident in the Taranto area in 1998–2010 and followed them up for mortality till 2014. In this work, we included only deaths occurring on 2008–2014. We observed a total of 15,303 natural deaths in the cohort and age-specific annual death rates were computed for each area unit (11 areas in total). PM10 and NO2 concentrations measured at air quality monitoring stations and the results of a dispersion model were used to estimate annual average population weighted exposures to PM10 of industrial origin for each year, area unit and age class. Changes in exposures and in mortality were analyzed using Poisson regression. Results: We estimated an increased risk in natural mortality (1.86%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.06, 3.83%) per 1 μg/m3 annual change of industrial PM10, mainly driven by respiratory causes (8.74%, 95% CI: 1.50, 16.51%). The associations were statistically significant only in the elderly (65+ years). Conclusions: The DID approach is intuitively simple and reduces confounding by design. Under the multiple assumptions of this approach, the study indicates an effect of industrial PM10 on natural mortality, especially in the elderly population. © 2019 The Authors","Air pollution; Confounding; Difference-in-differences; Mortality; PM10; Steel industry","Air pollution; Air quality; Iron and steel industry; Risk perception; Steelmaking; Air quality monitoring stations; Confidence interval; Confounding; Difference-in-differences; Dispersion modeling; Elderly populations; Mortality; PM10; Population statistics; nitrogen oxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; cohort analysis; elderly population; industrial emission; iron and steel industry; mortality; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; Poisson ratio; risk assessment; adult; age; aged; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; Article; atmospheric dispersion; cause of death; cohort analysis; concentration (parameter); controlled study; difference in differences; environmental exposure; female; follow up; human; industrial waste; iron and steel industry; Italy; male; mortality; mortality rate; mortality risk; particle size; priority journal; regression analysis; statistical analysis; adolescent; air pollutant; analysis; child; infant; longitudinal study; metallurgy; middle aged; newborn; particulate matter; preschool child; risk assessment; time factor; toxicity; young adult; Italy; Puglia; Taranto; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Air Pollutants; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Italy; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Metallurgy; Middle Aged; Mortality; Particulate Matter; Risk Assessment; Time Factors; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072546298

These processes combine the use of the huge “Soviet legacy” and the creation of principally new economic, social, and infrastructural facilities. It is proved that redevelopment is the main content of transformation processes in the entire Russian territory and that the AZRF can serve as their most adequate pattern at the level of the country, as well as its regions and municipalities. The genesis and essence of Arctic problems are shown to systemically depend on the realities of transformation processes under way in the entire country due to the policies and reforms of recent decades. It is substantiated that the success of Arctic redevelopment will decisively depend on the early revision of the basic provisions of the current nationwide industrial, energy, transport, demographic, ethnic, educational, and personnel policies. The concept of a macroregion as a target object of state control, formed to implement specific state interests, is used to prove the advisability of detaching the AZRF as an independent object of state policy. Paradoxes of the demographic situation in the AZRF are considered, and directions for organizing Arctic health care are justified in terms of (a) the specifics of urbanized and rural territories in the western and eastern (Transural) parts of the AZRF and (b) the specific needs for medical services among miners, metallurgists, military personnel, sailors, rotational employees, and representatives of indigenous ethnic minorities of the North. Specific interrelations between the state and large corporations in the Arctic, including those aimed at mitigating climate risks during development, are revealed, and the state regulations concerning greenhouse gas emissions, proposed by the Russian Ministry of Economic Development, are assessed critically in this respect. In conclusion, the consistency of recent changes in managing AZRF development by a special federal body for Arctic affairs is substantiated. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","administrative-territorial unit; Arctic megaproject; Arctic zone of the Russian Federation; development project; integrated development; integration; redevelopment; systems approach",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077887270

This paper investigates how climate change will affect the values and functions of Mediterranean seasonally-flooded wetlands with emergent vegetation. We simulated the future evolution of water balance, wetland condition and water volumes necessary to maintain these ecosystems at mid- and late- 21st century, in 229 localities around the Mediterranean basin. We considered future projections of the relevant climatic variables under two Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios assuming a stabilization (RCP4.5) or increase (RCP 8.5) of greenhouse gases emissions. We found similar increases of water deficits at most localities around 2050 under both RCP scenarios. By 2100, however, water deficits under RCP 8.5 are expected to be more severe and will impact all localities. Simulations performed under current conditions show that 97% of localities could have wetland habitats in good state. By 2050, however, this proportion would decrease to 81% and 68% under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively, decreasing further to 52% and 27% by 2100. Our results suggest that wetlands can persist with up to a 400 mm decrease in annual precipitation. Such resilience to climate change is attributed to the semi-permanent character of wetlands (lower evaporation on dry ground) and their capacity to act as reservoir (higher precipitation expected in some countries during winter). Countries at highest risk of wetland degradation and loss are Algeria, Morocco, Portugal and Spain. Degradation of wetlands with emergent vegetation will negatively affect their biodiversity and the services they provide by eliminating animal refuges and primary resources for industry and tourism. A sound strategy to preserve these wetlands would consist of proactive management to reduce non-climate stressors. © 2019 The Authors","Adaptive management; Ecosystem services; Hydrology; Marsh resilience; Mitigation measures; Water stress","Banks (bodies of water); Biodiversity; Ecosystems; Floods; Greenhouse gases; Hydrology; Reservoirs (water); Vegetation; Wetlands; Adaptive Management; Ecosystem services; Marsh resilience; Mitigation measures; Water stress; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; ecosystem service; hydrology; marsh; vulnerability; water budget; water stress; wetland; Algeria; Article; biodegradation; biodiversity; carbon footprint; climate change; ecosystem resilience; environmental management; evaporation; flooding; fluid balance; habitat; Morocco; Portugal; precipitation; priority journal; river basin; seasonal variation; simulation; Spain; vegetation; water deficit; water stress; water supply; wetland; winter; Algeria; Mediterranean Sea; Morocco; Portugal; Spain; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069688380

Currently, the dust emission reduction factor (RF) is determined by the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). This study aims to improve the forecasting capability of ADAM2 by developing a daily dust RF using both monthly (January 2007 to December 2016) and real-time moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data. We also developed a look-up table to transform the RF using NDVI and a system to update the RF by producing MODIS NDVI data for the last 30 days. Using these data, new RFs can be produced every day. To examine the impact of RF modification, the current (CTL) and new (EXP) RFs are compared during the period from March to May 2017. The simulations are verified by ground-based PM10 observations from China and Korea. Accordingly, root mean square errors (RMSEs) are reduced by 11.58% when RF is updated using real-time NDVI data. The results suggest that recent daily NDVI data contribute positively to the forecasting ability of ADAM2, in the dust source and downwind regions. © 2019 by the authors.","Asian dust aerosol model 2; Dust emission reduction factor; MODIS; Normalized difference vegetation index","Aerosols; Emission control; Forecasting; Mean square error; Radiometers; Table lookup; Vegetation; Asian dust aerosol models; Dust emission; Forecasting ability; Forecasting capability; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS; Normalized difference vegetation index; Root mean square errors; Dust; aerosol; dust; emission; emission control; modeling; MODIS; NDVI; particulate matter; China; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075666528

In this study, we prepared a DNA-based thermometer that reports low and high temperatures by providing two distinct optical signals. The system is a molecular beacon that carries a loop and a stem, whose conformation is subject to change from a hairpin to a random coil when the temperature changes from low to high. A fluorophore, Cy5, and a quencher, BHQ3, are terminally labeled at the stem ends. Moreover, perylene is included in the middle of the 3′-end stem. The signaling state of Cy5 relies on the relative distance to BHQ3. However, the perylene emission is regulated by its microenvironment (i.e., the oligonucleotide or duplex state). With a temperature variation, the designed thermometer undergoes a change in conformation that leads to two signal patterns with Cy5/off and perylene/on at low temperature and Cy5/on and perylene/off at high temperature. The reversibility and biocompatibility of the thermometer design were examined for potential applications in biological systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","DNA; Molecular beacon; Temperature probe","Biocompatibility; DNA; Oligonucleotides; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Temperature; Biological applications; Microscale levels; Molecular beacon; Relative distances; Temperature changes; Temperature probes; Temperature variation; Thermometer design; Thermometers; oligonucleotide; perylene; carbocyanine; cyanine dye 5; DNA; fluorescent dye; oligodeoxyribonucleotide; Article; biocompatibility; cell viability; concentration (parameter); conformation; controlled study; DNA hairpin; foreskin cell line; Hep-G2 cell line; high temperature; Hs68 cell line; human; human cell; low temperature; male; melting temperature; MTT assay; priority journal; temperature sensitivity; chemistry; cold; fluorescence; genetics; heat; inverted repeat; osmolarity; thermometer; Carbocyanines; Cold Temperature; DNA; Fluorescence; Fluorescent Dyes; Hep G2 Cells; Hot Temperature; Humans; Inverted Repeat Sequences; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides; Osmolar Concentration; Perylene; Thermometers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069963066

Results: The amount of organic carbon in the Pinus densiflora forest was 261.09 ton C ha-1 during the research period, and fixed organic carbon in plant through net photosynthesis was 3.2 ton C ha-1 year-1. The organic carbon in plant was 62.77 ton C ha-1 (24.04%), in litter on the forest floor was 3.65 ton C ha-1 (1.40%), and in soil was 194.67 ton C ha-1 (74.56%). The value of plant, litter on forest floor, and soil organic carbon distribution were each 6,277,000 won ha-1, 365,000 won ha-1, and 19,467,000 won ha-1. The value per ton of fixed organic carbon in plant through net photosynthesis was 320,000 won ha-1 year-1 and the value of ecosystem services stored in carbon in the Namsan forest ecosystem was about 26.1 million won ha-1 for 3 years. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that the pine forests of Namsan rapidly decompose leaves due to the high atmospheric temperature and accumulate a large amount of organic carbon in the soil to provide climate control regulatory service function. © 2019 The Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075551340

The lake water is shown to be thermal hydrocarbonate–sulphate–sodium water of the Kuldur type. Lake sediments are characterized by higher temperatures and greater saturation with microelements. A comparative analysis of the species abundance of the microbial community of water and bottom sediments shows high indices of diversity in all layers of sediments, while the diversity in water is low. An analysis of taxonomic diversity reveals the predominance of the members of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Chloroflexi phyla in the community of water and bottom sediments. The presence of bacteria with various metabolic pathways of substance and energy transformation in both production and destruction processes is determined. The sequences belonging to the genus Hydrogenophaga (class β-Proteobacteria, phylum Proteobacteria), which is an indicator of the deep geochemical processes of hydrogen production, are found in the bottom layers of sediments. The rates of microbial processes of photosynthesis, dark assimilation of CO2, sulfate reduction, and methanogenesis are determined to characterize the functional activity. The main part of the organic-matter production in water is found to be formed as a result of the activity of chemolithoautotrophic prokaryotes. In the microbial community, the producers synthesize organic matter using volcanogenic carbon dioxide enriched in the heavy isotope (δ13C). An analysis of the rates of terminal processes indicates that sulfate reduction is the main process. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","Baikal Rift Zone; functional activity; groundwater discharge zone; taxonomic diversity of the microbial community; thermal lake","abundance; biogeochemistry; carbon dioxide; discharge; groundwater; lacustrine deposit; lacustrine environment; methanogenic bacterium; microbial activity; microbial community; organic matter; sediment chemistry; sediment-water interface; species diversity; sulfate-reducing bacterium; Baikal Rift Zone; Russian Federation; Actinobacteria; Bacteroidetes; Betaproteobacteria; Chloroflexi; Chloroflexi (class); Firmicutes; Hydrogenophaga; Prokaryota; Proteobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076497619

Locally manufactured small wind turbines (LMSWTs) used in off-grid battery based renewable energy systems, typically utilize coreless axial flux permanent magnet generators (AFPMGs) due to their simple manufacturing. Typically, low cost three phase uncontrolled diode bridge rectifiers are used for the direct coupling of the AFPMG to the battery bank, which increases significantly the total harmonic distortion (THD) content in the stator current. LMSWT users have occasionally reported AFPMG noise as contributing to the overall acoustic noise emissions of the small wind turbine, especially during low wind speeds. In this paper the relation between current harmonics and acoustic noise emissions in AFPMGs is investigated and verified experimentally, while appropriate passive filtering techniques are utilized in order to reduce their effect. Furthermore, the overall acoustic noise emissions of a LMSWT are measured experimentally in the field and are compared to noise standards for residential areas. Finally, electromagnetic and aerodynamic sources of acoustic noise are investigated experimentally in the field, while design recommendations are developed for LMSWTs towards the reduction of acoustic noise emissions. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2019.",,"Acoustic emissions; Bridge circuits; Electric batteries; Electric generators; Electric rectifiers; Manufacture; Noise generators; Passive filters; Permanent magnets; Rectifying circuits; Renewable energy resources; Rural areas; Synchronous generators; Wind turbines; Acoustic noise emissions; Axial flux permanent magnet generators; Design recommendations; Diode bridge rectifiers; International networks; Renewable energy systems; Rural electrification; Total harmonic distortion (THD); Acoustic noise",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075781041

The work presents an unexpected fatigue related in-vivo failure of a high carbon CoCrMo alloy, used to produce the neck of a modular hip prosthesis. The first part of the work is focused on the characterization of the failed component by means of SEM analysis of the fractured prosthesis. The second part of the work focuses on the electrochemical (Electrochemical Potentiokinetic Reactivation curves) and microstructural characterization (SEM, light microscope and Scanning Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy) of both high and low carbon CoCrMo alloys, in order to determine the possible in-vivo degradation that could locally decrease the fatigue properties of the material. The results showed that the prosthesis failure was promoted by a kind of selective corrosion, occurring at a narrow crevice generated by the mechanical joint between the Ti alloy stem and the CoCrMo alloy neck. The selective corrosion worked as stress raiser favouring fatigue cracks nucleation, then locally reducing the fatigue resistance of the component. Moreover, it was observed that the high carbon CoCrMo alloy is susceptible to a local selective dissolution of the metal matrix close to the Cr–Mo primary carbides, that behave as local cathodes, promoting an intergranular like selective corrosion. On the other hand, a similar degradation is not visible in the low carbon CoCrMo alloy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CoCrMo alloys; Corrosion-fatigue failure; Modular hip prosthesis; SKPFM characterization","Binary alloys; Carbides; Chromium alloys; Corrosion fatigue; Crevice corrosion; Dealloying; Failure (mechanical); Hip prostheses; Intergranular corrosion; Molybdenum alloys; Molybdenum compounds; Orthopedics; Ternary alloys; Textures; Titanium alloys; CoCrMo alloy; Corrosion-fatigue failures; Electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation; Electrochemical studies; Micro-structural characterization; Modular hip prosthesis; Scanning Kelvin probe force microscopy; Selective dissolution; Cobalt alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069722068

The samples were collected in five size fractions that ranged from <0.25 to 10 μm using a SIOUTAS impactor in a 6-h period and analyzed by synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence to obtain elemental aerosol mass concentrations for As, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Ni, Pb, Si, S, Ti, V, and Zn. An analysis of the distribution of the elements in the different collected fractions was performed to infer the most likely sources of particulate matter. From the analysis, it was found that the particulate matter fraction smaller than 0.25 μm was mostly affected by emissions from traffic and combustion, while the particulate matter fraction ranging from 2.5 to 10 μm was mostly influenced by re-suspension of road dust. In addition, the results indicated the presence of Si, typically found in coarse particulate matter and in large amounts in particles smaller than 0.25 μm. To infer the sources of aerosols causing the deterioration of air quality, principal component analysis was performed. The smallest particles, due to their toxicity, are likely to produce more adverse health effects than larger size fractions. These results show the need to monitor their atmospheric emissions in order to preserve air quality. Synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence analysis of the elemental composition of particles smaller than 0.25 μm in Córdoba city constitutes the first contribution to the knowledge base of the concentrations of toxic metals in this size fraction.

Broad-scale political and developmental similarities (e.g., societally impactful developmental challenges related to climate variability) offer opportunities for comparative research resulting in potentially improved understanding of the complexities of various climate adaptation interventions including disaster risk reduction. Countries or geographical regions of the world significantly affected by climate extremes may consider collaboration on issues such as understanding and modelling of the climate system, especially when there is a common, dominant and somewhat plausible climate mode such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) affecting the regions' climate variability. Better ENSO and subsequent climate predictions alone, however, are not enough to reduce the risks associated with such events. The socio-economic and political context in which climate finds expression and in which climate forecasts have potential value also need to be understood. Here we present seasonal precipitation forecast skill over 20 geographical regions including emerging or developing regions, but also a few developed regions, in order to rank their ENSO-related seasonal rainfall predictability in an attempt to cluster regions of similar ENSO climate predictability. We then also provide some of the broad contours to investigate the level of human “development” within these clusters in order to begin to understand some of the socio-economic factors that configure vulnerabilities. Such profiles begin to show some areas of macro-level vulnerability that may then provide further possible inter-area collaborations, albeit at very gross level scales. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","collaboration; emerging economies; ENSO; human development; seasonal climate modelling; skill","Atmospheric pressure; Economics; Geographical regions; Precipitation (meteorology); Weather forecasting; collaboration; Emerging economies; ENSO; Human development; skill; Climatology; climate modeling; climate prediction; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; extreme event; human development index; risk assessment; seasonal variation; social impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066465349

This study addresses the challenge by developing a dynamic system modeling framework integrating Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Agent-Based Modeling (ABM), and Techno-Economic Analysis (TEA). LCA and TEA were coupled with dynamic simulation models of crop yields, costs, and prices, allowing for the estimation of life-cycle environmental impacts and profitability of crop planting activities under changing climate and economic conditions. The framework was demonstrated by a case study for an agricultural system, including 1,000 farms in the United States over a 30-year time frame. The results indicated that information exchange among farmers, farmers' environmental awareness, access to environmental information, and farm size are key factors driving the system's environmental impacts. The results can provide a broad range of stakeholders (e.g., policymakers, nonprofits, agriculture companies) with insightful information to tailor their strategies for effectively managing the environmental footprints of large-scale agricultural systems. The integrated modeling framework has the potential to address sustainability challenges in other systems that are dynamic, involve human behaviors, and have complex interactions among human and nature systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based modeling; Crop cultivation; Dynamic modeling; Life Cycle Assessment; Stochastic process","Autonomous agents; Behavioral research; Climate models; Computational methods; Costs; Crops; Cultivation; Dynamic models; Economic analysis; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Random processes; Simulation platform; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Agent-based model; Crop cultivation; Environmental information; Integrated model framework; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle environmental impact; Sustainable agricultural system; Techno-Economic analysis; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073700439

Text analysis can serve as an important means to decipher stakeholder (dis)agreements. Traditionally, researchers analyze texts using qualitative text analysis. Relying only on qualitative text analysis can no longer be sufficient to handle very large amounts of textual data. Now computational methods can be applied to help extract opinions in electronic texts. Our paper adopts a big data computational text analysis approach (keyword analysis, keyword co-occurrence, thematic analysis), based on a corpus of 2.4 million words, to compare concerns towards air pollution among three stakeholder groups (i.e. the government (GOV), the environmental groups (NGO) and the news media (MEDIA)) in Hong Kong, between 2002 and 2012, a period when air pollution was subject to rigorous policy debates and discussions. Our analysis shows the somewhat different concerns of the stakeholders. The stakeholders focus heavily on emissions and end-of-pipe pollution control. Though the advocation of sustainability since 1990s, the government-led command-and-control approach still dictates the discourse. Sustainability is featured more intensively by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government. Transboundary pollution (e.g. from Guangdong, China) is not a major concern for all stakeholder groups. Public health is a greater concern in MEDIA, as compared to the other two stakeholder groups. Future air pollution policy-making may direct more of its attention to the pressing concerns over the negative impacts of air pollution on health and its associated costs, with health experts getting more closely involved in the regulatory decision-makings. More information should be given to vulnerable groups, such as young children or workers in polluted environments. To better relate differential health risks of pollution in everyday life, both local and international governments should consider developing more personalized air pollution monitoring and health management systems for their citizens in future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Big data; Computational text analysis; Personalisation; Public health; Stakeholder concerns","air pollution; article; attention; big data; child; decision making; government; health care management; health hazard; Hong Kong; human; monitoring; pollution control; public health; thematic analysis; worker",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071300764

In this work, a low-temperature and energy-saving CO2 capture technology has been successfully developed by using alcohols-amines-water mixtures as sorbents. The addition of certain amounts of alcohols [especially ethanol (EtOH)] to amines can significantly increase the CO2 desorption rates and cyclic CO2 capture capacities in comparison with those of monoethanolamine-water, diethanolamine-water, and methyldiethanolamine-water systems. The sorbent containing 40 wt% EtOH, 20 wt% monoethanolamine (MEA), and 20 wt% H2O can increase cyclic CO2 capture capacity by 6.8 times and a maximum improvement of 236 times in CO2 desorption rate at 75 °C, which makes the use of the low-temperature waste heat in power plants for CO2 capture or self-supported CO2 capture in power plants possible. To the best of authors’ knowledge, this is the first time that Raman and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy characterizations have been used to confirm that ethanol in EtOH-MEA-H2O can change the reaction pathway by forming C2H5OCO2− instead of HCO3−, which is difficult to decompose. In addition, the experimental results confirm that the new technology can significantly avoid amine degradation – a common challenge of the state-of-the-art CO2 capture technologies. Therefore, the new CO2 capture technology is promising from the perspectives of energy saving and environmental protection. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Amine; Amine degradation; CO2 capture; Ethanol; Low-temperature sorbent regeneration; Monoethanolamine","Amines; Blending; Carbon dioxide; Desorption; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Environmental technology; Ethanol; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Power plants; Sorbents; Temperature; Waste heat; CO2 capture; Energy saving and environmental protection; Low energy consumption; Low temperatures; Low-temperature waste heats; Methyldiethanolamine; Monoethanolamine; Regeneration temperature; Ethanolamines; additive; alcoholic beverage; amino acid; carbon dioxide; decomposition; desorption; ethanol; FTIR spectroscopy; heat flux; low temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073706712

To assist in meeting this need, this study employs the simple classification of “local climate zones” (LCZs) to conduct a spatiotemporal thermal climatic analysis of the Toulouse Metropolitan Region (France) under warm and dry summer conditions. Simulations are performed using the mesoscale atmospheric model Méso-NH. These simulations provide a city-wide spatial coverage of 2-m air temperature (T2M), mean radiant temperature (MRT), and Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). Model parameters describing the urban morphology are initialized based on administrative databases and independent of LCZ maps, which allows for an evaluation of whether the distributions of the modelled thermal climatic parameters will differ between LCZs. The results show that different LCZs possess significantly different distributions of T2M and MRT, confirming the suitability of the LCZ scheme for discerning the thermal environment of Toulouse. Compact urban settings (LCZ 1/2/3) show the highest T2M throughout the day and a nocturnal temperature difference of up to 2.8 K compared to rural settings. The MRT of LCZ 1/2/3 in the late afternoon (1700–2000 LST (UTC + 2)) can be as much as 6.3 K lower than it is for LCZs with open settings due to shading by dense urban structures. Additional analysis reveals that the intra-LCZ variabilities of T2M and MRT may be explained by the distance to the city centre. Finally, the thermal stress in different LCZs is assessed with the modelled UTCI. Among the built LCZs, the probability of strong heat stress is the highest for open high/mid-rise (LCZ 4/5) and lowest for sparsely built (LCZ 9) and open low-rise (LCZ 6) settings. For land cover type LCZs, dense trees (LCZ A) are the most favourable for daytime outdoor human thermal comfort. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","heat stress; local climate zones; numerical model simulation; universal thermal climate index (UTCI); urban climate analysis; urban thermal environment","Atmospheric temperature; Numerical models; Thermal stress; Climate index; Heat stress; Local climate; Numerical model simulations; Urban climates; Urban thermal environment; Climate models; climate variation; computer simulation; heat island; numerical model; seasonal variation; temperature anomaly; urban climate; France; Haute Garonne; Occitanie; Toulouse",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067357605

In order to establish an potential absorption capacity of recultivated lands, forest stands of the first and second age-classes were chosen as model (with pine, spruce and birch as dominating tree species). On the basis of model forest stands by the method of regional assessment of the forest carbon budget the feasible forestation potential for recultivation of disturbed lands for the areas of Leningrad region is established.

To understand how agricultural activities respond to climate change, therefore, it is necessary to investigate farmers' behavior in the face of climate-induced crop yield changes. We extend the deterministic agricultural sector model to a two-stage stochastic programming with recourse (SPR) model to evaluate the potential changes in cropland utilization and agro-economic measures under climate impacts in Taiwan. We show that when farmers are uncertain the risk, land use could alter considerably. In such cases, approximately 55% and 26% of corn land and peanut land, respectively, will be used to plant other crops. When changes in crop yield are certain, farmers can maintain their income at a cost of higher government expenditures on aside-land subsidy and rice repurchase program. Because yields of many crops present a positive response to climate change, in some cases the net social welfare might increase by NT$800 million dollars (after subtracting NT$5.2 billion dollars of government expenditure) or 0.2% of total agricultural production, and most of the benefits are captured by farmers.

However, little information is available in the academic literature on how these funds are governed to optimise their reach and application. Using Ghana's Forest Plantation Development Fund as a case study, this study bridges this knowledge gap and provides insights into how without insistence on transparency, accountability can be lacking on the way such funds are utilised. Data was collected from 103 plantation developers in five forest districts using semi-structured questionnaires and key informant interviews with other stakeholders, including administrators of the Fund. The study found that there were no mechanisms in place to address stakeholders' information needs about the Fund. This translated into low awareness and limited access to the fund by its intended beneficiaries as well as weak participation of stakeholders in the governance of the Fund, including stakeholders' capacity to demand accountability. Fund administrators were unwilling to disclose information to stakeholders which is reinforced by a lack of incentives to do so. The study recommends the implementation of a right to information legislation and an active press to demand accountability and ensure transparent use of the fund. The findings further highlight an opportunity for global discourse calling for landscape restoration investments in sub-Saharan Africa to be accompanied with governance reforms to address barriers that militate against the efficient use of climate mitigation investments. © 2019","Accountability; Climate financing; Forest landscape restoration; Plantation development; Right to Information; Transparency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073107973

Landward of the zone of highest accumulation, in the shallow Gulf of Martaban, is a highly turbid zone where the seabed is frequently mixed to depths of ~1 m below the sediment water interface. Frequent resuspension in this area may contribute to the formation of extensive fluid muds in the water column, and consequent re-oxidation of the shallow seabed likely reduces the carbon burial efficiency for an area where the rivers are supplying large amounts of terrestrial carbon to the ocean. Sediment cores from the Gulf of Martban have a distinctive reddish brown coloration, while x-radiographs show sedimentary structures of fine silt laminations in mud deposits, which indicates strong tidal influences. The seaward part of the Martaban Depression off the modern subaqueous delta is covered by relict sediment, with no apparent connection between the modern sediment deposit and the offshore Martaban canyon. On the western side of the Sagaing fault, the “Mouths of the Ayeyarwady” represent a large promontory where the subaerial delta has prograded seaward some ~200 km along the eastern flank of the Indo-Burman range since the Holocene maximum transgression. The shelf area off the “Mouths of the Ayeyarwady” presently exhibits low sediment accumulation rates (~1 cm y−1) and a relative coarse (sandy) texture. The reduced accumulation and coarse texture in the western shelf region at the present time is attributed to frequent wave resuspension, and subsequent transport of finer river-derived sediment eastward (into the Martaban Depression) during the SW Monsoon. A mud drape (accumulation rates &lt;1 cm/yr) is present on the northwestern part of the delta, where some sediment likely escapes the shelf to the deeper Bay of Bengal. In contrast with the Gulf of Martaban, sediments in this mud drape show olive grey coloration, while sedimentary structures are dominated by mottled sandy mud with shells, and occasional sand layers. The mud drape is likely derived from a mixture of local rivers draining westward from the Indo-Burman range, and a contribution from the Ayeyarwady system delivered during the NE monsoon. Overall, the shelf offshore the Ayeyarwady and Thanlwin rivers represents a compound subaqueous delta with marked differences from east to west that are controlled by a combination of oceanographic and tectonic factors. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,"Atmospheric thermodynamics; Carbon; Deposits; Faulting; Offshore oil well production; Rivers; Sedimentology; Seismology; Textures; Accumulation rates; Burial efficiency; Continental shelves; High resolution seismic data; Sediment accumulation; Sediment dispersal; Sediment water interface; Sedimentary structure; Sediments; Holocene; oceanography; progradation; sediment budget; sediment transport; seismic data; soil texture; tectonic setting; transgression; Andaman Sea; Ayeyarwady; Bay of Bengal; Gulf of Martaban; Indian Ocean; Irrawaddy Delta; Myanmar; Sagaing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070807975

The article explores the climate policy model in Sweden in terms of the societal actors included in the policy process, the nature of this inclusion, and its relevance for the prospects of decarbonisation. It uses three perspectives in the analysis: corporatism, sustainable transition studies, and ecological democracy. The findings largely support existing research that states characterised by corporatist policymaking are suited for environmental governance and for climate policymaking. However, as a model of governance of actor relations, the Swedish climate policymaking model has both its merits and demerits. Although it has potential to reach decarbonisation objectives, it does this in the context of including mainly established economic interests, that is, incumbents.

The impact that these planning and subsequent local policy actions have on addressing actual emissions, however, remains under-explored and even less is known about the conditions under which cities’ climate planning efforts result in meaningful mitigation. Data limitations, specifically the sporadic and unstandardized accounting of local GHG emissions, underlie the minimal empirical attention given to understanding cities’ climate policy outcomes. To circumvent these data challenges, we quantify the impact of local efforts through expert evaluation. We utilize nation-wide survey data collected from U.S. cities in 2010 and 2015 to empirically assess how community and city government characteristics influence the extent to which cities’ climate planning efforts serve as the basis for emissions reductions. The results suggest that the dynamics shaping cities’ decisions to complete an inventory are different from those that influence whether it is used as a basis for emissions reductions. Results also point to the positive effect of regular inventory updates and to the importance of stability in the administrative leadership of sustainability in a city’s government. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","cities; emissions inventories; greenhouse gas; Local climate protection",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074500759

To address this issue, we analysed the energy demand of 17 European cities using the coupled CIM-CitySim model. Simulations taking into account the urban microclimate were performed for one typical year to obtain the cooling and the heating demand. When comparing the results with and without the urban microclimate, although on a yearly basis there does not seem to be much difference on the overall energy demand (<15%), when looking at the seasonal dynamics, it can be noted that there are significant deviations, in particular for the cooling demand (>60%). In the future, strategies to design more sustainable urban areas at the European scale will be evaluated. The objective is to be able to define mitigation strategies that will decrease the footprint of urban areas while at the same time increasing its liveability. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Energy demands; Energy strategy; European cities; Heating demand; Local climate; Mitigation strategy; Seasonal dynamics; Urban microclimate; Energy management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076258324

The interplay of changes in winter climate and plant presence may alter soil functioning via effects on decomposers. Responses of decomposer soil fauna and microorganisms to such changes likely differ from each other, since their life histories, dispersal mechanisms and microhabitats vary greatly. We investigated the relative impacts of short-term winter warming and increases in plant cover on bacteria and collembola community composition in cryoturbated, non-sorted circle tundra. By covering non-sorted circles with insulating gardening fibre cloth (fleeces) or using stone walls accumulating snow, we imposed two climate-change scenarios: snow accumulation increased autumn-to-late winter soil temperatures (−1 cm) by 1.4 °C, while fleeces warmed soils during that period by 1 °C and increased spring temperatures by 1.1 °C. Summer bacteria and collembola communities were sampled from within-circle locations differing in vegetation abundance and soil properties. Two years of winter warming had no effects on either decomposer community. Instead, their community compositions were strongly determined by sampling location: communities in barren circle centres were distinct from those in vegetated outer rims, while communities in sparsely vegetated patches of circle centres were intermediate. Diversity patterns indicate that collembola communities are tightly linked to plant presence while bacteria communities correlated with soil properties. Our results thus suggest that direct effects of short-term winter warming are likely to be minimal, but that vegetation encroachment on barren cryoturbated ground will affect decomposer community composition substantially. At decadal timescales, collembola community changes may follow relatively fast after warming-driven plant establishment into barren areas, whereas bacteria communities may take longer to respond. If shifts in decomposer community composition are indicative for changes in their activity, vegetation overgrowth will likely have much stronger effects on soil functioning in frost-affected tundra than short-term winter warming. © 2019 The Authors","Arctic; Global warming; Microbes; Shrub encroachment; Snow; Soil fauna","Animals; Expansion; Frost effects; Global warming; Landforms; Plant expansion; Snow; Soils; Vegetation; Wool; Arctic; Climate change scenarios; Community composition; Decomposer communities; Microbes; Shrub encroachments; Soil fauna; Spring temperatures; Bacteria; arctic environment; bacterium; beetle; climate change; community composition; community dynamics; decomposition; global warming; range expansion; shrub; snow; soil fauna; soil microorganism; soil temperature; tundra; winter; Bacteria (microorganisms); Collembola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071614319

However, FeOx structure and reactivity is dependent on adsorption and incorporation of such dissolved species, particularly oxyanions such as phosphate and silicate. These interactions affect the fate of nutrients and metal(loids), especially in perturbed aquatic environments such as eutrophic coastal systems and environments impacted by acid mine drainage. Altered FeOx reactivity impacts sedimentary nutrient retention capacity and, eventually, ecosystem trophic state. Here, we explore the influence of phosphate (P) and silicate (Si) on FeOx structure and reactivity. Synthetic, poorly crystalline FeOx with adsorbed and coprecipitated phosphate or silicate at low but environmentally relevant P/Fe or Si/Fe ratios (0.02–0.1 mol mol−1) was prepared by base titration of Fe(III) solutions. Structural characteristics of FeOx were investigated by X-ray diffraction, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy and high-energy X-ray scattering. Reactivity of FeOx was assessed by kinetic dissolution experiments under acidic (dilute HCl, pH 2) and circum-neutral reducing (bicarbonate-buffered ascorbic acid, pH 7.8, Eh ∼ −300 mV) conditions. At these loadings, phosphate and silicate coprecipitation had only slight impact on local and intermediate-ranged FeOx structure, but significantly enhanced the dissolution rate of FeOx. Conversely, phosphate and silicate adsorption at similar loadings resulted in particle surface passivation and decreased FeOx dissolution rates. These findings indicate that varying nutrient loadings and different interaction mechanisms between anions and FeOx (adsorption versus coprecipitation) can influence the broader biogeochemical functioning of aquatic ecosystems by impacting the structure and reactivity of FeOx. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Adsorption; Aquatic ecosystems; Ascorbic acid; Coprecipitation; Dissolution; Nutrients; Passivation; Silicates; Silicon; X ray absorption spectroscopy; X ray scattering; Aquatic environments; Biogeochemical functioning; Dissolution kinetics; Dissolved nutrients; High-energy x-ray scatterings; Interaction mechanisms; Nutrient retention; Structural characteristics; Phosphorus compounds; anion; ascorbic acid; hydrochloric acid; iron oxide; iron(oxyhydr)oxide; phosphate; silicate; unclassified drug; ferric ion; ferric oxide; phosphate; silicate; acid mine drainage; adsorption; aquatic ecosystem; aquatic environment; detection method; dissolution; iron oxide; metalloid; oxide; phosphate; reaction kinetics; silicate; sorption; acid mine drainage; acidity; adsorption; aquatic environment; Article; crystal structure; dissolution; eutrophication; kinetics; pH; precipitation; trophic level; X ray absorption spectroscopy; X ray crystallography; X ray diffraction; adsorption; chemistry; ecosystem; kinetics; pollutant; solubility; water pollutant; Adsorption; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollutants; Ferric Compounds; Kinetics; Phosphates; Silicates; Solubility; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067563781

The goal of this study was to assess the impacts of CC on winter wheat production in the THP and evaluate potential adaptation strategies using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) CERES-Wheat model. A thorough calibration of the model against field data resulted in a satisfactory simulation of phenology, leaf area index, grain yield (percent error, |PE| &lt;4.7%), biomass (|PE| &lt;7.1%), and evapotranspiration (|PE| &lt;11.9%). The evaluated model was then used for: (i) predicting winter wheat yield and irrigation water use, and (ii) evaluating six potential winter wheat cultivars under CC at three sites in the THP. Mixed trends were found for irrigated yield in the future across the study sites due to differences in climate and soils. Irrigation water use of winter wheat is expected to decrease in the future due to improved water use efficiency at elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration and reduced growing season length due to temperature rise. Dryland yield is expected to increase due to improved crop water use efficiency. Among the virtual cultivars tested for CC adaptation, increasing potential number of grains and vigorous root system were found to be the most desirable traits, since these cultivars had higher yield and lower or comparable irrigation water use than the reference cultivar. Long-maturity and stay-green cultivars were found to be not advisable due to significantly higher irrigation water use than the reference cultivar. Overall, the results showed that winter wheat production in the THP could benefit from CC under milder climatic conditions (mean growing season temperature &lt;13 °C). Enhancing yield potential traits and root architecture should be considered for screening cultivars for CC adaptation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CERES-Wheat; Genetic traits; Stay-green; Yield potential","Aquifers; Artificial intelligence; Crops; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Efficiency; Grain (agricultural product); Irrigation; Plants (botany); Water supply; Agrotechnology transfer; CERES-Wheat; Climate change adaptation; Genetic traits; Growing season lengths; Irrigation water supply; Stay-green; Yield potential; Climate change; agricultural technology; climate change; crop production; crop yield; cultivar; decision support system; genetic analysis; growing season; water supply; water use efficiency; wheat; winter; Great Plains; Ogallala Aquifer; Texas; United States; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071572888

In addition to providing humanity with 98.8% of its food, soils provide a broad range of other services, from carbon storage and greenhouse gas regulation, to flood mitigation and providing support for our sprawling cities. But soil is a finite resource, and rapid human population growth coupled with increasing consumption is placing unprecedented pressure on soils through the intensification of agricultural production – the increasing of crop yield per unit area of soil. Indeed, the human population has increased from ca. 250 million in the year 1000, to 6.1 billion in the year 2000, and is projected to reach 9.8 billion by the year 2050. The current intensification of agricultural practices is already resulting in the unsustainable degradation of soils. Major forms of this degradation include the loss of organic matter and the release of greenhouse gases, the over-application of fertilizers, erosion, contamination, acidification, salinization, and loss of genetic diversity. This ongoing soil degradation is decreasing the long-term ability of soils to provide humans with services, including future food production, and is causing environmental harm. It is imperative that the global society is not shortsighted by focusing solely on the near-immediate benefits of soils, such as food supply. A failure to identify the importance of soil within increasingly intensive agricultural systems will undoubtedly have serious consequences for humanity and represents a failure to consider intergenerational equity.

The weather research forecast–community multiscale air quality (WRF-CMAQ) modelling system has been applied for the baseline period (year 2010) and the future day period (years 2050 and 2100) during the winter and summer monsoons. The simulation of WRF agrees well with observation datasets in simulating the surface temperature. However, precipitation did not perform well. The future projection revealed that the surface temperature increased across the Malaysian region, while patterns of total precipitation were varied. The study also identified model deficiencies of WRF-CMAQ in simulating air quality in the Malaysian region. RCP simulations reproduced the observed and reanalysis dataset for O3 mixing ratio with moderate values in statistical analysis. Compared with the present scenario, a small decrease in the O3 concentration was found under RCP8.5 scenario, while a large decrease was found for the RCP4.5 scenario except for the winter monsoon. In 2100, O3 reduced by − 1.4% (− 15.2%) and 4.5% (− 25.8%) during winter (summer) monsoons under the RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios, respectively. Overall, the decrease in O3 was found to be affected by meteorological change, as well as changes in ozone oxidants such as hydroxyl radical (OH), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and acid nitric (HNO3). Further tightening control measures on anthropogenic emissions to reduce future surface ozone may be unnecessary, since the future ozone mixing ratio did not exceed the Malaysia standard. However, continuous monitoring is vital to ensure efficient air quality management in Malaysia. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Malaysia; RCP4.5; RCP8.5; Surface ozone; Weather research forecast–community multiscale air quality modelling system","Air quality; Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Mixing; Nitric acid; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Quality management; Surface properties; Community multi-scale air qualities; Malaysia; RCP4.5; RCP8.5; Surface ozone; Weather forecasting; air quality; anthropogenic source; climate conditions; concentration (composition); emission; hydroxyl radical; meteorology; mixing ratio; nitrogen oxides; Oceania Ecozone; ozone; seasonal variation; simulation; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063218835

Long-distance road freight transport accounts for a large and rising share within this sector. For this reason, in February 2019, the European Union agreed to introduce CO2 emission standards following Canada, China, Japan and the United States. One way to reduce CO2 emissions from long-distance road freight transport is to use alternative powertrains in trucks — especially heavy-duty vehicles (HDV) because of their high mileage, weight and fuel consumption. Multiple alternative fuels and powertrains (AFPs) have been proposed as potential options to lower CO2 emissions. However, the current research does not paint a clear picture of the path towards decarbonizing transport that uses AFPs in HDVs. The aim of this literature review is to understand the current state of research on the market diffusion of HDVs with alternative powertrains. We present a summary of market diffusion studies of AFPs in HDVs, including their methods, main findings and policy recommendations. We compare and synthesize the results of these studies to identify strengths and weaknesses in the field, and to propose further options to improve AFP HDV market diffusion modelling. All the studies expect AFPs on a small scale in their reference scenarios under current regulations. In climate protection scenarios, however, AFPs dominate the market, indicating their positive effect on CO2 reduction. There is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the emergence of a superior AFP technology for HDVs. The authors of this review recommend more research into policy measures, and that infrastructure development and energy supply should be included in order to obtain a holistic understanding of modelling AFP market diffusion for HDVs. © 2019 The Authors","Alternative fuel; Alternative powertrain; Decarbonization; Heavy-duty vehicle; Low-carbon policy; Road freight transport","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Decarbonization; Diffusion; Energy policy; Freight transportation; Greenhouse gases; Powertrains; Roads and streets; Current regulations; Degree of uncertainty; Heavy duty vehicles; Infrastructure development; Literature reviews; Low-carbon policies; Policy recommendations; Road freight transport; Alternative fuels",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073702410

Based on data on the production and consumption of various kinds of energy and the emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, in 1990–2017, changes in the structure of the global energy consumption, trends in electric power generation, and the influence of different factors on the carbon dioxide emissions in power-generating enterprises are investigated. It is shown that the power industry, which is the main source of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs), is the most inertial branch of the economy in terms of its contribution to the reduction in GHG emissions. Thus, in the first 2008–2012 commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, GHG emissions in the state parties to the protocol decreased by 7.6% compared the base year, while other GHG sources reduced the emission by 18%. The corresponding figures for the following 2013–2017 commitment period were 10.6 and 17.1%, respectively. The maximum reduction in the carbon dioxide emissions in the power industry resulted from an increase in the global average efficiency of the thermal power stations from 32% in 1990 to 36% in 2017; as a consequence, the cumulative decrease in the CO2 emissions in the world during the 1990–2017 period was approximately 22 billion t. The increase in the electric power generation at HPPs and NPPs resulted in a reduction in GHG emissions by 16.7 and 10.7 billion t, respectively. The substitution of coal and fuel oil by gas at thermal power stations facilitated reducing the emissions by 5.2 billion t, while the use of renewable energy sources for generation of electric energy resulted in a reduction of 1.1 billion t. The contribution of the carbon capture and storage technologies amounting to only 0.2 billion t is not noticeable so far. © 2019, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","carbon dioxide; efficiency; fuel mix; greenhouse-gas emissions; hydropower station; Kyoto Protocol; nuclear power plant; Paris Agreement; renewable energy sources; thermal power station; world energy","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal storage; Digital storage; Efficiency; Electric power generation; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Gas fuel storage; Global warming; International cooperation; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Petroleum prospecting; Renewable energy resources; Thermoelectric power plants; Fuel mix; Hydropower stations; KYOTO protocol; Renewable energy source; Thermal power stations; World energies; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073527565

We used a systematic approach to identify and describe the ecological consequences of discrete forest disturbance events involved in compound interactions. Fire, wind disturbance, and salvage logging were the most common disturbance types investigated. Most compound interactions occurred in North America and involved five or fewer years between disturbances. Common and interrelated disturbance legacies that facilitated compound interactions included reduced seed source availability, deadwood deposition and extraction, and increased light and growing space availability. Forest recovery was assessed with a diversity of metrics including woody and herbaceous plants, soil properties, and carbon stocks, which sometimes determined whether and what kind of compound interaction was detected. Distinctions between recovery time and trajectory, forest succession and development, and species-specific and community-level responses also influenced the detection and direction of compound interactions. Moving forward, we advocate a more holistic approach to quantify ecosystem recovery that considers multiple response variables. Other opportunities to improve compound disturbance ecology include increased emphasis on understudied disturbance types, regions, and forest types. We also encourage more research on buffering interactions that increase forest resilience, which were underrepresented in this review. © 2019 The Authors.","biological legacies; disturbance interactions; ecological theory; linked interactions; multiple disturbances; perturbations; recovery; repeated disturbances; resilience; resistance; structure; succession",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076365443

Under this horizon, this study evaluates the prospects for large-scale, integrated sugarcane-microalgae biorefineries in terms of their techno-economic and environmental feasibility, as well as the possible benefits brought by the RenovaBio program. Process integration was based on different energy and material vectors obtained from the sugarcane mill, especially the use of fermentation-derived CO2, CO2 in biogas, and vinasse as carbon sources for microalgae growth. Results show that the co-location of microalgae production with sugarcane mills leads to verticalized biorefineries currently behind in economic performance in comparison to conventional sugarcane mills due to an increase in both fixed and operational expenses. Anhydrous ethanol production costs remain in the range of US$ 0.36–0.42/L, below the market price of US$ 0.51/L. Integrating a microalgae facility with a sugarcane mill also helps to further improve the sustainability of anhydrous ethanol production: cradle-to-grave emissions of greenhouse gases fluctuate around 18 g CO2eq/MJ, a reduction of 15% in comparison to conventional sugarcane-based ethanol. Depending on the scenario, a reasonably-sized integrated biorefinery would be able to mitigate around 500 thousand t CO2eq/year when displacing gasoline with anhydrous ethanol. The analysis finally points out to integrated sugarcane-microalgae biorefineries becoming economically feasible at carbon prices as low as US$ 10/t CO2eq under the RenovaBio scheme. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuel policy; Biofuels; Microalgae; Process integration; RenovaBio; Sugarcane","Algae; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Economic analysis; Ethanol; Greenhouse gases; Microorganisms; Refining; Sugar cane; Sustainable development; Biofuel policies; Economic performance; Environmental feasibility; Integrated biorefinery; Micro-algae; National biofuel policies; Process integration; RenovaBio; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071965182

However, the rate of formulation has thus far not been very high among SMEs. This study conducted a questionnaire survey in 2017 targeting SMEs in Sukagawa, Fukushima. We analyzed the 240 responses collected through a Multiple Correspondence Analysis and used Cramer’s coefficient of association to determine the strength of association. Major findings are as follows: 1) Environment-related indices were associated with both BCP formulation and business size, and these associations indicate the possibility of connecting environmental actions or management to BCP formulation. 2) In the association between BCP formulation status and environmental actions, the environmental management system had a stronger association than business size (capital, number of employees). 3) The group interested in the conservation of regulating services related to local natural resources (reducing CO2 emission, water quality, aquatic plants and animals) had a higher rate of BCP formulation. 4) This group considers mutual help more important than self-help or public help. 5) Capital and number of employees have a strong association with both BCP formulation status and their interest in participating in local natural resource conservation. Activities with local society and stakeholders may collectively increase SMEs’ awareness with neighbor enterprises or the local community.

Problems are often observed with carbon-based support materials, due to their limited electrochemical stability. The emphasis is therefore on fabricating high-performance, stable non-carbon alternatives that exhibit advantageous electrochemical properties compared to conventional carbon black, and are thus regarded as ideal electrocatalyst support materials. In this work, we investigated the influence of dopants, and the morphology of conductive, porous doped tin-based oxides, on corrosion resistance and electrical conductivity for fuel cell electrode applications. Among the various doping elements, fluorine anion doping into tin oxide plays a key role in the formation of such structures as a complexing agent for improving electrical conductivity and suppressing electrochemical dissolution processes. When used in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells with platinum electrocatalyst loading, fluorine tin oxide nanotubes exhibit not only cell performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art commercial Pt/C, but also excellent cycling stability. The superior electrochemical performance and stability of this novel non-carbon support material is due to its unique features, i.e., excellent electrical conductivity, electrochemical corrosion resistance, and electronic and compressive strain effects due to strong metal-support interactions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon corrosion; Electrochemical durability; Fluorine-doped tin oxide; Non-carbon electrocatalyst support; Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell","Carbon black; Corrosion resistance; Electric conductivity; Electrocatalysts; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrodes; Nanocomposites; Polyelectrolytes; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Tin oxides; Carbon corrosion; Electrocatalyst support; Electrochemical dissolution; Electrochemical performance; Electrochemical stabilities; Fluorine doped tin oxide; Platinum electrocatalysts; Strong metal support interaction; Solid electrolytes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070802442

As a result, air quality in Seoul has improved. However, no study has reported whether emission reduction policies have affected respiratory morbidities in Korea. Thus, we aimed to assess an association between air pollutant emissions and ambient concentrations, and the effect of implemented emission reduction policies on asthma. The population of Daejeon, one of the metropolitan cities in Korea other than Seoul was used as a reference population to adjust for possible long-term background trend. Trends of air pollutant emissions, ambient concentrations, and hospital visit rates in Seoul and Daejeon were evaluated using descriptive statistics. To evaluate the possible beneficial effect of air pollutant emission reduction policies implemented since 2007 on hospital visits for asthma in Seoul, we conducted interrupted time-series analysis. As a result, we found evidence for the association between emission reductions and reduced ambient concentrations. Trends in hospital visit rates for asthma, which were previously increasing in Seoul, have decreased since the implementation of the policies. Prevented hospital visits cases for asthma in the total population and younger population (0–18 years) were estimated as 500,000 (11.3% of hospital visit cases if there was no intervention) cases and 320,000 (15.5% of hospital visit cases if there was no intervention) cases, respectively in Seoul. Our study provides evidence for the possible beneficial effect of emission reduction policies on hospital visits for asthma. © 2019 The Authors","Accountability; Air pollutant emission; Air pollution; Asthma; Environmental policy; Interrupted time series","Air pollution; Air quality; Diseases; Emission control; Hospitals; Time series analysis; Accountability; Air pollutant emission; Ambient concentrations; Asthma; Descriptive statistics; Emission reduction policies; Environmental policy; Seoul metropolitan area; Environmental protection; accountability; air quality; asthma; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; health risk; pollution policy; public health; time series analysis; air pollutant; ambient air; Article; asthma; disease association; environmental impact; environmental policy; geographic distribution; hospitalization; human; Korea; population research; priority journal; quasi experimental study; trend study; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollution; asthma; child; city; ecosystem restoration; health status; hospitalization; infant; middle aged; newborn; preschool child; prevention and control; South Korea; young adult; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea; Taejon [South Korea]; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Air Pollution; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; Cities; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Health Status; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Middle Aged; Republic of Korea; Seoul; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070221701

Martin Department of Chemical Engineering, University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, AR  72701, United States","The influence of farm-specific beneficial management practices (BMPs) on a set of comprehensive environmental impacts was characterized and quantified for two representative dairy farms in the Great Lakes region (a large 1500-cow farm in New York (NY) and a smaller 150-cow farm in Wisconsin (WI)). Comparative benefits or drawbacks of the effect of the adoption of selected management scenarios to environmental impacts were estimated by coupling the output from the Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM) to provide lifecycle inventory data for SimaPro©. The small dairy farm in WI generated a consistently larger carbon footprint than the large dairy farm in NY due to greater enteric methane (CH4) emissions from different feeds fed and greater nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the bedded pack housing facility for young stock. The flare scenario of burning biogas produced in a covered manure storage on the small farm and a whole-farm mitigation plan of combined feed, field, and manure management in the large farm demonstrate significant potential to reduce overall carbon footprint by 20.0% and 25.8%, respectively, compared to the baselines. The assessments of selective impact categories such as fossil energy use, water use, land occupation, aquatic eutrophication, terrestrial acidification, respiratory effects, human toxicity, and ecotoxicity are discussed and highlight hot spots relevant for sustainable dairy farm management. Normalization analysis indicates that eutrophication potential is the largest relative impact profile, which suggests that efforts to mitigate eutrophication can achieve relatively greater environmental impact reduction. Although this study identifies the beneficial adaptation of sustainable dairy production practices on individual impact profiles, trade-offs between impact categories make the analysis more complex when considering the comprehensive suite of environmental impacts. © 2019","Beneficial management practice; Dairy production system; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gas emission; Life cycle assessment","carbon footprint; dairy farming; emission; environmental impact; eutrophication; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; management practice; production system; Great Lakes [North America]; United States; Wisconsin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069674195

Two different cases of the CO2 injection pressure and temperature at the well head are then simulated using the coupled reservoir-well simulation scheme within a multi-phase thermo-hydrological numerical model. The results of the numerical simulations show that the fluid pressure and temperature and the CO2 injection rate and injectivity in the reservoir rock-injection well system can be quantitatively evaluated using the coupled reservoir-well simulation scheme. The fluid pressure and temperature in the injection well including the well head and bottom can also be simply predicted with assumptions of the hydrostatic fluid pressure transition and the adiabatic fluid temperature transition from the well head to the well bottom using the thermodynamic equation of state (EOS) data of CO2. In addition, the CO2 injection rate and injectivity have very close relationships with the fluid pressure and temperature at the well bottom, respectively, which determine the fluid pressure difference between the injection well bottom and the far-field reservoir rock and the kinematic viscosity of CO2 at the well bottom. The CO2 injection rate increases almost linearly with the fluid pressure difference, whereas the CO2 injectivity varies unsystematically with it. Instead, the CO2 injectivity has an excellent linear relationship with the reciprocal of the kinematic viscosity (i.e., kinematic fluidity) of CO2. These results can be utilized as practical guidelines to determine optimal injection operation schemes for sustainable, safe, and efficient geologic storage of CO2. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide; Coupled reservoir-well simulation scheme; Geologic storage; Injection rate; Injection well; Injectivity; Reservoir rock; Thermo-hydrological numerical evaluation","Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Efficiency; Equations of state; Flow of fluids; Kinematics; Numerical models; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Petroleum reservoirs; Reservoirs (water); Rocks; Temperature; Viscosity of liquids; Wellheads; Coupled reservoir-well simulation scheme; Geologic storage; Injection rates; Injection wells; Injectivity; Reservoir rock; Thermo-hydrological numerical evaluation; Injection (oil wells); carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; equation of state; reservoir impoundment; reservoir rock; steam injection; underground storage; well stimulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071302973

Here, we study the effect of electrolyte composition on CO2 activity to examine whether this is the case. The results indicate that TEGDME-based electrolytes containing moderate concentrations of Li+ salts (roughly within the range of 0.7-2 M examined herein) are most conducive to CO2 activation, especially compared to dimethyl sulfoxide and propylene carbonate-based electrolytes. Through electrochemical, spectroscopic, and computational methods, we determine that glymes have lower desolvation energies for Li+ compared to other solvent candidates, whereas high salt concentrations increase the local density of Li+ surrounding CO2 and reduction intermediates. These attributes collectively increase the availability of Li+, crossing a threshold necessary to support CO2 activation.

Governments around the world have devised various mechanisms and policy strategies to ameliorate the worsening condition of natural environment around the world. Similar to the developed world, in China, the government is also aware of deteriorating environmental conditions. Hence, the existing abatement instruments include pollution discharge fees and several other policy strategies. This research is conducted to investigate the association between pollution intensity and its determinants, i.e., pollutant discharge fees and urban population, third industry structure, and total retail goods consumption. The secondary data of 29 provinces is used for empirical analysis. The principal component analysis is used to develop a single index called pollution intensity, and panel autoregressive distributed lags model (ARDL), or pooled mean group (PMG) analysis, is employed to find long-run and short-run relationship. The empirical findings show that pollution discharge fees negatively affects pollution intensity. Total retail good consumption and urban population increase pollution intensity. However, third industry structure helps to control pollution intensity. These results suggest reforms in the existing environmental regulations policy by targeting more pollutant intensive provinces. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Environmental regulations; Pollution discharge fees; Pollution intensity","abatement cost; consumption behavior; economic instrument; environmental policy; government; industrial structure; panel data; policy making; pollution effect; population growth; regulatory approach; retailing; urban population; China; China; data analysis; environmental policy; human; industry; pollution; population growth; urban population; China; Data Analysis; Environmental Policy; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Industry; Population Growth; Urban Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073946037

Screening for heat tolerance and breeding to increase the heat tolerance of rice is major objective in the situation of recent climate change. Replacing sensitive genotypes with heat tolerant cultivars, modification in sowing time, and use of growth regulators are some of the adaptive strategies for the mitigation of yield reduction by climate change. Different strategies could be adopted to enhance the thermos-tolerance of rice by (1) the modification of agronomic practices i.e., adjusting sowing time or selecting early morning flowering cultivars; (2) induction of acclimation by using growth regulators and fertilizers; (3) selecting the genetically heat resistant cultivars by breeding; and, (4) developing genetic modification. Understanding the differences among the genotypes could be exploited for the identification of traits that are responsible for thermo-tolerance for breeding purpose. The selection of cultivars that flowers in early morning before the increase of temperature, and having larger anthers with long basal pore, higher basal dehiscence, and pollen viability could induce higher thermo-tolerance. Furthermore, the high expression of heat shock proteins could impart thermo-tolerance by protecting structural proteins and enzymes. Thus, these traits could be considered for breeding programs to develop resistant cultivars under a changing climate. © 2019 by the authors.

To understand these effects, we sampled tea (Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze) grown in different environmental conditions. Using a target/nontarget data analysis approach, we detected 564 metabolites from tea grown at two elevations in spring and summer over 3 years in two major tea-producing areas of China. Principal component analysis and partial least squares-discriminant analysis show seasonal, elevational, and yearly differences in tea from Yunnan and Fujian provinces. Independent of location, higher concentrations of compounds with aromas characteristic of farmers’ perceptions of high-quality tea were found in spring and high elevation teas. Yunnan teas were distinct from Fujian teas, but the effects of elevation and season were different for the two locations. Elevation was the largest source of metabolite variation in Yunnan yet had no effect in Fujian. In contrast seasonal differences were strong in both locations. Importantly, the year-to-year variation in chemistry at both locations emphasizes the importance of doing multi-year studies, and further highlights the challenge farmers face when trying to produce teas with specific flavor/health (metabolite) profiles. © Copyright © 2019 Kfoury, Scott, Orians, Ahmed, Cash, Griffin, Matyas, Stepp, Han, Xue, Long and Robbat.","climate change; elevation; gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; metabolomics; plant-climate interactions; season; tea quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076994333

At the same time a growing number of disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation measures are being implemented by governmental and non-governmental organizations, and substantial post-disaster donations are frequently pledged. At the same time there has been increasing demand for transparency and accountability, and thus evidence of those measures having a positive effect. We hypothesized that resilience-enhancing interventions should result in less damage during a hazard event, or at least quicker recovery. In this study we assessed recovery over a 3 year period of seven municipalities in the central Philippines devastated by Typhoon Haiyan in 2013. We used very high resolution optical images ( < 1 m), and created detailed land cover and land use maps for four epochs before and after the event, using a machine learning approach with extreme gradient boosting. The spatially and temporally highly variable recovery maps were then statistically related to detailed questionnaire data acquired by DEval in 2012 and 2016, whose principal aim was to assess the impact of a 10 year land-planning intervention program by the German agency for technical cooperation (GIZ). The survey data allowed very detailed insights into DRR-related perspectives, motivations and drivers of the affected population. To some extent they also helped to overcome the principal limitation of remote sensing, which can effectively describe but not explain the reasons for differential recovery. However, while a number of causal links between intervention parameters and reconstruction was found, the common notion that a resilient community should recover better and more quickly could not be confirmed. The study also revealed a number of methodological limitations, such as the high cost for commercial image data not matching the spatially extensive but also detailed scale of field evaluations, the remote sensing analysis likely overestimating damage and thus providing incorrect recovery metrics, and image data catalogues especially for more remote communities often being incomplete. Nevertheless, the study provides a valuable proof of concept for the synergies resulting from an integration of socio-economic survey data and remote sensing imagery for recovery assessment. © 2019 by the authors.","Disaster; resilience; Evaluation; German development cooperation; Gradient boosting; Haiyan; Impact; Land use planning; Machine learning; Philippines","Adaptive boosting; Climate change; Disasters; Geometrical optics; Land use; Learning systems; Machine learning; Population statistics; Recovery; Risk assessment; Surveys; Development cooperations; Evaluation; Gradient boosting; Haiyan; Impact; Land Use Planning; Philippines; Remote sensing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074655854

Here, we assess how the on-going expansion of arable land and urban areas is affecting the availability of common resources, such as forest and grazing land, and the availability of biomass for food, feed, and energy. Taking the Hawassa area in the Rift Valley of Ethiopia as a study case, this study aims at analysing the drivers of change of farming systems, assessing farmers’ responses to these drivers and appreciating the consequences for the agricultural landscapes’ composition. We found that (i) national-level policies, climate and soil fertility changes, population increase, and urban expansion were major drivers of farming systems change in the Hawassa area, (ii) forests and grasslands have been progressively replaced by cropland and urban areas, and (iii) these changes resulted in fragmentation and diversification of local agricultural landscapes with potential consequences for ecosystem service provision. Farmers responded with the following three main livelihood strategies: consolidation, diversification and specialization. These changes led to more diverse and fragmented agricultural landscapes.

The intermediate temperature (500°C-750°C) SOFC (IT-SOFC) has been developed to satisfy the operation requirements of SOFCs. During SOFC operation, fuels and oxidant are introduced to the anode and cathode, respectively.

For certain values (including its current value) of the solar constant, the climate system allows two different stable states: one of them is the snowball Earth, covered by ice and snow, and the other one is today's climate. In our setup, we consider the case when the climate system starts from its warm attractor (the stable climate we experience today), and the solar constant is changed according to the following scenario: it is decreased continuously and abruptly, over one year, to a state, where only the Snowball Earth's attractor remains stable. This induces an inevitable transition or climate tipping from the warm climate. The reverse transition is also discussed. Increasing the solar constant back to its original value in a similar way, in individual simulations, depending on the rate of the solar constant reduction, we find that either the system stays stuck in the snowball state or returns to warm climate. However, using ensemble methods, i.e., using an ensemble of climate realizations differing only slightly in their initial conditions we show that the transition from the snowball Earth to the warm climate is also possible with a certain probability, which depends on the specific scenario used. From the point of view of dynamical systems theory, we can say that the system's snapshot attractor splits between the warm climate's and the snowball Earth's attractor. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074692335

The study further provides new insight into the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction potential within the mobile telecommunications and energy sectors. The carbon handprint of a novel Finnish liquid-cooled base station technology is quantified. The liquid-cooled base station provides a telecommunications service and waste heat that is recoverable through the cooling liquid for heating purposes. The baseline solutions are an air-cooled base station, and district and electrical heating. The liquid-cooled base station creates a carbon handprint, both through energy savings in telecommunications and additional waste heat reuse, replacing other energy production methods. A large-scale climate change mitigation potential through a liquid-cooled base station expansion could be significant. Different supply chain operators’ contributions to the total carbon handprint could be terminologically distinguished in communications to emphasize their roles in a shared handprint. The handprint should be transparently communicated for each customer and function. © 2019 by the authors.","Base station; Carbon footprint; Carbon handprint; Handprint; LCA; Life cycle assessment; Liquid cooling; Waste heat reuse","Base stations; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Emission control; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Liquids; Sales; Supply chains; Waste heat; Carbon footprint reductions; Climate change mitigation; Handprint; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Liquid cooling; Mobile telecommunications; Research questions; Telecommunications services; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076149373

With decrease in inoculum concentration, GAC-supplemented bioreactors showed faster methane production rates and reduced lag times. Geobacter species were specifically enriched on the GAC surfaces under lower inoculum concentration conditions. Together, the relative abundance of aceticlastic methanogens (competitors of Geobacter species for acetate) gradually decreased when the inoculum concentration increased. These results suggested that the specific enrichment of Geobacter species by outcompeting with aceticlastic methanogens through low inoculum concentrations on GAC surfaces accelerated methanogenesis by DIET via GAC in anaerobic bioreactors. Taken together, the results of this study suggested that inoculum concentration is an important factor in stimulating DIET for methane production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digester; Direct interspecies electron transfer; Enrichment; Geobacter species; Inoculum concentration","Activated carbon; Bioconversion; Bioreactors; Blast enrichment; Methane; Methanogens; Aceticlastic methanogen; Anaerobic bioreactors; Anaerobic digester; Electron transfer; Geobacter; Granular activated carbons; Inoculum concentrations; Microbial community composition; Electron transitions; activated carbon; methane; activated carbon; anaerobic digestion; bacterium; community composition; concentration (composition); inoculation; methane; methanogenesis; microbial community; nutrient enrichment; performance assessment; relative abundance; Article; DNA extraction; electron transport; environmental factor; Geobacter; high throughput sequencing; inoculation; interspecies electron transfer; methanogenesis; microbial community; nonhuman; priority journal; reactor operation; sampling; bioreactor; biosynthesis; Euryarchaeota; metabolism; microflora; Geobacter sp.; Bioreactors; Electron Transport; Euryarchaeota; Geobacter; Methane; Microbiota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070104267

For modeling, a kinetic model has been used to justify the two-stage system behavior using MATLAB software. In writing the equations for modeling in the first reactor, variations are taken with time, while in the second reactor, the equations are written in solid and liquid phase and in steady state. The relationship used in most cases to represent the kinetics of bacterial growth is the equation called Monod, which is used in modeling the system. The systems have been investigated at mesophilic temperature and the effect of the reaction's resistance on the boundary layer has been neglected in the concentrations around the granules. According to the modeling, by increasing the residence time and the concentration of input waste, the percentage of removal of organic compounds will increase and fluctuate between the oxygen content of 67–81% and the methane production efficiency will reduce (until less than 0.1 L CH4 g−1 CODremoved−1) that is agreement with laboratory model in 19th day. The results and studies have shown that the modeling performed for a two-stage system can be used in the mesophilic temperature conditions, and the internal mass transfer resistance in the granules is a controlling process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Mesophilic; Potato leachate; Two-stage; UASB reactor","Biogas; Boundary layers; Carbon dioxide; Granulation; Growth kinetics; Mass transfer; MATLAB; Methane; Controlling process; Hydraulic retention time; Internal mass transfer; Leachates; Mesophilic; Mesophilic temperature; Methane production; UASB reactor; Anaerobic digestion; anaerobic digestion; biogas; bioreactor; equation; hydraulic property; hydrolysis; leachate; methanogenesis; methanogenic bacterium; numerical model; potato; reaction kinetics; retention; Bacteria (microorganisms); Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072555649

An accurate characterization of shale reservoir rock properties would positively impact hydrocarbon exploration and production planning. We integrate large-scale geologic components with small-scale petrophysical rock properties to categorize distinct rock types in low-porosity and low-permeability shales. We then use this workflow to distinguish three rock types in the reservoir interval of the Niobrara Shale in the Denver Basin of the United States: the Upper Chalks (A, B, and C Chalk), the Marls (A, B, and C Marl), and the Lower Chalks (D Chalk and Fort Hays Limestone). In our study area, we find that the Upper Chalk has better reservoir-rock quality, moderate source-rock potential, stiffer rocks, and a higher fraction of compliant micro- and nanopores. On the other hand, the Marls have moderate reservoir-rock quality and a higher source-rock potential. The Upper Chalks and the Marls should have major economic potential. The Lower Chalk has higher porosity and a higher fraction of micro- and nanopores; however, it exhibits poor source-rock potential.

Socio-economic factors have a tremendous influence on whether a farmer or a nation can adapt to these climate stressors. This study aims to examine the extent to which these factors affect maize vulnerability to drought in SSA. To differentiate sensitive regions from resilient ones, we defined a crop drought vulnerability index (CDVI) calculated by comparing recorded yield with expected yield simulated by the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model during 1990-2012. We then assessed the relationship between CDVI and potential socio-economic variables using regression techniques and identified the influencing variables. The results show that the level of fertilizer use is a highly influential factor on vulnerability. Additionally, countries with higher food production index and better infrastructure are more resilient to drought. The role of the government effectiveness variable was less apparent across the SSA countries due to being generally stationary. Improving adaptations to drought through investing in infrastructure, improving fertilizer distribution, and fostering economic development would contribute to drought resilience. © 2019 by the authors.","Crop model; Drought adaptation; EPIC; Regression techniques","agricultural modeling; agricultural production; crop plant; drought; economic development; food production; maize; NDVI; precipitation (climatology); quantitative analysis; regression analysis; vulnerability; Sub-Saharan Africa; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074826536

In contrast to raising biomass harvests in forests, purpose-grown biomass does not interfere with forest carbon (C) stocks. Provided that agricultural land can be diverted from food and feed production without impairing food security, energy plantations on current agricultural land appear as a beneficial option in terms of renewable, climate-friendly energy supply. However, instead of supporting energy plantations, land could also be devoted to natural succession. It then acts as a long-term C sink which also results in C benefits. We here compare the sink strength of natural succession on arable land with the C saving effects of bioenergy from plantations. Using geographically explicit data on global cropland distribution among climate and ecological zones, regionally specific C accumulation rates are calculated with IPCC default methods and values. C savings from bioenergy are given for a range of displacement factors (DFs), acknowledging the varying efficiency of bioenergy routes and technologies in fossil fuel displacement. A uniform spatial pattern is assumed for succession and bioenergy plantations, and the considered timeframes range from 20 to 100 years. For many parameter settings—in particular, longer timeframes and high DFs—bioenergy yields higher cumulative C savings than natural succession. Still, if woody biomass displaces liquid transport fuels or natural gas-based electricity generation, natural succession is competitive or even superior for timeframes of 20–50 years. This finding has strong implications with climate and environmental policies: Freeing land for natural succession is a worthwhile low-cost natural climate solution that has many co-benefits for biodiversity and other ecosystem services. A considerable risk, however, is C stock losses (i.e., emissions) due to disturbances or land conversion at a later time. © 2019 The Authors.

The simulations were performed with the use of a commercial program FactSage, and the calculations followed the procedure of dosing the reducer to slag in portions, each time reaching the state of thermodynamic equilibrium. The calculation procedure was realized sequentially, and the equilibrium composition of gaseous phase, nonmetallic phase and separated Fe was established at each calculation step. Gaseous products of CO and CO2 reduction were removed from the system with each successive calculation step. The simulation revealed that reaching comparable results of reduction requires using a considerable amount of CO. Moreover, the CO2 content in the gaseous phase and amount of separated Fe depend on the type of reducer. It was observed that the main mechanism was the reduction of iron with C. In this case the composition of gaseous products was mainly dominated by CO-CO2. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Metal recovery; Slags; Calculation procedure; CO2 reduction; Converter slags; Equilibrium compositions; Gaseous phase; Gaseous products; Liquid slags; Thermodynamic equilibria; Iron oxides",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076619863

The use of species distribution models (SDMs) to predict habitat suitability, both currently and in the future under the effects of climate change, offers a potential solution for estimating extinction risk. With a set of validated observations, we used SDMs to make preliminary evaluations of the risk of extinction for 114 Egyptian medicinal plants based on IUCN Red-List Criteria and Categories. Using MaxEnt and eleven environmental variables, distributions were projected for 2020, 2050, and 2080 under two emission scenarios (A2a and B2a) assuming unlimited and no dispersal. The IUCN assessments used the predicted distributions as well as the actual records to measure both extent of occurrence (EOO) and area of occupancy (AOO). There was a positive correlation between EOO estimates based on actual records and those based on SDMs, demonstrating the ability of SDMs to compensate for a lack of data. Most species could be classified as Least Concern (LC) at the current time, whilst in the future under climate change, many species face some risk of extinction, depending on assumptions. We conclude that it is possible to make regional risk assessments even in data-sparse countries, in order to plan conservation management in the future. Using species distribution modelling together with IUCN Red-List assessment is a good method for countries where data are sparse in order to conserve and protect threatened species. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Conservation planning; Ecological niche modelling; Egypt; IUCN assessment; MaxEnt","assessment method; climate change; conservation management; conservation planning; ecological modeling; endangered species; extinction risk; integrated approach; medicinal plant; Red List",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066623231

Several countries are working on improving their energy policies as a step of moving towards renewable energy resources. As a part of this movement in Australian, Victorian government has released several initiatives for rebates like small trading certificate (STC) for the Grid-connected rooftop solar, battery rebates, other rebates for a standalone system. Due to rapid decline in the price of the PV system, Australia is experiencing massive growth in rooftop PV. The question arises in everyone's mind is to stay connected to Grid or going off-Grid? Now, both the systems have its pros and cons, but the lack of accurate analytical design approach resulted in a significant amount of oversizing, high costs is involved in the project and wastage of the resources. Hence, the installation of Grid-connected system has been increased a lot in the market and due to this oversizing of the system, excess solar feeding into the Grid, understandable it is beneficial because, it reduces the emission from the fossil fuel generators by displacing but the local electricity distribution network might be unable to digest these excess exports which are happening and confirmed by several residential households when they discovered their grid voltage is higher (i.e., 255 V ~ 260 V) than the nominal voltage 230 V. This resulted in PV system generating less than it should, and the consumers ended up getting higher bill than before solar installation. So, the networks are started to tighten their PV connection agreement by export limiting the system partially or entirely zero export.

These studies play an important role in the energy policy debate on understanding and assessing different transformation paths of the energy system, technology options and their implications. They support strategic decisions on the type and scale of investments in the energy system under uncertain future conditions. However, in recent years the increasing complexity of these studies lead to a decreasing transparency even though their transparency and traceability is important for society, politics, research, and industry. In this article, three energy scenarios at different regional scales are reviewed according to their compliance with our pre-defined criteria of transparency. They are analysed in detail with regard to their objectives, methods, data used, results obtained and traceability. Our comparison shows that the results are often presented sufficiently in order to inform decision makers. However, the underlying model-based methods lack information on data exchange between the models, the transparent description of model couplings and a discussion on the rationality of method selection and the strengths and weaknesses of the applied approaches.

Field-emission scanning electron and confocal laser scanning microscopic images showed that the PSGs were completely concealed by the α-glucan coating layer. This carbohydrate-based encapsulant displayed higher amount of resistant glucan contents due to the elongated chains of the glucan coating, resulting in lower digestibility of these PSGs in simulated digestive fluid systems. Among the various PSGs evaluated, the highest loading efficiency for the bioactive molecule crocin was observed with the β-amylase-induced PSGs (β-PSGs) that had the smallest nanosize pores. Furthermore, α-glucan-coated β-PSGs showed the highest capacity to preserve the loaded crocin when incubated in simulated digestive fluids. This suggests that the α-glucan-coated β-PSGs can potentially be used for the delayed release of the core material in the upper region of the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, this system can be potentially utilized as an effective carrier for colon-specific delivery, and the release of the bioactive compound can be triggered by beneficial intestinal microbiota. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Coatings; Coremaking; Granulation; Bioactive compounds; Bioactive molecules; Colon-specific delivery; Confocal laser scanning; Field emission scanning; Gastrointestinal tract; Loading efficiency; Microscopic image; Starch; alpha glucan; amylase; beta amylase; beta porous starch granule; crocin; drug carrier; glucan; glucan 1,4 alpha glucosidase; starch; unclassified drug; amylosucrase; carotenoid; drug carrier; glucan; glucosyltransferase; starch; Article; biocatalysis; confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; enzymatic hydrolysis; field emission scanning electron microscopy; gastrointestinal tract; in vitro study; intestine flora; nanofabrication; particle size; priority journal; reaction time; antibody specificity; biocatalysis; chemistry; colon; drug delivery system; drug effect; enzymology; human; microbiology; Neisseria; porosity; scanning electron microscopy; Biocatalysis; Carotenoids; Colon; Drug Carriers; Drug Delivery Systems; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Gastrointestinal Tract; Glucans; Glucosyltransferases; Humans; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Neisseria; Organ Specificity; Porosity; Starch",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073253635

Simulations were performed in a chaparral shrubland and a coniferous pine forest representative of the southeast United States. In each case, simulations were carried out under marginal and critical fire conditions. Marginal fire conditions include high moisture levels and low winds, often desired for prescribed fires as these conditions produce a low-intensity burn with slower spread rates. Critical fire conditions include low moisture levels and high winds, which easily lead to uncontrollable wildfires which produce a high-intensity burn with faster spread rates. These simulations' resultant particle emission profiles show critical fire conditions generate larger particle emission factors, higher total mass emissions, and a higher lofting potential of particles into the atmosphere when compared against marginal fire conditions but similar particle size distrubtions.

We show that climatic changes correlate with the termination of the so-called Gressbakken phase (4200–3500 cal BP), and unpack the middle-range mechanisms linking the Gressbakken termination to contemporaneous changes in the biophysical environment. We show that what was a Holocene extreme, and likely volcanically-induced, climate deterioration around 3550 cal BP coincided with a population decline as reflected in the frequency of radiocarbon-dated archeological sites along with major changes in material culture and settlement pattern. Together, these proxies suggest a return to forms of social and economic organization based on lower population densities, higher residential mobility, and reduced locational investments. In establishing the middle-range ecological mechanics mediating these changes into archeologically observable patterns, the results indicate that the Gressbakken termination was the result of a particularly unstable climate period characterized by regional paludification, increased effective precipitation, forest decline, and likely impacts on reindeer populations and their migratory behavior, with drastic human implications. We argue for a convergent catastrophe-scenario in which a series of hardships between 4000 and 3500 cal BP exceeded the adaptive mitigation capabilities of the contemporaneous Arctic Norwegian population. Our study supports the notion that increased sedentism and locational investment actually increases vulnerability in the face of rapid biophysical change and contributes to the growing database of past human ecodynamics that speak to current socio-ecological concerns. © The Author(s) 2019.","adaptive strategies; Arctic Norway; climate forcing; Gressbakken phase; human ecodynamics; palaeodemography; resilience; risk mitigation; tephrochronology","adaptive management; archaeological evidence; biophysics; climate forcing; convergent evolution; demographic history; population decline; radiocarbon dating; resilience; Stone Age; tephrochronology; vulnerability; Arctic; Norway; Rangifer tarandus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070450809

It can also be useful as a tool in macroeconomic stabilisation, while public spending on quality infrastructure projects has been shown to have significantly greater multiplier effects than tax cuts – so the case for an increasing spend is not undermined by a country's overall debt level. These arguments are especially apposite for post-Brexit UK. Britain's investment performance in general has been especially poor since the 2016 EU referendum. Fixed capital formation as a proportion of GDP is low by international standards, while the government's share of fixed capital formation, at 2.5 per cent, is also below average. It would make sense to target an increase in public and private infrastructure spend to 3.5 per cent of GDP which is the OECD's recommended level. While major infrastructure projects continue to generate controversy on grounds of cost overruns and other issues, UK policy-makers have recently taken a more constructive approach to infrastructure development, notably with the creation of an independent National Infrastructure Commission. But the UK's infrastructure remains unsatisfactory, with significant parts of its energy, water, transport and communications networks in need of renewal or replacement, and infrastructure project delivery remains poor. In summary, much of Britain continues to operate well into the 21st century largely with 20th century, sometimes 19th century, infrastructure assets that are creating bottlenecks, crimping productivity, putting off potential foreign investors, undermining the economy's competitiveness, increasing inequality, and leaving the economy ill-equipped to face future challenges such as Brexit and climate change. The government needs to be bolder, setting out a more ambitious set of priorities including energy projects, regional spending, and fostering capital recycling and private sector investment. A still more ambitious, but eminently feasible, proposal would be to establish a National Investment Bank to offer project guarantees, recommend user fees, lend to projects with the proceeds of National Investment Bonds and simplify planning among other tasks. In a serious downturn, with monetary policy exhausted, the NIB could also help to co-ordinate and finance a response. © 2019 National Institute of Economic and Social Research.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074269758

Experience suggests that long-term strategies for a single sector could yield both trade-offs and synergies for other sectors. Thus, long-term transition pathways for linked resource systems should be informed using nexus approaches. Global integrated assessment models can represent the synergies and trade-offs inherent in the exploitation of water, energy and land (WEL) resources, including the impacts of international trade and climate policies. In this study, we review the current state-of-the-science in global integrated assessment modeling with an emphasis on how models have incorporated integrated WEL solutions. A large-scale assessment of the relevant literature was performed using online databases and structured keyword search queries. The results point to the following main opportunities for future research and model development: (1) improving the temporal and spatial resolution of economic models for the energy and water sectors; (2) balancing energy and land requirements across sectors; (3) integrated representation of the role of distribution infrastructure in alleviating resource challenges; (4) modeling of solution impacts on downstream environmental quality; (5) improved representation of the implementation challenges stemming from regional financial and institutional capacity; (6) enabling dynamic multi-sectoral vulnerability and adaptation needs assessment; and (7) the development of fully-coupled assessment frameworks based on consistent, scalable, and regionally-transferable platforms.

Silicate weathering is thought to represent a negative feedback to changes in atmospheric pCO2. The Late Cretaceous-Early Cenozoic was characterized by elevated atmospheric pCO2 and greenhouse climate, widely thought to be due to increased magmatic flux from mid-ocean ridges, flood basalts and continental arcs. Of interest here is the role of continental arcs in modulating long term atmospheric CO2 contents and climate. Continental arc magmatism is accompanied by rapid uplift and erosion due to magmatic/tectonic thickening of the crust, thus, the development of continental arcs might also enhance the global efficiency of silicate weathering, in turn increasing the efficiency of carbon sequestration. To assess the contribution of continental arcs to global carbon sinks, we conducted a case study in the Cretaceous Peninsular Ranges batholith (PRB) and associated forearc basin in southern California, USA, representing one segment of a Mesozoic circum-Pacific continental arc system. Arc magmatism occurred between 170-85 Ma, peaking at 100 Ma. Erosion occurred during magmatism and continued well into the early Eocene, with forearc sediments representing the products of this protracted unroofing of the arc. By calculating the depletion of Ca in forearc sediments relative to their arc protoliths, we estimate chemical weathering fluxes (in equivalent CO2) to be ∼106 mol km−2yr−1 near the end of magmatism, decreasing to ∼105 mol km−2yr−1 by the Early Eocene. Integrated over the entire magmatic and post-magmatic history of the batholith, the total amount of CO2 consumed through chemical weathering is comparable to that degassed. However, during magmatism, the regional degassing flux exceeds the regional weathering flux even though the efficiency of weathering is increased due to magmatic and tectonic uplift. After magmatism ends, continued erosion from remnant topography causes the arc to transition into a net regional sink, increasing the global efficiency of chemical weathering and amplifying cooling after magmatism ends. Understanding how atmospheric CO2 and climate vary over long timescales requires an understanding of how magmatic orogenies enhance degassing but also increase the strength of the global silicate weathering feedback. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","continental arc; feedback strength; long-term carbon cycle; Peninsular Ranges; silicate weathering","Atmospheric chemistry; Basalt; Carbon dioxide; Degassing; Efficiency; Erosion; Feedback; Geochemistry; Organic carbon; Silicates; Topography; Carbon cycles; continental arc; Feedback strength; Peninsular Ranges; Silicate weathering; Weathering; batholith; chemical weathering; continental arc; degassing; forearc basin; long-term change; magmatism; silicate; tectonic evolution; uplift; Coast Ranges; Peninsular Ranges",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070617864

To capture the detailed atomic microstructure of methane moving in rough nanochannel accurately, the modification of OPLS methane fully atomic model is employed. The average number density distributions of C (H) atom, average velocity profile, velocity autocorrelation function and projection radial distribution function (XOY-, XOZ- and YOZ planes) plots give a clear observation of the impacts of different conditions (roughness, body driving force, fluid–wall interaction strength and cutoff radius) on the methane Poiseuille flow in nanochannel. The projection radial distribution functions and diffusivity appear anisotropic, and seem to be affected more significantly by roughness, fluid–wall interaction strength and cutoff radius than body driving force in the whole channel region.

Herein, high-performance carbonized waste corrugated boards (CCB) reinforced with epoxy coating as lightweight structured electromagnetic (EM) shields were demonstrated, and the resultant CCB samples not only exhibited excellent shielding effectiveness (SE) of ∼46.0-82.0 dB and ideal special SE value of ∼325-1171 dB/(g/cm3) related to their carbonization temperature or different types at the frequency region of ∼8.2-12.4 GHz (X-band), but also showed superior thermal-insulation capability, comparable to expanded polypropylene foam. Such shielding performance should ascribe to their high electrical conductivity, as well as special structure (sawtooth pattern sandwiched between two parallel surfaces), capable of internal multiple reflections and constructive interference. Moreover, the further construction of an ultrathin graphene skin-layer on the CCB surfaces could reduce the carbonization temperature while keeping their SE value, suggesting an effective and facile approach for energy-saving.

Founded in 1229, it is the country's oldest city. It is situated around the Aura River, which flows into the Baltic Sea, making it an ideal location for its 184,000 inhabitants and 20,000 enterprises. In June 2018, the city unveiled an ambitious climate plan to be carbon neutral by 2029. This plan was prepared according to the common model of the European Union (EU) (SECAP, Sustainable energy and climate action plan) with key milestones for years 2021, 2025, and 2029. It focuses on both adaptation and mitigation strategies with six measures outlined as necessary to meet the targets, two of which directly target citizen outreach and engagement. These two measures focus on mobilizing communities as partners in the climate plan and on raising awareness of climate change. Given its significance to the plan, this paper examines stakeholder engagement in the City of Turku's climate policies from a governance perspective. It asks the question, how does stakeholder participation materialize in the City of Turku's carbon neutral planning process? It aims to give a snapshot of baseline stakeholder participation in the city's carbon neutral aspirations. It has found that whilst the plan contains ambitions for stakeholder participation, it is not fully implemented. It recommends a citizen facilitated public participation steering group that aims to inspire citizens towards taking action and engaging in the decision-making process for a carbon neutral 2029. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon neutral; Cities; Climate change; Engagement; Public; Stakeholder participation; Turku","adaptive management; climate change; decision making; European Union; governance approach; social participation; stakeholder; urban area; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Europe; Finland; Turku; Varsinais-Suomi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074813303

In their NDCs, states propose governance mechanisms for implementation of climate action, in turn distinguishing appropriate roles for the state in climate governance. Clarity on Parties’ suggested roles for the state makes explicit assumptions on the premise of climate policy, in turn contributing to enhanced transparency in negotiations on the scaling-up of NDCs. This also speaks to ongoing debates on roles for the state in climate governance literature. This article identifies the governance mechanisms proposed by states in their NDCs and the roles for the state envisioned by those governance mechanisms, and also examines how cross-national patterns of roles for the state break or converge with conventional patterns of international politics. The analysis shows that states propose a plurality of roles, which to different extents may be complementary or conflictual. We conclude that income, region, and the Annexes under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are important for understanding suggested roles for the state, but that there are nuances to be further explored. We argue that this paper has three key findings: i) a majority of states rely on market mechanisms to implement their NDCs while rules on implementation and assessment of market mechanisms are still an outstanding issue in the negotiations, meaning that resolving this issue will be essential; ii) the process for evaluating and assessing qualitative governance mechanisms needs to be specified; and iii) increased awareness of differing views on the state’s roles makes explicit different perspectives on what constitutes an ambitious and legitimate contribution to combating climate change. Key policy insights A majority of states (> 75%) envision the state as regulator (creating and strengthening legislation), market facilitator (creating and maintaining market structures), or facilitator (creating more favourable material conditions for climate-friendly behaviour). Greater awareness of differing views on roles for the state can increase understanding of different perspectives on ambition and legitimacy of contributions, in turn facilitating trust in negotiations. A distinction between substantive and procedural qualitative governance mechanisms and their function and interaction would facilitate the stocktaking dialogues. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The reproductive timing of insectivorous songbirds in temperate forests is tightly synchronized with peak prey abundance, and thus they can be susceptible to such shift in timing. We aimed to investigate the effect of future climate change on the egg-laying phenology of the Varied Tit (Sittiparus various), which is common and widely distributed in South Korean forests. We developed the predictive model by investigating their egg-laying dates in response to spring temperatures along geographical gradients, and our model indicated that the tits lay eggs earlier when the average of daily mean and daily maximum temperatures rise. We predicted future shifts in egg-laying dates based on the most recent climate change model published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), under a scenario with no climate change mitigation and under a scenario with moderate mitigation. Under this outcome, this species might be unable to adapt to rapid climate change due to asynchrony with prey species during the reproductive period. If no mitigation is undertaken, our model predicts that egg-laying dates will be advanced by more than 10 days compared to the present in 83.58% of South Korea. However, even moderate mitigation will arrest this phenomenon and maintain present egg-laying dates. These results demonstrate the first quantitative assessment for the effect of warming temperatures on the phenological response of insectivorous songbirds in South Korea. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

There is no reasonable decision support model for green remodeling, however, that is capable of determining the target building, which has low energy performance, from the viewpoint of the non-expert building owners and policymakers. To solve this problem, this study developed a decision support model for determining the target multi-family housing complex (MFHC) for green remodeling using data mining techniques. Specifically, a total of 589 MFHCs were classified into three groups using a decision tree. Based on the operational rating system, the CO2 emission (CE) intensity by group was analyzed, and the results showed that Case No. 1,089 (0.0368 tCO2/m2) was the target MFHC where green modeling needed to be performed first. Also, most of the 88 MFHCs belong to grade E, the lowest grade in terms of CE intensity, were located in specific regions (i.e., Gangnam-gu, Seocho-gu, etc.). Thus, the developed decision support model can be used to determine the regions with a high demand for green remodeling, and to establish an efficient government budget. © 2019","CO2 emissions; Data mining technique; Decision tree; Green remodeling; Multi-family housing complex; Operational rating system","Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Decision support systems; Decision trees; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Housing; Trees (mathematics); Building sectors; CO2 emission reduction; CO2 emissions; Decision support models; Energy performance; Green remodeling; Multi-family housings; Rating system; Data mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071767382

By analysing how the EU, national and regional development policy mix affects environmental outcomes we show the importance of context in terms of assessing the contribution to air pollution of different stakeholders such as foreign investors. The results show that while state owned firms pollute more, new domestic firms make a positive contribution to reducing emitted particulate matter and foreign owned subsidiaries on average have an increasing or neutral impact on air pollution. However, territorial policy becomes in Poland the focal point for understanding these changes as there are large differences for areas that are subject to this policy. When accounting for the combinations in these policies results suggest that zone governance has been very effective in reducing emissions of particulate matter. Zones combine ownership changes with technological changes associated with restructuring of enterprises and FDI along with EU subsidies associated with technology policies such as adoption of more green technologies in general. Both policy factors (e.g. using FDI to restructure former SOEs within the zones and using zones also as a policy tool to distribute structural funds) aid in reducing emissions, while to the extent we can compare them (due to differential measuring scales) we conclude that technology policy through structural funds has been by far the most effective policy tool towards curbing high emissions levels in Poland. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Foreign direct investment; Green technologies; Policy mix; Technology policy; Territorial policy","atmospheric pollution; emission control; foreign direct investment; market conditions; ownership; particulate matter; regional development; technology policy; territory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069856382

The article shows that, in some cases, there is evidence that SEAP development is a project-based activity, supported by external experts. From municipal personnel point of view, it is a project that ends with approved SEAP, but not a part of their future daily routine. Eventually implementation of the plan is difficult, because municipalities lack experience in daily management of energy data, distribution of responsibilities and implementation of procedures. Municipalities also tend to exclude important stakeholders in their SEAPs, like, private sector, household sector and transport sector, which lead to lower targets and lower achievements in GHG reduction. © 2019 Anda Jekabsone et al., published by Sciendo 2019.","Energy management; energy planning; municipality; sustainable energy action plan","action plan; alternative energy; data management; energy planning; implementation process; monitoring; Latvia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076278970

Multiple organic compound tracers including 36 PAH members, 25 n-alkane homologs, 17 hopanes, and 12 steranes were used for organic aerosols source apportionment. Source apportionment based on specific molecular markers, molecular diagnostic ratios/indices, and positive matrix factorization (PMF) modeling showed that similar sources are responsible for both fine- and coarse-particle organic pollutants. PMF analysis showed that biogenic aerosols, fugitive dust emissions, gasoline engine emissions, diesel engine emissions, and heavy oil combustion were the five main pollution sources of organic aerosols, which agreed well with the results from the diagnostic ratios analysis. The conditional bivariate probability functions (CPF) and potential source contribution function (PSCF) indicated that both regional (i.e., mixed biogenic/secondary particles and oil refinery/shipping emissions) and local sources contributed to airborne organic aerosol concentrations observed at the site, depending on the wind speed and direction. It appears that the relatively high levels of organic pollutants were contributed by local anthropogenic sources, such as fossil fuel combustion, vehicular emissions, and fugitive dust emissions. The high levels of local contributions indicated that there might be great opportunities for Qatar to considerably reduce emissions so that population exposures to carbonaceous aerosols and the public health risks associated with air pollution can be minimized. Implications: Multiple organic tracers and various source apportionment techniques have been used for convincing source apportionment. It was found that both long-range and local sources have a significant impact on atmospheric carbonaceous particles in the area, depending on the wind conditions.

Both effects may be important for peatlands as the carbon (C) sink potential of these ecosystems depends on the balance between plant C uptake through photosynthesis and microbial decomposition. Here, we show that the effect of climate warming on Sphagnum community photosynthesis toggles from positive to negative as the peatland goes from rainy to dry periods during summer. More particularly, we show that mechanisms of compensation among the dominant Sphagnum species (Sphagnum fallax and Sphagnum medium) stabilize the average photosynthesis and productivity of the Sphagnum community during summer despite rising temperatures and frequent droughts. While warming had a negligible effect on S. medium photosynthetic capacity (Amax) during rainy periods, Amax of S. fallax increased by 40%. On the opposite, warming exacerbated the negative effects of droughts on S. fallax with an even sharper decrease of its Amax while S. medium Amax remained unchanged. S. medium showed a remarkable resistance to droughts due to anatomical traits favouring its water holding capacity. Our results show that different phenotypic plasticity among dominant Sphagnum species allow the community to cope with rising temperatures and repeated droughts, maintaining similar photosynthesis and productivity over summer in warmed and control conditions. These results are important because they provide information on how soil water content may modulate the effects of climate warming on Sphagnum productivity in boreal peatlands. It further confirms the transitory nature of warming-induced photosynthesis benefits in boreal systems and highlights the vulnerability of the ecosystem to excess warming and drying. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; extreme events; net photosynthesis; phenotypic plasticity; soil water content; Sphagnum fallax; Sphagnum magellanicum; temperate and boreal ecosystem; trait plasticity","boreal forest; climate change; climate effect; community response; ecosystem response; extreme event; moss; peatland; phenotypic plasticity; photosynthesis; plant community; soil water; temperate environment; vulnerability; warming; water content; Sphagnum; Sphagnum fallax; Sphagnum magellanicum; rain; climate change; ecosystem; photosynthesis; soil; Sphagnopsida; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Photosynthesis; Rain; Soil; Sphagnopsida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072032201

This is generally accompanied by a reduction in traits attracting pollinators, including reduced emission of floral scent. In Capsella, emission of benzaldehyde as a main component of floral scent has been lost in selfing C. rubella by mutation of cinnamate-CoA ligase CNL1. However, the biochemical basis and evolutionary history of this loss remain unknown, as does the reason for the absence of benzaldehyde emission in the independently derived selfer Capsella orientalis. We used plant transformation, in vitro enzyme assays, population genetics and quantitative genetics to address these questions. CNL1 has been inactivated twice independently by point mutations in C. rubella, causing a loss of enzymatic activity. Both inactive haplotypes are found within and outside of Greece, the centre of origin of C. rubella, indicating that they arose before its geographical spread. By contrast, the loss of benzaldehyde emission in C. orientalis is not due to an inactivating mutation in CNL1. CNL1 represents a hotspot for mutations that eliminate benzaldehyde emission, potentially reflecting the limited pleiotropy and large effect of its inactivation. Nevertheless, even closely related species have followed different evolutionary routes in reducing floral scent. © 2019 The Authors.

Among various TMDs, the monolayer WSe2 has a direct bandgap of 1.65 eV and exhibits p-type or bipolar behavior, depending on the type of contact metal. Despite these promising properties, a lack of efficient large-area production methods for high-quality, uniform WSe2 hinders its practical device applications. Various methods have been investigated for the synthesis of large-area monolayer WSe2, but the difficulty of precisely controlling solid-state TMD precursors (WO3, MoO3, Se, and S powders) is a major obstacle to the synthesis of uniform TMD layers. In this work, we outline our success in growing large-area, high-quality, monolayered WSe2 by utilizing methane (CH4 ) gas with precisely controlled pressure as a promoter. When compared to the catalytic growth of monolayered WSe2 without a gas-phase promoter, the catalytic growth of the monolayered WSe2 with a CH4 promoter reduced the nucleation density to 1/1000 and increased the grain size of monolayer WSe2 up to 100 µm. The significant improvement in the optical properties of the resulting WSe2 indicates that CH4 is a suitable candidate as a promoter for the synthesis of TMD materials, because it allows accurate gas control. © 2019 by the authors.

The transportation sector produces 23% of world energy-related CO2 emissions with three quarters of the emissions coming from road transport, specifically passenger cars and light-duty trucks. The daily commute constitutes a significant portion of the traffic demand in cities, as people's use of private cars remains an integral part of daily life. Using theories of practice, this paper investigates the range of elements (meanings, competencies, and materials) that collectively shapes the practice of daily commuting. Adopting a qualitative approach, the research comprises 21 interviews with United Arab Emirates residents. Our findings reveal two major insights: (a) “meanings” play a more dominant role in shaping the practice of daily commuting; thus, competencies and materials are integrated in a way that addresses these meanings, and (b) practices are simultaneously interconnected with other practices and often compete for the finite resources of consumers.

Concentrations of bicarbonate and CO2 vary greatly with catchment geology. In this study, we investigate whether there is a link between these concentrations and the frequency of freshwater plants possessing the bicarbonate use trait. We show, globally, that the frequency of plant species with this trait increases with bicarbonate concentration. Regionally, however, the frequency of bicarbonate use is reduced at sites where the CO2 concentration is substantially above the air equilibrium, consistent with this trait being an adaptation to carbon limitation.

Three subnational levels can be considered for the implementation of jurisdictional REDD+ in Indonesia: Provincial, District and Village. REDD+ implementation should involve all levels of jurisdiction, however, the implementation at the village level will be better coordinated at the district level due to the size of areas and potential emissions reduced. In this paper, we estimate the potential contribution of sub-national jurisdictions to reducing deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions using a case study from Central Kalimantan. District governments can contribute to reducing emissions by stopping deforestation from oil palm concessions, which in the case study considered has the potential of reducing emissions by as much as 15% from the business as usual scenario. Provincial governments have the authority to reduce emissions from state forest areas. In Central Kalimantan, if no more deforestation occurs in production forests, the projected avoided emissions between 2013 and 2020 are about 21% from the business as usual scenario. © 2019","Conservation; Indonesia; Jurisdictional approach; REDD+","Conservation; Deforestation; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Palm oil; Rural areas; Avoided emissions; Business-as-usual; District government; Indonesia; Jurisdictional approach; National level; REDD; Reducing emissions; Gas emissions; Borneo; Commerce; Conservation; Deforestation; Governments; Greenhouse Gases; Indonesia; Oil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060480624

In order to explore the possible ways for the rehabilitation of the abandoned mine site as well as to suggest alternative waste management approaches, gold mine tailings of Lefke-Xeros area are incorporated in cement mortars in this paper. Experimental measures such as compressive strength, water penetration depth, porosity, resistance to freeze/thaw cycling and carbonation depth of cement mortars incorporating gold tailings, carried out over the period of 9 months, have shown to be improved significantly. The release of heavy metals of cement mixtures incorporating gold tailings were substantially lower than the limits of US Code of Regulations. Cost effectiveness analysis also validated the efficient use of gold tailings both as cement and sand replacement in these mortars. Particularly, it is shown in the paper that the use of 30% gold tailings as a binder replacement resulted in a 22% decrease in the CO2 emissions arises from cement manufacturing. It must be emphasized that the use of gold tailings does not only result in a considerable reduction in CO2 emissions originates from cement production but also plays a crucial role in sustaining a healthy ecosystem of the immediate environment after the closure of mine sites and helps maintaining the economic growth of the locality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cement; Cost efficiency; Gold mine tailings; Mechanical properties; Reusing; Socio-economic profit","Abandoned mines; Carbon dioxide; Cements; Compressive strength; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Gold mines; Health hazards; Heavy metals; Mechanical properties; Mortar; Solid wastes; Tailings; Waste management; Cost effectiveness analysis; Cost efficiency; Immediate environment; Mine tailings; Reusing; Socio-economic development; Socio-economics; Water penetration depths; Economic geology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073701379

This may lead to an increase in building energy consumption. With the changing climate, cities, communities, and university campuses need a more dynamic forecasting model to predict their future energy demands to mitigate risks. Although many building energy prediction models have been developed, only a few have focused on climate change and its impacts. This paper discusses the development of a regression-based forecasting model for a university campus energy use under changing climate. The forecasting model development follows a four-step process: (1) data frame setting, (2) descriptive statistics, (3) statistical regression modeling, and (4) validation and prediction. The independent numeric variables used as inputs are building characteristics (gross square feet, lighting power density, equipment power density; U factor of roof, wall, and windows; building age; years after building renovation; and window-to-wall ratio) and weather data (temperature and humidity). The outputs are electricity and chilled water for 2054. Prior to modeling, matrix plots and histograms are used to identify correlations between variables. This step is followed by normalization of independent variables to check their impact. Finally, multiple linear regression model for electricity and Lasso regression models for chilled water estimations are developed. For the purpose of predicting energy consumption owing to climate change, we used weather data that represents 2054. The equipment power density was the most important factor for electricity consumption and temperature was the most important one for chilled water consumption. The prediction models give an insight of which factors remain essential and applicable to campus building policy to prevent wasting energy in buildings, as a result of climate change. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Building Energy Use; Climate Change; Regression Analysis; Statistical Prediction; University Campus","Big data; Climate change; Cooling water; Data handling; Data visualization; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Global warming; Information analysis; Linear regression; Regression analysis; Visualization; Walls (structural partitions); Building characteristics; Building energy use; Electricity-consumption; Multiple linear regression models; Statistical prediction; Statistical regression model; Temperature and humidities; University campus; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077339344

Many mixed-lanthanide single phase white-light source materials have been produced so far by a careful trial and error combination of lanthanide ions during the synthetic procedure. In this work we propose a simple and efficient method for the direct preparation of the desired material with the optimal combination of metal ions, avoiding the trial and error multiple synthetic approach. In the proposed strategy, the emission profiles of the isostructural complexes of each lanthanide ion for a chosen excitation wavelength are compared relative to their ion density and the necessary final composition of the material is calculated in order to obtain the white-light CIE coordinates. Using this method, we prepared a white-light emitting material which is a metal-organic framework built from oxydiacetate ligand, lanthanide ions (Eu, Tb and Dy emitting red, green and blue respectively) and zinc (a closed shell metal ion that has proven to be ideal for optical applications). The compound [Dy1.60Eu0.38Tb0.02Zn3(oda)6(H2O)6]·12H2O was prepared and fully characterized by single crystal x-ray diffraction, its optical properties were also measured. The proposed rational mixing of lanthanide ions could be useful for the preparation of white-light source materials in analogous systems, provided the single-lanthanide compounds are isostructural along the series and no optical interaction is operative among ions. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Mixed-lanthanide compounds design; Oxydiacetate; White-light emitter","Crystalline materials; Light sources; Metal ions; Optical properties; Organometallics; Rare earth elements; Single crystals; Isostructural complexes; Metal organic framework; Mixed lanthanide; Oxydiacetate; Red , green and blues; Single crystal x-ray diffraction; Solid-state lighting technology; White light; Light emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072249129

MERRA-2 aerosol composition was evaluated using independent in-situ observations at the Cape Fuguei (CAFE) site. Results showed that MERRA-2 was able to distinguish the contribution of different species within complicated aerosol mixtures. Fifty transported high PM2.5 events were identified during the winters of 2005–2015. To investigate the transport characteristics associated with Asian continental outflow, these events were further classified into sulfate-dominated, dust-dominated and mixed-composition events. More than 80% of transported events were influenced by Asian dust and 20% of them were dust-dominated. Both sulfate-dominated and dust-dominated events showed similar average PM2.5 concentrations (~44 μg m−3), while dust-dominated events showed a higher average PM10 concentration (114 μg m−3) and thus a lower PM2.5/PM10 ratio (0.41) compared to sulfate-dominated events (94 μg m−3 and 0.46, respectively). Results indicated that the low-level trough at 700 hPa plays a critical role in determining the transport paths of dust aerosols and their impact on local air quality. Therefore, the influence of Asian dust over Northern Taiwan cannot be neglected during winter seasons, and could potentially offset the effectiveness of emission controls and pollutant reductions. Such potential impacts could occur over vast areas affected by Asian continental outflow.

Despite being ubiquitous in most carbonate rocks, their potential impact on structural diagenesis and fluid flow remains unclear. The Zechstein 2 Carbonate (Ca2) is a diagenetically complex reservoir in the Southern Permian Basin and represents one of the most prolific gas reservoirs in NW Germany. This investigation focuses on evaluating the relationship between stylolites, fractures/veins and their subsequent influence on the spatial variations in reservoir quality. We utilise drill core samples to carry out a combined analysis of cross-cutting relationships between different structures and diagenetic products. We therefore use a combination of petrography and statistical analyses on stylolite networks, focusing on their occurrence, morphology and sealing capacity. In the study area, the Ca2 carbonate mudstone was deposited in a slope environment and dolomitised under shallow burial conditions, followed by bedding-parallel stylolitisation during burial. Results indicate that calcium-rich fluids percolated from neighbouring evaporite units causing widespread calcitisation within the more distal environments of deposition. Some stylolites locally acted as barriers to affect the migration of the calcitising fluids, resulting in a macroscopic diagenetic stratification of relatively porous dolomite and areas of calcitised dolomite with lower porosity. However, pressure-solution continued during burial and bedding-parallel stylolites also appear postdating calcitisation. During inversion, horizontal stylolites were reopened to act as conduits to enable fluid migration that precipitated metal sulphides. This indicates that stylolites acted as both barriers and conduits for fluid flow depending on variations of the overburden pressure and regional stress regime. Stylolites present a range of sealing capacities between 63 and 89%, depending on their morphology, and can result in partial leakage and subsequent invasive calcitisation in their vicinity. This study highlights the importance of understanding the impact of stylolites on structural diagenesis and spatial variations in petrophysical rock properties that determine reservoir quality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Calcitisation; Carbonate reservoir quality; Dolomitisation; Stylolites; Zechstein Ca2","Carbonation; Core drilling; Morphology; Petroleum reservoirs; Sedimentary rocks; Sedimentology; Sulfur compounds; Textures; Calcitisation; Carbonate reservoir; Dolomitisation; Stylolites; Zechstein Ca2; Flow of fluids; burial diagenesis; carbonate rock; dolomitization; mudstone; physicochemical property; reservoir rock; spatial variation; stylolite; Zechstein; Germanic Basin; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067175352

However, they usually do not include crucial parameters for EBA in areas of shale gas development such as methane concentrations. A logistic regression (LR) model was developed to predict the probability of methane occurrence in aquifers in Alberta (Canada). The model was calibrated and tested using geochemistry data including methane concentrations from two groundwater monitoring programs. The LR model correctly predicts methane occurrence in 89.8% (n = 234 samples) and 88.1% (n = 532 samples) of groundwater samples from each monitoring program. Methane concentrations strongly depend on the occurrence of electron donors such as sulfate and to a lesser extent on well depth and the total dissolved solids of groundwater. The model was then applied to a province-wide public health groundwater monitoring program (n = 52,849 samples) providing aqueous geochemistry data but no methane concentrations. This approach allowed the prediction of methane occurrence in regions where no groundwater gas data are available, thereby increasing the resolution of EBA in areas of shale gas development by using basic hydrochemical parameters measured in high-density groundwater monitoring programs.

The isolated canyon of L/H = 10 and W/H = 2 with trees are simulated considering the center tree-planting (CTP) and double rows tree-planting (DRTP) patterns as well as eight trunk heights under perpendicular approaching wind. The results reveal that tree-planting pattern and especially the trunk height affect significantly the flow and pollutant distributions. For each tree-planting pattern, the biggest characteristic of flow structure is, a strong stream of air passes through the canyon, resulting in the disappearance of canyon vortex and corner eddies at the canyon ends when h ≥ H. When compared to treeless case: trees lead to reduced ACH (air exchange rate) ranging from H/3 to 8H/9 and enhanced ACH at h = H and 10H/9; averaged/maximum concentration increases on wall A and slight decreases on wall B are found at h ranging from H/3 to 7H/9, while concentration dramatic decreases on wall A and significant increases on wall B are observed at h = H and 10H/9. Compared to the CTP counterpart, the DRTP present the similar flow structures, ACH and concentration distributions, which indicates that when the total volume and trunk height of trees are the same, the tree-planting patterns have little impacts on the flow structure and concentration distribution.

In this work, we design a simple computing library to bridge the gap and decouple the work of ocean modeling from parallel computing. This library provides 12 basic operators that feature user-friendly interfaces, effective programming, and implicit parallelism. Several state-of-the-art computing techniques, including computing graph and just-in-time compiling, are employed to parallelize the seemingly serial code and speed up the ocean models. These operator interfaces are designed using native Fortran programming language to smooth the learning curve. We further implement a highly readable and efficient ocean model that contains only 1860 lines of code but achieves a 91 % parallel efficiency in strong scaling and 99 % parallel efficiency in weak scaling with 4096 Intel CPU cores. This ocean model also exhibits excellent scalability on the heterogeneous Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer.

The aggregate multimedia human exposure included the accidental ingestion and dermal adsorption of soil and surface water, as well as the intake of grains, fruits, vegetables, meats and eggs, milk and dairy products, and freshwater fish. The values and variabilities of atmospheric deposition and exposure factors were identified as two major uncertainty sources. The annual variations in wet and bulk deposition were propagated from the variabilities of particulate matter (PM) × precipitation and the linear regressed coefficients of flux~PM × precipitation, and the annual variation in dry deposition was propagated by subtracting the wet deposition from the bulk deposition. The variabilities in the exposure factors were updated based on the latest published regional data. Long-term atmospheric deposition was identified as a vital source of Cd contamination in surface soil and freshwater bodies and As accumulation in freshwater fish. The noncarcinogenic (NC) risk probabilities caused by Cd were the highest, followed by As. The overall uncertainties related to the NC risk probabilities were much lower for both adults and 6- to 17-year-old children/adolescents, while those related to the carcinogenic risk (CR) probabilities were much lower for 2- to 5-year-old children and 6- to 17-year-old children/adolescents.

Despite recent advances in constructing nanostructured/composite-Si anodes with an alleviated volume change and improved cycle life, daunting challenges still remain for Si anodes to suppress the irreversible capacity loss associated with the repeated rupture/reconstruction of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Herein, an electrolyte-based optimization strategy is devised to in situ construct a thin, continuous, and mechanically stable SEI film on Si surface by using a trifluoropropylene carbonate (TFPC) cosolvent, targeting highly stable Si-based anodes for LIBs. TFPC is featured with its low unoccupied molecular orbital energy, high reduction potential and outstanding film-forming capability, outperforming those of the state-of-the-art fluoroethylene carbonate additive. More importantly, TFPC plays a key role in regulating the structure and component of SEI layer. As such, 10 wt% TFPC addition promotes the formation of an optimal SEI film with appropriate amounts of polyolefins and LiF, endowing the SEI layer with enhanced rigidity and toughness as well as high ionic conductivity. Both the Si nanoparticle-based and Si/C composite electrodes deliver a greatly enhanced cycling stability, rate capability, and overall structural integrity in such optimized electrolyte. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Important breeding targets for wheat improvement in the southern Great Plains of the United States, including grain yield, kernel weight, wheat protein content, and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sedimentation volume as a rapid test for predicting bread-making quality, were used to estimate the effectiveness of GS across harvest years from 2014 (drought) to 2016 (normal). In general, nonparametric algorithms reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and random forest (RF) produced higher accuracies in both same-year cross-validations (CVs) and cross-year predictions for the purpose of line selection. Further, the stability of GS performance was greatest for SDS sedimentation volume but least for wheat protein content. To ensure long-term genetic gain, our study on selection response suggested that across this sample of environmental variability, and though there are cases where phenotypic selection (PS) might be still preferred, training conducted under drought or in suboptimal conditions could provide an encouraging prediction outcome when selection decisions were made in normal conditions. However, it is not advisable to use training information collected from a normal season to predict trait performance under drought conditions. Finally, the superiority of response to selection was most evident if the training population (TP) can be optimized. © 2019 The Author(s).",,"genetic selection; genetics; genomics; plant breeding; plant genome; season; wheat; Genome, Plant; Genomics; Plant Breeding; Seasons; Selection, Genetic; Triticum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075555278

China's government has given attention to cooling energy conservation. However, a nationwide fundamental building energy database, identification of the key features of cooling energy intensity in urban families, or a review or discussion of current technologies and cooling policies are still lacking. This study collected data on cooling in urban residential buildings and established an engineering-based bottom-up model of cooling energy consumption in urban residential China. From data analysis and discussion, the following conclusions are obtained. Total urban residential cooling energy consumption of electricity was around 85 billion kWh in 2015, having increased by more than ten times over the last two decades. Single-split AC is the primary AC type and the most commonly used cooling equipment. Cooling behavior distribution also varies significantly with region and cooling type. Cooling behavior diversity also causes a huge difference in cooling operation hours and energy intensity.

This study proposes a new paradigm for enhancing energy efficiency in buildings by designing adaptive building envelope that embraces dynamic response to the fluctuating climatic condition. Adaptive envelope is designed by integrating building roof with thermochromic (TC) coating (namely TC roof) and placing phase change material (PCM) in the wall (namely PCM wall), which could intelligently manage both solar energy and thermal energy in the buildings. EnergyPlus simulation is implemented to unveil the potential energy savings of using adaptive envelope for the building under five distinctive climatic conditions. The simulation results show that in comparison to traditional envelope, the use of TC roof saves total energy consumption up to 13% and reduces CO2 emission by 4%; TC roof-PCM wall gives rise to total energy saving of up to 19% and reduction in CO2 emission by up to 5%, especially for the building in warm region.

In addition, LCZ has provided a new insight into the studies on urban thermal environment. This study selected Nanjing, China, as the study area and utilized a combined method that comprised remote sensing based and geographic information system based methods based on random forest classifier for LCZ classification. Overall accuracy reached 92%, and kappa coefficient was 0.911. In addition, the seasonal and diurnal differences of land surface temperature (LST) were analyzed via LST retrieval from Landsat data and computational fluid dynamics model simulation, respectively. Results confirmed the warmest and coldest zones in four seasons. The LST distribution characteristics of land cover and built types were basically the same during the four seasons. Moreover, the UHII difference of an LCZ class in various seasons and the UHII difference of a season in various LCZs were investigated. The daily LSTs of the simulated LCZs (1 to 6) within 24 h showed the same variation law but different variation extents in a day. The LST variations of built types were related to building elements, such as building height, building density, building layout, and green ratio. This study identified an existing relation between LST and LCZ and analyzed LST on the basis of LCZs from seasonal and diurnal scales, which provides guidance for future researchers. © 2008-2012 IEEE.","Land surface temperature (LST); local climate zone (LCZ); random forest; spatial and temporal variations; urban heat island (UHI)","Atmospheric temperature; Classification (of information); Computational fluid dynamics; Decision trees; Landforms; Morphology; Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; Distribution characteristics; Local climate; Random forest classifier; Random forests; Spatial and temporal variation; Urban heat island; Urban thermal environment; Land surface temperature; accuracy assessment; heat island; image classification; Landsat; research work; seasonal variation; temporal variation; urban morphology; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078326806

In the present study, a mixture of all three was used to test whether they could further improve soil OC content and the soil’s ability to retain and fix carbon. Materials and methods: A laboratory incubation study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of using microalgae, biochar, OM, or their mixture, as a soil amendment to improve OC in soil extract. Metabolic processes and soil microbial community structuring were analyzed to explore the mechanism by which the mixture increased the capacity of soil to act as a carbon sink. Results and discussion: OC increased markedly (2.9 times its initial level) following the amendment of the soil with a treatment comprising microalgae, biochar, and the highest dose of OM. Microalgal metabolites were utilized by soil microorganisms as a carbon source. Biochar reduced the concentration of extracellular polysaccharides, whereas OM increased extracellular protein concentration. These metabolites affected the relative proportions of different groups of soil microorganisms, thereby increasing the proportion of Rhodobacter and Runella, which exerted a positive synergistic effect on soil OC and increased the soil’s capacity to fix carbon. Conclusions: A mixture including microalga, biochar, and OM as a soil amendment improved the OC of soil extract, and its effect was greater than that of any of its components alone. The findings of this study can help in devising ways to increase the OC content and the CO2-fixing capacity of the soil. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CO2 fixation; Microalgal metabolite; Soil amendment; Soil microorganisms; Synergistic effects","bacterium; biochar; carbon fixation; carbon sink; community structure; manure; metabolite; microalga; microbial community; organic matter; soil amendment; soil carbon; soil microorganism; Rhodobacter; Runella",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066134078

The effects have been followed by electronic absorption, its second derivative spectra, and resonance Raman spectroscopies. Upon addition of the additives, a final form is reached after about 24 h. It is characterized by a 4 nm red-shifted Soret band compared to that typical of the oxy species (418 nm) but with similar Q bands. Resonance Raman experiments carried out in 16O2 and 18O2 allowed us to identify the presence of the native oxy form coexisting with a second oxygen bound species, characterized by a ν(Fe[sbnd]O2) stretching frequency upshifted 7 cm−1 compared to the native oxy form and with a greater (33 cm−1) isotopic shift in 18O2. These data suggest the presence of a highly bent ligand conformation. The new species induced by the addition of the additives imparts a red colour to the tuna fish meat, a characteristic that is of some concern. In fact, the presence of the new red form can mask the aging of the product that, consequently, might contain histamine. Furthermore, the electronic absorption spectrum is very similar to that of the tuna fish myoglobin carbon monoxide complex, which has important regulatory consequences. Carbon monoxide treatment of tuna is banned in the EU for masking the effects of aging on the appearance of meats. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Additives; Conformational changes; Horse heart myoglobin; Resonance Raman; Tuna myoglobin","ascorbic acid; histamine; myoglobin; oxygen; oxygen 18; ascorbic acid; food preservative; absorption; absorption spectroscopy; Article; conformation; controlled study; fish meat; new species; photolysis; Raman spectrometry; reaction time; shelf life; tuna; animal; fish product; food analysis; food preservation; human; Animals; Ascorbic Acid; Fish Products; Food Analysis; Food Preservation; Food Preservatives; Humans; Tuna",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071539887

While NTRC is an important regulator of photosynthetic processes in leaves, its function in heterotrophic tissues remains unclear. Here, we focus on the role of NTRC in developing tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruits representing heterotrophic storage organs important for agriculture and human diet. We used a fruit-specific promoter to decrease NTRC expression by RNA interference in developing tomato fruits by 60% to 80% compared to the wild type. This led to a decrease in fruit growth, resulting in smaller and lighter fully ripe fruits containing less dry matter and more water. In immature fruits, NTRC downregulation decreased transient starch accumulation, which led to a subsequent decrease in soluble sugars in ripe fruits. The inhibition of starch synthesis was associated with a decrease in the redox-activation state of ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase and soluble starch synthase, which catalyze the first committed and final polymerizing steps, respectively, of starch biosynthesis. This was accompanied by a decrease in the level of ADP-Glc. NTRC downregulation also led to a strong increase in the reductive states of NAD(H) and NADP(H) redox systems. Metabolite profiling of NTRC-RNA interference lines revealed increased organic and amino acid levels, but reduced sugar levels, implying that NTRC regulates the osmotic balance of developing fruits. These results indicate that NTRC acts as a central hub in regulating carbon metabolism and redox balance in heterotrophic tomato fruits, affecting fruit development as well as final fruit size and quality. © 2019 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"plant protein; starch; thioredoxin reductase; carbohydrate metabolism; enzymology; fruit; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; metabolomics; oxidation reduction reaction; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; RNA interference; tomato; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Fruit; Lycopersicon esculentum; Metabolomics; Oxidation-Reduction; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; RNA Interference; Starch; Thioredoxin-Disulfide Reductase",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074553635

Due to the differences in size and development level among counties of China, the applicability and fairness of county-level low-carbon standards are very important in this country. This study analyzed the trends of county-level carbon emissions in China, defined the peak value of carbon emissions per capita, summarized the characteristics of existing low-carbon standards, and proposed a fair county-level low-carbon standard based on carbon emissions per capita. The results of our analysis suggest that, under the constraints of carbon emissions reduction policies, China’s carbon emissions per capita will tend towards a stable range. Additionally, by referring to predictions results of the peak value of China’s carbon emissions per capita, it was determined that, in low-carbon development targets, China’s county-level carbon emissions per capita should be set within the range of 2–4 tons. Besides setting low-carbon standards, the Chinese government and private enterprises should develop low-carbon technologies as soon as possible and innovate management models to achieve the win–win situation of simultaneous economic growth and carbon emissions reduction. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","carbon emissions controlling; carbon emissions per capita; County-level carbon emissions; low-carbon development; low-carbon standards","carbon emission; climate change; development level; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073620061

In this paper, we characterize the vertical structure of air pollutants based on ground-based Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements in the wintertime in Hefei, East China. Both NO2 and aerosol show exponentially decreasing profile with high concentrations concentrated close to the surface, suggesting the major emissions are at ground level. SO2 profiles extend to slightly higher altitudes than NO2, which might be due to the SO2 emissions from elevated point sources (e.g., power plants). Elevated HCHO was observed in the middle layer during noon time, probably indicating that the larger effect of the photochemical formation of atmospheric HCHO rather than direct HCHO emissions. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) models were used to evaluate the potential sources of Hefei's air pollution in the lower, middle and upper boundary layer. The results revealed that the major regional source of NO2 and aerosol were located in the northern and eastern part of Anhui and the transport mainly occured in the lower layer. Transported SO2 from the northwestern regions in the middle layer made great contribution to SO2 in Hefei. HCHO was mostly produced locally while the transport of HCHO from potential source areas was negligible. To further explore the potential source contributions affecting haze pollution, PSCF and CWT analysis for heavy haze episodes suggested that the potential source areas for aerosol were almost located in the northern region, the northwestern region, and the YRD region. Our findings provide a more comprehensive understanding for regional transport through the study on potential sources at different altitudes, which are useful for designing collaborative air pollution control strategies on a regional scale. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosol; HCHO; MAX-DOAS instrument; NO2; Regional transport; SO2; Vertical distribution","Absorption spectroscopy; Aerosols; Air pollution control; Altitude control; Atmospheric movements; Boundary layers; Light absorption; Nitrogen oxides; Photochemical forming; Differential optical absorption spectroscopy; HCHO; MAX-DOAS; Pollution episodes; Potential source contribution function; Regional transport; Vertical distributions; Vertical structures; Air pollution; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; atomic absorption spectroscopy; formaldehyde; haze; nitrogen dioxide; pollutant source; sulfur dioxide; vertical distribution; Anhui; China; Hefei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067445619

Therefore, better understanding of the temporal dynamics of UHI is required for sustainable urban planning to mitigate air pollution under a changing climate. Here, we present the evolution of UHI intensity (UHIi) and its controlling factors in the Seoul metropolitan area, Korea, over the last 56 years (1962–2017), which has experienced unique compressed economic growth and urban transformation under monsoon climate. The analysis demonstrated an inverted U-shape long-term variation of UHIi with the progress of urban transformation and economic climate which has not been reported in Asian cities before. Meanwhile, short-term variations in UHIi are related to both diurnal temperature range and duration after rainfall event unlike previous studies, and the UHIi was exacerbated by heat waves. Our findings suggest that the UHIi will exhibit different temporal dynamics with future changes in the monsoon climate, and heat waves in the urban area will be reinforced if current rapid urbanization continues without a shift toward sustainable and equitable development. Asian cities that are likely to face the similar urbanization trajectory and the implications are that urban (re)development strategy considers changes in rainfall magnitude and timing due to monsoon system variation under changing climate and plans to mitigate synergy between heat wave and UHI in this area. © 2019","Economic condition; Heat wave; Seoul; Urban heat island; Urban sprawl","Air pollution; Atmospheric temperature; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate change; Dynamics; Economic and social effects; Economics; Rain; Thermal pollution; Economic condition; Heat waves; Seoul; Urban heat island; Urban sprawl; Urban growth; rain; climate change; development strategy; heat island; heat wave; socioeconomic conditions; urban development; urban planning; urban sprawl; air temperature; Article; climate change; economic development; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; environmental temperature; greenhouse effect; heat; heat acclimatization; humidity; island (geological); Korea; seasonal rain forest; socioeconomics; temperature sensitivity; temporal analysis; trend study; urban area; urbanization; wind speed; air pollution; city planning; climate; economic development; heat; South Korea; urbanization; Seoul [Seoul (ADS)]; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea; Air Pollution; City Planning; Climate; Climate Change; Economic Development; Hot Temperature; Rain; Republic of Korea; Seoul; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069915779

So far, urban governance is not delivering: novel governance approaches are emerging in cities worldwide, yet are unable to transform conventional policymaking and planning to allow for innovative, co-beneficial and long-term solutions and actions to emerge and institutionalise. We present a capacities framework for urban transformations governance, starting from the need to fulfil distinct output functions (‘what needs to happen’) for mobilising and influencing urban transformation dynamics. The framework helps to diagnose and inform urban governance for responding to disturbances (stewarding capacity), phasing-out drivers of path-dependency (unlocking capacity), creating and embedding novelties (transformative capacity) and coordinating multi-actor processes (orchestrating capacity). Our case study of climate governance in New York City exemplifies the framework's applicability and explanatory power to identify conditions and activities facilitating transformation (governance), and to reveal gaps and barriers of these vis-à-vis the existing governance regime. Our framework thereby functions as a tool to explore what new forms of urban transformation governance are emerging, how effective these are, and how to strengthen capacities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agency; Capacity; Cities; Climate change; Transformations; Urban; Urban governance","climate change; governance approach; policy making; sustainability; urban development; urban planning; urban policy; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067196832

Due to their high surface area, large 12-ring pore channels and highly active tetrahedral isolated Ti-sites, Ti-Beta zeolites are well-known catalysts for applications in the field of oxidizing alkanes, alkenes, as well as for CO2 reduction. The drawback of many state-of-the-art synthesis methods is the limitation of the maximum amount of active sites and the control of material properties like hydrophilicity and Ti loading of the zeolite. This paper reports on the impact of the synthesis method and the variation of synthesis parameters on the material properties of the Ti-Beta heterogeneous catalyst. By using characterization techniques such as XRD, FTIR, UV-DR, Ar-sorption, H2O-sorption, ICP-MS and Raman spectroscopy, the control on important material properties of the Ti-Beta zeolite are investigated. A reproducible two-step post-synthesis method has been optimized in order to prepare high loading Ti(IV)-containing Beta zeolites, of which the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity is tunable. The optimized method allows to synthesize Ti-Beta zeolites with a very high Ti loading up to 7.4 wt% Ti with the majority in the form of isolated tetrahedrally coordinated Ti(IV) in the zeolite framework, which is a three times higher Ti loading than Ti-Beta materials synthesized by conventional hydrothermal synthesis. This high Ti loading together with the tuning of the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity is expected to have a positive effect on the catalytic performance of Ti-Beta zeolites. © 2019","High Ti loading; Ti-Beta zeolites; Tunable hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity; Two-step post-synthesis method","Catalysts; Coordination reactions; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Hydrocarbons; Hydrophilicity; Hydrophobicity; Hydrothermal synthesis; Titanium compounds; Zeolites; Beta zeolite; Catalytic performance; Characterization techniques; Heterogeneous catalyst; Hydrophobic/hydrophilic; Postsynthesis; Synthesis parameters; Tunable hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity; Loading",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068560353

Decarbonisation of transport and heat supply to buildings is recognised as a fundamental step in achieving this target. With cities being the largest producers of GHG emissions they provide the biggest opportunity for climate change mitigation. Two contrasting visions of a 2050 target-compliant scenario are evaluated against each other. One is based on a high penetration of nuclear power and renewables the other based on predominantly gas with carbon capture storage (CCS). An impact assessment is carried out on both scenarios to understand how each scenario might perform over 4 evaluation criteria. The evaluation criteria provide insight into each scenario regarding; guaranteeing security of supply, scenario cost, sustainability and how feasible it is to deploy the chosen technologies. Whilst both scenarios raise discussion points on the feasibility of deploying certain technologies the more favourable scenario, in terms of the study results, is the nuclear and renewables option. The renewable energy generating technologies included as part of the study – from largest to smallest in terms of capacity – are wind, solar photovoltaic, tidal and river hydro.

However, reduction of energy demand does not necessarily translate into similar changes in peak power demand. Four different types of apartment buildings, representing the Finnish apartment building stock, were examined after optimal energy retrofits to see the influence of retrofitting on hourly power demand. Switching from district heating to ground-source heat pumps reduced emissions significantly under current energy mix. However, the use of ground-source heat pumps increased hourly peak electricity demand by 46–153%, compared to district heated apartment buildings. The corresponding increase in electrical energy demand was 30–108% in the peak month of January. This could increase the use of high emission peak power plants and negate some of the emission benefits. Solar thermal collectors and heat recovery systems could reduce purchased heating energy to zero in summer. Solar electricity could reduce median power demand in summer, but had only a little effect on peak power demand.

This study examines the cost-effective energy retrofit measures in Finnish detached houses. The Finnish detached house building stock was divided into four age classes according to the building code in effect at the time of their construction. Multi-objective optimization with a genetic algorithm was used to minimize the life cycle cost and CO2 emissions in each building type for five different main heating systems (district heating, wood/oil boiler, direct electric heating, and ground-source heat pump) by improving the building envelope and systems. Cost-effective emission reductions were possible with all heating systems, but especially with ground-source heat pumps. Replacing oil boilers with ground-source heat pumps (GSHPs), emissions could be reduced by 79% to 92% across all the studied detached houses and investment levels. With all the other heating systems, emission reductions of 20% to 75% were possible. The most cost-effective individual renovation measures were the installation of air-to-air heat pumps for auxiliary heating and improving the thermal insulation of external walls. © 2019 by the authors.","Deep renovation; Detached house; Energy retrofit; Genetic algorithm; Greenhouse gas emissions; Heat pump; Multi-objective optimization","Boilers; Building codes; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Electric heating; Emission control; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Houses; Investments; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Pumps; Retrofitting; Thermal insulation; Building envelopes; Carbon emission reductions; Deep renovation; Detached house; Emission reduction; Energy retrofit; Ground source heat pump (GSHPs); Heat pumps; Geothermal heat pumps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076020206

Tidal wetland soils contain relatively high quantities of soil organic carbon (SOC); yet there is little information about whether this SOC can be predicted based on easily identifiable environmental factors. We investigated how tidal wetland SOC density was distributed across the continental United States among various coastal locations, estuarine typologies, vegetation types, water regimes, and management regimes and found that knowledge of a wetland's coastal affiliation provided the most differentiation (whether on the East Coast, West Coast, or Gulf Coast). We then sought to identify whether SOC density was correlated with 47 different environmental variables and found that knowledge based on latitude and precipitation explained ~46% of the variance in SOC density for wetlands on the West Coast and Gulf Coast, respectively. Several other geographic, oceanic, terrestrial, and atmospheric factors were cross-correlated along these axes, including oceanic salinity, temperature, and average catchment elevation. For the U.S. East Coast, SOC density was not simple to explain and was likely dependent on a wide range of interacting and complex factors.

While the election of Donald Trump and his climate and energy policy led to a narrative shift in the coal industry, the oil and gas industry remained conspicuously silent in its immediate response and maintained its narrative strategies despite its alignment with the Paris Agreement. © 2019 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"energy policy; environmental policy; fossil fuel; gas industry; governance approach; industrial emission; international agreement; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075370587

National and local authorities lack sufficient knowledge, capacity and plans on how to preserve urban green spaces and benefit from their ecosystem services, with such gaps being particularly pronounced in the smaller secondary cities. This study focuses in such as secondary city, Pyin Oo Lwin, and analyzes land use and land cover (LULC) change, tree diversity and carbon stored in aboveground and belowground biomass, and soil. We focus on the main green spaces of the city, which contain different configurations of urban forest, grassland and agricultural land. Remote sensing analysis tracked LULC change between 1988 and 2018, and showed the extensive increase of built-up area, and the decline of urban forests and urban farms. Even though a substantial amount of green spaces has been converted to built-up land, the remaining urban green spaces are still serving as an important habitat for many different tree species, with a total of 82 species from 35 families observed in the different green spaces. Furthermore, these green spaces contain significant carbon stocks, which are, however, highly variable: botanical garden (383.67 t/ha), coffee farms (355.64 t/ha), monasteries (277.14 t/ha), golf course (208.45 t/ha), and seasonal farms (123.22 t/ha). Nevertheless, the extensive LULC change has reduced carbon stocks from 2.41 Mt (1988) to 1.65 Mt (2018). The findings of this study provide a better understanding of LULC change in secondary cities of Myanmar, and build an evidence base on how urban green spaces preservation and green infrastructure development can contribute to green economic transitions, and sustainable, resilient, and low-carbon cities in the country. © 2019 Helen et al.

Cities will face a transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources, with electricity acting as a cross-sectorial energy carrier. Consequently, the electricity demand of cities is expected to rise, in a situation that will be exacerbated by ongoing urbanisation and city growth. As alternative to an expansion of the connection capacity to the national grid, local measures can be considered within city planning in order to utilize decentralised electricity generation, synergies between the heating and electricity sectors, and flexibility through energy storage technologies. This work proposes an optimisation model that interconnects the electricity, heat, and transport sectors in cities. We analyse the investments in and operation of an urban energy system, using the City of Gothenburg as an example. We find that the availability of electricity from local solar PV together with thermal storage technologies increase the value of using power-to-heat technologies, such as heat pumps. High biomass prices together with strict climate targets enhance the importance of electricity in the district heating sector. A detailed understanding of the integration of local low-carbon energy technologies can give urban planners and other city stakeholders the opportunity to take an active role in the city’s energy transition. © 2019, Aalborg University press.

In order to understand the acclimatization and explore the adaptive mechanism of typical desert plant Nitraria tangutorum Bobrov to rain addition, gas exchange parameters and photosynthetic physiology characteristics of N. tangutorum at the eastern edge of the Ulanbuh Desert on the Northwest of China under five rain addition treatments (increased 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of local mean annual precipitation, respectively) were measured. The results show that photosynthetic capacity enhanced after rain addition. The impact extent of precipitation on photosynthesis was related to rain addition amount which was not less than 75% (110 mm) rain addition played significantly accelerated effects on photosynthesis and transpiration. The supplement watered plants carbon and water exchange were affected significantly which indicated that there was a process for N. tangutorum to adapt to the increased precipitation. The apparent quantum efficiency (AQY), light saturation point (LSP), initial carboxylation efficiency (CE) and CO2 saturation point (CSP) increased, indicating an enhanced activity of carboxyl enzyme and increased the capacity of N. tangutorum to use light and carbon dioxide.

More and more data center operators are seeking to reduce carbon footprint via various types of renewable energy. However, the intermittent availability of renewable energy sources makes it quite challenging to cooperate with dynamically arriving workload. Meanwhile, the different natures (eg, price and carbon emission) of multiple energy sources also bring more challenges to achieve an optimal trade-off among carbon emission, power cost, and service level agreement (SLA). In this paper, we study the problem of reducing the long-term energy cost for geo-distributed cloud centers, where multiple sources of renewable energy are considered and SLA requirement and carbon budget are satisfied. To tackle the randomness of workload arrival, varying electricity price, and intermittent supply of renewable energy, we first formulate the cost minimization problem as a constraint stochastic optimization problem. Second, based on Lyapunov optimization technique, we propose an online control algorithm to solve it and provide the rigorous theory analysis to demonstrate its performance. By converting the long-term optimization problem to a mixed integer linear programming problem in each time slot, we analyze its inherent structure and propose an efficient algorithm to solve it based on Brenner's method. Our proposed algorithm makes online decisions rely only on the current system state and achieve [O(1/V),O(V)] cost emission trade-off. Finally, the effectiveness of our algorithm is evaluated by extensive simulations based on real-world data traces. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","geo-distributed cloud center; green-aware; Lyapunov optimization; renewable energy","Budget control; Carbon footprint; Constrained optimization; Costs; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Integer programming; Renewable energy resources; Distributed clouds; green-aware; Mixed integer linear programming problems; Optimization techniques; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Service Level Agreements; Stochastic optimization problems; Green computing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055700182

In this study, a set of numerical simulations are conducted along two turbocharger compressor speed lines of 150,000 rpm and 80,000 rpm to analyse and validate the results against experimental data. The domain includes the full compressor stage comprising intake, impeller as a Multiple Reference Frame, diffuser and outlet. The k-omega SST turbulence model with three different mesh sizes is used tosolve the compressible flow using ANSYS Fluent software. Three points on each speed-line are selected:one point each in regions close to surge and choke and a point in the stable zone of the compressor map. The simulations predict compressor performance in terms of the total-to-total pressure ratioand total-to-total efficiency. Results reveal the predicted pressure ratio error is in the range of 1-6%. At 150,000 rpm the pressure ratio is underpredicted for the point close to the surgebut overpredicted for the point close to the choke. However, the pressure ratio results are within 1% difference for 80,000 rpm. In all cases, the predicted efficiency increased when a finer mesh is used.While results are close to the experimental data in both the surge and stable areas of the map, the efficiency wasoverpredicted up to 20% in the region close to the choke. In conclusion, the finer mesh leads to higher pressure ratio and efficiency values that overpredict the performance, especially for the pointclose to choke. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2019.","CFD; Compressor performance; K-ω SST turbulence model; Turbocharger compressor","Automotive industry; Computational fluid dynamics; Efficiency; Emission control; Mesh generation; Momentum transfer; Turbomachinery; Turbulence models; Compressor maps; Compressor performance; Compressor stage; FLUENT software; Multiple-reference frames; SST turbulence models; Total efficiency; Turbocharger compressor; Compressors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075538395

By performing comparative analysis, this study attempts to address the problem of assessing the role of participants’ motivation. The study uses a rich administrative data obtained from the IPS system to develop a propensity score matching (PSM) approach where the treatment groups consist of only those who completed the programs, and the comparison groups consist of drug-addicted prisoners who have not taken part in any drug rehabilitation program. After matching, prisoners in the treatment and comparison groups are found to be similar on all known characteristics. Findings show that the only rehabilitation program that promised significant and positive outcomes for its completers was the more comprehensive one operating at Hermon Prison. Prisoners who completed the treatment were incarcerated and arrested less than their comparison group. The “golden strategy” for rehabilitating drug-using prisoners, then, will be twofold. The program should be based on the promising components of rehabilitation, that is, cognitive behavioral therapy, therapeutic community, long duration, intensity, and positive social climate. The program should also succeed in retaining its participants through completion. © The Author(s) 2019.","completers; drug rehabilitation programs; Israeli Prison Service; propensity score matching; recidivism","adult; cognitive behavioral therapy; comparative study; drug dependence; drug dependence treatment; human; Israel; motivation; patient compliance; prevention and control; prisoner; program evaluation; propensity score; recidivism; therapeutic community; treatment duration; treatment outcome; Adult; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Duration of Therapy; Humans; Israel; Motivation; Prisoners; Program Evaluation; Propensity Score; Recidivism; Substance Abuse Treatment Centers; Substance-Related Disorders; Therapeutic Community; Treatment Adherence and Compliance; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072108928

Tight reservoirs are characterized with low permeability which reduces the hydrocarbon flow into the wellbore. Water blockage is considered one of the main damaging mechanisms in tight reservoirs due to the increase of water saturation around the wellbore region and eventually decrease in the relative permeability of hydrocarbons. Acid fracturing or hydraulic fracturing are required to remove the damage and enhance the formation conductivity. This paper presents a new technique to remove the water blockage from tight formations and improve the formation productivity using thermochemical treatment. Chemicals that generate pressure and heat at reservoir conditions are used to remove the water bank from tight core samples to enhance the flow conditions. Coreflooding experiments, capillary pressure, and NMR measurements were conducted as well as routine core analysis. The impact of thermochemical treatment on improving the formation productivity was quantified. The productivity index for core samples were determined before and after the thermochemical flooding. The effect of thermochemical injection on reducing the capillary forces was analyzed by measuring the capillary pressure before and after the chemical treatment. The alteration in pore geometry due to the thermochemical flooding was evaluated using NMR measurements. The results of this study show that water blockage is a potential damage in tight gas reservoirs. Injecting thermochemical fluids into tight samples reduced the capillary forces and removed the water banking. Flooding tight core samples with thermochemical resulted in generating tiny fractures in the treated samples, which reduces the capillary forces by 55.6% after the chemical treatment. The in-situ generated heat and nitrogen gas during thermochemical treatment can result in removing the water blockage from tight formations utilizing the desiccation effect. Also, thermochemical treatment showed a significant improvement in the core conductivity. The productivity index of core samples increased by 94.3% due to the chemical flooding. This study introduces a new chemical treatment for removing the water blockage from tight formations using environmentally friendly fluids. Thermochemical treatment improved the productivity index by a factor of 1.94 and decreased the drawdown pressure by more than 80%. Consequently, the trapped water was removed, and the total hydrocarbon production significantly improved. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Capillary forces; Micro fractures; Thermochemical fluids; Tight sandstone; Water blockage","Boreholes; Capillarity; Capillary tubes; Chemical analysis; Core samples; Floods; Fracture; Hydrocarbons; Low permeability reservoirs; Oil field equipment; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Productivity; Sandstone; Tight gas; Water levels; Capillary force; Hydrocarbon production; Micro-fracture; Relative permeability; Routine core analysis; Thermochemical treatments; Tight gas reservoirs; Tight sandstones; Water treatment; capillarity; capillary pressure; fluid injection; gas production; hydraulic fracturing; hydrocarbon reservoir; permeability; sandstone; thermochemistry; thermomechanics; water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069726936

However, the process of this replacement is affected by many factors and the ambiguity involved makes it difficult to make decisions for a systematic transition. Battery Electric Vehicles. Presenting genuine metrics and introducing and focusing on effective factors, this paper presents a model and framework to facilitate the selection of electric vehicles as the alternatives for fossil-fuel vehicles. Extensive research on the specifications of vehicles and the statistics and figures related to the economic aspects of vehicles, including the fuel and charge costs and technical aspect such as the fuel and charge consumption are presented in variety of tables. At the end, tangible examples are provided to illustrate the practical aspects of the proposed framework. Moreover, to reduce air pollution, fossil-powered generator could be replaced by solar generators. Moreover, due to the specific climate conditions of Malaysia that is located near the equator, the solar solutions ate on the desk. © 2019 IEEE.","Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs); Electronic Vehicles; Fossil-Fuel Vehicles; Green House Emissions; Internal Combustion Engine Vehicles (ICEVs); Sustainable Urban Development","Battery electric vehicles; Planning; Solar power generation; Urban growth; Climate condition; Economic aspects; Electronic vehicles; Fuel vehicles; Solar generator; Sustainable urban development; Technical aspects; Urban areas; Fossil fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094674166

This separation of the two phenomena has long been deemed as a way of garnering heightened policy attention for ocean acidification rather than having it bound up in the often contested politics of climate change. This effort, however, appears to have resulted in the inadvertent placing of ocean acidification outside of the mandate of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This has created a significant gap in the global governance of this issue with no multilateral agreement understood as having jurisdiction over the mitigation of rising ocean acidity. For these reasons this paper argues that an alternative framing of ocean acidification as an effect of climate change is warranted. This would include ocean acidification in the core obligations of the Convention, thereby filling the mitigation governance gap and avoiding perverse implementation outcomes. It is contended that interpreting the UNFCCC in this way is more consistent with its objective and purpose than the existing interpretations that place ocean acidification beyond the remit of the Convention. Key policy insights Ocean acidification is best understood as an effect of climate change in the context of the UNFCCC, and therefore is included in its obligations to combat climate change and its adverse effects. An obligation to address ocean acidification has implications for the way that the provisions of the Convention, particularly on mitigation, are implemented. Mitigation activities that exacerbate ocean acidification or lead to emission reduction pathways that do not prevent dangerous acidification should be deemed inconsistent with the Convention. Protection, conservation and restoration of coastal and marine ecosystems should become a priority area for action within the UNFCCC. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate policy; global governance; Ocean acidification; treaty interpretation; UNFCCC","climate change; coastal zone management; environmental policy; international agreement; ocean acidification; policy implementation; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070514965

Such catalyst also displayed an OER potential of 1.582 V (vs. RHE) with an overpotential of 0.80 V between ORR and OER at the current density of 10 mA cm−2, significantly lower than that of Pt/C.

In this work, TiB2 was used as a precursor to successfully prepare Ti3+ defective TiO2 (TiO2-B) with a truncated bipyramidal structure by a one-step method. Then, the SnS2 nanosheets were assembled onto the as-prepared TiO2-B through simple hydrothermal reaction. TiO2-B exhibits strong visible light absorption properties, but the recombination rate of the photo-generated electron-hole pair was high and does not exhibit ideal photocatalytic performance. Upon introducing SnS2, the heterojunction catalyst SnS2-Ti3+ defective TiO2 (SnS2/TiO2-B) not only possesses the strong light absorption from UV to visible light region, the lowest photo-generated charge recombination rate but also achieves a more negative conduction band potential than the reduction potential of CO2 to CO, and thereby, exhibits the significantly enhanced selectivity and yield of CO in photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Notably, SnS2/TiO2-B produces CO at a rate of 58 μmol·h-1·g-1 with CO selectivity of 96.3% under visible light irradiation, which is 2 and 19 times greater than those of alone TiO2-B and SnS2, respectively. Finally, a plausible photocatalytic mechanism on SnS2/TiO2-B was proposed that the electron transfer between TiO2 and SnS2 follows the Z-scheme mode.

In order to avoid these major problems affecting groundwater quality and quantity of this aquifer, sustainable water resource management is necessary and a priority to select an appropriate exploitation scheme. For this purpose, geographic information systems and Modflow have been applied to estimate current and future water budgets; hydrodynamic modeling of Skhira groundwater was investigated by using Modflow code to understand the hydrodynamics and the geometry of the aquifer system. The calibration of the mathematical model in steady state (1973) helped to refine the spatial distribution of transmissivity, to restore the groundwater level at each point, and to establish the stock of the groundwater. The assessment of the reliability of the model was conducted by comparing the simulated and observed values of the hydraulic head for the observed wells. It is noticed that there is a satisfactory concordance between these levels, especially in areas, where there is sufficient information about the hydrodynamic properties (transmissivity and piezometry). The results from the steady state were used to calibrate the transient model, to refine the spatial distribution of recharge and storage coefficient, and to determine the drawdowns at all points capturing Skhira aquifer during the period (1973–2014). Using the calibrated model, different scenarios were considered in order to predict the aquifer response under different exploitation conditions and stresses. © 2019 Desalination Publications.

In order to acquire up-to-date information on the forests, optical remote sensing techniques are commonly used. Moreover, in the future hyperspectral satellite missions will start providing data to support the needs of natural resource management practices, such as forestry. It is, however, unclear what would be the additional value from using hyperspectral data compared to multispectral in quantifying forest variables of Finnish boreal forest. In this study, we used the remote sensing data by hyperspectral AISA imager (128 bands, 400–1000 nm, resolution 0.7 m) and Sentinel-2 (10 bands, resolution 10 m) to assess the possible benefits of higher spectral resolution. As reference data, we used a new nationwide forest resource dataset (stand-level data), which has a high potential in further remote sensing applications. In addition, we used a set of independent in situ measurements (plot-level data) for validation. We applied two kernel-based machine learning regression algorithms (Gaussian process and support vector regression) to relate boreal forest variables with the remote sensing data. The variables of interest were mean height, basal area, leaf area index (LAI), stem biomass and main tree species. The regression algorithms were trained with stand-level data and estimations were evaluated with stand- and plot-level holdout sets. The estimation accuracies were examined with absolute and relative root-mean-square errors. Successful variable estimations showed that kernel-based regression algorithms are suitable tools for forest structure estimation. Based on the results, the additional value of hyperspectral remote sensing data in forest variable estimation in Finnish boreal forest is mainly related to variables with species-specific information, such as main tree species and LAI. The more interesting variables for forestry industry, such as mean height, basal area and stem biomass, can also be estimated accurately with more traditional multispectral remote sensing data. © 2019 The Authors","Forest structure variables; Gaussian process regression; Hyperspectral imaging; Machine learning; Sentinel-2; Support vector regression","biomass; boreal forest; community structure; comparative study; machine learning; multispectral image; regression analysis; remote sensing; satellite data; Sentinel; spectral resolution; support vector machine; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100687187

This paper proposes a methodology for recording an emission inventory for HDD equipment that formulates emission factors as a baseline of current emissions quantities. The sample case of the proposed emissions inventory technique is based on a small part of Indonesia's national toll road project: Rembang-Pasuruan toll road project. Rembang-Pasuruan toll road is a part of Gempol-Pasuruan toll road, a piece of national infrastructure project called Trans-Java Toll road that runs from Merak, Northwestern end of Java, to Banyuwangi, the eastern end of the island. This toll road connects almost all major cities and landmarks of the island with the total length of the road is nearly 1,167 km. The length of Gempol-Pasuruan toll road is about 34.15 km, and consists of three section: Section I, Gempol-Rembang 13.9 km, Section II, Rembang-Pasuruan 6.6 km, and Section III, Pasuruan-Grati 13.65 km. This toll road project utilizes a HDD fleet that includes 9 excavators, 2 bulldozers, 2 roller compactors, 1 motor-grader and 1 paver. This equipment consumes large quantities of diesel fuel and release air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matters (PM). The proposed inventory technique in this paper addresses the key attributes of the equipment on how long it is used during its operational life and how emission rates of NOx and PM are estimated. By using emission factors calculated from equipment's key attributes, it is revealed that all equipment in the project release approximately 452.12 gr/hr of NOx or 3400.97 gr/day on average, and emit 31.99 gr/hr of PM or equals to 252.92 gr/day. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Diesel engines; Environmental engineering; Highway planning; Nitrogen oxides; Roads and streets; Toll highways; Current emissions; Emission inventories; Emissions inventory; Heavy-duty diesel; National infrastructure; Operational life; Particulate Matter; Roller compactor; Construction equipment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076462478

The carbon use efficiency (CUE), a key parameter in C cycling models, can inform on the partitioning of C between microbial biomass, and potential soil storage, and respiration. Here, we test the dependency of mycorrhizal mycelial CUE on stand age and seasonality in managed boreal forest stands. Based on mycelial production and respiration estimates, derived from sequentially incubated ingrowth mesh bags, we estimated CUE on an ecosystem scale during a seasonal cycle and across a chronosequence of eight, 12- to 158-year-old, managed Pinus sylvestris forest stands characterized by decreasing pH and nitrogen (N) availability with increasing age. Mycelial respiration was related to total soil respiration, and by using eddy covariance flux measurements, primary production (GPP) was estimated in the 12- and 100-year-old forests, and related to mycelial respiration and CUE. As hypothesized, mycelial CUE decreased significantly with increasing forest age by c. 65%, supposedly related to a shift in mycorrhizal community composition and a metabolic adjustment reducing their own biomass N demand with declining soil N availability. Furthermore, mycelial CUE increased by a factor of five over the growing season; from 0.03 in May to 0.15 in November, and we propose that the seasonal change in CUE is regulated by a decrease in photosynthate production and temperature. The respiratory contribution of mycorrhizal mycelium ranged from 14% to 26% of total soil respiration, and was on average 17% across all sites and occasions. Synthesis. Carbon is retained more efficiently in mycorrhizal mycelium late in the growing season, when fungi have access to a more balanced C and nutrient supplies. Earlier in the growing season, at maximum host plant photosynthesis, when below-ground C availability is high in relation to N, the fungi respire excess C resulting in lower mycelial carbon use efficiency (CUE). Additionally, C is retained less efficiently in mycorrhizal fungal biomass in older forest stands characterized by more nutrient depleted soils than younger forest stands. © 2019 The Authors.

The overall and age-specific carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks of these compounds for taxi drivers and passengers were estimated separately using Monte Carlo simulations. Three scenarios of exposure frequency were defined for taxis commuting in different zones of city: Restricted Traffic Zone (RTZ) and Odd-Even Zone (OEZ) as two plans to reduce air pollution, and no-restriction zone (NRZ). The carcinogenic risks for drivers and passengers, the average risks of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde for most cases were above the 1 × 10−4. The health risks were greater in Restricted Traffic Zone (RTZ) and Odd-Even Zone (OEZ) in comparison to no-restriction zone (NRZ). The carcinogenic risk from formaldehyde exposures were higher than those for acetaldehyde in all cases. Taxis fueled with LPG showed lower cancer risks for both acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. Refueling increased the carcinogenic risk from both compounds. For non-carcinogenic risks from acetaldehyde, the average hazard ratios for both drivers and passengers were &gt;1, indicating a non-negligible risk. Cancer and non-cancer risks for the taxi drivers were greater than the passengers given the higher time of occupancy. The present study showed that transportation in taxis can impose significant long-term health risks to both passengers and drivers.

Results reveal that the fluorine content in Carboniferous-Permian coal in the mining area ranges from 2.00 to 911.00 mg/kg, and the Carboniferous coal seam contents are generally higher than those of the Permian system. The calculated average fluorine contents in Nos. 5 and 12 coal seams of the Carboniferous system are 203.42 and 308.00 mg/kg, respectively, and therefore, both are high-fluorine coal. In addition, the calculated mean fluorine contents of Nos. 2 and 10 coal seams are 168.58 and 187.02 mg/kg, respectively, which are higher than average value of Chinese and global coal values. The highest fluorine content of 896.00 mg/kg is found in medium- to high-fluorine coal. Fluorine in coal mainly exists in an inorganic bound state in forms such as fluorapatite and calcium fluoride. The Xiangning Coal Mine predominantly produces coal for coking and power, and the release of fluorine during coal combustion is harmful to the environment. According to the information obtained in relation to coal resource reserves and development planning, the amount of fluorine released from combustion is estimated at 2258.1 t/year and is estimated to reach 4862.9 t/year by 2020. Coal washing is an effective way of reducing fluorine emissions, and flotation experiments have shown that this can reduce the amount of fluorine by up to 30–47%. Different engineering measures, such as denitrification and desulfurization, can also significantly reduce the amount of fluorine released during coal combustion and can thus be employed to reduce the associated environmental impacts. © The Author(s) 2019.","Coal; emission intensity; fluorine; geochemical characteristic; Xiangning mining area","Calcium fluoride; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal mines; Coking; Environmental impact; Exploratory boreholes; Flotation; Fluorine; Fluorine compounds; Fluorspar; Geochemistry; Proven reserves; Carboniferous coals; Carboniferous systems; Development planning; Emission intensity; Engineering measures; Fluorine emissions; Geochemical characteristic; Mining areas; Coal combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073187824

The response of L. chinensis to experimental warming can provide insight into its regeneration behaviour and the likely composition of future communities under warmer climate. We used MSR-2420 infrared radiators to elevate temperature and examined soil organic carbon and nitrogen and soil total phosphorus and determined the growth and physiology of L. chinensis in response to manipulations of ambient condition and warming. Results showed that compared with the control, L. chinensis subjected to warming treatment showed increased soil organic carbon and soil total nitrogen, but no significant difference was observed in soil total phosphorus. Climate warming increased shoot biomass, ecosystem respiration, and ecosystem water-use efficiency and reduced net ecosystem CO2 exchange and evapotranspiration. This result implies that warming could rapidly alter carbon fluxes. The effect of warming treatment significantly increased the contents of glucose and fructose and significantly inhibited sucrose synthesis. However, the TCA cycle was enhanced when citric and malic acid contents further accumulated. The results implied that L. chinensis probably enhanced its warming adaption mechanism mainly through increasing glycolysis consumption when it was exposed to elevated temperature. These results provide an understanding of the fundamental evidence explaining the primary metabolism of L. chinensis in response to warming and suggest the future impact of the terrestrial carbon-cycle feedback on global climate change. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Efforts to increase green zones require the establishment of parks and extension of planting activities in urban areas. The planting work conducted on streets, roads, avenues, and traffic islands is significant in the development of urban green spaces. Determination of the plant species that would be used in planting work and assessment of these species by experts and authorities based on scientific approaches are significant for the success of these efforts. In the present study, the issue of plant selection criteria for roadside planting was investigated with a hybrid decision-making approach based on landscape architects’ perspectives. To solve the plant selection problem of decision-makers and to obtain reliable quantitative data, a set of criteria that included 5 main and 41 sub-variables was determined. Pairwise comparison technique was used by experts for evaluation of the involved criteria. The study findings revealed that the “structural criteria” were the most effective main factor in plant selection for roadside planting, followed by the “economic and ecological” criteria. Furthermore, it was determined that the growth length and diameter of the plants (10.2%), selection of indigenous species that reflect the urban identity (7.30%), and the climatic requirements of the plants (7.20%) were the sub-criteria that should be considered in selection of the plants. In conclusion, it was determined that quantitative assessment of plant selection decisions would help planting design decisions on roadside planting. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","ANP; Decision-making; DEMATEL; Landscaping; Roadside plants","decision making; greenschist facies; greenspace; landscape; plant; roadside environment; urban area; urban growth; urban planning; urban population; urbanization; city; ecology; environmental planning; plant; urbanization; Cities; Ecology; Environment Design; Plants; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074751172

In this context, object-based image analysis (OBIA) has been used to monitor changes in vegetation, but only a few studies have related them to anthropic pressure. In this study, we assessed changes in cover, number, and shape of Ziziphus lotus shrub individuals in a coastal groundwater-dependent ecosystem in SE Spain over a period of 60 years and related them to human actions in the area. In particular, we evaluated how sand mining, groundwater extraction, and the protection of the area affect shrubs. To do this, we developed an object-based methodology that allowed us to create accurate maps (overall accuracy up to 98%) of the vegetation patches and compare the cover changes in the individuals identified in them. These changes in shrub size and shape were related to soil loss, seawater intrusion, and legal protection of the area measured by average minimum distance (AMD) and average random distance (ARD) analysis. It was found that both sand mining and seawater intrusion had a negative effect on individuals; on the contrary, the protection of the area had a positive effect on the size of the individuals' coverage. Our findings support the use of OBIA as a successful methodology for monitoring scattered vegetation patches in drylands, key to any monitoring program aimed at vegetation preservation. © 2019 by the authors.","Arid zones; Cabo de Gata-Níjar Natural Park; Drylands; Object-based; Seawater intrusion; Soil loss; Southeast Spain; Time series classification; Very high-resolution images; Ziziphus lotus","Arid regions; Climate change; Groundwater; Object detection; Salt water intrusion; Vegetation; Arid zones; Dry land; Natural park; Object based; Soil loss; Southeast Spain; Time series classifications; Very high resolution (VHR) image; Ziziphus lotus; Seawater effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075353996

Although transport of construction materials represents up to 30% of freight movements in cities and even more in terms of pollutant emissions. Using data collected over eight months in four construction sites, this paper provides a better understanding of the urban freight transport activity related to construction and presents the potential benefits of the implementation of construction consolidation centres (CCCs). A CCC is an innovative approach, which aims at increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of logistics processes by reducing the number of deliveries. Consequently, the use of a CCC in urban areas can reduce congestion and pollutant emissions due to construction freight movements. This paper presents results of CCC usage simulations for the four construction sites mentioned above. The results suggest that the distribution of goods to and from construction sites is peculiar as compared to other, better-known, urban supply chains and reinforce the call to researchers and decision makers from both private and public sides to devote more attention to this market segment. © 2019 by the authors.","CCC; City logistics; Comparative analysis; Construction logistics; Urban freight transport","comparative study; decision making; environmental impact; freight transport; supply chain management; urban agriculture; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074859109

While some CO2 mitigation options can reduce water demand, others can increase it, and still others are neutral. By simulating two parametric models, one for all Brazilian refineries, and the other locally detailing the water balance of the country´s largest refinery, this study aimed to quantify the impacts of CO2 mitigation options on the water use of oil refineries. Findings show that, by pricing CO2 emissions up to 100 US$/tCO2, the list of mitigation options was able to abate 25% of the annual emissions in Brazilian refineries. A relevant share of this abatement derives from the implementation of carbon capture (CC) facilities in fluid catalytic cracking and hydrogen generation units. However, these CC facilities offset the co-benefits of other CO2 mitigation options that can reduce steam and cold-water requirements in refineries. In fact, for the largest Brazilian oil refinery, the implementation of all mitigation measures had almost no effect on its water balance. This means that CO2 abatement in refineries has no significant impact on water demand (no negative trade-off). However, this also means that the water stress in oil refineries should be dealt with measures not directly linked to CO2 abatement (no significant co-benefits). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Brazil; Climate-energy-water nexus; Oil refineries","Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Fluid catalytic cracking; Hydrogen production; Brazil; Climate-energy-water nexus; CO2 mitigation; Hydrogen generations; Mitigation measures; Mitigation options; Oil refineries; Parametric models; Petroleum refineries; abatement cost; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; cost-benefit analysis; industrial emission; oil industry; water demand; water stress; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071128352

The plant demonstrated the Transport Integrated Gasification (TRIGTM) technology developed by Southern Company, KBR, and the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). With a capability of generating up to 524 MW net, the plant also captures CO2 from syngas produced from locally mined Mississippi lignite. Particulate Control Devices (PCDs), designed by Pall Corporation, are a critical component of the TRIGTM gasification process. The PCDs use dry filtration technology to remove essentially all the fine particulates from the syngas before it is sent to downstream processes for further gas clean-up, CO2 capture, and, finally for use in combustion turbines to generate power. The Kemper PCDs are designed to accommodate different types of filter elements for future optimization. The initial installation features the 2.5-meter long iron aluminide (FEAL) filter elements based on the extensive testing experience gained at the Power Systems Development Facility (PSDF). The PCD back-pulse system is equipped with the Coupled Pressure Pulse (CPPTM) blowback technology developed jointly by Pall's Schumacher Division and Karlsruhe Institute of Technology for online filter element cleaning. It is the first CPPTM application of this scale used for high-pressure, high-temperature filtration in a gasification process. The Kemper facility has achieved integrated operation with production of electricity, CO2, and other by-products from syngas per design specifications. This paper describes the operations, performance, and technical issues of both the PCD and the fines cooling and handling system that were encountered during the installation, unit commissioning, and extended operation with lignite. © 2019 The Authors","Back-pulse; Coal gasification; Filtration; Fine ash removal; Kemper County IGCC project; Particulate control device","Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Coal gasification; Filtration; Lignite; Product design; Synthesis gas; Back-pulse; Filtration technologies; Fine ashes; High-temperature filtration; IGCC projects; Integrated gasification combined cycle; Particulate control; U.S. Department of Energy; Synthesis gas manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069913555

However, the advancement of energy technology may cause rebound effect which may lessen the emission reduction effect of technical progress. This suggests that the real impact of energy technological progress is worthy of further study. By taking the rebound effect into consideration, this study estimates the real effect of energy technological progress and energy consumption on carbon emissions in China, based on an interaction model, and using data from China's 30 provinces for the period 2005–2016. Key results include the following: (1) An inverted U-shaped relationship between energy technological progress and carbon emissions is detected. (2) Across technical progress, energy consumption has an inverted U-shaped effect on carbon emissions. (3) Turning points are found in both the direct effect and the technical effect of China's energy technological progress. This indicates that they initially increase carbon emissions, and then reduce them, although the rebound effect continues to have a positive impact on the increase of carbon emissions. (4) The largest differences between regions with different energy technology levels appear in the direct effect and the technical effect of energy technological progress on CO2 emissions, and there is almost no difference in rebound effect.

Yet, our understanding of how tropical trees regulate sap flux in response to climate variability remains elusive. With a progressively warming climate, atmospheric evaporative demand [i.e., vapor pressure deficit (VPD)] will be increasingly important for plant functioning, becoming the major control of plant water use in the twenty-first century. Using measurements in 34 tree species at seven sites across a precipitation gradient in the neotropics, we determined how the maximum sap flux velocity (vmax) and the VPD threshold at which vmax is reached (VPDmax) vary with precipitation regime [mean annual precipitation (MAP); seasonal drought intensity (PDRY)] and two functional traits related to foliar and wood economics spectra [leaf mass per area (LMA); wood specific gravity (WSG)]. We show that, even though vmax is highly variable within sites, it follows a negative trend in response to increasing MAP and PDRY across sites. LMA and WSG exerted little effect on vmax and VPDmax, suggesting that these widely used functional traits provide limited explanatory power of dynamic plant responses to environmental variation within hyper-diverse forests. This study demonstrates that long-term precipitation plays an important role in the sap flux response of humid tropical forests to VPD. Our findings suggest that under higher evaporative demand, trees growing in wetter environments in humid tropical regions may be subjected to reduced water exchange with the atmosphere relative to trees growing in drier climates. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Evapotranspiration; Plant functional traits; Transpiration; Vapor pressure deficit","drought; evapotranspiration; flux measurement; hydrological cycle; Neotropical Region; precipitation (chemistry); precipitation (climatology); tree; tropical forest; tropical region; vapor pressure; water; drought; evapotranspiration; forest; tree; vapor pressure; Droughts; Forests; Plant Transpiration; Trees; Vapor Pressure; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074005732

Most climate models project a decrease in winter rainfall in southern Australia, however there is a wide model range and there is not yet a robust assessment of underlying physical processes that can inform and constrain projections. Here, a multiple linear regression model between indices of atmospheric circulation and gridded rainfall in observations and in CMIP5 climate models is developed for July, representing the peak of winter. The regression is used as an evaluation tool for models and a basis to select models. Spatial distributions of the coefficients from the regression illustrate the relative important of different circulation features for rainfall across the region, and illustrate where climate models have deficiencies. As an additional check of projections, historical years that are an analogue for the projected future mean state of the atmospheric circulation are identified and the rainfall anomaly during those years is examined. Both approaches broadly agree and support previous work in suggesting a constraint on rainfall change to a decrease only. The regression analysis also suggests that the median projection for southwest Western Australia should be revised lower than the median of all climate models. The results demonstrate value in applying statistical techniques to understand relationships of rainfall to circulation and to refine confidence in regional climate projections. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Atmospheric circulation; Climate projections; Model selection","atmospheric circulation; climate modeling; CMIP; rainfall; winter; Australia; Western Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068210625

Finland, however, was labeled “a failing ecostate” by a recent study owing to its weak climate change policy. Why is Finland different? We use data from a survey of organizations belonging to the Finnish climate change policy network to investigate two alternative explanations related to policy networks. According to the Cooptation Thesis, inclusive corporatist polities, where environmental NGOs (ENGOs) have support from and access to the state, formulate less ambitious policies because environmentalists moderate their views to secure state funding and political access. Second, according to the Treadmill of Production Theory, the decisive feature of Nordic corporatism with regard to environmental policy is the tripartite system linking business interests, labor unions, and the state in a coalition that prioritizes economic over ecological values. The results indicate that the ENGO Coalition is the least influential, least resourceful, smallest, least linked to the others, and not particularly moderate.

One of these parts involved in the direct threshing process is the whipping threshing drum made of high carbon steel. Used steels of increased strength for the manufacture of parts, components and structures of agricultural machines requiring restoration using surfacing with wear-resistant coatings are hampered due to the tendency of such steels to form hot and cold cracks in the near-weld zone. The main reason for the formation of cold cracks during the welding of steel parts is considered to be the unfavorable development of physicochemical processes in the heat-affected zone of welding. The highest probability of the formation of deformations and residual stresses in austenitized regions of the heat-affected zone is characteristic of steels with a high carbon equivalent. As a result of the research conducted, the possibility of reducing the carbon content in the welded edges and weld surfaces of carbon steel products by creating a temperature gradient in them directed from the surface to the core was substantiated and experimentally confirmed. The local decarburization that occurs during this process is reversible, and after performing the surfacing, it is easily eliminated by normalization. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Carbon fractions are important for modelling soil carbon dynamics for carbon accounting, and as a potential indicator of soil quality. We considered particulate organic carbon (POC), humic organic carbon (HOC) and resistant organic carbon (ROC), which represent fractions of increasing bio-chemical stability. A dataset of 427 NSW profiles with mid-infrared (MIR) derived carbon fractions and a set of 16 predictor variables were applied. Random Forest and multiple linear regression techniques were applied, for depth intervals to 30 cm. The derived models and maps were of moderate strength, with validation results revealing Lin's concordance values for the 0–30 cm depth interval of 0.79 for total SOC stocks and 0.60 to 0.74 for the fraction stocks. Maps of mean stocks, and upper and lower 95% prediction intervals are presented. Absolute stocks (in Mg ha−1) of each fraction have a strong linear relationship with total SOC and are controlled by similar environmental and land management factors, normally increasing in a systematic way with increasingly moist climate (considering rainfall and temperatures), increasing mafic lithology (associated with more fertile, clay rich soils) and less disturbed land uses with higher vegetation cover. The environmental factors influencing the relative proportions of each fraction (% of total SOC) are more complex, but climate and lithology appear to be dominant, in addition to depth in profile. An SOC vulnerability index is mapped over the State, identifying areas where the stored carbon is most vulnerable to land management or environmental change. Our findings add to the understanding of factors driving the distribution of soil carbon and its fractions, which may ultimately contribute to more effective climate change mitigation programs. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon fractions; Controlling factors; Digital soil mapping; Vulnerability index","Chemical stability; Climate change; Decision trees; Environmental management; Forestry; Land use; Linear regression; Lithology; Soil surveys; Soils; Carbon fraction; Climate change mitigation; Controlling factors; Digital soil mappings; Multiple linear regressions; New South Wales , Australia; Particulate organic carbon; Vulnerability index; Organic carbon; digital mapping; environmental factor; factor analysis; index method; model validation; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil quality; spatial distribution; vulnerability; Australia; New South Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068535670

National forest inventories (NFIs) are important to meet international accounting goals, but data are often incomplete going back in time, and the amount of time between remeasurements can make attribution of C flux to specific events difficult. The long time series of Landsat imagery provides spatially comprehensive, consistent information that can be used to fill the gaps in ground measurements with predictive models. To evaluate such models, we relate Landsat spectral changes and disturbance interpretations directly to C flux measured on NFI plots and compare the performance of models with and without ground-measured predictor variables. The study was conducted in the forests of southwest Oregon State, USA, a region of diverse forest types, disturbances, and landowner management objectives. Plot data consisted of 676 NFI plots with remeasured individual tree data over a mean interval (time 1 to time 2) of 10.0 years. We calculated change in live aboveground woody carbon (AWC), including separate components of growth, mortality, and harvest. We interpreted radiometrically corrected annual Landsat images with the TimeSync (TS) tool for a 90 m × 90 m area over each plot. Spectral time series were divided into segments of similar trajectories and classified as disturbance, recovery, or stability segments, with type of disturbance identified. We calculated a variety of values and segment changes from tasseled cap angle and distance (TCA and TCD) as potential predictor variables of C flux. Multiple linear regression was used to model AWC and net change in AWC from the TS change metrics. The TS attribution of disturbance matched the plot measurements 89% of the time regarding whether fire or harvest had occurred or not. The primary disagreement was due to plots that had been partially cut, mostly in vigorous stands where the net change in AWC over the measurement was positive in spite of cutting. The plot-measured AWC at time 2 was 86.0 ± 78.7 Mg C ha-1 (mean and standard deviation), and the change in AWC across all plots was 3.5 ± 33 Mg C ha-1 year-1. The best model for AWC based solely on TS and other mapped variables had an R2 = 0.52 (RMSE = 54.6 Mg C ha-1); applying this model at two time periods to estimate net change in AWC resulted in an R2 = 0.25 (RMSE = 28.3 Mg ha-1) and a mean error of -5.4 Mg ha-1. The best model for AWC at time 2 using plot measurements at time 1 and TS variables had an R2 = 0.95 (RSME = 17.0 Mg ha-1). The model for net change in AWC using the same data was identical except that, because the variable being estimated was smaller in magnitude, the R2 = 0.73. All models performed better at estimating net change in AWC on TS-disturbed plots than on TS-undisturbed plots. The TS discrimination of disturbance between fire and harvest was an important variable in the models because the magnitude of spectral change from fire was greater for a given change in AWC. Regional models without plot-level predictors produced erroneous predictions of net change in AWC for some of the forest types. Our study suggests that, in spite of the simplicity of applying a single carbon model to multiple image dates, the approach can produce inaccurate estimates of C flux. Although models built with plot-level predictors are necessarily constrained to making predictions at plot locations, they show promise for providing accurate updates or back-calculations of C flux assessments. © 2019 by the authors.","Biomass; Carbon flux; Disturbance; Landsat; Tree growth","Biomass; Carbon; Forecasting; Greenhouse gases; Harvesting; Linear regression; Magnesium; Spectroscopy; Time series; Carbon fluxes; Disturbance; LANDSAT; Management objectives; Mean and standard deviations; Multiple linear regressions; National forest inventories; Tree growth; Forestry; biomass; carbon flux; environmental disturbance; forest inventory; forest management; growth response; Landsat; mortality; satellite data; satellite imagery; Biomass; Carbon; Forecasts; Greenhouse Gases; Harvesting; Magnesium; Oregon; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075400750

As such, climate change mitigation and adaptation are incidental to a larger enterprise that employs a systems approach to managing landscapes and communities. The transformative potential of regenerative agriculture has seen growing attention in the popular press, but few empirical studies have explored the processes by which farmers enter into, navigate, and, importantly, sustain the required paradigm shift in their approach to managing their properties, farm businesses, and personal lives. We draw on theories and insights associated with relational thinking to analyze the experiences of farmers in Australia who have undertaken and sustained transitions from conventional to regenerative agriculture. We present a conceptual framework of “zones of friction and traction” occurring in personal, practical, and political spheres of transformation that both challenge and facilitate the transition process. Our findings illustrate the ways in which deeply held values and emotions influence and interact with mental models, worldviews, and cultural norms as a result of regular monitoring; and how behavioral change is sustained through the establishment of self-amplifying positive feedbacks involving biophilic emotions, a sense of well-being, and an ever-expanding worldview. We conclude that transitioning to regenerative agriculture involves more than a suite of ‘climate-smart’ mitigation and adaptation practices supported by technical innovation, policy, education, and outreach. Rather, it involves subjective, nonmaterial factors associated with culture, values, ethics, identity, and emotion that operate at individual, household, and community scales and interact with regional, national and global processes. Findings have implications for strategies aimed at facilitating a large-scale transition to climate-smart regenerative agriculture. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change adaptation and mitigation; Communities of practice; Earth stewardship; Holistic Management; Relational thinking; Transformative learning","adaptation; carbon sequestration; climate change; conceptual framework; ecosystem service; holistic approach; learning; paradigm shift; soil carbon; soil water; strategic approach; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074748853

Based on data about annual emissions in U.S. counties and current land cover, we show that existing forest, grassland, and shrubland vegetation take up a significant portion of current U.S. emissions. Restoring land cover, where possible, to county-level average canopy cover can further remove pollution of SO2, PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 by an average of 27% through interception of particulate matter and absorption of gaseous pollutants. We find such nature-based solutions to be cheaper than technology for several National Emission Inventory sectors. Our results with and without monetary valuation of ecological cobenefits identify sectors and counties that are most economically attractive for nature-based solutions as compared to the use of pollution control technologies. We also estimate the sizes of urban and rural populations that would benefit from this novel ecosystem-based approach. This suggests that even though vegetation cannot fully negate the impact of emissions at all times, policies encouraging ecosystems as control measures in addition to technological solutions may promote large investments in ecological restoration and provide several societal benefits.

The elaborated, far infrared actuator together with a control system maintains the temperature of the Antarctic plant certain delta above the ambient temperature. Since the heat transfer is based on infrared radiation a thermal model is introduced, where the parameters of the model are determined empirically approximating it using a 1-st order dynamical system. Once determined, the sytem model paremeters help to design the control strategies: Control On-Off (1) and Control PID (proportional-integral-derivative) (2).

For the two power plants, top-down NOX emissions agree to within 10% of the emissions reported by the power plants. We then derive top-down NOX emissions rates for New York City, Chicago, and Toronto, and compare them to projected bottom-up emissions inventories. In this analysis of 2018 NOX emissions, we find a +22% overestimate for New York City, a-21% underestimate in Toronto, and good agreement in Chicago in the projected bottom-up inventories when compared to the top-down emissions. Top-down NOX emissions also capture intraseasonal variability, such as the weekday versus weekend effect (emissions are +45% larger on weekdays versus weekends in Chicago). Finally, we demonstrate the enhanced capabilities of TROPOMI, which allow us to derive a NOX emissions rate for Chicago using a single overpass on July 7, 2018. The large signal-to-noise ratio of TROPOMI is well-suited for estimating NOX emissions from relatively small sources and for sub-seasonal timeframes. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Nitrogen oxides; Signal to noise ratio; Air mass factor; Emissions inventory; Intraseasonal variability; Monitoring instruments; North American; Operational retrievals; Vertical columns; Weekend effects; Power plants; nitrogen; nitrogen dioxide; air mass; emission inventory; estimation method; instrumentation; megacity; nitric oxide; signal-to-noise ratio; urban area; urban pollution; Article; city; electric power plant; Illinois; kernel method; New York; North American; signal noise ratio; air pollutant; city; electric power plant; environmental monitoring; North America; United States; Canada; Chicago; Illinois; New York [New York (STT)]; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto; United States; Air Pollutants; Chicago; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; New York City; North America; Power Plants; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074388021

During this period, the UK pollution landscape has continued to evolve in terms of emission sources, and the measurement framework for metals in ambient air, the UK Heavy Metals Monitoring Network, has also been subject to significant configuration changes. Therefore, this work provides a timely review of more recent concentration trends in the context of current emission profiles. Overall, throughout this time period, there has been a significant downward trend in the emissions and consequently, the measured concentrations of most metals in UK ambient air. Ambient concentrations were generally found to be well correlated with emission estimates. Analysis of the sensitivity of measured concentrations to emissions suggests that concentrations have fallen faster than the reduction in emission estimates would have predicted at typical median urban background sites. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Air quality; Ambient air; Heavy metals; Monitoring networks; Trend analysis","Air quality; Heavy metals; Patient monitoring; Urban growth; Ambient air; Ambient concentrations; Concentration trends; Current emissions; Emission sources; Metals in ambient air; Monitoring network; Trend analysis; Quality control; arsenic; cadmium; chromium; cobalt; copper; iron; lead; manganese; mercury; metal; nickel; selenium; vanadium; zinc; heavy metal; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission; heavy metal; monitoring; trend analysis; air pollutant; air pollution; ambient air; concentration (parameter); controlled study; correlation analysis; environmental monitoring; geography; prediction; Review; sensitivity analysis; trend study; United Kingdom; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; United Kingdom; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Metals, Heavy; United Kingdom",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074213950

This paper describes a life-cycle analysis (LCA) of the Brazilian urban passenger transport system. The LCA considers various scenarios of a wholesale conversion of car and urban bus fleets to 100% electric or biofuel (bioethanol and biodiesel) use by 2050 compared to a business as usual (BAU) scenario. The LCA includes the following phases of vehicles and their life: fuel use and manufacturing (including electricity generation and land-use emissions), vehicle and battery manufacturing and end of life. The results are presented in terms of CO2, nitrous oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emissions, electricity consumption and the land required to grow the requisite biofuel feedstocks. Biofuels result in similar or higher CO2 and air pollutant emissions than BAU, while electrification resulted in significantly lower emissions of all types. Possible limitations found include the amount of electricity consumed by electric vehicles in the electrification scenarios. © 2019 by the authors.","Biofuel; Brazil; Electrification; Ethanol; Life-cycle analysis (LCA); Mobility; Transport","atmospheric pollution; biofuel; carbon emission; electricity generation; electrification; emission control; ethanol; life cycle analysis; particulate matter; traffic emission; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075886529

However, Nationally Determined Contributions as submitted under the Paris Agreement, suggest that a large share of policies still focusses on year-specific GHG targets, which do not full comply with the stock problem. A literature review performed for this paper supports that those politically set caps are taken over by energy system models. However, due to a higher flexibility in the choice of mitigation options, a time-spanning carbon budget can achieve the same cumulated emission reduction than year-specific caps - but at lower average mitigation cost. In this paper we demonstrate in a first step that the introduction of a second policy besides year-specific caps can lead – counterintuitively – to lower average mitigation cost than a cap alone. The reason is that the second policy induces a mitigation pathway, that approaches the carbon budget solution. In a second step, reasons behind this effect are demonstrated in a generic mitigation cost curve analysis. The application of two models with different regional and thematic foci emphasizes that this is not a case-specific effect, but can occur under various circumstances. We conclude that using a scenario with a budget constraint on GHG emissions more frequently - in addition to widespread cap or price scenarios - supports policy-makers to identify pathways at lowest mitigation cost. As a second benefit, the generic demonstration of mitigation cost curves in this paper helps modellers to gain a better understanding of model results under various political constraints. © 2019 The Authors","Carbon budget; Energy system model; Linear optimization; Mitigation cost; Modelling policy instruments","Budget control; Carbon; Costs; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Linear programming; Carbon budgets; Energy system model; Linear optimization; Mitigation costs; Policy instruments; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070219468

Yet, their achievement depends on sustainability targets compatible across different sectors and scales. Our study examines how the GHG emission intensity of agriculture (EIA) should evolve globally, regionally (Western Europe) and nationally (The Netherlands) under different socioeconomic pathways, so that two major aims of SDGs 2 and 13 (i.e. sufficient food production and climate change mitigation) are achieved simultaneously. Results show that, by 2050, relative to 2010 values, EIA should decrease at all three levels when measured on a product basis (GHG emissions per ton dry matter) and on a land basis (GHG emissions per ha). This indicates that, globally, agriculture should be intensified per unit area, while in Western Europe and even more so in the Netherlands additional emission reductions require increased production efficiency and lower production volumes. Projected reductions in methane and nitrous oxide emissions from enteric fermentation, manure management and fertilizer application in Dutch agriculture are much higher than what would be achieved through the extrapolation of current trends. Given the high costs of increasing production efficiency further, our analysis indicates the need for significantly more ambitious policy targets and systemic changes, including reduced consumption of animal-sourced food. Besides shedding light on the interaction between climate and agricultural strategies, our analysis illustrates the application of cross-scale thinking in the operationalization of the SDG agenda and underscores the need for concerted action amongst countries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Cross-scale analysis; Scenario analysis; Sustainable Development Goals; Trade-offs","climate change; fertilizer application; food production; scenario analysis; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development; Netherlands; Western Europe; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072539697

This also applies to climate change co-benefits that derive from adaptation and mitigation initiatives implemented at the urban level and that address the water-energy nexus. A better understanding of the water-energy nexus is a precondition for integrated resource planning that optimizes the use of scarce resources. Against this background, the paper assesses the potential impact of water-energy saving technologies (WEST) on the water-energy nexus of Cuenca, Ecuador, focusing on how vulnerability to climate change may affect the water metabolic cycle of the urban area. Water-energy saving technologies such as rainwater harvesting, solar water heaters, and micro water turbines, reduce water-related energy consumption and mitigate greenhouse gases emissions; thereby illustrating the potential to generate climate change mitigation and adaptation co-benefits. The paper relies on primary data collected through interviews and a survey as well as secondary data in order to assess the extent to which water-energy saving technologies influence the water-energy nexus in Cuenca's urban water metabolic cycle. Within the context of climate change, the paper develops a business-as-usual scenario and assesses how this is modified by the implementation of water-energy saving technologies. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change adaptation and mitigation; Climate change co-benefits; Water-energy nexus","adaptive management; climate change; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; policy implementation; urban area; vulnerability; Azuay; Cuenca [Azuay]; Ecuador",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074975258

Nowadays, the most significant flexible loads of a commercial port are the refrigerated containers, known as reefers, and the shore-side electric power supplies for ships. Moreover, ports usually have a great potential for local energy generation from renewable energy sources. The real-time control of the numerous port flexible loads is difficult to be achieved with conventional control systems. Multi-agent systems (MAS) have been proved to be very efficient in complex systems and, as it is shown in this paper, they can also be effective for large ports. In this paper, a real-time distributed demand response system using MAS with hierarchical structure is proposed for extensively electrified large ports. The proposed control system ensures real-time limitation of ship emissions, and the reduction of operation cost and fast power variations caused by local wind parks. To achieve the above, the electric power demands of in-port reefers and shore-to-ship power supplies are suitably controlled. A fuzzy-logic-based system is exploited to estimate reefers' desired utilization factor and integrated to the developed MAS. The efficiency of the proposed method is evaluated by detailed simulations of a realistic case study of a large commercial port. © 1969-2012 IEEE.","Demand Response; Emissions Limitation; Flexible Loads; Fuzzy Systems; Multi-Agent Systems; Port Power Systems","Control systems; Cost effectiveness; Electric power systems; Electric power utilization; Fuzzy logic; Fuzzy systems; Real time control; Refrigerated containers; Ships; Wind power; Conventional control systems; Demand response; Electric power demands; Electric power supply; Flexible loads; Hierarchical structures; Renewable energy source; Utilization factor; Multi agent systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074452127

However, dry forest ecosystems in Ecuador are endangered to become a source of carbon emissions because of deforestation. Often spatial information, necessary to quantify potential carbon loss to the atmosphere, is missing. This particularly applies to remote areas of limited accessibility. This study aims to regionalise the SOC stocks of a small and poorly accessible dry forest ecosystem in southwestern Ecuador by using boosted regression tree (BRT) models. Resampling in a nested repeated k-fold cross validation approach was applied to develop robust models for a dataset of 118 samples with limited predictor information. To select an optimal set of model parameters, optimisation by differential evolution (DE) was applied for parameter tuning. Predictor selection was implemented using the same optimisation algorithm. This study demonstrates how the predictive performance of BRT models can be improved by applying an optimisation approach for parameter tuning and predictor selection. Model performance was improved by approximately 40% concerning the R2. Still, the results also demonstrated the difficulties of machine learning applications in small and highly heterogeneous natural areas. Very variable or even random factors were assumed to distort the relationship between predictor and response variables.

By flying grids at different heights above the landfills, atmospheric CH4 densities and wind components were measured along the edges and inside the study atmospheric volume, in order to calculate mass flows in the along- and across-wind directions. A steady-state Gaussian dispersion model was applied to build the concentration fields associated to unit emission from each landfill, while the contribution of each one to the total emission was assessed using a General Linear Model approach, minimizing the difference between measured and modeled mass flows. Results showed that wind spatial and temporal variability is the main factor controlling the accuracy of the method, as a good agreement between measured and modeled mass flows was mainly found for flights made in steady wind conditions. CH4 emissions of the entire area ranged from 213.5 ± 33.5 to 317.9 ± 90.4 g s−1 with a mean value of 252.5 ± 54.2 g s−1. Contributions from individual sources varied from 17.5 to 40.1 g m−2 day−1 indicating a substantial heterogeneity of the different landfills, which differed in age and waste composition. The proposed method was validated against tower eddy covariance flux measurements made at one of the landfills, revealing an overall agreement within 20%. © 2019 The Authors","Airborne measurements; Landfill emission; Mass balance","Aircraft; Mass transfer; Methane; Airborne measurements; Aircraft measurement; Concentration fields; Dispersion Modelling; Gaussian dispersion models; General linear modeling; Mass balance; Spatial and temporal variability; Land fill; airborne survey; dispersion; emission; landfill; mass balance; methane; modeling; quantitative analysis; accuracy; aircraft; Article; chemical composition; concentration (parameter); data analysis; environmental monitoring; flight; landfill; methane emission; quantitative analysis; steady state; waste; wind; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; statistical model; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; methane; Air Pollutants; Aircraft; Environmental Monitoring; Linear Models; Methane; Refuse Disposal; Waste Disposal Facilities; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071085961

While the impacts of artificial light at night in terrestrial and riparian ecosystems are increasingly well documented, those on organisms that reside in coastal intertidal habitats are less well explored. The distribution of artificial light at night from seaside promenade lighting was mapped across a sandy shore, and its consequences for macroinvertebrate community structure quantified accounting for other collinear environmental variables known to shape biodiversity in intertidal ecosystems (shore height, wave exposure and organic matter content). Macroinvertebrate community composition significantly changed along artificial light gradients. Greater numbers of species and total community biomass were observed with increasing illumination, a relationship that was more pronounced (increased effects size) with increasing organic matter availability. Individual taxa exhibited different relationships with artificial light illuminance; the abundances of 27% of non-rare taxa [including amphipods (Amphipoda), catworms (Nephtys spp.), and sand mason worms (Lanice conchilega)] decreased with increasing illumination, while 20% [including tellins (Tellinidae spp.), lugworms (Arenicola marina) and ragworms (Nereididae spp.)] increased. Possible causes of these relationships are discussed, including direct effects of artificial light on macroinvertebrate behaviour and indirect effects via trophic interactions.

In this work, 12 combinations of GCM and RCM under two scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) supplied by the EURO-CORDEX project are analyzed in the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands. Precipitation quantiles for a set of exceedance probabilities are estimated by using the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution function fitted by the L-moment method. Precipitation quantiles expected in the future period are compared with the precipitation quantiles in the control period, for each climate model. An approach based on Monte Carlo simulations is developed to assess the uncertainty from the climate model projections. Expected changes in the future are compared with the sampling uncertainty in the control period to identify statistically significant changes.

This study determined the removal of air pollutants by dry deposition of trees across the Basque Country and estimated its annual economic value. A model that calculates the hourly dry deposition of NO2, O3, SO2, CO and PM10 on trees at a 1 km x 1 km resolution at a regional scale was developed. The calculated mean annual rates of removal of air pollution across various land uses were 12.9 kg O3 ha−1, 12.7 kg PM10 ha−1, 3.0 kg NO2 ha−1, 0.8 kg SO2 ha−1 and 0.2 kg CO ha−1. The results were then categorised according to land use in order to determine how much each land use category contributed to reducing air pollution and to determine to what extent trees provided pollution reduction benefits to society. Despite not being located in the areas of highest pollutions, coniferous forests, which cover 25% of the land, were calculated to absorb 21% of the air pollution. Compared to other land uses, coniferous forests were particularly effective in removing air pollution because of their high tree cover density and the duration of leaf life-span. The total economic value provided by the trees in reducing these pollutants in terms of health benefits was estimated to be €60 million yr−1 which represented around 0.09% of the Gross Domestic Product of the Basque Country in 2016. Whilst most health impacts from air pollution are in urban areas the results indicate that most air pollution is removed in rural areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Deposition velocity; Health; Land cover; Pollutant; Vegetation","atmospheric pollution; dry deposition; Gross Domestic Product; health status; land cover; pollution effect; regional climate; scale effect; tree; vegetation cover; Basque Country [Spain]; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069566168

Less analysis has been devoted to piecemeal solutions. We use the Forest and Agriculture Sector Optimization Model with Greenhouse Gases (FASOMGHG) to project the individual and combined effect of three existing U.S. Department of Agriculture programmes with potential to increase greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. We find that a combined policy scenario may achieve greater mitigation than individual constituent programmes, suggesting the possibility of complementary spillover effects in some periods. Mitigation varies over time, however, and some periods experience net emissions as markets and management practices respond to initial policy shocks. The regional distribution of GHG mitigation also varies between policy scenario. Differences in the magnitude and imputed cost of mitigation under each scenario, generating negative values for some programmes and time periods, reinforces the need to evaluate portfolio design to cost-effectively achieve near-term GHG mitigation. Key policy insights Increased near-term GHG mitigation in the forest and agriculture sectors in the US may be possible by expanding or refocusing the emphasis of existing programmes. Implementing several such forest and agricultural programmes simultaneously may lead to greater GHG mitigation than when implemented separately, indicating the possibility of positive spillover effects. Programmes targeted to agricultural management may hold outsized potential to achieve near-term GHG mitigation; Policies aimed at influencing land use conversion appear to be more vulnerable to reversion and subject to larger inter-annual swings. The staged implementation of programmes could also be useful, helping to encourage increased mitigation (or the retention of already achieved mitigation) over time as markets re-equilibrate to initial shocks. Though the particular scenarios assessed here are unique to the US, our findings may be applicable to other locations outside the US where land management is influenced by individual market actors and there is competition between forest and agricultural land uses. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","agriculture; climate change mitigation; Conservation Reserve Program; FASOMGHG; land use change and forestry (LULUCF); policy portfolio","agricultural policy; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; environmental assessment; greenhouse gas; land use change; nature conservation; spillover effect; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074274958

At regional level, the three segmented emission sources: CO2 and N2O from coal combustion, and CO2 from sulfur content depreciation, each contributes to emission intensity at 1011.26, 8.24 and 6.09 gCO2e/KWh, respectively. At plant-specific level, emission intensity is very different, with an average of 1025.60 as well as an interval of 722.38–1796.67 gCO2e/KWh, which implies large gap in mitigation burden among power plants. Comparing mitigation cost of two pathways: CCS technology and carbon market mechanism, it is verified that on average, the former induces electricity price raised by 64.84%–97.26%, while the latter only induces 8.32% upward. From mitigation burden perspective, carbon market is more feasible than CCS technology to motivate power plant to carry out GHGs abatement in the short-run period. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 38: e13224, 2019. © 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers","CO2 emissions; coal-fired power plant; mitigation burden; N2O emissions; SO2 removal","Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal fueled furnaces; Commerce; Greenhouse gases; American Institute of Chemical Engineers; CO2 emissions; Coal-fired power plant; Electricity prices; Emission intensity; mitigation burden; SO2 removal; Western region of chinas; Fossil fuel power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064157711

A canonical configuration for this class of flows consists in three buoyant jets at different temperatures vertically entering a pool from the bottom. This work reports a Direct Numerical Simulation study performed on the triple jet configuration. The Reynolds number based on the average jet centerline velocity and jet width is set to Re=5000 and mixed convection regime is established at a Richardson number, Ri=0.25. In order to represent flows occurring inside liquid metal fast reactors, the selected Prandtl number is Pr=0.031. Statistics computed show that in the first stages of development, the three jets undergo a strong interaction. In that same region the shedding of large-scale vortices is originated accompanied by low-frequency undulations. Further from the inlet, the three jets are observed to coalesce in a single, isothermal stream. The analysis of momentum fluxes clarifies the mutual entrainment mechanism behind coalescence, which is commonly known as Coandă effect. At distances larger than ten times the jet width the self-similar characteristics of single and isothermal planar jets are recovered. The flow configuration presented includes several peculiar features, namely buoyancy effects at low Prandtl number, interaction between jets and the presence of multiple shear layers. This leads to an irregular behaviour of the turbulent diffusivity of momentum and heat as well as the misalignment between the temperature gradient and turbulent heat flux. Therefore the flow can be considered very complex and might constitute a demanding test bench for the development and validation of turbulence models. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Buoyant jets; DNS; LMFR; Low-Prandtl number; Mixed convection","Buoyancy; Direct numerical simulation; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Fast reactors; Heat flux; Isotherms; Liquid metal cooled reactors; Marine pollution; Mixed convection; Numerical models; Outfalls; Reynolds number; Shear flow; Turbulence models; Buoyant jets; Centerline velocity; Large-scale vortices; Liquid metal fast reactors; LMFR; Low Prandtl number; Turbulent diffusivities; Turbulent heat fluxes; Prandtl number",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070222230

While this is partly driven by changing precipitation, with well-known Earth system model uncertainties, here we show that the influence of plant stomatal conductance feedbacks can cause equally large changes in regional flood extremes and even act as the main control on future low latitude streamflow. Over most tropical land masses, modern climate predictions suggest that plant physiological effects will boost streamflow, overwhelming opposing effects of soil drying driven by the effects of CO2 on atmospheric radiation, warming and rainfall redistribution. The relatively unknown uncertainties in representing eco-physiological processes must therefore be better constrained in land-surface models. To this end, we identify a distinct plant physiological fingerprint on annual peak, low and mean discharge throughout the tropics and identify river basins where physiological responses dominate radiative responses to rising CO2 in modern climate projections. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon dioxide; climate modeling; ecophysiology; flash flood; flood; physiological response; rainfall; stomatal conductance; streamflow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074221823

One can observe an increase in the depletion and water content of the fields, an increase in the proportion of highly viscous and high-sulfur oil; the share of stocks in hard-to-reach and infrastructural underdeveloped regions is growing. One of the tools for encouraging subsoil users to develop such resources is to ensure lower rates of deductions to state bodies. The study presents an improved methodological approach to estimating and forecasting state budget revenues from hydrocarbon resources. The main stages of development are investigated and the main trends of the system of tax deductions from oil production are revealed. Explained the use of an approach focused on the forecast of production indicators of production, taking into account the structure of the mineral resource base. The calculations showed the need to reform the system of formation of government revenues from hydrocarbon resources. In the structure of government revenues from hydrocarbon resources, there is a tendency to increase the role of the mineral extraction tax in comparison with the export duty. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Budget control; Depreciation; Deterioration; Forecasting; Hydrocarbons; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge based systems; Mineral industry; Minerals; Petroleum industry; Soils; Taxation; Export duty; Hydrocarbon resources; Methodological approach; Mineral extraction; Oil production; Regional feature; State budgets; Tax deduction; Mineral resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076587858

These vary from increased exposures to floods, to discomfort due to urban heat, depending on their geographical locations and settings. However, even though some cities have a greater ability to cope with climate change challenges, many struggle to do so, particularly in cities in developing countries. In addition, there is a shortage of international studies which examine the links between climate change adaptation and cities, and which at the same time draw some successful examples of good practice, which may assist future efforts. This paper is an attempt to address this information need. The aim of this paper is to analyse the extent to which cities in a sample of developing countries are attempting to pursue climate change adaptation and the problems which hinder this process. Its goal is to showcase examples of initiatives and good practice in transformative adaptation, which may be replicable elsewhere. To this purpose, the paper describes some trends related to climate change in a set of cities in developing countries across different continents, including one of the smallest capital cities (Georgetown, Guyana) and Shanghai, one the world's most populous cities. In particular, it analyses their degree of vulnerability, how they manage to cope with climate change impacts, and the policies being implemented to aid adaptation. It also suggests the use of transformative approaches which may be adopted, in order to assist them in their efforts towards investments in low-carbon and climate-resilient infrastructure, thereby maximizing investments in urban areas and trying to address their related poverty issues.

The paper focuses on supercritical pulverised coal (SC PC) and natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants. Post combustion capture based on solvent scrubbing only has been considered, being currently the commercially leading option for capture. Variations in the performance and costs of plants have been quantified, according to local and site-specific conditions.

Macro and micro analyses of evolutions of energy consumption, carbon emission, and industrial added value were conducted from 2006 to 2016. Carbon emission was decomposed at the overall and subdivided industrial level by using the logarithmic mean division index method (LMDI) method. Results showed that the industrial added value emerges sustainable increase tendency. Both energy consumption and carbon emission keeps continuous increase during the 11th five year period (11-FYP). They firstly decrease and then they present volatile change during the rest years of the 12-FYP. Rigorous incentives should be enacted to avoid the phenomenon of carbon emission increase rebound during the later phase of each FYP. There are no decoupling signals during the whole 11-FYP.

Background and Objectives: Mangrove forest ecosystems grow in brackish water especially in areas exposed to accumulation of organic matter and tides. This forest type is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical coastal areas. Recent studies have revealed that the mangrove forest ecosystem had significantly degraded due to Land Use and Cover Changes (LUCC) in the recent past. Therefore, contribution of mangrove deforestation drivers has to be assessed to ensure a comprehensive analysis for ecosystem conservation and restoration and facilitate decision making. Materials and Methods: Firstly, a correlation analysis was conducted between individual data products and mangrove deforestation. Each data product was associated with the Dominant Land Use of Deforested Mangrove Patches data for 2012. Next, calculations were performed for specific data combinations to estimate the contributions of anthropogenic factors to mangrove deforestation. Results: In general, our study revealed that 22.64% of the total deforested area was converted into agriculture, 5.85% was converted into aquaculture, 0.69% was converted into infrastructure, and 16.35% was not converted into any specific land use class but was still affected by other human activities. Conclusions: We discovered that the percentage of land affected by these anthropogenic factors varied between countries and regions. This research can facilitate trade-off analysis for natural resources and environmental sustainability policy studies. Diverse management strategies can be evaluated to assess the trade-offs between preserving mangrove forests for climate change mitigation and transforming them for economic purposes. © 2019 by the authors.","Deforestation; Ecosystem conservation; GIS; Land use land cover change; Mangrove; Southeast Asia; Wetlands","Climate change; Decision making; Deforestation; Economic and social effects; Economics; Geographic information systems; Land use; Sustainable development; Tropics; Wetlands; Climate change mitigation; Comprehensive analysis; Environmental sustainability; Land use and cover change; Land use land cover change; Management strategies; Mangrove; Southeast Asia; Ecosystems; conservation management; deforestation; ecosystem management; GIS; land cover; land use; mangrove; satellite data; satellite imagery; wetland; Decision Making; Deforestation; Economics; GIS; Land Use; Tropics; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075333520

This corresponds to a 92% decrease of greenhouse gas emissions from Swedish consumption from today's level. The four scenarios illustrate different strategies: 1) collaborative economy, 2) local self-sufficiency, 3) automation for quality of life and 4) circular economy in the welfare state. The aim is to further hone and quantify the scenario narratives with a focus on greenhouse gas emissions occurring as a result of Swedish consumption, both private and public. The results show that the climate target can be met in all scenarios but this requires radical sector-specific as well as general changes, including decarbonisation, technology development, increased efficiencies, innovative practices and reduced demand. The mix of these strategies varies for different sectors and different scenarios, but all are needed to reach the climate goals. As we assume that Sweden is fossil-free 2050, particular areas of attention are diets, travel, emission intensities in other countries and the level of imports. Potential implications for other environmental goals, land use and biodiversity as well as the potential magnitude of negative emissions technologies, although uncertain and limited, that could offset some additional greenhouse gas emissions are discussed. © 2019",,"Biodiversity; Carbon; Economics; Environmental technology; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Circular economy; Climate targets; Decarbonisation; Emission intensity; Innovative practices; Low-carbon futures; Quality of life; Technology development; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069702281

Buildings operational energy needs are highly dependent on the envelope and space functionality characteristics, as well as climate properties, which is expected to change over time. While managing buildings energy performance, climate change can be a threat as it can cause significant changes in energy use patterns. This paper discusses the use of artificial intelligence techniques to assess the impact of climate change on campus buildings energy use under various future envelope and climate scenarios. We have relied on hourly energy use data of buildings situated in the University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, as well as their thermo-physical and space functionality properties. To study the impact of climate change, we have used climate properties of three future climate scenarios developed by North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) for Gainesville, FL, represented based on their impact within a 40-year prospect: median (year 2063), hottest (2057), and coldest (2041). In order to conduct the scenario analysis, we refer to the Technology Roadmap, Energy Efficient Building Envelopes, that is used to assess and present the development of technology products in building sector.

This study used data from statistics yearbooks and literatures to evaluate the spatio-temporal distribution of sludge generation, potential and distribution of methane production from sludge, and the potential of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction (PGER) from sludge treatment and disposal in provinces in mainland China. The results showed that a total of 6.03 Mt of dry solids in 2015. The eastern part of the country produced more sludge than that the western part. The standard coal equivalence of sludge was 3.5 Mt, ranged from 0.7 to 399.8 Kt, among the 31 provinces of mainland China. Total sludge could produce 1.27 billion m3 of methane per year through anaerobic digestion (AD). The distribution of methane density exhibited that the east part was higher than the west part in China. The GHG emissions totaled 18.82 Mt CO2-eq as a baseline for the current sludge disposal methods without AD technology. The PGER was 10.77 Mt CO2-eq for the sludge disposal routes with AD technology. The sludge disposal for the project route of building material exhibited the highest PGER of 4.24 Mt CO2-eq among the disposal methods. As the least GHG emissions method, sludge treated by AD and the residue disposed for land using as fertilizer should be recommended. Our findings provide a sludge disposal reference for the government and industries. For further study, it is suggested to take the co-digestion technology into consideration for sewage sludge to produce methane, which would perform a higher methane production and GHG emissions reduction potential. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Bioenergy; Biogas; Biomass; Sludge disposal","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Population statistics; Sewage sludge; Sludge disposal; Wastewater disposal; Bio-energy; Biomass resources; Economic development; Methane production; Population growth; Sludge generation; Sludge treatment and disposals; Spatiotemporal distributions; Sludge digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070582793

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is essential for achieving anticipated long-term climate change mitigation targets. However, China's government subsidy policies tend to support PV, while incentives for CCS are few. Given this situation, a trinomial tree modeling-based real options approach was developed to evaluate CCS retrofitting investment in coal-fired power plants versus PV power investment. This model includes setting different policy scenarios by considering electricity tariff subsidies and Chinese emission trading scheme (CN-ETS). The results showed that coal-fired power with CCS has a cost advantage over PV power in most provinces in China, if the electricity tariff and other subsidy policies remain the same; however, PV power will be cheaper than coal-fired power with CCS in Yunnan, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanghai and Shanxi provinces in the above cases. Incorporating CCS into CN-ETS could cut the former's application cost, but the incentive effect of CN-ETS is not obvious, because the carbon price in China is currently too cheap, and the incentive effect of a power tariff subsidy (subsidy at the PV power tariff level) is much better for PV than for CN-ETS. Increasing the load factor is an important way to reduce the CCS application cost for power plants. The results of this study provide reference and guidance for the collaborative development of CCS and PV. © 2019","Carbon capture and storage; CCS retrofitting investment; Low-carbon technology; Photovoltaic investment; Real options approach; Trinomial tree model","Climate change; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Costs; Electric power systems; Forestry; Fossil fuel power plants; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Retrofitting; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Climate change mitigation; Collaborative development; Emission trading scheme; Low-carbon technologies; Photovoltaic; Real options approach; Tree modeling; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071319330

Herein, we use density functional theory (DFT) calculations, supplemented by experiments, to propose and explore two possible reaction mechanisms of iron(0)-catalyzed hydrosilylation of aldehydes: One is initiated via hydrogen transfer from silane to benzaldehyde, and the other is initiated via σ-bond metathesis between Si-H and Fe-O bonds. The former mechanism is favored owing to the much lower calculated activation energy. In addition, spin crossover is expected to occur in this low-valent iron(0)-catalyzed reaction and is verified by different computational methods, which indicates that this reaction should have two-state reactivity (TSR). Hence, the reaction along the favored pathway is proposed to take place via quintet intermediates and triplet transition states before the generation of the final product, silyl ether.

Moreover, an efficient and integrated control strategy is needed for each of the components of a distributed generation plant, in order to reach the expected economic and environmental performances. In this paper, the transition from natural gas to electricity-based heating is evaluated for residential applications, considering the interplay between photovoltaic electricity produced on site and the thermal energy storage, to grant the optimal management of heating devices. The energy demand of an apartment building, under different climatic conditions, is taken as a reference and four power plant solutions are assessed in terms of energy cost and pollution reduction potential, compared to a baseline plant configuration. The performance of each power plant is analyzed assuming an optimized control strategy, which is determined through a graph-based methodology that was previously developed and validated by the authors. Outcomes from our study show that, if heat pumps are used instead of natural gas boilers, energy costs are reduced up to 41%, while CO2 emissions are reduced up to 73%, depending on the climatic conditions. Our results provide a sound basis for considering the larger penetration of photovoltaic plants as an effective solution towards cleaner and more efficient heating technologies for civil applications. The simultaneous utilization of heat pumps (as substitutes of boilers) and photovoltaic panels yields a positive synergy that nullifies the local pollution, drastically cuts the CO2 emission, and guarantees the economical sustainability of the investment in renewable energy sources without subsidiary mechanisms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","GHG; Heat pump; Optimization; Photovoltaic heating; Thermal storage","Apartment houses; Boilers; Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Distributed power generation; Electric energy storage; Environmental management; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Graphic methods; Greenhouse gases; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heating; Natural gas; Optimization; Photovoltaic cells; Pollution; Pumps; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Thermal energy; Distributed generation system; Economic and environmental performance; Heat pumps; Integrated control strategy; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaic electricities; Simultaneous utilization; Thermal storage; Investments; alternative energy; carbon emission; electricity generation; energy storage; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; heat production; human activity; photovoltaic system; residential energy; thermal power; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048330313

The considered UMG consists of a photovoltaic generator, an electrochemical storage system, a micro-gas turbine (GT) and a residential loads. A new optimal energy management system (EMS) is designed to perform a day-ahead power flow management (off-line management) in the UMG. The proposed EMS aims at coordinating the active and the reactive power schedule for the distributed energy sources (DES). This EMS is based on 24 h ahead forecast data of the residential loads consumption, the photovoltaic power and the electricity tariffs. Indeed, the EMS predicts hour-by-hour the active/reactive power references for each DES, while ensuring the stability and the reliability of the UMG. Accordingly, the EMS has two objectives: (1) minimizing the production cost of the active/reactive power for each DES (economic criteria); (2) reducing the CO2 equivalent emissions by adjusting the GT operating point (environmental criteria). To meet these objectives, the optimization problem is stated as a discretized economic problem over a 24 h time horizon. This problem is formulated by a multi-objective function (expressed in cash flow) as well as the operating constraints of the DES. To solve the optimization problem, a hybrid optimization technique is adopted based on the dynamic programming (using the Bellman algorithm) combined with the linear programming (using the simplex algorithm). This resolution choice allows an exhaustive and effective exploration of the solutions search area in a relatively fast resolution time (CPU time). The effectiveness of the proposed management strategy is demonstrated using a comparison against a rules-based management. Indeed, a statistical comparison shows that the proposed management provides an optimization around 38% of the energy bill with respect to the rules-based one. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"Costs; Digital storage; Dynamic programming; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission networks; Gas turbines; Housing; Linear programming; Optical variables measurement; Petroleum prospecting; Photovoltaic cells; Problem solving; Reactive power; Active and Reactive Power; Distributed energy sources; Electrochemical storage system; Management strategies; Multi-objective functions; Operating constraints; Photovoltaic generation; Statistical comparisons; Energy management systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061704946

Such dark matter can scatter off molecules in a gas and transfer an O(1) fraction of its kinetic energy to excite a vibrational and rotational state. The excited rovibrational mode relaxes rapidly and produces a spectacular multi-infrared-photon signal, which can be observed with ultrasensitive photodetectors. We discuss in detail a gas target consisting of carbon monoxide molecules, which enable efficient photon emission even at a relatively low temperature and high vapor pressure. The emitted photons have an energy in the range 180 to 265 meV. By mixing together carbon monoxide molecules of different isotopes, including those with an odd number of neutrons, we obtain sensitivity to both spin-independent interactions and spin-dependent interactions with the neutron. We also consider hydrogen fluoride, hydrogen bromide, and scandium hydride molecules, which each provide sensitivity to spin-dependent interactions with the proton. The proposed detection concept can be realized with near-term technology and allows for the exploration of orders of magnitude of new dark matter parameter space. © 2019 authors.

To this end, it is clear that practical ways to save energy and reduce CO2 emissions from this sector are needed to enable Cameroon to achieve its greenhouse gas mitigation targets. The Tapio and LMDI methods were applied in this paper, based on an extended Kaya identity, to explore the decoupling relationship among energy-related CO2 emissions and growth from Cameroon's transport sector, over the period 1990–2016. The decoupling indicators were broken down into five factors while considering the four fuels consumed in Cameroon's transport sector. Empirical results showed that only four states of decoupling appeared during the study's period including weak decoupling, strong decoupling, weak negative decoupling, and strong negative decoupling. Meanwhile, scale effects, energy structure effect, and energy intensity effect prevented decoupling, whereas the economic structure effect played an important role in promoting decoupling. Based on the findings of this study, some policies aimed at reducing carbon emissions from Cameroon's transport sector were proposed in this paper. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cameroon; CO2 emission; Decoupling; Energy consumption; GDP per capita; LMDI; Transport sector","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Cameroon; CO2 emissions; Decoupling; LMDI; Per capita; Transport sectors; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070316173

These objectives imply creating policy-supported national renewable technology industries, ideally reducing clean energy costs to a point where support becomes unnecessary. Two dimensions of competition arise: renewables competing with incumbent technologies, and local renewable technology industries competing with others globally. Policy can, sometimes, overlook the evolution of such competitive pressures due to three blind-spots. Policy support may: create demand that outstrips the domestic industry's capacity to expand — generating jobs overseas; underestimate the pace at which costs of a new technology are falling and become inadvertently over-generous; underestimate innovation potential in incumbent technologies, which necessitates longer-than-anticipated support for the renewable technology or, at worst, cease support before the new technology is sustainably cost-competitive. These blind-spots suggest that policymakers may incorporate more realistic representations of foreseeable changes in the competitive dynamics of industry and trade into transition planning. Ultimately, clean energy penetration intends to reduce absolute fossil-fuel consumption, which may trigger a more competitive response from affected suppliers than seen so far. This will be experienced as reductions in production costs due to demand clearing down the supply cost-curve and the supply cost-curve itself moving downwards. © 2018 The Authors","Energy policy; Energy transition; Technology transition","Competition; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Competitive dynamics; Competitive pressure; Economic prosperity; Energy transitions; Incumbent technology; Innovation potential; Renewable technology; Technology transition; Cost reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056877797

These factors impose a huge temporal and spatial variability of Eucalyptus growth, leading to growth gaps. Therefore, identifying Eucalyptus growth gaps (GG), their magnitudes and causes may be a powerful tool for establishing strategies to increase forest resiliency and productivity. In this context, the aims of this study were to determinate the Eucalyptus growth gaps by a multimodel approach for different production locations in Brazil and to identify their main causes, possible solutions and mitigation strategies. Three Eucalyptus simulation models (FAO, APSIM and 3PG), properly calibrated and validated, were used for simulating the potential and attainable growth. Actual growth data were obtained from 30 producing locations in Brazil from experimental plantations of the TECHS Project. The growth gaps at all locations in Midwest and Northeast regions of the country were predominantly caused by water deficit. In Southeast and North regions, the water deficit was the main cause of GG in 87% and 67% of the locations, respectively. On the other hand, in Southern Brazil, the sub-optimal forest management was the main cause of growth gap at all locations, since water deficit is very low in this region. In general, the water deficit represented the main cause of Eucalyptus growth gap in Brazil; therefore, the use of drought-tolerant genotypes, wider spacing, deeper subsoiling for heavy and cohesive soils, and soil conservation practices (such as maintaining harvest residue on site) for improving water infiltration and root growth are the main strategies to reduce this kind of gap. On the other hand, for reducing the growth gap caused by sub-optimal forest management, the main strategies are better nutrition management, use of high-quality seedlings (improved genetic materials and high nursery quality), and weed control, pests and diseases. In addition to these practices, better monitoring of forest fires, windstorms and waterlogging events by integrating climate, management and genetic strategies also could help to improve Eucalyptus productivity in Brazil. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Actual growth; Attainable growth; Forest modeling; Forestry management; Potential growth; Water deficit","Deforestation; Disease control; Location; Productivity; Soil conservation; Soils; Storms; Weed control; Eucalyptus plantations; Forest modeling; Forestry management; Optimal forest managements; Potential growth; Silvicultural practices; Temporal and spatial variability; Water deficits; Industrial management; environmental assessment; evergreen forest; forest management; forestry modeling; forestry production; gap dynamics; growth; plantation forestry; silviculture; water stress; Brazil; Deforestation; Eucalyptus; Forest Management; Growth; Productivity; Water; Weed Control; Brazil; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071629252

Over the same period emissions from shipping have also decreased, but with large differences depending on species and sea area. At sea, sulfur emissions in the SECAs (Sulphur Emission Control Areas) have decreased following the implementation of a 0.1% limit on sulfur in marine fuels from 2015. In Europe the North Sea and the Baltic Sea are designated as SECAs by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). Model calculations assuming present (2016) and future (2030) emissions have been made with the regional-scale EMEP model covering Europe and the sea areas surrounding Europe, including the North Atlantic east of 30°. The main focus in this paper is on the effects of ship emissions from the Baltic Sea. To reduce the influence of meteorological variability, all model calculations are presented as averages for 3 meteorological years (2014, 2015, 2016). For the Baltic Sea, model calculations have also been made with higher sulfur emissions representative of year 2014 emissions. From Baltic Sea shipping the largest effects are calculated for NO2 in air, accounting for more than 50% of the NO2 concentrations in central parts of the Baltic Sea. In coastal zones contributions to NO2 and also nitrogen depositions can be of the order of 20% in some regions. Smaller effects, up to 5 %10 %, are also seen for PM2.5 in coastal zones close to the main shipping lanes. Country-averaged contributions from ships are small for large countries that extend far inland like Germany and Poland, and larger for smaller countries like Denmark and the Baltic states Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, where ship emissions are among the largest contributors to concentrations and depositions of anthropogenic origin. Following the implementations of stricter SECA regulations, sulfur emissions from Baltic Sea shipping now have virtually no effects on PM2.5 concentrations and sulfur depositions in the Baltic Sea region. Adding to the expected reductions in air pollutants and depositions following the projected reductions in European emissions, we expect that the contributions from Baltic Sea shipping to NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations, and to depositions of nitrogen, will be reduced by 40 % 50% from 2016 to 2030 mainly as a result of the Baltic Sea being defined as a Nitrogen Emission Control Area from 2021. In most parts of the Baltic Sea region ozone levels are expected to decrease from 2016 to 2030. For the Baltic Sea shipping, titration, mainly in winter, and production, mainly in summer, partially compensate. As a result the effects of Baltic Sea shipping on ozone are similar in 2016 and 2030. © 2019 BMJ Publishing Group.

It generates around 75% of global emissions of ammonia to the atmosphere and soil fertilisation accounts for half of agricultural emissions. Ammonia emissions have a negative impact on ecosystems and human health, as it is able to accumulate both as solid particles and as an integral part of acid cases. Measures to reduce ammonia emissions can be divided into three large groups: the first group is ammonia-reducing measures in animal housing, the second group is ammonia-reducing measures during manure storage, and the third group is ammonia-reducing measures during the application of manure. Measurements of ammonia emissions were carried out in the parish of Jaunberze, which took place on 30 April and 1 May 2018. Sulphuric acid was used for acidification of pig slurry digestate. Picarro G2508 was used for on field measurement of ammonia concentrations with 1 second interval, a measurement time of one session was 400 seconds. The volume of the chamber was 60 l and was connected to the Picarro G2508 using a 10 m long Teflon tube. The measurement of ammonia emissions was with three repetitions for each measurement, with a reference error of less than 5%. Emissions were measured at different time intervals: immediately after digestate distribution, 2 hours, 4 hours and the 24 hours after digestate application. The emission of ammonia from digestate without vegetation after 24 hours was 13 kg ha-1, for acidified digestate without vegetation 8.5 kg ha -1, while the acidified digestate with vegetation within 24 hours reached 2.5 kg of ha -1 ammonia emissions, five times lower than that of non-vegetation. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH showed clear tidal variability with relatively higher values during high tide than low tide. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations varied over a narrow range (1.92–2.19 mM) with relatively higher values during low tide; reverse trend, however, was noticed for δ13CDIC with significant variability (– 4.28 to – 2.21‰). During low tide, along with estuarine mixing, preliminary evidences for influences of biogeochemical (such as organic carbon mineralization, sulfate reduction, and denitrification) and hydrological processes (porewater exchange) were found on DIC dynamics. The δ13CDIC - DIC relationship suggested respiration of marine plankton to be one of the possible sources for DIC. Dissolved organic carbon showed tidal influence during high tide with a signal of porewater mediated addition during low tide. Both particulate organic carbon and particulate nitrogen concentrations reached the maximum during low tide with stable isotopic compositions showing predominantly marine signature along with the possibility of biogeochemical modifications within the estuary.

Unique opportunities for mitigation are presented by point-source emitters—surface features or infrastructure components that are typically less than 10 metres in diameter and emit plumes of highly concentrated methane3. However, data on point-source emissions are sparse and typically lack sufficient spatial and temporal resolution to guide their mitigation and to accurately assess their magnitude4. Here we survey more than 272,000 infrastructure elements in California using an airborne imaging spectrometer that can rapidly map methane plumes5–7. We conduct five campaigns over several months from 2016 to 2018, spanning the oil and gas, manure-management and waste-management sectors, resulting in the detection, geolocation and quantification of emissions from 564 strong methane point sources. Our remote sensing approach enables the rapid and repeated assessment of large areas at high spatial resolution for a poorly characterized population of methane emitters that often appear intermittently and stochastically. We estimate net methane point-source emissions in California to be 0.618 teragrams per year (95 per cent confidence interval 0.523–0.725), equivalent to 34–46 per cent of the state’s methane inventory8 for 2016. Methane ‘super-emitter’ activity occurs in every sector surveyed, with 10 per cent of point sources contributing roughly 60 per cent of point-source emissions—consistent with a study of the US Four Corners region that had a different sectoral mix9. The largest methane emitters in California are a subset of landfills, which exhibit persistent anomalous activity. Methane point-source emissions in California are dominated by landfills (41 per cent), followed by dairies (26 per cent) and the oil and gas sector (26 per cent). Our data have enabled the identification of the 0.2 per cent of California’s infrastructure that is responsible for these emissions. Sharing these data with collaborating infrastructure operators has led to the mitigation of anomalous methane-emission activity10. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"methane; oil; methane; natural gas; petroleum; anthropogenic source; confidence interval; emission control; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; industrial emission; infrastructure; landfill; methane; mitigation; point source pollution; quantitative analysis; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; absorption spectroscopy; Article; bootstrapping; calibration; California; follow up; gas; geographic information system; landfill; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; measurement accuracy; prediction; priority journal; reliability; sample size; signal noise ratio; solid waste management; stochastic model; waste water treatment plant; chemistry; environmental monitoring; greenhouse effect; manure; metabolism; oil industry; procedures; waste management; wastewater; California; United States; California; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Manure; Methane; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Industry; Petroleum; Waste Management; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074438238

In that sense hierarchical optimization procedure was carried out which enables application of different criteria, i.e. it was possible to set different goal functions. Special attention was put on the CO2 emissions. In order to quantify the social impact of different generation plants, CO2 emission cost was analysed in different scenarios. Moreover, economic analysis was based not only on operation expenditures but also on the capital investments. Different technologies were analysed, biomass-based cogenerations (wastewater sludge), fossil fuel-based cogenerations (in combination with gas engine and gas turbine), heat pumps, electric boilers and fossil fuel boilers. In order to determine optimal generation set-up simulation was carried out for a case of the City of Zagreb, Croatia. The simulation period was one year. It is shown that it is yet possible to achieve significant benefits with appropriate selection of generation mix, particularly in the context of CO2 reduction. Heat pumps together with biomass-based cogeneration technologies have shown the best potential for their utilisation in future energy system. © 2019, Strojarski Facultet.

Plant-soil feedbacks in terrestrial ecology are well-documented, but the strength and direction of feedbacks as influenced by abiotic environmental factors, such as temperature and soil moisture, has not been fully explored. In our study, we examined plant-soil feedback responses of both cool- and warm-season native and non-native grasses to elevated temperatures (ambient and +5°C) and soil moisture (100 and 75% field capacity). In a previous experiment, grasses were grown under temperature and soil moisture conditions similar to our current study. The resultant trained soil communities served as the inoculum sources for our current experiment. We found that consistent training and experimental temperatures resulted in negative PSF, where plants produced greater biomass in soils conditioned by heterospecifics. However, the direction of PSF was reversed when training and experimental conditions were mismatched. That is, when training and experimental temperatures mirrored one another, negative PSF occurred, suggesting coexistence between the two species is likely under these conditions. However, when only training or testing temperatures were elevated, positive PSF were detected, favoring the non-native species. These alterations in plant-soil feedbacks were relatively consistent across pairings of warm- and cool-season grasses. Overall, our results indicate inconsistent year-to-year environmental conditions, such as extreme temperatures, may undermine the stabilizing forces of negative PSF and favor of non-native grasses. © Copyright © 2019 Duell, Zaiger, Bever and Wilson.","Bothriochloa ischaemum; Bromus inermis; climate; invasive species; Pascopyrum smithii; plant-soil feedback; Schizachyrium scoparium; soil training",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075359641

The reactions were carried out in the ball-milled mixtures subjected to Spark Plasma Sintering at 900 °C. The products of the reactions were composites containing TiC or TiB2 nanoparticles distributed in the copper matrix. The in-situ synthesized TiC and TiB2 nanoparticles were extremely fine (10-20 nm). The distribution pattern of the particles in the matrix was similar in the TiC-Cu and TiB2-Cu systems: composite regions were intermixed with copper regions free from the ceramic particles. It was shown that, when the Ti25Cu75 alloy was melted first by heating up to 900 °C and then forced to interact with carbon, TiC particles two orders of magnitude larger in size grew in the copper matrix. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Binary alloys; Carbon; Ceramic matrix composites; Melt spinning; Metallic matrix composites; Mixtures; Nanoparticles; Particle reinforced composites; Spark plasma sintering; Synthesis (chemical); Titanium alloys; Titanium carbide; Ball-milled mixtures; Ceramic particle; Composite regions; Copper matrix composite; Distribution patterns; In-situ synthesized; Orders of magnitude; Structural evolution; Copper alloys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078233186

In this study, two different electrolyzer configurations, flow-through and flow-by modes, were analyzed for the production of carbon monoxide to resolve the CO2 mass-transfer limitation problem at high current densities in gas diffusion electrodes. These two configurations respectively state convective and diffusive flow inside the gas diffusion layer, and their effect was studied on the cathodic performance of the electrolyzer by varying the operating conditions: cathodic potential, electrocatalyst loading, and Nafion content. In flow-through configuration, a current density of 220 mA/cm2 could be achieved at a faradaic efficiency of 90 %; whereas, in the flow-by configuration, the current density was at the same faradaic efficiency limited to 140 mA/cm2. However, the flow-through configuration has a few limitations, such as lower energy efficiency, owing to the higher ohmic drop and the faster deactivation caused by crystallization of electrolyte salts inside the gas diffusion electrode. Therefore, flow-by mode is currently the most adequate configuration for the long-term operation of electrolyzers for the reduction of CO2 to CO. This study represents an essential step toward the application of electrolyzers for the electroreduction of CO2. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

We apply the approach to a nationally representative survey of 88,404 new car buyers that includes respondents’ geographic, demographic and psychographic characteristics. We find that BEVs have the potential to reach an annual U.S. market share of 2.4%. To achieve this, BEVs with added features must be sold at a lower price. The costs of the improved features combined with the eventual removal of purchase subsidies will offset the forecasted declines in battery costs.

We found that both moderate and strong chilling treatments advanced budburst and reduced forcing requirements, relative to plants subjected to a low chilling treatment. Longer photoperiod enhanced budburst rate for only two species, suggesting that chilling is more important for regulating budburst for most species. With respect to future climate change, the spring phenology of subtropical species is expected to be delayed further because species could lack the ability to meet their fundamental chilling requirement. These results have important implications for the conservation and management of tropical and subtropical plant populations under future climate change scenarios. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Budburst; Chilling; Climate change; Evergreen species; Phenology; Twig cutting experiment","budburst; climate change; cold tolerance; conservation management; evergreen tree; experimental study; phenology; photoperiod; subtropical region; temperate environment; tropical region; woody plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070228126

Here we investigated the following: (a) do changes in plant diversity affect leaf-out and flowering dates for woody species; (b) which group of variables are more important in influencing leaf-out and flowering dates, abiotic variables (soil variables) or biotic variables (plant diversity)?. Study site: A subtropical forest in the Biodiversity–Ecosystem Functioning Experiment of China, located in Jiangxi Province, China. Methods: Species were planted in various combinations to create plots with varying tree richness: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 or 24 species. We monitored leaf-out and flowering dates of eight randomly selected species in 17 plots in 2018. A linear model was used to test whether species diversity was a predictor of leaf-out/flowering times for each species. We then fit linear mixed-effects models to assess the combined influence of species diversity, soil Total Carbon and Total Nitrogen on the overall community. Results: In the low-diversity plots, we found two species leafing out earlier, one leafing out later and four showing no significant difference. Leaf-out date advanced an average of 0.3 days per species lost. Of all the biotic and abiotic predictor variables, Total Nitrogen was the only one significantly correlated with leaf-out date. No significant correlation was found between species diversity and flowering date for any of the species. Conclusions: Our study provides the first empirical evidence concerning the effects of biodiversity loss on plant spring phenology for woody species. Our findings illustrate that fluctuation in plant diversity could alter the timing of leaf-out and that abiotic variables may be more important than biotic variables in determining leaf-out dates in subtropical forest. Overall, declining diversity may exacerbate the phenological changes attributed to rising global temperatures. © 2019 International Association for Vegetation Science","BEF-China; biodiversity–ecosystem functioning; flowering; leaf-out; species interactions; species loss; spring phenology; Total Carbon; Total Nitrogen","biodiversity; climate change; condition factor; ecosystem function; environmental factor; flowering; phenology; species diversity; spring (hydrology); subtropical region; woody plant; China; Jiangxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073775456

Over geologic time, the negative feedback between temperature and chemical weathering rates contributes to the regulation of Earth climate. The challenge of understanding weathering rates and the resulting evolution of critical zone structures lies in complicated interactions and feedbacks among environmental variables, local ecohydrologic processes, and soil thickness, the relative importance of which remains unresolved. We investigate these interactions using a reactive-transport kinetics model, focusing on a low-relief, wetland-dominated karst landscape (Big Cypress National Preserve, South Florida, USA) as a case study. Across a broad range of environmental variables, model simulations highlight primary controls of climate and soil biological respiration, where soil thickness both supplies and limits transport of biologically derived acidity. Consequently, the weathering rate maximum occurs at intermediate soil thickness. The value of the maximum weathering rate and the precise soil thickness at which it occurs depend on several environmental variables, including precipitation regime, soil inundation, vegetation characteristics, and rate of groundwater drainage. Simulations for environmental conditions specific to Big Cypress suggest that wetland depressions in this landscape began to form around beginning of the Holocene with gradual dissolution of limestone bedrock and attendant soil development, highlighting large influence of age-varying soil thickness on weathering rates and consequent landscape development. While climatic variables are often considered most important for chemical weathering, our results indicate that soil thickness and biotic activity are equally important. Weathering rates reflect complex interactions among soil thickness, climate, and local hydrologic and biotic processes, which jointly shape the supply and delivery of chemical reactants, and the resulting trajectories of critical zone and karst landscape development. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Chemical weathering; Critical zone; Feedbacks; Patterned landscape","Bioinformatics; Climate models; Earth (planet); Environmental microbiology; Erosion; Feedback; Geochemistry; Groundwater; Lime; Limestone; Soils; Wetlands; Chemical weathering; Critical zones; Environmental conditions; Environmental variables; Formation and evolutions; Landscape development; Patterned landscape; Precipitation regimes; Weathering; chemical weathering; computer simulation; ecohydrology; feedback mechanism; karstification; limestone; numerical model; Big Cypress National Preserve; Florida [United States]; United States; Cupressus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047254862

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to find how to effectively reduce CEI. At the national level, we investigate the influencing factors of CEI by using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method (LMDI). Then, this study examines the sensitivity of CEI change to various factors. At the regional level, we study the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the influencing factors through Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regress (GTWR). The main results are as follows. (1) At the national level, the positive contribution of the energy mix is the largest. The energy intensity of the production sector is the main negative driving factor in the early stage, and in the later stage, the principal negative contribution comes from the combined action of the CO2 emission coefficient and economic structure. (2) A dynamic change is observed in the sensitivity of CEI to various factors. (3) At the regional level, various determinants of CEI show spatial-temporal heterogeneity based on GTWR. For example, in analysing the impact of energy intensity in the industrial sector on CEI in various regions, Shandong Province has the largest coefficient.

This housing stock is a major target for retrofitting given its characteristic poor thermal performance and inefficient control of energy consumption. This article proposes a method for analysing the dynamic capacity of thermal enclosures on moderate energy flows in building stock in climate change scenarios, estimating the potential for adaptation and strengths and weaknesses of several building categories exposed to different present and future climate scenarios. A pilot study applying the procedure is carried out in the city of Seville, one of the largest in southern Europe, with a representative northern Mediterranean climate. The approach designed is equally applicable to other urban centres in southern Europe. Although indoor comfort in cold weather must be addressed even in the least favourable future scenarios, the predominant concern for this stock is controlling heat gain. This study shows how, regardless of individual situations, thermal insulation alone does not guarantee an optimal response for the stock as a whole. Different categories can be identified within a given stock, where some buildings display significant resilience and potential for adaptation to new scenarios, while others have less scope for improvement. These conclusions can provide guidelines for the design of future intervention policies in southern Europe. © 2019","Climatic change; Energy demand; Monitoring; Simulation; Social housing; Southern Europe","Energy utilization; Housing; Military operations; Monitoring; Thermal insulation; Climatic changes; Energy demands; Simulation; Social housing; Southern Europe; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070663011

Plant survival strategies are usually characterized by morphological and physiological adaptations, while their underlying anatomical settings are largely unknown. Woody angiosperms and herbaceous dicots have repeatedly evolved small water transporting conduits and large storage parenchyma tissues at colder or drier places to cope with freezing- and drought-induced damages. However, whether these adaptations are also valid for graminoids remains unclear. Here we show that stem anatomical variations in grasses, sedges and rushes dominating in western Himalayan grasslands are driven by elevation and soil moisture via control over aboveground plant stature and belowground clonal growth, while phylogenetic constraints have only a weak effect. Phylogenetic comparative analyses controlling for confounding factors showed that the elevation-related cooling controls the conductive system through reduced vessel diameter and extended assimilatory and storage tissues with more chlorenchyma and less sclerenchyma around vessels. The soil moisture deficit, on the other hand, determines stabilization structures by promoting short-rhizomatous turf graminoids with hollow stems, thicker epidermis and deep adventitious roots in dry steppes and semi-deserts. Saline wetlands and moist alpine pastures promote long-rhizomatous short-stature plants with lower need for mechanical support (absence of hollow stem) and exposure to high evaporative forcing (thinner epidermis). Observed trends of decreasing vessel sizes and lignification rate with elevation supports the existing knowledge that narrower vessels and extensive parenchyma assist plants to grow in cold environments by avoiding freezing-induced cavitation. Our results bring novel information on ecological drivers influencing the evolution of anatomical adaptations in high mountain graminoids. Distinct grassland types, covering elevations from 2650 to 6150 m, harbor unrelated species with different evolutionary histories that have converged towards similar anatomical structures. © 2019 The Authors","comparative plant anatomy; evolutionary inertia; gradient analysis; grasses; Himalaya; parenchyma cells; phylogeny; sclerenchyma; vessels","aboveground biomass; anatomy; cell; comparative study; drought stress; evolutionary theory; grassland; local adaptation; phylogeny; sedge; soil moisture; survival; Himalayas; Carex; Dicotyledoneae; Juncus; Magnoliophyta; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068641910

However, understanding the spatial spillover effects of carbon emissions will help the government achieve this goal. This paper selects the carbon-emission intensity panel data of 11 provinces in the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2004 to 2016. Then, this paper uses the Global Moran’s I to explore the spatial distribution characteristics and spatial correlation of carbon emission intensity. Furthermore, this paper constructs a spatial econometric model to empirically test the driving path and spillover effects of relevant factors. The results show that there is a significant positive correlation with the provincial carbon intensity in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, but this trend is weakening. The provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai are High–High agglomerations, while the provinces of Yunnan and Guizhou are Low–Low agglomerations. Economic development, technological innovation, and foreign direct investion (FDI) have positive effects on the reduction of carbon emissions, while industrialization has a negative effect on it. There is also a significant positive spatial spillover effect of the industrialization level and technological innovation level. The spatial spillover effects of FDI and economic development on carbon emission intensity fail to pass a significance test. Therefore, it is necessary to promote cross-regional low-carbon development, accelerate the R&D of energy-saving and emission-reduction technologies, actively enhance the transformation and upgrade industrial structures, and optimize the opening up of the region and the patterns of industrial transfer. © 2019 by the authors.

As China's first ecological civilization demonstration zone, Fujian Province has also promulgated an array of carbon emission trading policies. Therefore, deeply analyzing the classification of carbon emission trading policies in Fujian Province is of great reference value for other regions to formulate carbon emission trading policies. This paper first introduces the textual formulation of the carbon emission trading policies in Fujian Province, and subdivides the relevant policies into 17 types of policy instruments as per the classification criteria of mandatory, hybrid, and voluntary. Besides, it also classifies and codes the instruments involved in the Fujian provincial carbon emission trading policies using social network analysis method, with a total of 107 social network actors obtained. On this basis, the differences in the composition of various policy instruments are to be compared and analyzed. The Results show that the proportions of mandatory policy instruments, hybrid policy instruments, and voluntary policy instruments are 54.20%, 36.45%, and 9.35%, respectively. The policy instruments used by the Fujian provincial government are dominated by mandatory and hybrid policy instruments, and the voluntary policy instruments account for a relatively low proportion. Currently, what the Fujian government's carbon emissions trading policies focus on is to improve the supervision and accountability mechanism so as to form a complete carbon emission trading supervision and management system. In the process of building a carbon emissions trading market, the government of Fujian Province should strengthen policy support for talent cultivation, carbon credit evaluation system construction, and policies support for projects in finance, and reinforce the construction of voluntary certification emission reduction mechanism in a timely manner, with a view to encouraging the participation of social forces in the construction of the carbon emissions trading market. © 2019 The Authors","Carbon emission permit; Carbon emissions trading; Policy instruments; Social network analysis","Carbon; Commerce; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Social networking (online); Carbon emission permits; Carbon emission trading; Carbon emissions; Classification criterion; Emission reduction mechanisms; Policy instruments; Talent cultivations; Voluntary certification; Public policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074155062

The gasification tests were operated in a fixed bed reactor under steam and/or carbon dioxide at three different temperatures (950 °C, 1000 °C and 1050 °C), in order to investigate the experimental conditions of three samples at different particle size. The gasification of char conversion at different temperatures is found to be dependent on gasifying agent, nature of the sample, and can be explained by the Arrhenius equation, thus suggesting the use of three different models: Volume Reaction Model (VRM), Random Pore Model (RPM), and Shrinking Core Model (SCM) in order to interpret the carbon conversion data and to determine the kinetics parameters. From the results obtained, temperature has a positive effect on the kinetic conversion. Further, the gasification under mixed atmosphere of steam and carbon dioxide showed that the reactivity of the different chars depends on the increase of steam concentration in the mixture. The gasifying char types has some effects in the determination of the kinetic parameters (activation energies obtained ranged between 110 and 126 kJ/mol for peanut shell, 104–125 kJ/mol for the cashew shell and 116–150 kJ/mol for the palm shell). By using different models, the experimental results shows that the kinetics reaction of the cashew shells char, and peanuts shells char, are faster than those from palm shells char. At the same time, results showed that the char-steam reactivity, char - CO2 reactivity and their mixture (char-steam and char - CO2) are different. The experimental measurements also show the influence of temperature on the Lower Heating Values (LHV) of the gas.

New dynamics are occurring with cities becoming vectors of sustainable development, through initiatives like the Covenant of Mayors. Innovative approaches and tools are required to support city development planning in compliance with climate change mitigation goals. City planning and management are typically addressed through a fragmented and silo approach, failing to capture the dynamics and complexity of a city energy system. Integrated energy system modelling tools are progressively incorporating increasing realism to enhance results quality and confidence. This paper demonstrates the effects of including household budget constraints in integrated energy system optimisation modelling on low carbon city pathways. The TIMES_EVORA model was used to characterize current and future city energy system, covering all its chain, from energy supply sectors (e.g. electricity production) to end use sectors (e.g. residential and transport). Optimal solutions for meeting Évora municipality (Portugal) 2030 greenhouse gases emissions targets were assessed, combining household budget constraints for the acquisition of more efficient technologies – from appliances to private vehicles. The results showed a decrease of hybrid vehicles ownership in 2030 and a consequent increase of diesel vehicles. The optimal model solution shows a persistence in the acquisition of highly efficient households' appliances and the deployment of additional PV systems to facilitate a reduction of the electricity generation CO2 footprint. This allows to offset the transport CO2 emission increase and provide benefits across all energy system. Improving the integration of behavioural or real-life aspects in energy system optimisation models allows further understanding of city energy systems dynamics and provide robust city decarbonization strategies design. Cities sustainable energy system and urban planning should include different agent's investment constraints in order to avoid technology deployment locking that can compromise cities sustainable pathways. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","City energy system; Household budget constraints; Integrated energy model; Portugal; Scenarios analysis","Budget control; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Dynamics; Economics; Electric power generation; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Locks (fasteners); Optimization; Planning; Urban growth; Budget constraint; Energy model; Energy systems; Portugal; Scenarios analysis; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070241412

These two strategies use different carbon sources and reside within different ecological niches for microbial aggregation, which were hypothesized to show distinct microbial structures and metabolic fitness. We surveyed three floc reactors and three biofilm reactors for denitrification and determined if there were distinct microbial aggregations. Multiple molecular omics approaches were used to determine the microbial community composition, co-occurrence network and metabolic pathways. Proteobacteria was the dominating and most active phylum among all samples. Carbon source played an important role in shaping the microbial community composition while the distribution of functional protein was largely influenced by salinity. We found that the topological network features had different ecological patterns and that the microorganisms in the biofilm reactors had more nodes but less interactions than those in floc reactors. The large niche differences in the biofilm reactors explained the observed high microbial diversity, functional redundancy and resulting high system stability. We also observed a lower proportion of denitrifiers and higher resistance to oxygen and salinity perturbation in the biofilm reactors than the floc reactors. Our findings support our hypothesis that niche differences caused a distinct microbial structure and increased microbial ecology distribution, which has the potential to improve system efficiency and stability. © 2019 The Authors","Denitrification; Microbial aggregation; Multi-omics; Network; Niche difference","Biofilms; Bioreactors; Carbon; Denitrification; Metabolism; Microorganisms; Networks (circuits); System stability; Wastewater treatment; Co-occurrence networks; Different carbon sources; Functional redundancy; Heterotrophic denitrification; Microbial community composition; Multi-omics; Niche difference; Topological networks; Ecology; aggregation behavior; biofilm; community composition; denitrification; fitness; niche; wastewater treatment; Article; carbon source; denitrification; ecological niche; flocculent sludge; microbial activity; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; omics; phylum; priority journal; protein function; protein localization; Proteobacteria; salinity; waste water management; Proteobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070375404

Over the last half-century, some reef communities have been disappearing at an alarming pace. This study focuses on the Gulf of Mexico, where the majority of shallow coral reefs are reported to be in poor or fair condition. We analyze the RCP8.5 ensemble of the Community Earth System Model v1.2 to identify monthly-to-decadal trends in Gulf of Mexico SST. Secondly, we examine projected changes in ocean pH, carbonate saturation state, and salinity in the same coupled model simulations. We find that the joint impacts of predicted higher temperatures and changes in ocean acidification will severely degrade Gulf of Mexico reef systems by the end of the twenty-first century. SSTs are likely to warm by 2.5–3°C; while corals do show signs of an ability to adapt toward higher temperatures, current coral species and reef systems are likely to suffer major bleaching events in coming years. We contextualize future changes with ancient reefs from paleoclimate analogs, periods of Earth's past that were also exceptionally warm, specifically rapid “hyperthermal” events. Ancient analog events are often associated with extinctions, reef collapse, and significant ecological changes, yet reef communities managed to survive these events on evolutionary timescales. Finally, we review research which discusses the adaptive potential of the Gulf of Mexico's coral reefs, meccas of biodiversity and oceanic health. We assert that the only guaranteed solution for long-term conservation and recovery is substantial, rapid reduction of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. © Copyright © 2019 Dee, Torres, Martindale, Weiss and DeLong.","adaptation; climate change; coral bleaching; coral reefs; hot-house paleoclimates; ocean acidification",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076712276

Regions of the Mediterranean Basin and North America (i.e. Canada) produce about 60% of world durum wheat production, mainly used for human consumption as pasta, bulgur, couscous and some breads. In general durum wheat is better adapted to high temperatures and to semiarid climates than bread wheat. In spite of its relatively high adaptability to the marginal and drought environments, the production of durum wheat is threatened by the impacts of climate change, and the need for more sustainable development. This chapter provides an update on progress in genetic improvement of durum wheat and on the tools and strategies to maintain productivity and strengthen food security despite increasing water scarcity, higher temperatures, and the emergence of new pests and diseases. These demand changes in the approaches to crop improvement and require implementing novel approaches in gene discovery and plant breeding. Conventional and modern breeding strategies are discussed to integrate new target traits into varieties. Modelling provides a rational approach to identify desirable traits or combination of traits potentially leading to the specification of wheat ideotypes optimized for target environmental and future climatic conditions.

Ionization through electron impact is a fundamental process associated with the evolution of the ionic structure and emissivity of astrophysical plasmas. Over several decades substantial efforts have been made to measure and calculate the ionization cross sections of ionization through electron impact of different ions shell by shell, in particular, of carbon ions. Spectral emission codes use electron-impact ionization cross sections and/or rates taken from different experimental and theoretical sources. The theoretical cross sections are determined numerically and include a diversity of quantum mechanical methods. The electron-impact ionization database therefore is not uniform in the methods, which makes it hard to determine the reason for the deviations with regard to experimental data. In many cases only total ionization rates for Maxwell-Boltzmann plasmas are available, which makes calculating inner-shell ionization in collisional-radiative models using thermal and nonthermal electron distribution functions difficult. A solution of this problem is the capability of generating the cross sections with an analytical method using the minimum number of atomic parameters. In this way, uniformity in the database is guaranteed, and thus deviations from experiments are easily identified and traced to the root of the method. Aims. The modified relativistic binary encounter Bethe (MRBEB) method is such a simple analytical scheme based on one atomic parameter that allows determining electron-impact ionization cross sections. This work aims the determination of K- and L-shell cross sections of the carbon atom and ions using the MRBEB method and show their quality by: (i) comparing them with those obtained with the general ionization processes in the presence of electrons and radiation (GIPPER) code and the flexible atomic code (FAC), and (ii) determining their effects on the ionic structure and cooling of an optically thin plasma. Methods. The MRBEB method was used to calculate the inner-shells cross sections, while the plasma calculations were carried out with the collisional+photo ionization plasma emission software (CPIPES). The mathematical methods used in this work comprise a modified version of the double-exponential over a semi-finite interval method for numerical integrations, Gauss-elimination method with scaled partial pivoting for the solution of systems of linear equations, and an iterative least-squares method to determine the fits of ionization cross sections. Results. The three sets of cross sections show deviations among each other in different energy regions. The largest deviations occur near and in the peak maximum. Ion fractions and plasma emissivities of an optically thin plasma that evolves under collisional ionization equilibrium, derived using each set of cross sections, show deviations that decrease with increase in temperature and ionization degree. In spite of these differences, the calculations using the three sets of cross sections agree overall. Conclusions.

In this work, the community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model was used to evaluate the efficacy of emission control strategies in MASP, considering the spatial and temporal variability of fine particle concentration. Seven different emission scenarios were modeled to assess the relationship between the emission of precursors and ambient aerosol concentration, including a baseline emission inventory, and six sensitivity scenarios with emission reductions in relation to the baseline inventory: a 50% reduction in SO2 emissions; no SO2 emissions; a 50% reduction in SO2, NOx, and NH3 emissions; no sulfate (PSO4) particle emissions; no PSO4 and nitrate (PNO3) particle emissions; and no PNO3 emissions. Results show that ambient PM2.5 behavior is not linearly dependent on the emission of precursors. Variation levels in PM2.5 concentrations did not correspond to the reduction ratios applied to precursor emissions, mainly due to the contribution of organic and elemental carbon, and other secondary organic aerosol species. Reductions in SO2 emissions are less likely to be effective at reducing PM2.5 concentrations at the expected rate in many locations of the MASP. The largest reduction in ambient PM2.5 was obtained with the scenario that considered a reduction in 50% of SO2, NOx, and NH3 emissions (1 to 2 μg/m3 on average). It highlights the importance of considering the role of secondary organic aerosols and black carbon in the design of effective policies for ambient PM2.5 concentration control. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air quality modeling; Atmospheric chemistry; CMAQ; Emission control; Fine particles","aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; metropolitan area; particulate matter; pollution control; pollution policy; strategic approach; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; carbon; nitrogen oxide; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; Brazil; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; legislation and jurisprudence; particulate matter; prevention and control; procedures; soot; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Brazil; Carbon; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Policy; Nitrogen Oxides; Particulate Matter; Soot",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073960457

City networks of late have transcended beyond municipal collaborations towards more complex networked governance arrangements. City networks are noted also to raise the level of ambition among cities learning from and competing with each other with regard to the deployment of low-carbon technologies and policies. Over the last two decades, at least nine urban climate networks have been established around the world. This article consolidates the academic literature on C40 within the context of three key themes that are drawn upon from earlier work of Davidson et al. with the goal of drawing out the key implications of researching, and putting into practice, urban studies in an age of increasingly networked urban governance and the role of city networks. We conclude the paper with articulating a new research agenda that places a focus on the effects of city networks on institutional relevance of traditional planning in ways that have not yet been considered in practice and scholarship. We argue a key challenge is to align and potentially synthesise these traditional and new forms of city shaping in an urban age era of rapidly unfolding endangerment. © 2019 Durham University and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076780335

An effective and economical waste management can be achieved by using waste to energy (WtE) technologies to manage residual wastes and produce energy. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of the WtE technologies for energy recovery and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction in NSW. In this study, major streams of wastes (municipal solid waste, commercial & industrial waste, construction & demolition waste) in NSW were classified into combustible, non-combustible and food organic waste. Four waste management scenarios using different combinations of WtE technologies, such as landfilling with energy recovery, incineration and anaerobic digestion (AD) were applied to evaluate electricity generation and GHG emission potentials from all these wastes. The results indicated that by employing a combination of incineration and AD for combustible and food parts of residual waste in NSW about 4165 GWh of electricity could be generated annually, which is equivalent to about 5.9% of the total electricity generation in NSW. This conversion of WtE leads to a reduction of about 1.7 million tonnes of GHG emissions annually. In this way, about 3 million tonnes of residual waste could be diverted from landfills in NSW annually which would offer approximately 50% reduction in landfilled waste by weight. Findings of the study showed that employing incineration and AD technologies could exploit a considerable amount of energy from residual waste and mitigate GHG emissions. Furthermore, employing efficient WtE technologies would divert organic waste out of landfills, avoiding emissions from landfills and will contribute to a greater share of renewable energy production, thereby reducing emissions from fossil fuel power plants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Incineration; LCA; Municipal solid waste; Sustainable waste management; Waste to energy","Anaerobic digestion; Demolition; Electric power generation; Emission control; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Land fill; Municipal solid waste; Electricity generation; Management scenarios; New South Wales , Australia; Reducing emissions; Renewable energies; Sustainable waste management; Waste to energy; Waste to energy technologies; Waste incineration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072264199

In this work, a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis of combustion in diesel engine is performed for 100% load, and the effects of porous media addition in the combustion chamber are quantified. With a porosity of 66.7%, silicon carbide is applied as porous media of cylindrical shape in the modified piston bowl in the conventional engine. The combustion analysis outputs include average cylinder-pressure, temperature; Nitrogen Oxides (NOX), mean mixture fraction, turbulent kinetic energy, total energy and modified Peclet number. The results of the CFD study for the cases of non-porous media are validated against the performed baseline experimental analysis, whereas porous media predictions are compared to the state-of-the-art studies available in the literature. In presence of porous media, the average peak pressure and temperature are found to drop by ∼26 bar and ∼550 K, respectively, as compared to that of non-porous media. Furthermore, NOX emissions are significantly reduced up to 97%.

This was Brazil's longest trucker strike, and within a few days, gas stations ran out of fuel, drivers waited in line for hours to fuel their cars, transport was severely affected, and airports began cancelling flights. In Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in Brazil, Air Quality Indexes (AQI) during the strike showed that the high ozone concentrations, determined in three monitoring stations (Irajá, Bangu and Campo Grande), led to “Moderate” and “Unhealthy” AQI in spite of reduced primary pollutant concentrations: nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2), particulate matter with a diameter &lt; 10 μm, carbon monoxide (CO) and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC). In this work, the causes of the high ozone concentrations were analyzed. Criteria pollutant concentrations, as well as meteorological parameters, were compiled for the interval of May 14th to June 6th, 2018. The NMHC/NOx and NO2/NO ratios indicated that the most likely cause of the high ozone levels was the reduced NOx concentrations under VOC-limited conditions (where VOC stands for volatile organic compounds). VOC speciation also showed that the vehicular fleet composition was altered during the strike. Considering that the legislation regarding emissions and air quality standards is being revised in Brazil and other countries, these results show that the control and speciation of VOC emissions is a desirable strategy, while NOx-focused strategies to reduce O3 in VOC-limited areas should be evaluated carefully. © 2019 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Criteria pollutants; Emission reduction; Ozone concentrations; Truck driver strike; VOC-Limited conditions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072527212

Tropical karst landscape can store organic carbon derived from forest ecosystem biomass that covers this karst landscape. While inorganic carbon stocks in tropical karst landscape are stored on carbonate rock (CaCO3). This potential can be calculated to identify the economic carbon value to support carbon trade program in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. This research aims to (1) identify carbon stocks value from organic and inorganic carbon in the study area; (2) calculate economic carbon value in the study area. Organic carbon stocks were measured using field measurement to calculate aboveground, belowground, and litter biomass. Calculation of aboveground, belowground, and litter biomass was measured based on the standard method in SNI 7724: 2011. X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) method was used to identify the CaO concentration in carbonate rock. This CaO concentration was measured to calculate carbon (C) concentration in carbonate rock formation namely inorganic carbon stocks. Economic carbon value was calculated using cost-benefit transfer method. Biduk-Biduk Karst Region has a big value of organic carbon stocks of 0.007 Pg-C and inorganic carbon stocks of 9.02 Pg-C. Therefore, the total carbon stock in Biduk-Biduk Karst Region is 9.037 Pg-C.

The study of pattern, magnitude, and environmental controls of CH4 emissions are still insufficient due to limited measurements and understand of underlying drivers for variations of CH4 fluxes at different temporal scales. In this study, CH4 fluxes from a rice-wheat rotation agroecosystem in eastern China were continuously measured using the eddy covariance technique. The diurnal and seasonal variations of CH4 flux and potential controlling factors in 2016 were analyzed using wavelet coherence, conditional Granger causality, correlation analysis and path analysis methods. CH4 fluxes showed distinguishable diurnal variations with single peaks during 13: 00–16: 00 local time. At the diurnal timescale, gross primary productivity (GPP) regulates CH4 fluxes after accounting for the effects of latent heat flux (LE), air temperature (TA), and soil temperature (TS) on CH4 fluxes. LE mirrored the diurnal pattern of CH4 fluxes when the effects of TA and TS on CH4 fluxes were considered. Daily CH4 fluxes exhibited large seasonal variations, with the largest daily CH4 flux of 1191.78 mg C-CH4 m−2 d−1 on 29 July 2016. The daily CH4 fluxes were continuously low in the growing season of wheat, and sharply increased from very low values in late June to peaks in late July and early August, and then gradually decreased to low values at the end of the rice growing season in late November and early December. Correlation analysis and path analysis showed that seasonal variations of soil temperature, air temperature, and GPP had strong effects on daily CH4 fluxes during pre-panicle initiation of the rice growing season, while soil temperature and leaf area index (LAI) had very strong effects on daily CH4 fluxes during the post-panicle initiation stage.

A consensus prevails on a causal relationship between distance to the city center and emissions from private transport, which has led to an emphasis on density in urban planning. However, several studies have reported a reverse association between the level of urbanity and emissions from long-distance leisure travel. Studies have also suggested that pro-environmental attitudes and climate change concerns are unrelated or positively related to emissions from long-distance travel. The goals of this case study were to find out the structure, levels, distribution, and predictors of GHG emissions from the local, domestic, and international travel of young adults of the Reykjavik Capital Region. A life cycle assessment (LCA) approach was utilized to calculate emissions, and the materials were collected with a map-based online survey. International leisure travel dominated the overall GHG emissions from personal travel regardless of residential location, modality style, or income level. A highly unequal distribution of emissions was found. A higher climate change awareness was found to predict higher GHG emissions from trips abroad. Emissions from leisure travel abroad were the highest in the city center, which was related to cosmopolitan attitudes among downtown dwellers. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change concern; Domestic travel; Greenhouse gas emissions; International travel; Local travel; Modality style; Pro-environmental attitude; Transport; Urban planning","climate change; greenhouse gas; leisure industry; life cycle analysis; public attitude; questionnaire survey; traffic emission; urban planning; urban population; urban transport; Iceland; Reykjavik",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075907804

However, questions remain regarding the state of the climate during the LIG in the North Atlantic, a region that is extremely sensitive to changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation. Here, we present hydrogen and carbon isotope (δD and δ13C) records from a suite of plant wax biomarkers preserved in Holocene and LIG lacustrine sediments from the North Atlantic Faroe Islands and interpret them as qualitative proxies for temperature and hydroclimate variability. These data are used to directly compare LIG and Holocene climate using the same proxy approaches from the same terrestrial location. Measuring multiple isotopes on multiple types of waxes elucidates the sources of homologous plant waxes. We deduce that the δD values of long-chain n-alkanes (C27–C33) and mid-chain n-alkanes (C23–C25) in these sedimentary archives reflect leaf water and lake water δD values, respectively, while the δD values for both long-chain (C28–C30) and mid-chain n-alkanoic acids (C24–C26) primarily represent lake water δD values. Plant wax-inferred δD values of precipitation during the early Holocene (10,100 to 8,200 cal yr BP) are ∼35‰ more positive than late Holocene values, and decline over the Holocene. δD-inferred hydrologic change and δ13C -inferred plant water use efficiency both indicate that the Faroe Islands became drier throughout the Holocene. Comparison with measurements from LIG plant waxes indicates that late LIG in the Faroe Islands was hydrologically similar to the early-to mid-Holocene (8,200 to 4,000 cal yr BP), with enriched precipitation isotopes and reduced evapotranspiration indicating a warmer, wetter environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Holocene; Interglacial; North Atlantic; Organic geochemistry; Paleoclimatology; Stable isotopes","Carbon; Geochemistry; Global warming; Hydrogen; Lakes; Paraffins; Sedimentology; Water supply; Holocenes; Interglacial; North Atlantic; Organic geochemistry; Paleoclimatology; Stable isotopes; Isotopes; atmospheric circulation; carbon isotope; evapotranspiration; global warming; Holocene; hydrogen isotope; hydrological change; interglacial; lacustrine deposit; lake water; Last Interglacial; paleoclimate; stable isotope; water use efficiency; wax; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Faroe Islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072634825

Unlike in our previous studies on M+(N2O)n (M = Cu, Ag, Au and M = Co, Rh, Ir) complexes, N– and O–bound isomers in this case are near isoenergetic and are not distinguished spectroscopically at this resolution. In the case of Li+ complexes, there is, however, evidence for the presence of bound N2 moieties, indicating the presence of inserted, OLi+N2(N2O)n–type structures. The weak N2 band lies to the blue of the signature of molecularly N– and O–bound ligands and is well–reproduced in the simulated spectra of energetically low-lying structures computed from density functional theory. No such inserted isomers are observed in the case of Al+(N2O)n complexes whose infrared spectra can be understood on the basis of molecularly-bound N2O ligands.

Soil infiltration rate plays an important role in determining the inputs from precipitation, which is important for the plant growth and groundwater recharge in semi-arid regions. Soil infiltration rate is generally influenced by belowground biomass (BGB), soil water content (SWC) and other soil properties (total soil porosity, soil mean weight diameter and soil organic carbon). The aim of this study is to understand the effects of plant roots, SWC and other soil properties on soil infiltration rate, and to identify the main factor affecting soil infiltration rate. This study investigated the total soil porosity (TP), soil mean weight diameter (MWD), soil organic carbon (SOC), SWC and plant roots of five grasslands (Bromus inermis, Trifolium repens, Panicum virgatum, Medicago sativa and Miscanthus sinensis). An automatic measurement system of point source device was used to quantify the soil infiltration rate. Results showed that SWC significantly affected the initial infiltration rate (P < 0.05), but plant roots gradually became the main factor affecting soil infiltration rate as the increasing infiltration time. The percentage of root volume (PV) of 0–2 mm was positively correlated with infiltration rate, while the PV of >4.5 mm was negatively correlated with infiltration rate. Our results indicated that fine roots could increase soil organic matters and form soil pores, thus more determining the potential of soil infiltration than soil water content during the short-term vegetation restoration in semi-arid regions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Infiltration process; Plant root diameter; Semiarid grassland; Soil infiltration; Soil water content","Arid regions; Groundwater; Organic carbon; Porosity; Revegetation; Soil conservation; Soil moisture; Infiltration process; Plant roots; Semi-arid grasslands; Soil infiltration; Soil water content; Infiltration; diameter; fine root; grassland soil; infiltration; limiting factor; revegetation; semiarid region; soil water; water content; Bromus inermis; Medicago sativa; Miscanthus sinensis; Panicum virgatum; Trifolium repens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070506393

In CCS, CO2 transportation plays an important role for the transmission of CO2 from the capturing facility to the location of permanent storage. In order to increase the CO2 density and avoid two-phase flow, CO2 needs to be transformed into the supercritical state. The supercritical CO2 environment poses a threat to pipeline safety because it is a high pressure environment with gaseous impurities. In this paper, the influencing factors of pipeline corrosion under supercritical CO2 environment and the current prevention and control methods for SC CO2 corrosion are reviewed. To begin, the supercritical CO2 corrosion environment and corrosion evaluation methods are introduced. Then, the effects of some factors, such as the water content, gaseous impurities, acids, alkalis, salts, temperature, pressure, flow rate, exposure angle, and pipeline steel, on corrosion are comprehensively reviewed.

In regions where droughts have occurred, or where they are anticipated, water availability becomes a key concern for local residents, organizational leaders, and governmental officials who fear socioeconomic hardships. The focal theory, the construal level theory, is expanded by: (1) exploring resident understanding about water availability and climate change, and (2) assessing the impact of resident proximity to an environmental crisis and the presence of drought conditions. A dual social-climate science quantitative approach is introduced to explore the role of actual climatic conditions on important residential and organizational outcomes. To capture spatial proximity, an experimental design is used where residents within (experimental group) and outside (control group) water crisis areas were surveyed. For residents in water crisis areas, perceived use of water compared to neighbors, residential attribution for water shortages, and age are significantly related to perceived household water availability and only farm irrigation attribution for water shortages is significantly related to state-level water policy support. For residents in non-crisis areas, actual drought conditions and industrial attribution for water shortages are significantly related to water availability perceptions and water conservation, climate change attribution for water shortages, and age are significantly related to state-level water policy support. This is the first study to the authors’ knowledge to demonstrate the impact of actual drought conditions on individual perceptions about water security. Construal level theory application and implications are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Construal level theory; Drought; Natural resources; Water resources; Water security","accessibility; climate change; drought; natural resource; perception; social theory; water availability; water resource; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069693496

Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC's) Paris Agreement—which aims to limit climate change and increase global resilience to its effects—was a breakthrough in climate diplomacy, committing its Parties to develop and update national climate plans. Yet the Parties to the Agreement have largely overlooked the effect of climate change on ocean-based communities, economies, and ecosystems—as well as the role that the ocean can play in mitigating and adapting to climate change. Because the ocean is an integral part of the climate system, stronger inclusion of ocean issues is critical to achieving the Agreement's goals. Here we discuss four ocean-climate linkages that suggest specific responses by Parties to the Agreement connected to 1) accelerating climate ambition, including via sustainable ocean-based mitigation strategies; 2) focusing on CO2 emissions to address ocean acidification; 3) better understanding ocean-based mitigation; and 4) pursuing ocean-based adaptation. These linkages offer a more complete perspective on the reasons strong climate action is necessary and inform a systematic approach for addressing ocean issues under the Agreement to strengthen climate mitigation and adaptation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC); Nationally determined contributions (NDCs); Ocean acidification; Ocean climate change; Sustainable development goals (SDGs); United nations framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC)","climate change; diplomatic relations; environmental policy; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; international agreement; mitigation; national planning; ocean; ocean acidification; strategic approach; sustainable development; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074391830

Exposure to fine particulate matter, a major component of urban air pollution, has been associated with an increase in cardiovascular risk and associated mortality. Impact of fine particles on the cardiovascular system includes inflammation, activation of prothrombotic pathways, oxidative stress, vascular dysfunction and remodeling, and neurological dysfunction. Genetic and epigenetic factors might also increase the susceptibility to air pollution. Consequently, epidemiologic studies have identified correlations between air particulate matter concentrations and acute coronary events, ischemic cardiomyopathy, acute heart failure, and stroke. Interestingly, these effects are present even for fine particulate matter concentrations below current US and EU regulatory standards, and seems to be more harmful in the most fragile population such as low-income or elderly subjects, or patients with previous cardiovascular disease. This review aims to summarize recent data on the pathophysiology and epidemiology of cardiovascular disease after particulate matter exposure. It will also discuss potential strategies to reduce the impact of air pollution on current and future populations' health. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cardiovascular Diseases/epidemiology/*etiology/*prevention & control; Coronary artery disease; Heart failure; Particulate matter/toxicity; Stroke","air pollutant; air pollution; all cause mortality; Article; autonomic dysfunction; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cause of death; central nervous system; cerebrovascular disease; concentration (parameter); disease predisposition; heart arrhythmia; heart failure; heart infarction; human; insulin resistance; ischemic cardiomyopathy; ischemic heart disease; lowest income group; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; particle size; particulate matter; pathophysiology; priority journal; thrombosis; adverse event; air pollution; animal; cardiovascular disease; risk factor; Air Pollution; Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases; Humans; Particulate Matter; Risk Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073178300

Yet, consideration of how the uptake of these policies is challenged by racialized relations is insufficiently addressed in the neoliberal conservation literature. Colonial histories are sedimented in racialized subjectivities and land management practices where certain economic activities, geographical sites and interactions with the natural environment became the stronghold of different groups. In this paper, I demonstrate how the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism, one such globally driven, market-based environmental policy, is challenged by the legacy of these racialized land use practices and social relations rooted in the defining colonial period in Guyana and Suriname. I outline the relationship between the processes of politically demarcating forests and of shaping subjectivities, drawing attention to how these processes are impacted by REDD+. Through a focus on gold mining, explored here as a historically conditioned, economic relationship with the natural environment, I show how REDD+ contributes to state territorialisation, complicates pre-existing racialized subjectivities and increases the legibility of forests and their amenability to state management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Colonialism; Governmentality; Neoliberal conservation; Racialization; REDD+; Subjectivity","colonialism; environmental policy; governance approach; nature conservation; neoliberalism; racial disparity; territoriality; Guyana; Suriname",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073642255

However, under mainstream conditions, nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) out-select anammox bacteria for nitrite produced by ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB). Therefore, nitrite production is the bottleneck in mainstream anammox nitrogen removal. Nitrate-dependent denitrifying anaerobic methane oxidizing archaea (n-damo) oxidize methane and reduce nitrate to nitrite. The nitrite supply challenge in mainstream anammox implementation could be solved with a microbial community of AOB, NOB, n-damo, and anammox with methane from anaerobic sludge digestion or a mainstream anaerobic membrane bioreactor (AnMBR). The cost and environmental impact of traditional nitrification/dentrification relative to AOB/anammox and AOB/anammox/n-damo systems, with and without an AnMBR, were compared with a stoichiometric model. AnMBR implementation reduced costs and emission rates at moderate to high nutrient loading by lowering aeration and sludge handling demands while increasing methane available for cogeneration. AnMBR/AOB/anammox systems reduced cost and GHG emission by up to .303/d/m3 and 1.72 kg equiv. CO2/d/m3, respectively, while AnMBR/AOB/anammox/n-damo systems saw a similar reduction of at least .300/d/m3 and 1.65 kg equiv. CO2/d/m3 in addition to alleviating the necessity to stop nitrification at nitrate, allowing easier aeration control. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Anaerobic digestion; Bacteria; Biological water treatment; Bioreactors; Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Denitrification; Environmental impact; Eutrophication; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Nitrates; Nitrification; Nitrogen removal; Sludge digestion; Ammonium oxidizing bacteria; Anaerobic ammonium oxidation; Anaerobic membrane bioreactor; Anaerobic sludge digestion; Biological nitrogen removal; Nitrification-denitrification; Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria; Stoichiometric models; Wastewater treatment; methane; ammonium derivative; nitrogen; aeration; ammonium compound; anoxic conditions; bacterium; denitrification; environmental impact; membrane; methane; microbial community; nitrification; oxidation; wastewater; wastewater treatment; aeration; anaerobic digestion; anammox bacterium; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; cost; denitrification; denitrifyer; environmental impact; methanotroph; nitrification; nonhuman; nutrient loading; sludge; stoichiometry; waste water management; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; oxidation reduction reaction; waste water; Ammonium Compounds; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Methane; Nitrogen; Oxidation-Reduction; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073830041

Following the features of environmental policy in India as outlined in Chapter 1, subsequent chapters explore domestic and international factors that shape environmental policy in the country. The chapters examine the interplay between governmental and non-governmental actors, and the influence of social mobilisation and institutions on environmental policy and governance. Analysing various policy trajectories, the chapters identify and explore five central environmental policy subsystems: Forests, water, climate, energy and city development. The authors drill down into the social, economic, political and ecological dimensions of each system, shedding light on why striking a balance between national economic growth and environmental sustainability is so challenging.

Five CTMs have provided modeled air quality data for 21 continuous years in Europe using emission scenarios prepared by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis/Greenhouse Gas - Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (IIASA/GAINS) and corresponding year-by-year meteorology derived from ERA-Interim global reanalysis. For this study, long-term observations of particle sulfate (SO2 4-), total nitrate (TNO3), total ammonium (TNHx) as well as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for multiple sites in Europe were used to evaluate the model results. The trend analysis was performed for the full 21 years (referred to as PT) but also for two 11-year subperiods: 1990-2000 (referred to as P1) and 2000-2010 (referred to as P2). The experiment revealed that the models were able to reproduce the faster decline in observed SO2 concentrations during the first decade, i.e., 1990-2000, with a 64%-76% mean relative reduction in SO2 concentrations indicated by the EDT experiment (range of all the models) versus an 82% mean relative reduction in observed concentrations. During the second decade (P2), the models estimated a mean relative reduction in SO2 concentrations of about 34%-54%, which was also in line with that observed (47%). Comparisons of observed and modeled NO2 trends revealed a mean relative decrease of 25% and between 19% and 23% (range of all the models) during the P1 period, and 12% and between 22% and 26% (range of all the models) during the P2 period, respectively. Comparisons of observed and modeled trends in SO4 2- concentrations during the P1 period indicated that the models were able to reproduce the observed trends at most of the sites, with a 42%-54% mean relative reduction indicated by the EDT experiment (range of all models) versus a 57% mean relative reduction in observed concentrations and with good performance also during the P2 and PT periods, even though all the models overpredicted the number of statistically significant decreasing trends during the P2 period. Moreover, especially during the P1 period, both modeled and observational data indicated smaller reductions in SO42- concentrations compared with their gas-phase precursor (i.e., SO2), which could be mainly attributed to increased oxidant levels and pH-dependent cloud chemistry. An analysis of the trends in TNO3 concentrations indicated a 28%-39% and 29% mean relative reduction in TNO3 concentrations for the full period for model data (range of all the models) and observations, respectively. Further analysis of the trends in modeled HNO3 and particle nitrate (NO-3 ) concentrations revealed that the relative reduction in HNO3 was larger than that for NO-3 during the P1 period, which was mainly attributed to an increased availability of ""free ammonia"". By contrast, trends in modeled HNO3 and NO-3 concentrations were more comparable during the P2 period. Also, trends of TNHx concentrations were, in general, underpredicted by all models, with worse performance for the P1 period than for P2. Trends in modeled anthropogenic and biogenic secondary organic aerosol (ASOA and BSOA) concentrations together with the trends in available emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) were also investigated. A strong decrease in ASOA was indicated by all the models, following the reduction in anthropogenic non-methane VOC (NMVOC) precursors. Biogenic emission data provided by the modeling teams indicated a few areas with statistically significant increase in isoprene emissions and monoterpene emissions during the 1990-2010 period over Fennoscandia and eastern European regions (i.e., around 14 %-27 %), which was mainly attributed to the increase of surface temperature. However, the modeled BSOA concentrations did not linearly follow the increase in biogenic emissions. Finally, a comprehensive evaluation against positive matrix factorization (PMF) data, available during the second period (P2) at various European sites, revealed a systematic underestimation of the modeled SOA fractions of a factor of 3 to 11, on average, most likely because of missing SOA precursors and formation pathways, with reduced biases for the models that accounted for chemical aging of semi-volatile SOA components in the atmosphere. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

Therefore, the simulations performed are not able to provide information about possible future scenarios due to climate change. In this work, future trends of building energy demands due to the climate change across Europe were studied by comparing three time steps (present, 2050, and -2080) in three different European cities, characterized by different Köppen-Geiger climatic classes. A residential building with modern architectural features was taken into consideration for the simulations. Future climate conditions were reached by applying the effects of climate changes to current hourly meteorological data though the climate change tool world weather file generator (CCWorldWeatherGen) tool, according to the guidelines established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In order to examine the resilience of the building, the simulations carried out were compared with respect to: peak power, median values of the power, and energy consumed by heating and cooling system. The observed trend shows a general reduction in the energy needs for heating (–46% for Aberdeen, –80% for Palermo, –36% for Prague in 2080 compared to the present) and increase (occurrence for Aberdeen) in cooling requirements. These results imply a revaluation of system size. © 2019 by the authors","Buildings resilience; Climate change; Energy needs; EnergyPlus; Future trends; Residential sector","Housing; Architectural features; Building energy demands; Energy needs; EnergyPlus; Future trends; Heating and cooling systems; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Residential sectors; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076189190

These processes are mainly controlled by the response of the rocks to climate and vegetation characteristics occurring through time. The present study investigates the geomorphological dynamics leading to the formation of recurrent, relatively flat slopes, developed near quartzite outcrops, through the inference of climatic variations and insights into dominant relief processes. These analyses are based on a geomorphological approach with the support of data from phytoliths, sponge spicules and carbon isotopes. Results of field and laboratory analyses of twelve soil profiles sampled in three distinct areas (Guinda, Morrinhos and Chapadinha) show no major overall changes in the vegetation type over 14C dated time, though there are variations along the slope profiles. In Guinda and Morrinhos, phytolith stocks do not follow the pattern of decreasing with depth, varying instead according to the granulometry. In Chapadinha, the stocks decreased with depth, D/P (tree density) ratios were always low (0.06–0.29) and Bi (water stress) indices were very high (48–94%). In Guinda and Chapadinha, the phytoliths present a high degree of alteration, indicating intense erosive processes, while in Morrinhos the presence of well preserved phytoliths indicates greater geomorphological stability of the slopes. δ13C results show dominance of C4 grasses. The presence of woody species varies with slope stability but decreases with depth were observed in all areas enabling the inference that a less humid environment occurred at ca. 6000 yr cal BP and also that cerrado vegetation has predominated since then. Results showed that the applied analyses have a great potential for temporal reconstruction therefore helping the interpretation of geomorphological processes operating during paleoclimates. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon isotopes; Paleo geomorphological processes; Paleoclimates; Phytoliths; Siliciclastic rocks","carbon isotope; geomorphology; paleoclimate; phytolith; siliciclastic deposit; slope stability; spicule; sponge; Brazil; Serra do Espinhaco; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070066291

Many factors have caused traffic congestion, such as insufficient road capacity, high vehicle density, poor urban traffic planning and inconsistent traffic light cycle configuration. Among these factors, the problems of traffic light cycle configuration are the focal points of this paper. If traffic lights can adjust the cycle dynamically with traffic data, it will reduce degrees of traffic congestion significantly. Therefore, a modified mechanism based on Q-Learning to optimize traffic light cycle configuration is proposed to obtain lower average vehicle delay time, while keeping significantly fewer processing steps. The experimental results will show that the number of processing steps of this proposed mechanism is 11.76 times fewer than that of the exhaustive search scheme, and also that the average vehicle delay is only slightly lower than that of the exhaustive search scheme by 5.4%. Therefore the proposed modified Q-learning mechanism will be capable of reducing the degrees of traffic congestions effectively by minimizing processing steps. © 2019 by the authors.","Machine learning; Q-learning; Reinforcement learning; Traffic congestion; Traffic light cycle configuration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075258051

In this study, aggregated macro-level models are developed to investigate and quantify correlations of bike sharing ridership variability in the city of Seoul. The bike sharing kilometres travelled (BSKT) is introduced as the ridership measurement, and a revealed preference method for its estimation is proposed using more than five million trip trajectories of global positioning system (GPS) collected from the bike sharing system of Seoul city. Six different models grouped into three categories are estimated, including linear regression, Bayesian model without spatial effect and Bayesian models with spatial autocorrelation. Five categories of variables are used to explain the variability of BSKT in Seoul. The contribution of these variables in intra-zonal BSKT and inter-zonal BSKT are also modelled and compared. The findings suggest a strong correlation among BSKT, bike sharing stations and bicycle network variables.

The condensable particulate matter emission factors of liquefied natural gas, diesel, and bunker C oil were measured in boilers with no preventive facilities, and the coal power plant emission factor was obtained at the end of the prevention facility. The condensable particulate matter emissions were calculated by multiplying the particulate matter 2.5 filterable particulate matter emissions by the ratio of the condensable particulate matter emissions to the filterable particulate matter of the National Institute of Environmental Research data. Different patterns of emission sources were observed for each province depending on the consideration of condensable particulate matters. Considering only the filterable particulate matters, the proportion of mobile pollutants was high. On the other hand, considering the condensable particulate matters, the contribution of the nonindustrial combustion category emissions using gaseous fuels, such as city gas, increased in the metropolitan area, whereas the contributions of the manufacturing combustion category emissions increased in the nonmetropolitan areas. Therefore, in the case of collecting energy facilities and the manufacturing burning facilities planned in the local cities in Korea, it is necessary to consider the filterable particulate matter, and condensable particulate matter emission amount. © The Author(s) 2019.","condensable; emission; factor; Filterable; matter; particulate","Coal combustion; Emission control; Gas emissions; Manufacture; Natural gasoline plants; Neutron emission; Particulate emissions; condensable; factor; Filterable; matter; particulate; Particles (particulate matter); atmospheric pollution; combustion; condensation; emission control; emission inventory; facility location; metropolitan area; particulate matter; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065160575

Many novel genes have been cloned from a variety of species and modiﬁed for effective, stable, and strong expression in transgenic organisms. Although there are many applications, FT expression has been employed most commonly at the cellular level in plants. To investigate FT expression at the whole-plant level, particularly in ﬂowers, petunia ‘Mitchell Diploid’ [MD (Petunia ·hybrida)] was genetically transformed with seven genes encoding FTs: DsRed2, E2Crimson, TurboRFP, ZsGreen1, ZsYellow1, rpulFKz1, oraeCP597. Each gene was cloned into a pHK-DEST-OE vector harboring constitutive ﬁgwort mosaic virus 35S promoter and NOS-terminator. These plasmids were individually introduced into the genome of MD by Agrobacterium tumefaciens–mediated transformation. Shoot regeneration efﬁciency from the cocultured explants ranged from 8.3% to 20.3%. Various intensities of red, green, and yellow ﬂuorescence were detected from TurboRFP, ZsGreen1, and ZsYellow1-transgenic ﬂowers, respectively, under ultraviolet light for speciﬁc excitation and emission ﬁlters. More than 70% of plants established from the regenerated shoots were conﬁrmed as transgenic plants. Transgenic ZsGreen1 petunia generated strong, green ﬂuorescence in all ﬂower organs of T0 plants including petals, stigmas, styles, anthers, and ﬁlaments. Most of the chromophores were localized to the cytoplasm but also went into the nuclei of petal cells. The rewash a positive linear relationship (R2 = 0.88) between the transgene expression levels and the relative ﬂuorescent intensities of the ZsGreen1-transgenic ﬂowers. No ﬂuorescence was detected from the ﬂowers of DsRed2-, E2Crimson-, rpulFKz1-, oraeCP597-transgenic petunias even though their gene transcripts were conﬁrmed through semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. T1 generation ZsGreen1 plants showed green ﬂuorescence emission from the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and radicles, which indicated stable FT expression was heritable. Four homozygous T2 inbred lines were ﬁnally selected. Throughout this study, we demonstrated that ZsGreen1 was most suitable for generating visible ﬂuorescence in MD ﬂowers among the seven genes tested. Thus, ZsGreen1 may have excellent potential for better utility as a sensitive selectable marker. © 2019, American Society for Horticultural Science.

The strain of microalgae used in this process plays a vital role in determining the rate of CO2 fixation and characteristics of biomass production. High requirements are put forward for algae strains due to high CO2 concentration and diverse pollutants in flue gas. CO2 can directly diffuse into the cytoplasm of cells by extra- and intracellular CO2 osmotic pressure under high CO2 concentrations. The flue gas pollutants, such as SOx, NOx and fly ashes, have negative effects on the growth of microalgae. This work reviewed the state-of-the-art advances on microalgae strains used for CO2 fixation, focusing on the modification and improvement of strains that are used for coal-fired flue gas.

The impacts of PM2.5 may vary in time and space due to the spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5 number size distribution and chemical compositions. This research analyzed the latest PM2.5 chemical compositions measurements with an aim to better understand the dynamic changes of PM2.5 in response to emission reductions due to the new regulations. The particulate measurements from the Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization (SEARCH) network between 2001 and 2016 were analyzed for the spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5 and inorganic PM2.5 (iPM2.5 = SO4 2− + NH4 + + NO3 −) chemical compositions in the Southeastern United States (U.S.). It was discovered that PM2.5 and iPM2.5 mass concentrations exhibited significant downward trends in 2001–2016. Both PM2.5 and iPM2.5 mass concentrations were higher at urban and inland sites than rural/suburban and coastal sites. The higher iPM2.5 concentrations at agricultural sites were attributed to the influences of ammonia (NH3) emissions from animal feeding operations (AFOs). The iPM2.5 was the dominant contributor to PM2.5 in 2001–2016 at the coastal sites, whereas organic carbon matter (OCM) was the major contributor to PM2.5 after 2011 at the inland sites. Our data analysis suggests that significant decrease of PM2.5 concentrations is attributed to the reductions in nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions in 2001–2016. Findings from this research provide insights into the development of effective PM2.5 control strategies and assessment of air pollutants exposure. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chemical compositions; Gas-particle partitioning; Inorganic aerosols; Mass closure; PM2.5; Spatiotemporal variations","aerosol; chemical composition; partitioning; spatial variation; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal variation; United States; Animalia; ammonia; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; animal; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; United States; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Ammonia; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen Oxides; Particulate Matter; Southeastern United States; Sulfur Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073920323

However, controversies exist to argue that favourable meteorological conditions in 2017 were the major driver for such a rapid decrease in PM2.5 concentrations. To comprehensively evaluate this 5-year plan, we employed a Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter and WRF-CMAQ (Weather Research and Forecasting and the Community Multi-scale Air Quality) to quantify the relative contribution of meteorological conditions and the control of anthropogenic emissions to PM2.5 reduction in Beijing from 2013 to 2017. For these 5 years, the relative contribution of emission reduction to the decrease in PM2.5 concentrations calculated by KZ filtering and WRFCMAQ was 80.6% and 78.6% respectively. KZ filtering suggested that short-term variations in meteorological and emission conditions contributed majorly to rapid changes in PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing. WRF-CMAQ revealed that the relative contribution of local and regional emission reduction to the PM2.5 decrease in Beijing was 53.7% and 24.9% respectively. For local emission-reduction measures, the regulation of coal boilers, increasing use of clean fuels for residential use and industrial restructuring contributed 20.1 %, 17.4% and 10.8% to PM2.5 reduction respectively. Both models suggested that the control of anthropogenic emissions accounted for around 80% of the PM2.5 reduction in Beijing, indicating that emission reduction was crucial for air quality enhancement in Beijing from 2013 to 2017. Consequently, such a long-term air quality clean plan should be continued in the following years to further reduce PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing. © Author(s) 2019.",,"air quality; concentration (composition); emission control; human activity; particulate matter; pollution policy; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074713360

Specifically, this paper utilizes Internet penetration and mobile phone penetration as proxies to measure ICT respectively and employs quantile regression method to estimate the benchmark model at five quantiles (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 0.9). It is demonstrated that Internet penetration at the national level has a significant negative effect on the CO2 emission intensity for all quantiles. In addition, Internet penetration has a significant negative effect on CO2 emission intensity at all quantiles except for 0.1 quantile for China’s eastern provinces and has a significant negative effect on CO2 emission intensity at all quantiles for China’s central provinces, whereas Internet penetration has no significant negative impact on CO2 emission intensity at all quantiles for China’s western provinces. By comparison, the reduction effect of Internet penetration on CO2 emission intensity in China’s eastern and central provinces is more obvious and in contrast with the reduction effect of Internet penetration on CO2 emission intensity in China’s eastern provinces, it is greater in China’s central provinces. Finally, the impact of mobile phone penetration on CO2 emission intensity is generally consistent with the impact of Internet penetration.

Among these uncertainties, the surface exchange coefficient Ch is a critical parameter, controlling the total energy transported from the land surface to the atmosphere. Although it directly impacts the coupling strength between the surface and atmosphere, it has not been properly evaluated for regional climate models. This study assesses the representation of surface coupling strength in a stand-alone Noah-MP land surface model and in coupled 4-km Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations. The data collected at eight FLUXNET sites of the Canadian Carbon Program and seven AMRIFLUX sites are used to evaluate the offline Noah-MP simulations. Nine of these FLUXNET sites are used for the evaluation of the coupled WRF simulations. These sites are categorized into three land use types: grassland, cropland, and forest. The surface exchange coefficients derived using three formulations in Noah-MP simulations are compared to those calculated from observations. Then, the default Czil = 0 and new canopy-height dependent Czil are used in coupled WRF simulations over the spring and summer in 2006 to compare their effects on surface heat flux, temperature, and precipitation. When the new canopy-height dependent Czil scheme is used, the simulated Ch exchange coefficient agrees better with observation and improves the daily maximum air temperature and heat flux simulation over grassland and cropland in the US Great Plains. Over grassland, the modeled Ch shows a different diurnal cycle than that for observed Ch, which makes WRF lag behind the observed diurnal cycle of sensible heat flux and temperature. The difference in precipitation between the two schemes is not as clear as the temperature difference because the impact of changing Ch is not local. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Land–atmosphere interaction; Surface coupling strength; Surface exchange coefficient; Surface fluxes","air-sea interaction; computer simulation; diurnal variation; heat flux; regional climate; surface flux; weather forecasting; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071316438

Here we combine a neighborhood modeling approach with insights from coexistence theory to assess the effects of temporal variation in species interactions and environmental conditions (e.g., precipitation, temperature, and understory light availability) on seedling survival over nine census years in a subtropical forest. We find significant temporal shifts in the magnitude of neighborhood effects on both community-wide and species-level seedling survival (statistically significant random effects of neighborhood × year and neighborhood × species × year interactions). These results are consistent with the idea that environmental change will play a fundamental role on forest regeneration dynamics by altering biotic interactions at the neighborhood scale. Moreover, differences among species in response to neighbors over time contribute to a pattern of temporal decoupling of seedling survival between species, which can help to promote diversity in certain contexts. In separate analyses of multiple regression on distance matrices (MRM), altered interactions with neighbors are much stronger predictors of asynchronous seedling survival among species than the pure effects of climate and plant functional traits, explaining twice as much variation (43.9% vs. 22.2%). In sum, these results reveal that divergent species responses to interannual environmental variability detected are driven primarily by indirect effects mediated by changing biotic environments. This highlights the importance of including indirect effects from local biotic (neighborhood) interactions in forecasts of forest community responses to global change. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","demographic decoupling between species; direct and indirect effects; forest dynamics plot; neighborhood effects; seedling survival; subtropical forest; temporal environmental variation","biotic factor; coexistence; community response; demography; environmental change; environmental conditions; environmental effect; forest dynamics; neighborhood; seedling; subtropical region; survival; tropical forest; climate; forest; plant; seedling; tree; Climate; Forests; Plants; Seedlings; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070746283

While growing literature has explored the effects of technological progress on environmental quality, fewer studies have considered the varied effects exerted by different technological progress paths on PM2.5 concentrations. This paper explored the relationship between two different kinds of technological progress (indigenous innovation and technology diffusion) and PM2.5 concentrations. Indigenous innovation was in this study considered to be composed by research and development investment (R&amp;D) and import technology (IM); technology diffusion was represented by foreign direction investment (FDI) and export learning effect represent (EX). A panel data model was employed in order to explore the varied impact of these different technological progress paths on PM2.5 concentrations, using data for 48 cities located in China's three most developed urban agglomerations (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta), for the period 2000–2015. The results reveal that without control variables, FDI had a significant negative impact on PM2.5 levels in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, and EX a significant positive impact. FDI, R&amp;D, and EX were found to positively correlate with PM2.5 levels in the Yangtze River Delta. In Pearl River Delta, R&amp;D presented a significant negative relationship. The findings of this study provide decision makers and industry managers with a scientific basis from which to approach the task of mitigating PM2.5 concentrations through technological progress. The purpose of this study is to reveal the varied effects exerted by different technological progress paths on PM2.5 concentrations in China's three most developed urban agglomerations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Indigenous innovation; Regional variations; Technology diffusion","Agglomeration; Air pollution; Decision making; Diffusion; Engineering education; Rivers; Environmental quality; Innovation and technology; Regional variation; Research and development; Technological progress; Technology diffusion; Urban agglomerations; Yangtze river delta; River pollution; agglomeration; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); innovation; particulate matter; technology diffusion; urban area; air pollution; article; China; city; diffusion; human; investment; learning; manager; river; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city planning; diffusion; environmental monitoring; international cooperation; particulate matter; prevention and control; procedures; China; Guangdong; Yangtze River; Zhujiang Delta; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Cities; Diffusion; Environmental Monitoring; Internationality; Particulate Matter; Rivers; Urban Renewal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070557582

However, improvements in air quality after its implementation have rarely been evaluated on a regional scale. To fill this gap, this study employed the Weather Research and Forecast model coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem) model to investigate the improvement in air quality under scenarios separately implementing different control measures. The domestic emission control area (DECA) in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region of China was selected as the target area for the study. The results suggest that the use of cleaner fuels is a promising way to improve air quality. For vessels sailing in the DECA, using 0.5% sulfur-content fuel could reduce SO2 and PM2.5 by 0.52 μg/m3 and 1.43 μg/m3, respectively, in the target cities of PRD, while 0.1% sulfur-content fuel could increase these figures to 0.59 μg/m3 and 1.62 μg/m3, respectively. The use of liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuel was predicted to be the most effective method for air quality improvement. LNG fuel could reduce the annual average concentrations of SO2, NO2 and PM2.5 by 0.63 μg/m3, 2.80 μg/m3 and 2.14 μg/m3, respectively, in the target cities of PRD. The application of shore side electricity (SSE) would reduce the ship-contributed SO2 and PM2.5 by 0.33 μg/m3 and 1.06 μg/m3, respectively. For the NOX control, the retrofit of the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system could reduce the ambient concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5 by 2.09 μg/m3 and 0.15 μg/m3, respectively. These results suggest that the use of cleaner fuels and the retrofit SCR system all have positive effects on lowering the impact of ship emissions, while the application of SSE could be a useful supplement. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Control measures; Pearl River Delta; Ship emissions; WRF/Chem","Air cleaners; Air quality; Emission control; Gems; Liquefied natural gas; Nitrogen oxides; Retrofitting; Rivers; Sailing vessels; Selective catalytic reduction; Sulfur; Tankers (ships); Weather forecasting; Annual average concentration; Control measures; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Pearl River delta; Selective catalytic reduction systems; Ship emissions; Weather Research and Forecast models; WRF/Chem; Quality control; liquefied natural gas; sulfur; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric modeling; catalysis; concentration (composition); emission control; liquefied natural gas; mitigation; particulate matter; reduction; sulfur dioxide; traffic emission; air pollution control; air quality; Article; autumn; China; exhaust gas; priority journal; river; seasonal variation; ship; spring; winter; China; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071546214

The use of carbon trading to achieve carbon reductions is a recognized and effective way. However, in the face of complex economic development, there are different regions in the world that have formed a market for carbon trading. This paper proposes a common market mechanism based on the Indo-Pacific region. Under the reality that all member countries in the region have complementary, it is possible to achieve the goal of reducing emissions through carbon trading. First, explain the current carbon reduction trends and major carbon trading markets around the world. These include the region in which the market is located, the benefits of the exchange, the form in which the transaction can be used, and the legal norms that must be in place in actual operation. Secondly, discuss the reduction target strategies of countries and the operating conditions of the carbon trading market. Finally, the integration structure of the multi-country carbon trading market under the IndoChina common market are proposed. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Aerosols; Air quality; Carbon; Greenhouse effect; Carbon reduction; Economic development; Global climate changes; Integration structures; Management strategies; Operating condition; Reducing emissions; Reduction targets; Emission control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076623180

Both countries are expected to take the lead on the global effort to achieve clean energy and greenhouse gas emissions reduction. Although Germany and China have different characteristics, international-level strategic cooperation is essential for meeting the goals of both local and global energy transition. However, until now, no comparable research for energy transition in Germany and China exists in a peer-reviewed journal. In order to close this knowledge gap, a critical review was conducted and then some recommendations were proposed. First of all, after reviewing the background, milestones, current situation and challenges, we found infrastructure, policy instruments and market reform played the key roles in the transition process in Germany and China. While nuclear power and coal are likely to be abandoned in Germany, China has more ambition beyond the power sector and to reach self-sufficiency. As the two countries chosen different concepts and pathways to achieve their transition targets, there is great opportunity for them to take the lessons from each other. Germany and China need cooperation at multi-levels varies from politic, economic, scientific to public. Then, recommendations are presented on how to further foster cooperation and enable an energy transition. © 2019","China; Energy geography; Energy revolution; Energy transition; Germany","Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Nuclear fuels; China; Energy geography; Energy revolution; Energy transitions; Germany; Gas emissions",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071771632

In response, airlines have explored various means, including sustainable jet fuels. This article investigates how similar ETS policy would affect domestic carbon emissions when implemented in the United States. The study integrates a model of airlines operations optimization and multi-feedstock biojet fuels life cycle assessment to simulate decisions of biojet fuel and commercial aviation industry responding to an emission policy. We conduct a Monte-Carlo simulation on two scenarios of domestic emission schemes to investigate the adoption of biojet fuels and its impacts on carbon emissions. Our model indicates that implementing an emission policy for U.S. airlines could incentivize adoption of biofuels - a median value of 10% of total fuels in 2050- while only marginally reduce travel demand. Because of a combined effect of emission policy and improved aircraft technology, the emissions in 2050 would only increase 1.37 times the 2005 level despite passenger demand grows by a factor of 2.75. A non-parametric sensitivity analysis suggests that the price of oil, economic growth, and carbon price are the three most significant factors in affecting the fleet-level carbon emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aviation emissions; Emissions trading scheme policy; Sustainable aviation fuels","Air transportation; Carbon; Civil aviation; Commerce; Emission control; Intelligent systems; International law; Life cycle; Monte Carlo methods; Sensitivity analysis; Aircraft technology; Airlines operations; Aviation fuel; Commercial aviation industry; Commercial flights; Domestic emissions; Emissions Trading Scheme; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Biofuels; airline industry; biofuel; carbon emission; emission control; emissions trading; policy analysis; policy implementation; sustainable development; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072207630

Hence addressing both factors is very much essential. Battery electric vehicles are with limited vehicle range and higher charging time. So it is not suitable for the long-haul application. In further the hydrogen fuel cell-based electric vehicles are the future of the commercial electric vehicle to achieve long-range, zero-emission and alternate for reducing fossil fuels requirement. The hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle range, it means the total distance covered by the vehicle in a single filling of hydrogen into the onboard cylinders. And here the prediction of the vehicle range is essential based on optimal parameters; vehicle acceleration, speed, trip time etc. before the start of the trip. If the driver starts the vehicle without range prediction and optimum driving strategy, will be led into midway vehicle stoppage and excessive energy consumption of the trip. This paper deals with different methods of electric vehicle range prediction and optimization, benefits and demerits are listed and discussed, to provide a fair idea on hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicle range prediction. Also, the paper has concluded with the optimization strategy for the vehicle range by analyzing the vehicle powertrain module, battery module, fuel cell module, hydrogen fuel supply module and the vehicle module. The strategy presented in this paper is aiming for assisting the driver in formulating a driving strategy and for trip planning based on optimization trip parameters, considering optimum energy consumption.

The results of Spatio-Temporal trend distribution over the study area shown that the annual mean and annual minimum temperature indicates the upward (positive) trend over whole LTRB, while annual maximum temperature indicates the upward (positive) trend over the basin except west coastal region of LTRB. The annual rainfall exhibits upward (positive) trend in all three time periods over entire LTRB. The trend (positive/negative) detected for mean temperature and annual rainfall is found to be consistent with the trend noticed by Indian Meteorological Department for the state of Gujarat. The spatial distribution of trend further needs to be analyzed to correlate it with changing pattern of land use – land cover over a period of time. The present case study for the assessment of climate change would be useful to the water resources engineers for planning and management and policy decisions for climate change adaptation in the study area. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Innovative trend analysis; Lower Tapi River Basin; Spatio -temporal trend","Atmospheric temperature; Decision making; Land use; Rain; Rivers; Spatial distribution; Watersheds; Annual mean temperatures; Climate change adaptation; Climate change assessment; Innovative trends; Meteorological parameters; River basins; Sen's slope estimators; Spatio temporal; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072873871

In this sense, the objective of this study was to estimate gross primary productivity (GPP) in a region of the western Brazilian Amazon using Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images, and to evaluate possible changes in estimated productivity among areas of different land use and in different seasonal conditions (August 04, 2013, representing the dry season, and October 10, 2014, representing the rainy season). The images were subjected to atmospheric and radiometric corrections. As the basic input for the model, the balance of radiation and other components of the energy balance were calculated using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land. The GPP estimated through the OLI/TIRS sensor was compared with the MOD17A2 product of the MODIS sensor. The comparison of GPP by the OLI/TIRS sensors and the MOD17A2H product were based on the mean error (ME), simple linear regression (r2) and correlation coefficient (r). The estimated GPP indicated distinctions among land use types, however, similarities with MOD17A2H were detected only with the image from the rainy season (r = 0.53), with a slight underestimation for all land uses. The dry season image showed r2 = 0.11, r = 0.33 and ME = −0.48 gCm−2day−1 for extractivism, while the land use types were overestimated by the model. The OLI/TIRS sensor estimates need to be validated with data from flow towers. The focus on carbon sequestration by forest ecosystems and the reduction of CO2 emissions is the foundation for mitigating climate change damage and consequences at regional and global levels. Currently deforestation of the Amazon rainforest is growing absurdly. Policies contrary to the control of deforestation will only cause accelerated climate change, which will endanger the lives of future generations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Algorithms; Carbon in forests; Climate change; Orbital sensors",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071222422

To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has specifically attempted to pinpoint a hybrid programming strategy for making a quantitative description of the anaerobic biodegradability of these waste streams. Thus, considering the scarcity of the literature in this field, a comprehensive study was conducted to evaluate the amount of bio-methane obtainable from the investigated organic wastes and to predict their kinetics using three different sigmoidal microbial growth curve models (modified Gompertz equation, transference function (reaction curve-type model), and logistic function) within the framework an original MATLAB®-based coding scheme. The results showed that methane productions started immediately after 4 h of incubation for all substrates and reached their maximum rates of 118, 116, 108, 34 mL CH4/g VS/day, respectively, for wastewaters from chocolate, slaughterhouse, gum, and beet sugar industries. The corrected mean steady state methane contents were 61.7%, 73.4%, 62.8%, and 62.1% in the respective order. The highest methane yield (943 mL CH4/g VS) was obtained from the slaughterhouse wastewater, and this value was 1.32, 1.58, and 4.56 times higher than those obtained in the anaerobic digestion of chocolate, gum, and beet sugar wastewaters, respectively. Among the three kinetic models tested, the logistic function best explained the behavior of the observed data of all substrates using a Quasi-Newton cubic line search procedure (R2 = 0.987–0.996) with minimum number of non-linear iterations and function counts. Deviations between the measured and the outputs of the best-fit kinetic model were less than 4.3% in prediction of methane production potentials, suggesting that the proposed computational methodology could be used as a well-suited and robust approach for modeling and optimization of a highly non-linear biosystem. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agro-industrial waste; Anaerobic digestion; Biochemical methane potential; Hybrid programming; Kinetic modeling","Biodegradability; Computer hardware description languages; Function evaluation; Growth kinetics; Kinetic parameters; Kinetic theory; MATLAB; Methane; Reaction kinetics; Substrates; Sugar industry; Agro-industrial wastes; Anaerobic biodegradability; Biochemical methane potential; Computational methodology; Hybrid programming; Kinetic modeling; Modified gompertz equations; Slaughterhouse wastewater; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070230826

To maintain a comfort level of living under this arid climatic condition, Residential houses need to be equipped with necessary facilities and high-power home appliances such as Air-Conditioners, water heaters, refrigerators, pool pumps, laundries and so on. Also, electricity cost could be very different at peak time and non-peak time through the day. To achieve a better cost-efficient electricity consumption, optimization control of load consumption for local residential house is studied in this paper. Firstly, a dedicated house model with thermal dynamics under local conditions is developed in this paper. Based on this model, optimal cost-oriented load control and consumption management based on optimization tool is proposed. Also, by designing constraint criteria, the comfort level of housing indoor temperature is guaranteed and energy consumption upper boundary is restricted. Finally, the optimization control scheme is verified through a scenario under typical seasonal weather conditions. The results shows that the lowest cost of energy consumption can be achieved by the proposed optimization control of house load management. © 2019 IEEE.","desert climate; Load management; Optimization; thermal dynamics","Air conditioning; Costs; Domestic appliances; Electric power plant loads; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Heating; Houses; Laundries; Meteorology; Climatic conditions; Electricity costs; Electricity-consumption; Indoor temperature; Optimization control; Optimization tools; Residential house; Thermal dynamics; Electric load management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084677230

The majority of patients are curatively treated with simple excision. Only few present with locally advanced disease or have evidence of high-risk features, placing them at an elevated risk of relapse. In such cases, further investigations may guide the multidisciplinary management plan. There are no universally agreed on indications for recommending additional staging investigations, due to a lack of prospective data reporting their impact on patient outcomes. Some generally agreed upon indications are discussed in this review article. Most commonly, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MR) are used in cases of locally advanced NMSC for staging purposes and surgical planning. While Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT and sentinel lymph node biopsy have shown utility, data is lacking to establish their roles in the staging algorithm. An updated NMSC system was included in The American Joint Committee for Cancer eighth edition staging manual (AJCC8). Under AJCC8 the majority of patients with regional disease are upstaged by the presence of extranodal extension, however, this updated system appears to provide limited prognostic discrimination between the nodal categories and the overall TNM stages. This review article will explore the contemporary role of staging investigations, including evolving technologies, and review the changes implemented in AJCC8. It will also discuss the implications of the AJCC8 decision to assign patients with p16-positive cervical nodal SCC with an unknown primary to the oropharyngeal staging system, with particular relevance to clinicians working in areas of high NMSC incidence. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AJCC8 staging; Basal cell carcinoma; Magnetic resonance imaging; Non-melanomatous skin cancer; Positron Emission Tomography; Sentinel node biopsy; Squamous cell carcinoma","protein p16; advanced cancer; Article; basal cell carcinoma; cancer of unknown primary site; cancer staging; computer assisted tomography; echography; human; non melanomatous skin cancer; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; priority journal; sentinel lymph node biopsy; skin carcinoma; squamous cell skin carcinoma; treatment response; cancer staging; disease management; positron emission tomography; practice guideline; procedures; prognosis; skin tumor; treatment outcome; Disease Management; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neoplasm Staging; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Positron-Emission Tomography; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Prognosis; Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy; Skin Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome; Ultrasonography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072704579

The European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) Satellite Application Facility for Land Surface Analysis operationally delivers estimation of the MDSSFTD (MSG Downwelling Surface Short-wave radiation Fluxes-Total and Diffuse fraction) product with an operational status since the year 2019. The method for retrieval was presented in a companion paper. Part 2 now focuses on the evaluation of the MDSSFTD algorithm and presents a comparison of the corresponding outputs, i.e., total DSSF and diffuse fraction (fd) components, against in situ measurements acquired at four Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN) stations over a seven-month period. The validation is performed on an instantaneous basis. We show that the satellite estimates of DSSF and fd meet the target requirements defined by the user community for all-sky (clear and cloudy) conditions. For DSSF, the requirements are 20 Wm-2 for DSSF &lt; 200 Wm-2, and 10% for DSSF ≥ 200 Wm-2. The mean bias error (MBE) and relative mean bias error (rMBE) compared to the ground measurements are 3.618 Wm-2 and 0.252%, respectively. For fd, the requirements are 0.1 for fd &lt; 0.5, and 20% for fd ≥ 0.5. The MBE and rMBE compared to the ground measurements are -0.044% and -17.699%, respectively. The study also provides a separate analysis of the product performances for clear sky and cloudy sky conditions. The importance of representing the cloud-aerosol radiative coupling in the MDSSFTD method is discussed. Finally, it is concluded that the quality of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) forecasts currently available is accurate enough to obtain reliable diffuse solar flux estimates. This quality of AOD forecasts was still a limitation a few years ago. © 2019 by the authors.","Land surface modelling; Meteosat second generation; Solar radiation; Validation","Aerosols; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Surface analysis; Weather satellites; Aerosol optical depths; Land surface analysis; Land surface modelling; Meteosat second generations; Satellite application facilities; Short-wave radiation; Spatiotemporal distributions; Validation; Surface measurement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074670253

The major conclusion of our model is to prove the existence of infinitely many economic scenarios in which a strong commitment towards the global green economy will allow gains for each country participating in a green deal project and guarantee significant advantages with respect to a non green undesirable scenario. For this purpose, we propose a dynamical duopoly-type model–for a generic type of green (i.e. low Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions) technology good–based on coopetition. In our game model, we suggest coopetitive strategy profiles as solutions for a continuum of possible global economic interactions after the Paris agreement on climate change, given the 45th US president's decision to abandon the agreement itself. More specifically, we construct a game theory coopetitive model with two macro actors for our duopoly game–the United States and the group of countries that still hold to the COP21 global agreement on climate change. Our multidimensional coopetitive model naturally shows a continuum of possible global economic games–within COP21–based on cooperative paradigms and strategy designs, in order to improve the efficiency and strength of the policies enforced by the countries and in order to mitigate climate change and build a truly green global economy. Our approach shows how the actors of the game can expand the pie of their possible gains and to share those gains fairly. A limitation of our analysis concerns the chosen deterministic nature of the parameter expressing the degree of accession to COP21 agreement. A probabilistic approach would be more suitable, and this could constitute a development of plans for future research. Another limitation consists in assuming the total COP21 goal fulfillment of the countries accepting the COP21 agreement. In both cases our model could be easily generalized to overcome these drawbacks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Coopetitive games; Environmental agreements; Green technologies; Paris COP21","climate change; environmental legislation; game theory; global economy; green economy; international agreement; technology; article; case report; climate change; clinical article; drug withdrawal; economic aspect; France; game; greenhouse gas; United States; France; greenhouse gas; France; Ile de France; Paris; United States; Ville de Paris; Climate Change; Greenhouse Gases; Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070249097

In gravity sewers with sediments, responses of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and methanogenic archaea (MA) residing in different zones to Fe3+ dosing strategies still remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the changes in behavior of SRB and MA in different depths of sewer sediment using laboratory-scale sewer sediment reactors with different Fe3+ dosing strategies (different instant dosages and frequencies). All Fe3+ dosing strategies examined efficiently suppressed sulfide concentration for a short time, but the control mechanisms were different. When a low-dosage, high-frequency Fe3+ dosing strategy was employed, Fe3+ could not penetrate into the sewer sediment, therefore, the abundances of SRB and MA in all zones of sewer sediment did not change substantially. As a result, the active sulfide-producing and methane-producing zones kept unchanged. Sulfide was controlled mainly via chemical sulfide oxidation and precipitation, and methane formation was not influenced. In contrast, when a high-dosage, low-frequency Fe3+ dosing strategy was used, the SRB activity in the upper layer of the sewer sediment was nearly fully suppressed according to the down moving zones of sulfide production (from 0-5 mm to 20–25 mm) and lower sulfate reduction, in which sulfate reduction decreased by 56% in the long-term trial. The generated sulfide was further removed via chemical sulfide oxidation and precipitation. This strategy also significantly suppressed MA activity (21% reduction in methane production). However, considering a long-term satisfactory sulfide control, a low operational cost and less sediments deposited in gravity sewers, a low-dosage, high-frequency Fe3+ dosing strategy would be a more cost-effective solution for sulfide control in gravity sewers with thin (&lt;20 mm) or thick (&gt;20 mm) sediments if methane mitigation does not need to be taken into account. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Methanogenic archaea (MA); Microelectrode analysis; Stratified microbial structure; Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB); Sulfide and methane control","Bacteria; Combined sewers; Cost effectiveness; Methane; Microelectrodes; Precipitation (chemical); Sediments; Cost-effective solutions; Methane controls; Methane mitigation; Methane production; Methanogenic archaea; Microbial structures; Sulfate reducing bacteria; Sulfide concentration; Sulfur compounds; ferric ion; methane; RNA 16S; sulfate; sulfide; methane; sulfide; control system; electrode; laboratory method; methane; methanogenic bacterium; microbial activity; oxidation; prokaryote; sediment analysis; sewer network; sulfate-reducing bacterium; sulfide; Article; Bacteroidetes; Chloroflexi; Desulfobacter; Desulfobulbus; Desulfococcus; Desulfomicrobium; Desulfovibrio; Firmicutes; gene sequence; gravity; Lactococcus; lung diffusion capacity; Methanobacterium; methanogenic archaeon; methanogenic bacterium; Methanosaeta; Methanosarcina; Methanospirillum; microbial community; nonhuman; oxidation; pH; precipitation; priority journal; Proteobacteria; sediment; sewer; spectrophotometry; spirochete; total organic carbon; Euryarchaeota; oxidation reduction reaction; sewage; Euryarchaeota; Methane; Oxidation-Reduction; Sewage; Sulfides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070241406

However, few studies have explored the essential policy concern, which is, how to maximize the social benefits including both carbon mitigation and human health co-benefits from the co-abated conventional air pollutants. Besides, for some sectors that have extensive inter-regional trade, using more low-carbon technologies to produce goods (and thus reducing its own CO2 emissions) in one region may influence the need of goods imported from another region and consequently the associated conventional air pollutants emissions. Therefore, the health co-benefits may also be transferred to the other regions. This transfer effect has seldom been quantified before. To bridge these research gaps, this paper took China's power sector as an example and quantified the operating margin (OM) emission factors of SO2, NOX and PM2.5 in China's six power grids. Then the co-abatement rates of these three pollutants when reducing each kiloton of CO2 in different grids were calculated. Finally, considering different grids’ meteorological conditions, population densities, baseline incidences, baseline death rates, and the inter-grid electricity trade, this paper computed and compared the values and regional distribution of health co-benefits per kiloton of CO2 reduced. It is found that grids with the highest co-abatement rates in conventional air pollutants do not necessarily bring maximum health co-benefits. Although the northeast grid could achieve the largest co-reduction in NOX and PM2.5, it is the south grid that has the largest health co-benefits. The differences in health co-benefits of the same amount of CO2 reduced among grids vary as much as fivefold. Besides, the share of trans-grid health co-benefits can be as high as 14.1% if CO2 reduction takes place in the east grid. Therefore, it is suggested that the health co-benefits of CO2 reduction and their trans-regional distribution should be taken seriously when making regional carbon emission reduction plans, in order to maximize the social benefits of CO2 reduction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission reduction policy making; Co-abatement rates; Health co-benefits; Power sector; Transfer effect","Air pollution; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Geographical distribution; Health; Population statistics; Carbon emission reductions; Health co-benefits; Low-carbon technologies; Meteorological condition; Population densities; Power sector; Regional distribution; Transfer effect; Electric power system interconnection; abatement cost; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; emission control; emissions trading; energy market; environmental economics; policy making; public health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068703527

The interplay between future climate and emission changes in and around the CBW will likely shift the future nutrient deposition abundance and chemical regime (e.g., oxidized vs. reduced nitrogen). In this work, a Representative Concentration Pathway from the Community Earth System Model is dynamically downscaled using a recently updated Weather Research and Forecasting model that subsequently drives the Community Multiscale Air Quality model coupled to the agroeconomic Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model. The relative impacts of emission and climate changes on atmospheric nutrient deposition are explored for a recent historical period and a period centered on 2050. The projected regional emissions in Community Multiscale Air Quality reflect current federal and state regulations, which use baseline and projected emission years 2011 and 2040, respectively. The historical simulations of 2-m temperature (T2) and precipitation (PRECIP) have cool and dry biases, and temperature and PRECIP are projected to both increase. Ammonium wet deposition agrees well with observations, but nitrate wet deposition is underpredicted. Climate and deposition changes increase simulated future ammonium fertilizer application. In the CBW by 2050, these changes (along with widespread decreases in anthropogenic nitrogen oxide and sulfur oxide emissions, and relatively constant ammonia emissions) decrease total nitrogen deposition by 21%, decrease annual average oxidized nitrogen deposition by 44%, and increase reduced nitrogen deposition by 10%. These results emphasize the importance of decreased anthropogenic emissions on the control of future nitrogen loading to the Chesapeake Bay in a changing climate. Published 2019.

In the establishment of practices of greenhouse gas mitigation for this sector, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of soil tillage, with and without N fertilization, on N2O emissions from Oxisols under rainfed maize in the Brazilian Cerrado region. The managements were of monoculture maize under conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT), with (1) and without (0) application of N fertilizer (0 and 257 kg N ha−1). From November 2014 to October 2015, gas emissions were measured. The soil and climate variables were measured and related to the N2O fluxes. In the N-fertilized treatments, N2O fluxes were higher (P &lt; 0.01), ranging from −21 μg m−2 h−1 to 548 μg m−2 h−1 N2O under conventional tillage and from −21 μg m−2 h−1 to 380 μg m−2 h−1 N2O under no-tillage, compared with −6 to 93 μg m−2 h−1 N2O from systems without N application. There was a combined effect of mineral N and water-filled pore space for most N2O fluxes. The emission factors of N2O during maize cultivation were lower than the standard factor (1%) established by the International Panel of Climate Change. During the plant crop cycle, 30% less N2O was emitted from the N-fertilized no-tillage than from the conventional tillage. For the total cumulative N2O (crop cycle + fallow), the N2O emissions from NT1 and CT1 were not different, but 10× higher than those from the respective crops without N fertilization. To the emissions per unit of grain yield, CT1 and NT1 emitted 769 and 391 mg N2O kg−1 grain produced, respectively, and NT1 was most efficient in fertilizer-into-product conversion. Under maize cultivation, the soil acted as N2O source, regardless of the management. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Emission factor; Greenhouse gases; N2O; No-tillage","Crops; Gas emissions; Grain (agricultural product); Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen fertilizers; Soils; Agricultural sector; Climate variables; Conventional tillage; Emission factors; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Management systems; No tillage; Water-filled pore space; Cultivation; nitrogen fertilizer; nitrous oxide; rain; fertilizer; nitrogen dioxide; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; mitigation; nitrogen; soil management; soil nutrient; soil pollution; soil quality; tillage; air and air related phenomena; Article; biome; climate change; crop; crop production; maize; no tillage; nonhuman; priority journal; scrub; soil fertilization; tillage; agriculture; air pollution; Brazil; greenhouse gas; growth, development and aging; maize; prevention and control; procedures; soil; Zea mays; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Brazil; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Gases; Nitrogen Dioxide; Soil; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069701691

Despite a large decline in deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon between 2004 and 2012, frequency and extent of forest fires have been increasing over the last two decades. Fires cause huge carbon emissions, biodiversity losses and local economic costs. Fires are anthropogenic and mostly due to the accidental spread of agricultural fires. Yet, there is little data and knowledge about fire mitigation policies' effectiveness. We experimentally assess the impact of two policies under varying drought risk scenarios among Brazilian smallholders. Command and control is more effective than payments for environmental services. We conjecture that the first policy operates through participants' risk aversion (to the fine) and local demand for justice, while payments seem to switch farmers' motivation from normative to monetary payoffs. We also find evidence of a human-mediated, self-reinforcing loop of droughts and fires: droughts increase the exogenous component of fire risk, reducing farmers' incentives to control own fires and to invest in fire-free techniques. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Brazilian Amazon; Climate change; Coordination games; Forest fires; Framed field experiment","anthropogenic effect; biodiversity; climate change; conservation status; deforestation; drought; environmental policy; experimental design; forest fire; smallholder; Amazonia; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068508033

Decomposing the factors that influence non-CO2 GHG intensity in the livestock sector (LGI) serves as an important reference for the development of specific emission reduction policies. However, the difficulty lies in how to consider the relationship between emission reductions and the human food supply and economic development. In this study, a decomposition framework for the LGI in China was constructed from the concept of “environment–food–economy.” The influencing factors that drove changes in LGI were interpreted at the environmental level, economic level, and scale level. Additionally, the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method was used to quantify the contributions of these three drivers in 31 provinces across China from 1998 to 2016. The results showed that: (1) the LGI of China decreased by 80.02% during the study period. This decrease was mainly driven by the environmental and economic level factors of each province with a respective cumulative contribution of 51.96% and 34.10%. However, the scale-level factor of each province cumulatively suppressed the LGI drop by 6.04% in China. (2) For the contribution of the environmental-level factor, the top five provinces were Henan, Yunnan, Inner Mongolia, Guangxi, and Shandong.

However, existing studies have not yet provided a complete and updated emissions inventory of city-level GHGs for China in terms of city and GHG-type coverage. In this paper, we rigorously assemble a dataset that contains GHG emissions including carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorinated GHGs for 305 Chinese cities, based on a high-resolution emissions database (China High-Resolution Emission Database, CHRED 3.0) and first-hand on-site data collection and verification by 19 groups of 137 researchers using a bottom-up method, and analyze the uncertainty of the emissions. Results show that total GHG emissions are high in cities in eastern China and low in cities in west, while per capita GHG emissions are high in northern cities and low in southern cities. The emissions of four types of GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O and fluoridated GHGs) share different spatial distributions, due to variant industrial structure, energy structure, industry point sources and agricultural surface sources, etc. The uncertainty of GHG emissions is highly related to the source data of cities. Finally, we propose policy recommendations, including improving data quality and strengthening competitions of city-level emission reduction, to improve city-level emissions data integrity and low-carbon development strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; City; Greenhouse gas emissions accounting; Greenhouse gas emissions inventory; Uncertainty analysis","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Uncertainty analysis; China; City; Emission reduction; Emissions inventory; High-resolution emission; Industrial structures; Low-carbon development; Policy recommendations; Greenhouse gases; accountability; bottom-up approach; climate change; data quality; developing world; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; mitigation; point source pollution; pollution policy; spatial distribution; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069914435

Climate change (CC) is expected to impact this carbon pool. To date, large uncertainties still persist on the effects of CC on SOC stocks. In addition, a shortage of data related to regional SOC quantities of tree-covered areas and future changes under CC conditions is recognized. In this work, we used a spatial-explicit modelling approach to estimate the current SOC stock (at 2005) and future changes (at 2095) under CC conditions of the whole forest, tree crop, grassland, and pasture covered areas of Italy. A methodology was preliminarily implemented to obtain spatialized SOC estimates at a regional scale by using the CENTURY 5 model coupled with spatialized vegetation, soil, and climate data. We ran both moderate (RCP4.5) and extreme (RCP8.5) climatic scenarios, and used three Global Circulation Models for each one of the four ecosystems described above. The current SOC stock estimates range from 51.3 (orchards) to 129.5 Mg carbon ha−1 (coniferous forests) and we found an overall SOC stock in Italy ranging from 1320.1 to 1425.1 Tg. SOC projections under CC showed a moderate carbon loss suggesting that forest, grassland, and permanent crop soils could provide an important contribution to climate change mitigation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon stock; CENTURY; Climate change; Land use; SOC; Tree crops","carbon sequestration; climate change; coniferous forest; forest ecosystem; grassland; land use change; plantation; software; soil organic matter; tree; vegetation cover",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068497447

In Germany, a structural change commission has proposed a complete phase-out of coal by 2038. For the city of Leipzig, which is located in a mining region, this opens up the possibility of a post-fossil transformation. Leipzig started an energetic retrofitting process within its housing sector several years ago, and is now planning to phase-out coal-fired district heating as early as 2023. This heat transition could turn Leipzig into one of the pioneering cities of post-fossil transformation. However, such a transition will be accompanied by numerous challenges and problems in the financial, political, technological, and labor sectors. Using the example of Leipzig, we conducted a document analysis and semi-structured interviews to investigate how a transition of the heating sector is conceptualized and planned, which governance structures have emerged, and how they work. In addition, our paper outlines the main interests and goals of the key actors and stakeholders in this transition, as well as their competences and resources. We emphasize that while Leipzig has committed itself to ambitious climate goals, up to now, the city has had no systemic approach for reducing local emissions. Although a window of opportunity has opened for a post-fossil heat transition, this still remains at a niche level due to a lack of interest, path dependencies, and weak governance. © 2019 by the authors.","Heat transition; Local climate policy; Post-fossil city; Urban governance; Urban transformation","coal-fired power plant; environmental policy; heat transfer; heating; housing; labor; stakeholder; structural change; urban development; urban policy; Germany; Leipzig; Saxony",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074835747

This article brings practitioners’ viewpoints into discussion. It presents the way in which two of these networks–the CLER-network for the energy transition (France) and the 100%–Regions network (Germany)–each identifies itself, describes its action and build-up process in relation to government action, and conceives of justice issues in the field of climate energy policy. The analysis shows that these two networks share a lot, including political ends (localisation of energy production, empowerment of rural territories), but practice quite differently as intermediaries for local initiatives. This suggests overcoming the transition management vs grassroots divide present in the literature and paying more attention to hybrids. It also brings emphasis on a type of intermediary's work, which has not been covered by the academic literature, namely that of tinkering with multiple supports and embedding action in local-national-supranational networking in order to maintain continuity. In discussing justice dimensions, we emphasize that motives or ends of action are only reflectively related to ideas of justice: justice issues seem bound up with a politics of assembling, either as a marker of federative action (all fighting for justice) or as a potentially divisive issue. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate-energy; entanglements; justice issues; local initiatives; practitioners' view","environmental justice; environmental policy; governance approach; grassroots level; literature review; local participation; France; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053908770

This survey-based research was conducted with 453 middle and high school students within a large urban area of the western United States. Through structural equation modelling, it was found that knowledge about climate change causes and effects was a weak predictor of behaviour. Whereas social norms accepting of climate change, and the paths from social norms via efficacy and certainty, were strong predictors of behaviour. Certainty of human attribution and efficacy were rather weak predictors, mediating the influence of knowledge and norms. Students’ grade level, participation in clubs and number of science classes primarily affected knowledge and social norms. An implication of this study is that if action-taking is an intended outcome of climate change education efforts, then the learning activities should address efficacy and social norms. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","action; behaviour theory; Climate change education; pro-environmental behaviour; youth",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074561636

For the purposes of development planning and weather and climate prediction, it is important to improve understanding of how LLJs interact with the land surface and upper-atmospheric flow, and collectively, how LLJs have and may change over time. This study details the development and application of a new automated, dynamical objective classification of upper-atmospheric jet stream coupling based on a merging of the Bonner-Whiteman vertical wind shear classification and the finite-amplitude local wave activity diagnostic. The classification approach is transferable globally, but applied here only for the Great Plains (GP) LLJ (GPLLJ). The analysis spans the period from 1901 to 2010, enabled by the ECMWFclimatequality, coupled Earth reanalysis of the twentieth century. Overall, statistically significant declines in total GPLLJ event frequency over the twentieth century are detected across the entire GP corridor and attributed to declines in uncoupled GPLLJ frequency. Composites of lower- and upper-atmospheric flow are shown to capture major differences in the climatological, coupled GPLLJ, and uncoupled GPLLJ synoptic environments. Detailed analyses for southern, central, and northern GP subregions further highlight synoptic differences between weak and strong GPLLJs and provide quantification of correlations between total, coupled, and uncoupled GPLLJ frequencies and relevant atmospheric anomalies. Because uncoupled GPLLJs tend to be associated with decreased precipitation and low-level wind speed and enhanced U.S. ridge strength, this finding may suggest that support for drought over the twentieth century has waned. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climate change; Energy security; Shear flow; Wind; Atmospheric anomaly; Atmospheric flows; Classification approach; Climate prediction; Development and applications; Development planning; Twentieth century; Vertical wind shear; Landforms; climate prediction; jet; land surface; twentieth century; wind shear; wind velocity; wind wave; Great Plains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074956133

The new rule establishes emissions guidelines, including heat-rate efficiency improvements, for states when developing plans to limit GHG emissions. Past studies have indicated that heat-rate efficiency improvements can increase electricity output, leading to a reduction in emissions rates and an increase in emissions levels – a rebound effect that can temper the emissions-reduction benefits of plant-level heat-rate efficiency. This study adds to the literature by examining data on the relationship of plant-level heat-rate efficiency on the rate and level of GHG emissions. We explored three different types of GHGs – carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. Controlling for variation across operators, our results suggest that gains in heat-rate efficiency are associated with higher levels of all three pollutants. Specifically, we found that a ten percent increase in heat-rate efficiency led to an average seven-to-nine percent increase in the level of GHG emissions. Our analysis highlights the need to further study the full effects of heat-rate efficiency policies before such rules are enacted. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity policy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Heat-rate efficiency; Rebound effect; Thermal efficiency","Carbon dioxide; Efficiency; Electric power plants; Emission control; Environmental Protection Agency; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Greenhouse effect; Nitrogen oxides; Efficiency improvement; Electricity policy; Emissions reduction; Heat rate; Rebound effect; Regulatory mechanism; Thermal efficiency; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Greenhouse gases; coal-fired power plant; emission control; energy efficiency; energy policy; greenhouse gas; heat budget; regulatory approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071966053

Gemini Dr., Flagstaff, AZ  86001, United States","Climate variability and change acting at broad scales can lead to divergent changes in plant production at local scales. Quantifying how production responds to variation in climate at local scales is essential to understand underlying ecological processes and inform land management decision-making, but has historically been limited in spatiotemporal scale based on the use of discrete ground-based measurements or coarse resolution satellite observations. With the advent of cloud-based computing through Google Earth Engine (GEE), production responses to climate can be evaluated across broad landscapes though time at a resolution useful for ecological and land management applications. Here, GEE was employed to synthesize a multi-platform Landsat time series (1988–2014) and evaluate relationships between the soil-adjusted vegetation index (a proxy for plant production) and climate across deserts and plant communities of the southwestern U.S. A “climate pivot point” approach was adopted in GEE to assess the trade-off between production responses to increasing wetness and resistances to drought at 30-m resolution. Consistent with a long-term seasonal climate gradient, production was most related to climate variance during the cool-season in the western deserts, during the warm-season in the eastern deserts, and equally related to both seasons within several desert areas. Communities dominated by grasses and deciduous trees displayed large production responses to an increase in wetness and low resistances to water deficit, while shrublands and evergreen woodlands had variable responses and high drought resistances. Production in plant communities that spanned multiple deserts responded differently to seasonal climate variability in each desert. Defining these plant production sensitivities to climate at 30-m resolution in GEE advances forecasts of how long-term climate trajectories may affect carbon storage, wildlife habitat, and the vulnerability of water-limited ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Climate change; Drought; Dryland; Landsat remote sensing time series; Net primary production; Soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI); Southwestern U.S.; Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI)","Arid regions; Decision making; Drought; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Engines; Land use; Landforms; Remote sensing; Time series; Vegetation; Dryland; LANDSAT; Net primary production; Southwestern U.S; Standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI); Vegetation index; Climate change; arid region; climate change; drought stress; evapotranspiration; land management; Landsat; net primary production; remote sensing; satellite data; software; vegetation index; United States; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073226048

Such information is required under internationally agreed REDD+ safeguards, including measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) processes and free, prior, and informed consent (FPIC), and works to establish substantive and normative transparency. However, the sources of, access to, and outcomes from these information flows are still contentious. To address these problems, REDD+ project proponents are increasingly looking to information and communication technologies, such as mobile devices, to improve information gathering, processing, and access. In this article we develop a model and provide tentative examples of how normative and substantive transparency are connected through input and output legitimacy within broader governance contexts. We highlight that even though mobile devices are being used to bring forest communities into the REDD+ process, substantive transparency for emissions reductions through MRV tends to be prioritized over normative dimensions associated with FPIC.

The goal of this study was to investigate species-specific effects of plants on unvegetated soils being colonized by plants as climate changes, and assess how plant-soil feedbacks influence plant succession. Methods: We used lab and field litter additions in an early successional unvegetated ecosystem in the Front Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains to examine litter-driven changes in soil bacterial and fungal communities. We then used plant litter-trained soil as inocula in a greenhouse experiment to test plant-soil feedbacks. Results: We found species-specific effects of litter additions on bacterial and fungal communities in unvegetated soils, which are likely due to both differences in tissue litter chemistry and differences in the litter microbiome. We identified a negative effect of soil trained by litter from the conservative forb Silene acaulis on the growth of the fast-growing bunchgrass Deschampsia cespitosa, likely due to changes in microbial communities that resulted in lowered nitrification rates or to a litter-driven increase in N-immobilization. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the importance of plant specificity and potential negative litter-driven feedbacks in primary succession, which could lead to patchy distribution of plant colonists as climate change allows colonization of these areas. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Litter; Plant-microbe interactions; Plant-soil feedback; Succession","bacterium; climate change; colonization; community structure; elevation; fungus; inoculation; litter; microbial community; nitrification; soil microorganism; soil-vegetation interaction; succession; Colorado; Front Range; Rocky Mountains; Rocky Mountains; Bacteria (microorganisms); Deschampsia cespitosa; Silene acaulis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071493818

In a given system, multiple attractors can co-exist under the effect of the same forcing. At the boundaries of their basins of attraction, small changes produce large effects. Therefore, they are key regions for understanding the system response to perturbations. Here we prove the existence of up to five attractors in a simplified climate system where the planet is entirely covered by the ocean (aquaplanet). These attractors range from a snowball to a hot state without sea ice, and their exact number depends on the details of the coupled atmosphere–ocean–sea ice configuration.

We survey members of the U.S. Department of Energy's Electricity Advisory Committee using a Delphi approach to assess VGI's market potential and challenges.

The survey results are examined in tandem with a targeted review of the literature, current policies, and the ecosystem of stakeholders. We find that experts rate grid-to-vehicle integration as the most valuable mode, and they rate battery degradation and warranty issues as the most important integration challenges.

Promoting alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) is an essential strategy to reduce GHG emissions in the short term. Here, we study the effects of governmental incentives on the diffusion of ethanol and flex-fuel vehicle technologies in Brazil. We use a multi-generation diffusion model which assumes that new technologies introduce fresh market potential for adopters as well as upgraders from established technologies. Our analysis indicates that tax rates affected the adoption of both gasoline and ethanol technology, but for flex vehicles, the effect of taxation is not significant. The effect of fuel price shocks during the 1990s meant that the introduction of ethanol technology made no significant impact on market potential and a negative word-of-mouth effect contributed to the technology's failure. In contrast, the introduction of flex technology led to almost a doubling of total market potential. As policy suggestions, we emphasise the importance of tax reduction in addition to promoting versatile technologies, which insulate consumers against price fluctuations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Alternative fuel vehicles; Diffusion model; Ethanol and flex cars; Tax impacts; Technological generations","Alternative fuels; Commerce; Diffusion; Ethanol; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Vehicles; Alternative fuel vehicles; Diffusion model; Greenhouse gases emissions; Multi-generation diffusion model; Tax impacts; Technological generations; Transportation sector; Word-of-mouth effects; Taxation; alternative fuel; ethanol; incentive; state role; tax system; technology diffusion; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071887151

This implies that the transport sector has to reach zero GHG emissions mainly through direct and indirect electrification in the form of synthetic fuels, such as hydrogen and Fischer-Tropsch (FT) fuels. The results of this research document that this very ambitious target is possible. This research analyses the global solar photovoltaics (PV) demand for achieving the Paris targets in the transport sector by the year 2050. The methodology is composed of the derivation of the transportation demand converted into final energy demand for direct electrification, hydrogen, methane, and FT-fuels production. The power-to-gas (H2, CH4) and power-to-liquids (FT fuels) value chains are applied for the total electricity demand, which will be mostly fulfilled by PV, taking into account previous results concerning the renewable electricity share of the energy transition in the power sector for the world structured in 145 regions and results aggregated to nine major regions. The results show a continuous demand increase for all transportation modes till 2050. The total global PV capacity demand by 2050 for the transport sector is estimated to be about 19.1 TWp, thereof 35%, 25%, 7%, and 33% for direct electrification, hydrogen, synthetic natural gas, and FT fuels, respectively. PV will be the key enabler of a full defossilisation of the transport sector with a demand comparable with the power sector but a slightly later growth dynamic, leading to a combined annual PV capacity demand of about 1.8 TWp around 2050. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","100% renewable energy; electrification; energy system; energy transition; photovoltaic; power-to-gas; power-to-liquids; transport sector","Electric utilities; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; electrification; Energy systems; Energy transitions; Photovoltaic; Renewable energies; Transport sectors; Synthetic fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061508278

Models of tropical GHG fluxes predict that both the frequency of drought events and changes in atmospheric deposition of nitrogen (N) will significantly affect dynamics of soil carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) production and consumption. In this study, we examined the combined effect of a reduction in precipitation and an increase in nutrient availability on soil CO2 and CH4 fluxes in a primary French Guiana tropical forest. Drought conditions were simulated by intercepting precipitation falling through the forest canopy with tarpaulin roofs. Nutrient availability was manipulated through application of granular N and/or phosphorus (P) fertilizer to the soil. Soil water content (SWC) below the roofs decreased rapidly and stayed at continuously low values until roof removal, which as a consequence roughly doubled the duration of the dry season. After roof removal, SWC slowly increased but remained lower than in the control soils even after 2.5 months of wet-season precipitation. We showed that drought-imposed reduction in SWC decreased the CO2 emissions (i.e., CO2 efflux), but strongly increased the CH4 emissions. N, P, and N × P (i.e., NP) additions all significantly increased CO2 emission but had no effect on CH4 fluxes. In treatments where both fertilization and drought were applied, the positive effect of N, P, and NP fertilization on CO2 efflux was reduced. After roof removal, soil CO2 efflux was more resilient in the control plots than in the fertilized plots while there was only a modest effect of roof removal on soil CH4 fluxes. Our results suggest that a combined increase in drought and nutrient availability in soil can locally increase the emissions of both CO2 and CH4 from tropical soils, for a long term. © Copyright © 2019 Bréchet, Courtois, Saint-Germain, Janssens, Asensio, Ramirez-Rojas, Soong, Van Langenhove, Verbruggen and Stahl.","carbon dioxide; drought; fertilization; methane; nitrogen; phosphorus; soil GHG fluxes; tropical forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075969454

With development and population growth, increases in ambient air pollution are anticipated. Combined with an aging population and increasing burden of chronic diseases, ambient air pollution will remain a concern for India well into the current century. Air quality measurements make critical contributions to the identification and prioritization of sources and locations of greatest concern, benchmarking against standards and guidelines, and in the evaluation of effectiveness of actions to reduce emissions. We compare the density of India's monitoring network with that of comparator countries and find large differences. For example, given the ~200 PM2.5 monitoring sites in operation during the 2010–2016 period, we find that India's monitor density of ~0.14 monitors/million persons (1 monitor for every 6.8 million people) is well below that of other highly populated countries such as China (1.2 monitors/million persons), the USA (3.4 monitors/million persons), Japan (0.5 monitors/million persons), Brazil (1.8) and most European countries (2–3 monitors/million persons). To address these gaps between India and monitor densities of comparator countries will require 1600–4000 monitors (1.2–3 monitors/million persons) at an estimated capital (annual operating) cost of US $212–540 ($106–270) million. Even at these densities, only relatively basic information on common air pollutants at high temporal, but limited spatial, resolution would be available. Small-scale variability in air pollution levels within urban areas would not be well-characterized, nor would there be information on chemical constituents useful for evaluating and improving simulations and forecasts, or for characterizing source contributions. As a sufficiently dense traditional network is developed over time, the potential for an integrated monitoring framework to serve as a near-term complement to a traditional network is assessed. In this design, a smaller number of traditional monitoring sites would be linked to a single advanced surface monitoring station in each of ~11 airsheds identified as a minimal number for India. These sites would combine measurement of chemical speciation of particulate matter with measurements of aerosol scatter and aerosol optical depth to link measurements with global and regional satellite-based estimates. In turn, the advanced and traditional sites could serve as calibration nodes for low-cost sensor networks designed to complement periodic mobile monitoring campaigns and/or land use regression models, to provide high spatial and temporal resolution. Such a framework could be established at a substantially reduced cost relative to that of a traditional networks, subject to specific design and complexity considerations. The same general approach may also be applicable to the many other countries with limited or no air quality monitoring and where estimates suggest air quality is a concern. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","India; Monitoring; Network; Particulate matter","Aerosols; Benchmarking; Chemical speciation; Comparator circuits; Comparators (optical); Land use; Monitoring; Networks (circuits); Particles (particulate matter); Population statistics; Regression analysis; Sensor networks; Sensor nodes; Air quality measurements; India; Land-use regression models; Particulate Matter; Small scale variability; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Standards and guidelines; World Health Organization; Air quality; aerosol; aging population; air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; benchmarking; guideline; optical depth; particulate matter; population growth; spatial resolution; speciation (chemistry); aerosol; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; benchmarking; Brazil; chemical composition; China; comparative study; controlled study; disease burden; economic development; Europe; forecasting; human; India; Japan; light scattering; motor vehicle; optical depth; particulate matter; population health; priority journal; surgery; United States; urban area; China; India; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071928029

However, epidemiologic evidence suggests that current knowledge does not comprehensively capture all causes of death associated with PM2.5 exposure. Objective: To systematically identify causes of death associated with PM2.5 pollution and estimate the burden of death for each cause in the United States. Design, Setting, and Participants: In a cohort study of US veterans followed up between 2006 and 2016, ensemble modeling was used to identify and characterize morphology of the association between PM2.5 and causes of death. Burden of death associated with PM2.5 exposure in the contiguous United States and for each state was then estimated by application of estimated risk functions to county-level PM2.5 estimates from the US Environmental Protection Agency and cause-specific death rate data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Main Outcomes and Measures: Nonlinear exposure-response functions of the association between PM2.5 and causes of death and burden of death associated with PM2.5. Exposures: Annual mean PM2.5 levels. Results: A cohort of 4522160 US veterans (4243462 [93.8%] male; median [interquartile range] age, 64.1 [55.7-75.5] years; 3702942 [82.0%] white, 667550 [14.8%] black, and 145593 [3.2%] other race) was followed up for a median (interquartile range) of 10.0 (6.8-10.2) years. In the contiguous United States, PM2.5 exposure was associated with excess burden of death due to cardiovascular disease (56070.1 deaths [95% uncertainty interval {UI}, 51940.2-60318.3 deaths]), cerebrovascular disease (40466.1 deaths [95% UI, 21770.1-46487.9 deaths]), chronic kidney disease (7175.2 deaths [95% UI, 5910.2-8371.9 deaths]), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (645.7 deaths [95% UI, 300.2-2490.9 deaths]), dementia (19851.5 deaths [95% UI, 14420.6-31621.4 deaths]), type 2 diabetes (501.3 deaths [95% UI, 447.5-561.1 deaths]), hypertension (30696.9 deaths [95% UI, 27518.1-33881.9 deaths]), lung cancer (17545.3 deaths [95% UI, 15055.3-20464.5 deaths]), and pneumonia (8854.9 deaths [95% UI, 7696.2-10710.6 deaths]). Burden exhibited substantial geographic variation. Estimated burden of death due to nonaccidental causes was 197905.1 deaths (95% UI, 183463.3-213644.9 deaths); mean age-standardized death rates (per 100000) due to nonaccidental causes were higher among black individuals (55.2 [95% UI, 50.5-60.6]) than nonblack individuals (51.0 [95% UI, 46.4-56.1]) and higher among those living in counties with high (65.3 [95% UI, 56.2-75.4]) vs low (46.1 [95% UI, 42.3-50.4]) socioeconomic deprivation; 99.0% of the burden of death due to nonaccidental causes was associated with PM2.5 levels below standards set by the US Environmental Protection Agency. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, 9 causes of death were associated with PM2.5 exposure. The burden of death associated with PM2.5 was disproportionally borne by black individuals and socioeconomically disadvantaged communities.

However, this approach can be limited by several factors such as field accessibility, financial cost, area size, climate, and public disapproval. We recommend the use of multiscale hyperspectral remote sensing to mitigate the disadvantages of traditional exploration techniques. The proposed workflow analyzes a possible target at different levels of spatial detail. This method is particularly beneficial in inaccessible and remote areas with little infrastructure, because it allows for a systematic, dense and generally noninvasive surveying. After a satellite regional reconnaissance, a target is characterized in more detail by plane-based hyperspectral mapping. Subsequently, Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS)-mounted hyperspectral sensors are deployed on selected regions of interest to provide a higher level of spatial detail. All hyperspectral data are corrected for radiometric and geometric distortions. End-member modeling and classification techniques are used for rapid and accurate lithological mapping. Validation is performed via field spectroscopy and portable XRF as well as laboratory geochemical and spectral analyses. The resulting spectral data products quickly provide relevant information on outcropping lithologies for the field teams. We show that the multiscale approach allows defining the promising areas that are further refined using RPAS-based hyperspectral imaging. We further argue that the addition of RPAS-based hyperspectral data can improve the detail of field mapping in mineral exploration, by bridging the resolution gap between airplane- and ground-based data. RPAS-based measurements can supplement and direct geological observation rapidly in the field and therefore allow better integration with in situ ground investigations. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach at the Lofdal Carbonatite Complex in Namibia, which has been previously subjected to rare earth elements exploration. The deposit is located in a remote environment and characterized by difficult terrain which limits ground surveys. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbonatite complex; Hyperspectral sensors; Mineral exploration; Multiscale; Namibia; Remotely Piloted Aircraft System","Deposits; Exploratory geochemistry; Hyperspectral imaging; Lithology; Mapping; Minerals; Rare earths; Remote control; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Spectrum analysis; Surveys; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Carbonatites; Hyperspectral sensors; Multiscale; Namibia; Remotely piloted aircraft; Mineral exploration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074645303

The present work evaluates the energy and economic performances of the aqueous ammonia technology applied to a coal-fired power plant. First, the kinetics of absorption are characterized in the Aspen Plus software and are calibrated against the experimental data from the Munmorah pilot plant. Then, the validated model is used for sizing the full-scale plant columns and for simulating the overall capture plant. After determining the sizes of the plant components and their energy consumptions, the capture plant is integrated with the coal-fired power plant, and the economic analysis is assessed with both retrofitted and green-field approaches as described in reports from the European Benchmarking Task Force and the United States National Energy Technology Laboratory, respectively. The novelties presented here are the new approach in the absorption reactions implemented in the rate-based model, which changes the dependency of the ammonia concentration in the absorption process, as well as the full economic analysis with both retrofitted and green-field assumptions, which enable a sound comparison of the outcomes. The results with the retrofitted approach compared with the monoethanolamine case of the European Benchmarking Task Force report returned higher electric efficiency (36.3% versus 33.50%), lower levelized cost of electricity (87.66 €/MWhel versus 92.27 €/MWhel), and lower cost of carbon dioxide avoided (47.03 €/tonCO2 versus 51.62 €/tonCO2). The results using the green-field approach compared against the Cansolv case of the National Energy Technology Laboratory report returned higher electric efficiency (33.06% versus 32.50%), lower cost of electricity (124.3 $/MWhel versus 133.2 $/MWhel) and lower cost of carbon dioxide avoided (66.5 $/tonCO2 versus 75.25 $/tonCO2).

The livestock industry, and in particular that of poultry, is recognized as being responsible for the greatest share of ammonia emissions in the environment, and for this reason various strategies have been considered recently to reduce emission levels in this sector. In this work an innovative farming system without litter was analyzed, the AviHome Flooring System, the topic of an experiment funded by the Region of Umbria as part of the 2014–2020 Rural Development Program. The objective is to verify the properties of the AviHome Flooring system, as regards the reducing of ammonia emissions and productive and economic performance, as well as some parameters for assessing animal welfare. Using the Life Cycle Assessment and Life Cycle Costing methods, it was possible to consider environmental and economic aspects jointly in comparison with the traditional intensive poultry farming system. The analysis demonstrated that the use of the system leads to an actual improvement in animal welfare and a lower environmental impact of the farm, without negatively affecting the farm's economic performance.

Even in regions with excellent availability of wind and solar resources, such factors as limited availability of flexible renewable energy resources, low flexibility of demand, and high seasonality of energy supply and demand can impede the transition. All these factors can be found for the case of Kazakhstan, a mostly steppe country with harsh continental climate conditions and an energy intensive economy dominated by fossil fuels. Results of the simulation using the LUT Energy System Transition modelling tool show that even under these conditions, the power and heat supply system of Kazakhstan can transition towards 100% renewable energy by 2050. A renewable-based electricity only system will be lower in cost than the existing fossil-based system, with levelised cost of electricity of 54 €/MWh in 2050. The heat system transition requires installation of substantial storage capacities to compensate for seasonal heat demand variations. Electrical heating will become the main source of heat for both district and individual heating sectors with heat cost of about 45 €/MWh and electricity cost of around 56 €/MWh for integrated sectors in 2050.

Balancing an electricity system with 30-100% variable PV and wind is straightforward using off-the-shelf techniques comprising stronger interconnection over large areas to smooth out local weather, storage, demand management, and occasional spillage of renewable electricity. The overwhelming dominance of PV, wind, and hydroelectricity in new renewable energy deployment means that renewable electricity is tracking toward near equivalence with renewable energy. A global survey of off-river (closed-loop) pumped hydro energy storage sites identified 616 000 promising sites around the world with a combined storage capacity of 23 million GWh, which is two orders of magnitude more than required to support 100% global renewable electricity. This is significant because pumped hydro storage is the lowest cost storage method and is available off-the-shelf in large scale. Australia is deploying PV and wind at a rate of 250 W per year per capita, which is four to five times faster than in the European Union, the USA, Japan, and China. This is significant because it demonstrates that rapid deployment of PV and wind is feasible, with consequent rapid reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. © 2011-2012 IEEE.","100% renewable energy; Photovoltaics (PV); pumped hydro energy storage (PHES); wind energy","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Solar power generation; Surveys; Wind power; Capacity additions; Orders of magnitude; Photovoltaics; Pumped-hydro energy storages; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Renewable energy deployments; Solar photovoltaics; Electric energy storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077515529

Most existing analyses consider limited factors in isolation, such as investment costs or energy storage, and do not provide rigorous support for understanding which combinations of factors could underpin a leading role for wind and solar. This study addresses this gap by undertaking a systematic sensitivity analysis using a state-of-the-art energy-economic model to comprehensively evaluate the relative magnitudes of five key drivers that may influence future wind and solar deployment in the United States. We find future wind and solar capital costs and carbon policy are the dominant factors, causing the average wind and solar share to vary by 38 and 31 percentage points, respectively. Transmission and storage availability have much smaller effects, causing the average share to vary by no more than 15 and 5 percentage points, respectively. No single factor unilaterally determines wind and solar deployment. The variable renewable share of electricity generation never reaches 100% nationally in any scenario even with low-cost storage, as decreasing marginal returns at higher deployments eventually outpace cost reductions. Average wind and solar shares and ranges of possible outcomes are higher in this study relative to recent multi-model comparison studies due to lower renewable costs and the potential for more stringent policies. Understanding drivers and barriers to renewable deployment has important ramifications for technology developers, infrastructure, market design, and policymakers, and this research provides insights as to which combinations of drivers lead to the greatest share of economic wind and solar deployment and why. © 2019 The Author(s).

Carbon isotopic composition studies indicate that ANME are metabolically diverse and able to assimilate metabolites including methane, methanol, acetate, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). Our data support the interpretation that ANME in marine sediments at methane seeps assimilate both methane and DIC, and the carbon isotopic compositions of the tetrapyrrole coenzyme F430 and the membrane lipids archaeol and hydroxy-archaeol reflect their relative proportions of carbon from these substrates. Methane is assimilated via the methyl group of CH3-tetrahydromethanopterin (H4MPT) and DIC from carboxylation reactions that incorporate free intracellular DIC. F430 was enriched in 13C (mean δ13C = −27‰ for Hydrate Ridge and −80‰ for the Santa Monica Basin) compared to the archaeal lipids (mean δ13C = −97‰ for Hydrate Ridge and −122‰ for the Santa Monica Basin). We propose that depending on the side of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle used to synthesize F430, its carbon was derived from 76% DIC and 24% methane via the reductive side or 57% DIC and 43% methane via the oxidative side. ANME lipids are predicted to contain 42% DIC and 58% methane, reflecting the amount of each assimilated into acetyl-CoA. With isotope models that include variable fractionation during biosynthesis for different carbon substrates, we show the estimated amounts of DIC and methane can result in carbon isotopic compositions of − 73‰ to − 77‰ for F430 and − 105‰ for archaeal lipids, values close to those for Santa Monica Basin. The F430 δ13C value for Hydrate Ridge was 13C-enriched compared with the modeled value, suggesting there is divergence from the predicted two carbon source models. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","archaea; extremophiles; metabolism; uncultured microbes","biogeochemistry; carbon isotope; chemical reaction; coalbed methane; dissolved inorganic carbon; enzyme; enzyme activity; extremophile; isotopic composition; lipid; marine sediment; membrane; metabolism; methane; methanogenesis; methanogenic bacterium; sediment chemistry; California; Hydrate Ridge; Pacific Ocean; Santa Monica Basin; United States; Archaea; carbon; factor F430; membrane lipid; metalloporphyrin; methane; archaeon; California; chemistry; metabolism; microbiology; Oregon; oxidation reduction reaction; Pacific Ocean; sediment; Archaea; California; Carbon Isotopes; Geologic Sediments; Membrane Lipids; Metalloporphyrins; Methane; Oregon; Oxidation-Reduction; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073581698

Recent advancement of the technique shows that it can constrain planet-scale objects beyond our native galaxy by studying their induced microlensing signatures, the energy shift of emission lines originating in the vicinity of the black hole of high redshift background quasars. We employ this technique to exert effective constraints on the planet-mass object distribution within two additional lens systems, Q J0158-4325 (z l = 0.317) and SDSS J1004+4112 (z l = 0.68), using Chandra observations of the two gravitationally lensed quasars. The observed variations of the emission line peak energy can be explained as microlensing of the FeKα emission region induced by planet-mass microlenses. To corroborate this, we perform microlensing simulations to determine the probability of a caustic transiting the source region and compare this with the observed line shift rates. Our analysis yields constraints on the substellar population, with masses ranging from Moon (10-8 M o) to Jupiter (10-3 M o) sized bodies, within these galaxy or cluster scale structures, with total mass fractions of ∼3 × 10-4 and ∼1 × 10-4 with respect to halo mass for Q J0158-4325 and SDSS J1004+4112, respectively. Our analysis suggests that unbound planet-mass objects are universal in galaxies, and we surmise the objects to be either free-floating planets or primordial black holes. We present the first ever constraints on the substellar mass distribution in the intracluster light of a galaxy cluster. Our results provide the most stringent limit on the mass fraction of primordial black holes at the mass range. © 2019. The American Astronomical Society.

One alternative to overcome this environmental issue is the CO2 valorization through the storage and in situ hydrogenation to CH4. In this work, Ru-CaO/Al2O3 and Ru-Na2CO3/Al2O3 dual function materials are synthesized with different adsorbent loadings, namely 5, 10 and 15 wt.%. The prepared catalysts are characterized in terms of surface area by N2 adsorption and desorption, crystallinity by XRD, Ru dispersion by H2-chemisorption and TEM, basicity by CO2-TPD and reducibility and oxidation state of the noble metal by H2-TPR and XPS. Temperature programmed surface reaction experiments with H2 on samples with pre-adsorbed CO2 reveal that the decomposition of surface carbonates and the subsequent hydrogenation occurs at lower temperatures for catalysts containing Na2CO3 than CaO. A complete reaction scheme describing the CO2 adsorption and hydrogenation process has been proposed based on the temporal evolution of reactants and products. Oxides (CaO or Na2O) and hydrated oxides (Ca(OH)2 or NaOH) have been identified as CO2 storage sites, the former oxides being more reactive towards the CO2 adsorption. CH4, H2O and minor amounts of CO are detected during the hydrogenation step. The CO2 storage and hydrogenation to CH4 is promoted with increasing the adsorbent loading. Maximum CH4 production of 414 μmol g−1 is observed for Ru15%CaO/Al2O3 at 400 °C. High temperature is needed to efficiently decompose the highly stable carbonates formed onto CaO. On the other hand, the higher Ru dispersion along with a lower stability of carbonates in Ru10%Na2CO3/Al2O3 promotes CH4 formation (383 μmol g−1) at notably lower temperature, i.e. 310 °C. Thus, Ru10%Na2CO3/Al2O3 is regarded as a suitable catalyst for the CO2 storage and in situ hydrogenation to CH4. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 hydrogenation; CO2 storage; Dual function material; Methanation; Ruthenium","Adsorption; Alkalinity; Aluminum compounds; Carbon dioxide; Carbonates; Catalysts; Crystallinity; Dispersions; Fossil fuels; Hydrated lime; Hydrogenation; Methanation; Ruthenium; Sodium Carbonate; Sodium hydroxide; Storage (materials); Surface reactions; CO2 hydrogenation; CO2 storage; Dual function; Environmental issues; Hydrogenation process; In-situ hydrogenation; Lower temperatures; Temperature programmed surface reaction; Ruthenium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068042686

Simon Sandstone. Using site-specific data and samples, batch experiments were conducted at reservoir conditions and the reactive transport code TOUGHREACT was used to model the CO2 migration and interactions in the injection formation. In the model, most of the mineral alteration occurred after the injection was completed and brine displaced the CO2 at the base of the plume. K-feldspar dissolution led to a nearly 10% increase in porosity which is a maximum estimate of alteration because, the model omits mineral transformations and may underestimate clay precipitation and the effects of grain coatings. The batch experiments recreated these conditions and showed a little alteration. In both the model and experiments, the bulk of the mineralogy remained inert. Calcite precipitated within the modeled plume where the transformation of K-feldspar to clays buffered the pH, though this process only produced minor mineral sequestration. Less-permeable layers in the model baffled the ascent of the CO2 plume and caused it to spread laterally. The plume did not reach the upper third of the Mt. Simon Sandstone. Both the model and the batch experiments show that the bulk of the Mt. Simon Sandstone will undergo little change due to CO2 injection, and the batch experiments show the feldspar dissolution in the model is likely limited. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Batch experiment; Carbon sequestration; Kinetics; Mt.

National policies and strategies in many countries promote their bioeconomies. The importance of agricultural crops and residues as raw materials for the bioeconomy is increasingly recognised, but agricultural production also contributes to large impacts on nature and environment. With the aim of assessing the governance measures and their effectiveness in addressing the sustainability of bioenergy and biofuel production, the purpose of this study was to map the governance complex relevant to agricultural crop production in Denmark, and to identify the achievements, challenges and lessons learned. Methods: The analysis is based on a review and assessment of publicly available databases, inventory reports and scientific literature on governance measures and their effectiveness. Governance here includes a variety of legislation, agreements, conventions and standardisation. Environmental sustainability is represented by greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector, soil carbon, water quality and biodiversity. Results: The agricultural sector has a significant impact on Danish climate performance and on landscapes in the form of soil carbon losses, leaching of nutrients to water bodies and pressures on biodiversity. The governance complex addressing these issues is made up of a variety of state regulation and co-regulation between state and firms, state and NGOs, or NGOs and firms. Much regulation is adopted from EU directives and implemented nationally. Conclusions: The analysis found that greenhouse gas emission is a virtually unregulated field and additional regulation is required to live up to Denmark's 2030 emission reduction targets. The regulatory framework for soil carbon is criticised for its complexity, its competing instruments and its recognition procedures of voluntary co-regulation. For water quality governance measures in place have improved water quality, but it is still difficult to achieve the goals of the Water Framework Directive. It remains a challenge to protect biodiversity in agriculture. Biodiversity is mainly governed by national and supranational regulation, but co-regulating between state and firms and NGOs and firms have been initiated in the framework of the Agricultural Agreement. © 2019 The Author(s).","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Bioenergy; Biomass; GHG emissions; Governance; Soil carbon; Sustainability; Water quality","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Biomass; Crops; Cultivation; Emission control; Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Public policy; Soils; Water conservation; Water quality; Agricultural productions; Bio-energy; Emission reduction targets; Environmental sustainability; GHG emission; Governance; Soil carbon; Water Framework Directives; Sustainable development; agricultural production; biodiversity; bioenergy; biofuel; energy crop; environmental economics; governance approach; regulatory framework; species inventory; United Nations; water quality; Denmark; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075802153

The intermittency of renewable generation, and concerns about energy security, require us to become more independent of central grid operation by use of local or regional (micro-grid) electricity systems. Distributed generation, allied to the commercial availability of battery storage products, permits this–the pathway to energy autonomy. This paper reviews the contribution of different renewable energy sources (RES), trends in energy storage technologies to enable energy autonomy, and the centralised and decentralised techniques that coordinate the associated energy management. The paper covers energy autonomy at different scales, ranging from household levels to district levels. The improvements in grid independency are measured accordingly.

Copenhagen, Denmark, is one of them and aims to achieve a CO2-neutral energy system in 2025. Reaching this goal requires, among other, changes in energy supply portfolio, which can be assessed using energy systems modelling. The aim of this study is to construct and evaluate scenarios for sustainable electricity and heat supply in Greater Copenhagen with a particular focus on the new district, Nordhavn. The energy scenarios are modelled with the energy system model Balmorel, and they are assessed and compared with focus on heat and electricity prices and CO2 emissions. Sensitivity analyses are conducted considering changes in the coefficient of performance (COP) of heat pumps and the discount rate. The results show that expanding Copenhagen’s district heating system to Nordhavn is a promising solution from a socio-economic perspective. If it is chosen that the heating supply in Nordhavn should come from a local source, power-to-heat technologies are preferred. Despite the narrow geographical focus, the challenges discussed in this paper and the method developed are relevant for other urban areas in Europe that aspire to have sustainable energy systems. © 2019, Aalborg University press.

In Australia, coastal wetlands have been transformed to ‘ponded pasture’ for cattle grazing which has resulted in a loss of saline wetlands, increased methane emissions, and impacts on species like fish and birds. Reconversion of these areas to saline wetlands is a potential climate change mitigation strategy, but given they occur at the intersection of private and public ownership regimes, some specific legal issues must be considered. This article provides an analysis of the legal enablers and barriers associated with reconverting ponded pastures or other hydrologically modified coastal land to saline wetlands for climate change mitigation, using Queensland, Australia as a case study. While projects are clearly possible, some of the key factors to consider in order to reduce legal risk and liability include: whether the law permits reflooding and what permits are required; clarifying land and carbon rights, which may require negotiation with the state government; and understanding the liabilities for potential impacts on adjacent land and biota. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Blue carbon; Law; Ponded pasture; Saltmarsh","climate change; coastal wetland; land use planning; ownership; pasture; saltmarsh; Australia; Queensland; Aves; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072246679

Thus, NOx emissions from individual power plants can be resolved and quantified even on top of considerably high urban pollution from the Saudi Arabian capital city Riyadh.

Low-dust harvesters are viewed as one of the strategies to reduce PM emissions and help achieve the state’s PM2.5 attainment targets. This paper evaluates the potential emission reduction from using low-dust harvesters compared to the conventional. Orchard boundary measurements of PM concentrations were collected to back-calculate emission rates using inverse dispersion modeling. Emissions from four low-dust harvesters (Flory 850, Exact E3800, Weiss-McNair 9800 and Jack Rabbit) were compared to those from a conventional harvester (Flory 480) in two orchards, located in the Fresno County. Emissions of PM2.5, PM10 and total suspended particles were observed to be lower for all new harvesters compared to the conventional harvester. The range of reductions varies from about 40% to 77% in PM2.5 emissions based on emission factors generated. The average ratio of PM10 to PM2.5 emissions is about 12.5%. The results of these tests imply that these new low-dust harvesters are capable of reducing PM emissions without affecting product quality. Therefore, the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District should consider including the use of these new harvesters in the conservation management practices (CMP) for the reduction of PM emissions in the valley. Implications: The results of this research indicate that almond low-dust harvesters could potentially reduce PM emissions over traditional harvesters without any negative effect on product quality. Therefore, the use of these new harvesters should be considered as part of almond best management practices and updating of emissions inventory in the San Joaquin Valley. © 2019, © 2019 A&WMA.",,"Air pollution; Dust; Emission control; Harvesters; Inverse problems; Orchards; Particles (particulate matter); Quality control; Air Pollution Control District; Best management practices; Boundary measurements; Conservation management; Emission reduction; Emissions inventory; Harvesting operations; Particulate matter emissions; Particulate emissions; air pollution control; almond; dispersion; dust; nut; orchard; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; product quality; air pollutant; air pollution; California; chemistry; dust; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; exhaust gas; particulate matter; prevention and control; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; California; Conservation of Natural Resources; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Nuts; Particulate Matter; Prunus dulcis; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073963468

With 20% of arid systems degraded and estimates of up to 10 Mha of land degrading each year, this issue is of global importance. In the semi-arid Pilbara region of north-west Western Australia, climatic projections suggest reductions in annual rainfall and high unpredictability of rain events. However, as these ancient landscapes are already degraded due to meteorological processes and anthropogenic activities, such as mining, the rehabilitation of this land is severely challenging. Here, we present a case study that examines, under different rainfall scenarios, the effect of two inorganic amendments (gypsum and urea) on substrate quality and growth of two plant species (Acacia inaequilatera and Triodia wiseana) native to the Pilbara region. Through an extensive glasshouse experiment, two doses of inorganic amendments were tested and compared to unamended mining waste (overburden) substrates extracted from an iron-ore mine of moderately alkaline pH and low nitrogen status. Our results showed that the addition of urea (nitrogen-based fertiliser) produced a three-fold increase of plant growth in A. inaequilatera and up to a 25-fold increase in T. wiseana compared to unamended substrates when grown under the higher watering regime but this effect was not evident in the lower water regimes. The inorganic amendments decreased pH and increased EC, total nitrogen and N-mineralisation but did not have a significant effect on soil microbial activity. Overall, water was the dominant driver for determining the effectiveness of the substrate amendments to improve the quality of mine waste substrates and increase plant growth. This study contributes to unravelling the role of inorganic amendments in post-mining rehabilitation in arid regions faced with climate change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Arid systems; Climate change; Land rehabilitation; Soil indicators; Substrate amendments","arid environment; arid region; climate change; dicotyledon; global climate; growth; human activity; landscape; microbial activity; mine waste; rainfall; semiarid region; soil microorganism; substrate; water availability; Australia; Pilbara; Western Australia; Acacia; Triodia; Wiseana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067595871

Several full-Heusler compounds are expected to be half-metallic ferromagnets, e.g. chemically-ordered L21 or B2 Co2MnSi. However, most cubic full-Heusler alloys have small magneto-crystalline anisotropy meaning that PMA is difficult to achieve in thin film geometries of devices. Addressing this limitation, Butler et al. (2014) calculate PMA and full spin-polarization in ultra-thin (2–3 nm) chemically-ordered Co2MnSi with an epitaxial coherent interface to rock-salt MgO (0 0 1). Experimentally, PMA in sputter-deposited ultra-thin films with full-Heusler compositions was reported though with adjacent layers of Pd or Pt. We investigate structural origins of such PMA using a test case of ultra-thin Co2MnSi films prepared by magnetron sputter-deposition, adjacent to a MgO layer to represent a tunneling barrier, and to a Pd buffer layer. We measure PMA, with an energy density of 7.8 ± 1.8 Merg/cc at 5 K, when a Pd layer is adjacent to Co2MnSi, following annealing in a narrow temperature range, around 350 °C. This ferromagnetism originates from nanometer scale regions, below 5 nm in size, having a relatively low saturation magnetization, 550 ± 50 emu/cc at low temperatures. Following thermal annealing, significant compositional intermixing between Co2MnSi films and adjacent layers, Co with Pd and Mn with MgO, was measured by electron energy-loss and angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies.

Urban green space in cities is also recognized as a crucial adaptation response to changes in climate and its subsequent effects. The exploration of conceptual and practical intersections between human health, green spaces, and climate action is needed. Evidence-based guidance is needed for stakeholders, practitioners, designers, and citizens in order to assess and manage urban green spaces that maximize co-benefits for both human health and climate resilience. This paper proposes interventions that provide strategic green space enhancement at the neighborhood and block scale. We propose eight tangible green space interventions and associated metrics to integrate climate resilience and population health co-benefits into urban green space design and planning: View from within, Plant entrances, Bring nature nearby, Retain the mature, Generate diversity, Create refuge, Connect experiences, and Optimize green infrastructure. These interventions represent a hierarchy of functional design concepts that respond to experiential qualities and physical/psychological dimensions of health, and which enhance resilience at a range of social scales from the individual to the neighborhood. The interventions also reveal additional research needs in green space design, particularly in neighborhood-level contexts. © 2019 by the authors.

Polyoxymethylene dimethyl ether (POMDME, short OME) offers particular characteristics (i.e. no C–C bonds, high cetane number, high potential to reduce greenhouse gases, when produced with renewable energy, etc.) which are favourable to be combusted in a standard Diesel engine and allow the potential to overcome the classical NOx-PM trade off. In order to capture the full potential of this fuel, its combustion characteristics under diesel engine conditions need to be investigated. In the present work the combustion behaviour of neat OME in a composition of approximately 80% OME3 and 20% OME4 has been investigated. For the measurement campaign, a heavy duty single cylinder research engine was used. For the operation with OME, the eight injector nozzle holes were increased from 0.24 mm to 0.29 mm. The operating conditions included variations in fuel, nozzle size, EGR, boost pressure and load. A significant number of operating conditions with OME have been investigated under stoichiometric global air/fuel ratio conditions. It was observed that the ignition delay of OME is shorter than the one of Diesel, due to the higher cetane number of the oxygenated fuel. Moreover OME showed a faster combustion. The reason for this fast combustion behaviour has not been found in the lower demand on air directly, but mainly in the higher turbulence level for mixing due to combustion closer to the injector nozzle tip as a result of the lower oxygen demand. A computationally fast description for steady state sprays has been used to express a characteristic time scale which is required for the fuel to mix with surrounding air up to stoichiometric conditions. The resulting characteristic number τspray correlates well with the characteristic mixing rate τmix, calculated from the measurement data. This description offers the possibility to predict the diffusion combustion rate in a very wide range of engine operation parameter variations, including changes in nozzle size, fuel injection pressure or fuel composition with strongly air demand. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Characteristic mixing rate; Diffusion combustion analysis; OME; Oxygenated fuels; Polyoxymethylene dimethyl ether; POMDME","Acetal resins; Combustion; Diesel engines; Direct injection; Economic and social effects; Ethers; Greenhouse gases; Mixing; Nozzles; Diffusion combustion; Dimethyl ethers; Mixing rates; Oxygenated fuel; POMDME; Fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070496073

In this paper, we provide the first systematic and globally commensurable measures of street-network sprawl based on graph-theoretic and geographic concepts. Using data on all 46 million km of mapped streets worldwide, we compute these measures for the entire Earth at the highest possible resolution. We generate a summary scalar measure for street-network sprawl, the Street-Network Disconnectedness index (SNDi), as well as a data-driven multidimensional classification that identifies eight empirical street-network types that span the spectrum of connectivity, from gridiron to dendritic (tree-like) and circuitous networks. Our qualitative validation shows that both the scalar and multidimensional measures are meaningfully comparable within and across countries, and successfully capture varied dimensions of walkability and urban development. We further show that in select high-income countries, our measures explain cross-sectional variation in household transportation decisions, and a one standard-deviation increase in SNDi is associated with an extra 0.25 standard deviations in cars owned per household. We aggregate our measures to the scale of countries, cities, and smaller geographies and describe patterns in street-network sprawl around the world. Latin America, Japan, South Korea, much of Europe, and North Africa stand out for their low levels of street-network sprawl, while the highest levels are found in south-east Asia, the United States, and the British Isles. Our calculations provide the foundation for future work to understand urban processes, predict future pathways of transportation energy consumption and emissions, and identify effective policy responses. © 2019 Barrington-Leigh, Millard-Ball.

Many cities worldwide are looking forward to becoming smart. One of the most popular use cases in smart cities is the implementation of smart parking solutions, as they allow people to optimize time, reduce fuel consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions. Smart parking solutions have a defined architecture with particular components (sensors, communication protocols, and software solutions). Although there are only three components that compose a smart parking solution, it is important to mention that each component has many types that can be used in the deployment of these solutions. This paper identifies the most used types of every component and highlights usage trends in the established analysis period. It provides a complementary perspective and represents a very useful source of information. The scientific community could use this information to decide regarding the selection of types of components to implement a smart parking solution. For this purpose, herein we review several works related to smart parking solutions deployment. To achieve this goal, a semi-cyclic adaptation of the action research methodology combined with a systematic review is used to select papers related to the subject of study. The most relevant papers were reviewed to identify subcategories for each component; these classifications are presented in tables to mark the relevance of each paper accordingly. Trends of usage in terms of sensors, protocols and software solutions are analyzed and discussed in every section. In addition to the trends of usage, this paper determines a guide of complementary features from the type of components that should be considered when implementing a smart parking solution. © 2019 by the authors.

These specialist herbivore insects can induce and manipulate plant structure and metabolism throughout gall development and may affect plant volatile emission. Consequently, volatile emission from altered metabolism contribute to eavesdropping cueing. Eavesdropping can be part of adaptive strategies used by evolution for both galling insects and the entire-associated community in order to cue some interaction response. This is in contrast to some herbivores associated with delayed induced responses, altering plant metabolites during the short time while they feed. Due to the different lifestyles of the galling organism, which are associated with different plant tissues and organs (e.g leaves, flowers or fruits), a distinct diversity of organisms may eavesdrop on induced volatiles interacting with the galls. Furthermore, the eavesdropping cues may be defined according to the phenological coupling between galling organism and host plant, which results from the development of a gall structure. For instance, when plants release volatile-induced defenses after galling insects’ activity, another interactor may perceive these volatiles and change its behavior and interactions with host plants and galls. Thus, natural enemies could be attracted by different volatiles emitted by the gall tissues. Considering the duration of the life cycle of the galling organism and the gall, the temporal extent of gall-induced volatiles may include more persistent volatile cues and eavesdropping effects than the volatiles induced by non-galling herbivores. Accordingly, from chemical ecology perspective we expect that galling herbivore-induced volatiles may exhibit robust effects on neighboring-plant interactions including those ones during different plant developmental or phenological periods. Information about multitrophic interactions between insects and plants supports the additional understanding of direct and indirect effects, and allows insight into new hypotheses. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Elicitors; multitrophic interactions; neighboring effects; olfactory cues; surrounding noise; volatile composition","volatile organic compound; herbivory; host parasite interaction; metabolism; physiology; plant tumor; signal transduction; Herbivory; Host-Parasite Interactions; Plant Tumors; Signal Transduction; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073305476

The database collected snow depth data biweekly starting at the end of January until the end of April. A 30-year (1981–2010) analysis of 60 weather stations belonging to two independent meteorological networks was performed. A quality control of the climatic series was performed to evaluate the homogeneity. Three snow depth climatic areas were defined by means of two geostatistical methods (Kriging and Cluster analyses) applied on monthly snow depth, precipitation and temperature data series. Then, for each cluster, the climatological thresholds that characterize a snow fall event during the cold months were detected. Subsequently, a quality control on the daily snow depth series recorded during the January to April period was performed. For each daily series, outlier values were identified by checking both the sudden day-to-day changes and extreme thresholds (95th percentile). The quality control was then carried out to the manual series and the observed doubtful events were compared with the snow depth values recorded in the nearby stations. The results show that for the daily snow depth series, the highest number of suspect events was recorded during the months of March and April, and the analysis also shows that there are rain-on-snow events. As for the manual records, questionable snow depth errors randomly distributed in the series were highlighted. Finally, in order to improve the spatial distribution of stations located in the Canadian territory, the results give evidence that, thanks to the high-resolution climatic analysis, the proposed approach provides all the benchmarks required to conduct a quality control of snow depth series in absence of other auxiliary variables. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","climate; geostatistical methods; New Brunswick; quality control; snow depth","Benchmarking; Cluster analysis; Quality assurance; Snow; Snow melting systems; Spatial distribution; Surveys; Auxiliary variables; climate; Climatic analysis; Geostatistical method; New Brunswick; Quality control standards; Randomly distributed; Snow depths; Quality control; climatology; database; homogeneity; precipitation assessment; quality control; snow accumulation; snow cover; spatial distribution; threshold; Canada; New Brunswick",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067386588

Ascension Island and its seamounts are small, isolated and relatively young, yet harbor patchily dense life. Large areas of these waters are soon to be designated as a major Marine Protected Area. Given the remote location there are few local threats to the region. However, global climate related stressors (e.g., temperature and acidification) and arguably plastic pollution are key issues likely to impact ecosystem services. We evaluate the accumulated carbon in benthos around Ascension Island’s EEZ shallower than 1000 m using data collected over two research cruises in 2015 and 2017 through seabed mapping, seabed camera imagery and collections of benthos using a mini-Agassiz trawl. Benthos shallower than 1000 m essentially comprises the coastal waters around Ascension Island and three seamounts (Harris-Stewart, Grattan, and Unnamed). There is considerable societal benefit from benthic carbon storage and sequestration through its mitigation value buffering climate change. This service is often termed “blue carbon.” Overall we estimate that there is at least 43,000 t of blue carbon, on the 3% of Ascension Island EEZ’s seabed which is &lt;1000 m, mainly in the form of cold coral reefs. Two thirds of that occurs around the main island of Ascension, but it is very unevenly distributed on the seabed. Seabed roughness (e.g., rocky outcrops) seems most important for the development of blue carbon hotspots. About 21% of the total blue carbon is considered to be sequestered (removed from the carbon cycle for 100+ years) = 9000 t Carbon. At the 2019 Shadow Price of Carbon the proportion of CO2 considered sequestered is £29–59. As 9000 t C this is equivalent to 33,070 t CO2, which in 2019 is valued at approximately £1–2 million. With time, this increases with rising value of carbon, but also annual increment of carbon deposition, to £2–4 million by 2030. Thus even when biogeographic values of isolation, size and age are least favorable to biodiversity, the natural capital stock and future services of benthic ecosystems can be considerable and generate quantifiable economic return on their conservation. © Copyright © 2019 Barnes, Sands, Richardson and Smith.","Ascension Island; Atlantic Islands; blue carbon; cold corals; ecosystem services; Marine Protected Area; natural capital",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075551052

This study explores the factors affecting the fuelwood consumption, the amount of carbon emissions including the potential for carbon sequestration in community forests, taking a case study of Kankali Community Forest Users Group (CFUG) of Chitwan district of Nepal. Interviews with 217 households revealed that 60% of the households still depend on fuelwood for cooking, which apparently emits approximately 13.68 tons of carbon dioxide annually. The emission, however, varies with the economic status of the households; poor households rely exclusively on fuelwood for cooking and therefore emit greater amount of carbon. Similarly, the carbon emission was also found to be directly proportional to the family size and livestock holding, and inversely proportional to landholding and per capita income. A more conservation-oriented forest management along with activities to support livelihood has contributed to lower carbon emissions. Interestingly, the poverty-energy trap seemed to have a distinct gender dimension. We argue that CFUGs need to invest in income-generating activities for local users, and especially for women of low-income households, in order to reduce current carbon emission. © 2019 by the authors.","Alternative energy; Community-managed forest; Energy; Fuelwood; Low carbon emission","Carbon dioxide; Wood products; Alternative energy; Energy; Fuelwood; Low-carbon emissions; Managed forest; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076131552

The proposed air pollution dispersion model maps the emission into spatial AAPC increments (Δ AAPCs), and concentration-response function maps Δ AAPCs into health impacts. As such, we estimate differentiating health impacts of emissions at various times and locations without executing large-scale atmospheric models. We also integrate differentiating emission regulations with the joint optimization of security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) and EV battery swapping-charging system (BSCS). BSCS refers to the optimal scheduling of an aggregated number of EV batteries which are centrally charged and then dispatched via delivery trucks to battery swapping stations (BSSs) to supply local EVs. BSCS determines optimal schedules for battery charging, swapping, and truck routing. A Lagrangian decomposition method decouples the formulated large-scale mixed-integer linear programming model into SCUC and BSCS subproblems. The case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for managing ambient air quality and human health conditions. © 2010-2012 IEEE.","ambient air quality; Battery swapping stations; generation unit commitment; human health; vehicle routing","Air quality; Constrained optimization; Cost effectiveness; Electric vehicles; Health; Integer programming; Pollution control; Scheduling; Secondary batteries; Trucks; Vehicle routing; Ambient air quality; Battery swapping; Electric vehicle batteries; Generation units; Human health; Mixed integer linear programming model; Power generation scheduling; Security-constrained unit commitment; Charging (batteries)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077609882

Aside the threat posed by methane, if properly managed, it could be harnessed as a source of energy. The efficient management of landfill generated CH4 gas would require the accurate prediction, monitoring and utilization of this useful source. Therefore, this study is focused on the life cycle assessment (LCA) of Olushosun landfill in Lagos metropolis. Environmental benefits between operation of landfills with and without gas recovery systems in Olushosun landfill were determined. LCA analysis showed greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the present waste disposal system was 3,029,151tons of carbon dioxide emissions (CO2). The adoption of sanitary landfill with gas recovery system is a preferred management route for solid waste disposal in Lagos metropolis due to CO2 emissions reduction of 1,725,761 tons. The results obtained also corroborate the use of LCA as a decision support tool in waste management system. It is therefore recommended that LCA should be implemented in developing countries to reduce long term environmental effects of waste management activities. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

We argue that the strategic component is inconsistent with commitments under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). We extend the theory of border adjustments to neutralize the strategic incentive, and consider the remaining environmental incentive in a simplified structure. The theory supports border adjustments on carbon content that are below the domestic carbon price, because price signals sent through border adjustments inadvertently encourage consumption of emissions intensive goods in unregulated regions. The theoretic intuition is supported in our applied numeric simulations. Countries imposing border adjustments at the domestic carbon price will be extracting rents from unregulated regions at the expense of efficient environmental policy and consistency with international trade law. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Border tax adjustments; Carbon leakage; Climate policy; Trade and carbon taxes","Carbon; Environmental protection; International trade; Border tax adjustments; Carbon leakage; Carbon taxes; Climate policy; Environmental policy; General agreement on tariffs and trades; International trade law; Numeric simulation; Environmental regulations; environmental economics; environmental policy; GATT; international trade; pollution tax; strategic approach; trade-environment relations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070340871

Up until now, no-till has only been observed to perform better under rainfed conditions, especially in dry climates mainly because the reduced tillage system retains more soil moisture. However, the adoption of alternative agricultural practices (NT) can be improved only if uncertain and consequent assumption of risk is well known and accepted. For these reasons, the aim of this research is (i) to define durum wheat suitability under NT soil management in terms of yield success probability and (ii) to determine the suitable area for NT wheat cultivation within three climatic periods (the past, present, and future). The probability distribution of the aridity index (AI) was used to derive the non-exceedance conditional probability of NT yield success in comparison to conventional tillage (CT) on arable land in the Sicilian Region (southern Italy). The probability of NT management resulting in a higher yield than CT management for each specific environment was predicted. The latter made it possible to determine the probability of a higher yield under NT practice in comparison to CT, considering both the environment (aridity index) and different management practices (cropping system and residue management). An analysis of the relationship between the crop yield and the AI showed that the probability of NT success in durum wheat yield is affected by cropping systems and residue management and that Sicilian climatic trends will determine an increase in the areas suitable for NT durum wheat management. The uncertainty quantification or the success yield probability of NT could be used to target incentives for NT durum wheat cultivation in areas (within a region) where the mean yield and non-exceedance probability are low. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climatic trend; Durum wheat yield; No-till","Agronomy; Cultivation; Probability distributions; Risk perception; Soil moisture; Agricultural practices; Climatic trends; Conditional probabilities; Conservative agricultures; Durum wheats; No-till; Reduced tillage systems; Uncertainty quantifications; Environmental management; arable land; climate change; crop yield; cropping practice; cultivation; probability; soil management; trend analysis; wheat; yield response; Triticum aestivum; Triticum turgidum subsp. durum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070058757

The PWM signals of the master-mode inverter are generated based on the reference voltage, while those of the slave-mode inverter are output in the opposite direction when the master-mode inverter changes its switching state. However, the slave-mode control results in a mismatch between the reference voltage and the actual output voltage that is modified by synchronized control operation. The proposed method is capable of reducing and controlling this voltage error by performing signal selection in the vector space of the slave-mode inverter, which mitigates the distortion of the phase current. The efficacy of this method in reducing conducted emissions has been validated both theoretically and experimentally. © 2019 KIPE.","Air-conditioning system; Common-mode current; Conducted emission; Electromagnetic interference; Synchronized PWM strategy","Electric inverters; Electromagnetic pulse; Pulse width modulation; Signal interference; Synchronization; Vector spaces; Voltage control; Air conditioner systems; Common mode currents; Conducted emissions; Reference voltages; Synchronized control; Synchronized pulse width modulations; Synchronized PWM; Voltage variation; Air conditioning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075625094

Realizations from NRAP-Open-IAM revealed that maximum simulated leakage rates of brine were small, on the order of 10−5 kg/s, and maximum simulated leakage rates of CO2 were on the order of 10-3 kg/s, and could be detected earliest during the injection phase in the Ironton-Galesville, the thief zone immediately overlying the injection reservoir. Using this information to design an optimized monitoring well network eliminated one of the three originally planned monitoring wells, resulting in a cost reduction for the project. Perhaps the most significant finding from this effort is that NRAP-Open-IAM can be used to define a risk-based, and substantially shorter, PISC period for the site. NRAP-Open-IAM realizations indicate that the majority of risk of endangerment to USDWs decreases within the first 5 years after CO2 injection ends. Doubling this timeframe would still lead to a net PISC period reduction of 40-years and an operational cost reduction in excess of $50 M for the project.

In this context the weighted average costs of capital (WACC) are especially important, as renewables are highly capital intensive. In particular, investors' perceptions and expectations of risks are fundamental determinants of WACC and thus strongly influence the macroeconomic outcome of transition analyses. For the case of Europe's electricity sector transition, we analyze this sensitivity by choosing different WACC settings, driven also by different policy settings redirecting expectations. First, we find that when differentiating WACC across regions and technologies more accurately than usually done in the literature, immediate and substantial macroeconomic benefits from the transition emerge. We thereby reveal a systematic overestimation of low-carbon transition costs in the literature. Second, we find that when pricing-in increasing trust in renewables, these benefits get significantly larger, outweighing possible negative macroeconomic effects from the risk of stranding of fossil-based assets. We also demonstrate that in developed regions such as Europe, de-risking renewables is an effective lever for reaching climate targets, which indicates the relevance of green macroprudential regulation. © 2019 The Author(s)","Capital costs; Climate change mitigation; Electricity; Europe; Risk","Carbon; Costs; Economics; Electric industry; Electricity; Greenhouse gases; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Risks; Capital costs; Climate change mitigation; Developed regions; Economy wide effects; Electricity sector; Europe; Low-carbon transitions; Transition analysis; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068473106

Therefore, analysis of multi-proxy spectral signatures was carried out to trace the high-resolution SWM periodicities and their influence on the productivity, regional sea level fluctuations and depositional processes in the NE Arabian Sea. The time series data of stable isotopes of oxygen (δ18OG.ruber), carbon (δ13CG.ruber and δ13Corg) and nitrogen (δ15N), Total Organic Carbon (TOC), planktic-benthic foraminiferal ratio (P/B ratio) and &gt;63 μm coarse fraction (CF) were used from two coastal sedimentary cores located offshore Saurashtra, NE Arabian Sea (Core SK-240/485 having 88 m water depth; Core GC/SK-240/496 having 174 m water depth). The REDFIT based spectral analysis recorded significant periodicities (&gt;90% significance) in δ18O time series centered at ∼1609, ∼667, ∼525, ∼296, ∼290 and ∼256 years. Further, the significant periodicities recorded in carbon isotopes time series (δ13CG.ruber and δ13Corg) centered at ∼681, ∼512, ∼471, ∼452, ∼438, ∼360, ∼292, ∼275, ∼269, ∼245 and ∼209 years. The significant periodicities in TOC include ∼471 and ∼322 years whereas δ15N time series recorded significant periodicity centered at ∼360 years. The significant periodicities in P/B ratio time series centered at ∼512, ∼388, ∼304, ∼250, ∼235, ∼217, ∼152, ∼139 and ∼135 years while CF recorded ∼268, ∼216, ∼209, ∼198, ∼188, ∼173 and ∼140 years significant periodicities. The observed periodicities in the multi-proxy record consist of similar cycles (within the radiocarbon dating error) which also match with previously reported solar insolation influenced SWM and other global and regional cycles. Further, the stationarity of the data has been verified using wavelet analysis and shows similar periodicities as observed in REDFIT analysis. Thereafter, the depositional behaviour was studied using correlation analysis of the common periods of δ18O time series of both the cores. The result suggests that the depositional behaviour was different for both the core sites during the early Holocene and became similar during the middle Holocene. The correlation analysis of Total Solar Index (TSI) with δ18O time series reveals a significant correlation with the core SK-240/485 whereas an insignificant correlation with the core GC/SK-240/496. These observations suggest that the solar insolation has been a leading factor responsible for the SWM trends during the Holocene which may have further influenced the productivity, regional sea level fluctuations and depositional conditions in the NE Arabian Sea. However, these trends are better preserved in shallow marine sediments as compared to the deeper marine sediments. © 2019 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University","Arabian sea; Foraminifera; Periodicities; Southwest monsoon; Spectral analysis","deposition; foraminifera; insolation; monsoon; paleoceanography; periodicity; sea level; spectral analysis; time series analysis; Arabian Sea; Indian Ocean; Foraminifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064540886

Seven out of ten cities with the poorest air quality in the world are in India, and paddy field burning has been cited as one of the main reasons. Hazardous emissions from paddy field burning is combined with greenhouse gas emissions from coal fired power plants and cement manufacturing units, causing severe respiratory illnesses and other fatal health issues. The recent literature indicates an increased interest in rice straw valorisation, possibly in response to the increasing concerns over paddy field burning. However, a systematic study that compiles and compares various rice straw valorisation routes is lacking in the existing literature. This paper provides a comprehensive review of literature on various alternative uses of rice straw in energy and construction industries. Effective use of rice straw as a biomass fuel in energy sector not only reduces the field burning, but also decreases the dependency on non-renewable fossil fuels. Moreover, the proposed utilisation of secondary by-products from rice straw-based energy production in the construction industry can help to attain the goals of resource cascading. The availability of rice straw in major rice producing states of India and the feasibility of establishing rice straw-based power plants are also examined in this study. The potential reduction of harmful emissions from such resource recycling has been determined as per the guidelines issued by the intergovernmental panel on climate change. From the review of literature and the findings of the present study, a sustainable framework has been developed with well-defined cleaner production pathways to create a seamless material flow chain between the agricultural, energy, and construction sectors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Blended cement; Cleaner energy; Field burning; Rice straw; Rice straw ash; Sustainable construction","Agriculture; Air quality; Carbon; Cements; Climate change; Coal; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Pollution control; Smoke; Blended cement; Cleaner energies; Rice straw ashes; Rice straws; Sustainable construction; Construction industry",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069512287

In the automotive industry, major sustainability issues revolve around advocating for improved fuel economy and the incorporation of materials with higher recyclability in order to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A popular strategy to achieve this in the automotive industry is light-weighting. Many studies in this field are focused on the environmental benefits of light-weighting, that is, how replacement of traditional steel in the automotive industry with aluminum, for instance, will help reduce the amount of CO2-eq emissions in the environment. The increasing use of aluminum in the industry for differing automotive applications broadens the range of alloying elements. Unfortunately, many of these elements are dissipatively lost and also deemed critical. Furthermore, some of the alloying elements accumulate as tramp (unwanted) elements in the secondary aluminum stream, hence posing as a barrier to effective recycling, thus leading to material and economic losses. We quantified the material losses and analyzed the economic losses attributed to the dissipation of critical metals and also examined the attendant accumulation of tramp elements in the recycled aluminum stream. Our results indicate that to achieve a more circular economy requires investment and further development of a) operational blending and batching strategies that comprehend alloying additions and the inherent variability of their actual composition, and b) economically feasible material identification and sorting technologies that will help in abating these material losses and associated economic losses. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aluminum; Circular economy; Critical metals; Lightweight","Alloying; Alloying elements; Aluminum; Aluminum coated steel; Blending; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Losses; Recycling; Sustainable development; Automotive applications; Circular economy; Environmental benefits; Lightweight; Material identification; Products and services; Sustainability issues; Sustainable materials; Automotive industry; alloy; aluminum; copper; iron; magnesium; manganese; silicon; tin; zinc; aluminum; automobile industry; consumption behavior; demand analysis; estimation method; heavy metal; sustainability; Article; automobile industry; economic aspect; economic development; economic status; recycling; traffic and transport; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069048935

In order to fully deploy a demand side management approach, synergies between interconnected energy systems have to be systematically implemented. By taking this standpoint, this study proposes a new approach to explore the potential of multi-energy integrated energy systems. This approach is constituted by two main steps, which are (1) the performance simulation of selected energy infrastructures and (2) the estimation of related techno-economic performance indicators. Step (1) expands the work presented in previous literature, by including a novel co-simulation feature. In step (2), the levelized cost of energy and location-dependent emission factors are used as key performance indicators. In this paper, the presented approach is demonstrated by implementing two demand side management options for heat peak demand shaving. A Swedish residential neighborhood is considered as a case study. The first option explores the potential of storing heat in the thermal mass of residential buildings. The proposed strategies lead to a decrease of up to 70% of primary energy consumption, depending on the indoor comfort requirements. The second option estimates the techno-economic feasibility of a new set of scenarios based on the integration of geothermal distributed heat pumps within a district heating network. The district heating scenario is found to be the most techno-economical convenient. Nevertheless, a moderate penetration of distributed heat pumps (around 20%) is shown to have a good trade-off with the reduction of CO2 emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cities; Co-simulation; Demand side management; Heat pumps; Integrated energy systems; Peak shavings; Techno-economic; Thermal mass","Benchmarking; Demand side management; District heating; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Geothermal energy; Heat pump systems; Housing; Pumps; Cities; Cosimulation; Heat pumps; Integrated energy systems; Peak shaving; Techno-economics; Thermal mass; Energy management systems; demand analysis; demand-side management; economic conditions; heating; integrated approach; neighborhood; pump; renewable resource; simulated annealing; simulation; thermal power; trade-off; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070271109

This also affects the more depletion of fossil fuel availability. An increasing number of these vehicles contribute to air pollution in urban areas. Hazardous substances such as NOx (Nitrogen Oxide), CO (Carbon Monoxide), and HC (Hydrocarbon) are harmful to health. In order to reduce the emissions of CO and HC, wet ethanol is one of the solutions to overcome these problems. Besides ethanol can be obtained from materials that are renewable. In fact, wet ethanol has a value of higher octane and higher oxygen content than gasoline. Blending both the fuel is expected to reduce air pollution. The purpose of this research is to obtain the best premium and wet ethanol percentage for lowering emissions of CO and HC. The fuel used is gasoline (88 octane number) and the wet ethanol (109 octane number). The percentage of wet ethanol blended into the fuel is in the range of 5% to 15%. Experiments conducted an engine speed of 2500 to 4000 rpm with an interval of 500 rpm. This study investigates the effects of wet ethanol and premium blends and the use of EGR (Exhaust Gas Recirculation) against exhaust emissions on a gasoline engine with EFI systems (Electronic Fuel Injection). From the results of this study is found that the exhaust gas temperature increases in the increase of engine speed. The addition of EGR reduces the exhaust gas temperature. The increase in BSFC (brake specific fuel consumption) without the largest EGR at we15 is 3.36% at 0.38 kg/kw. Hour, while the decrease in BSFC with the largest EGR at we5 is 17.61% at 0.30 kg/kw. Hour. Wet ethanol and gasoline blends cause a decrease in emissions of CO and HC. With a 15% wet ethanol blend, CO and HC emissions can be reduced to 60.23% and 44.30%, respectively. However, adding 15% wet ethanol into gasoline fuel increases 34.66% of CO2. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air pollution; Antiknock rating; Blending; Carbon monoxide; Ethanol; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Nitrogen oxides; Speed; Brake specific fuel consumption; EFI gasoline engine; Electronic fuel injections; Exhaust emission; Exhaust gas temperatures; Experimental test; Hazardous substances; Number of vehicles; Exhaust gas recirculation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077059968

To compensate for this reduction, at different climate conditions, various systems can be used to cool the inlet air. To predict the performance of a gas turbine at off-design conditions (by changing surrounding conditions and/or the air cooling method), modeling of the unit performance is required. Due to the high consumption of water and electricity in the conventional cooling systems, in this paper, in addition to introducing an off-design algorithm, governing equations of each cycle elements were inferenced by their characteristic curve. By developing code in MATLAB software, the effect of applying a novel convergent–divergent system on GE-F5 gas units in Yazd Zanbagh power plants was studied. The results show that in a temperature range between 14 and 50 °C, for each degree decrease in ambient air temperature, an approximately 8.99 kW increase in output power can be obtained. The main advantage of this system is the capability of its application in both dry and humid regions. In addition, the refrigerant medium is not required, which makes this system desirable to use in arid areas. © The Author(s) 2019.","critical parameters; dimensional designs; Energy performance; integrating analysis","Atmospheric temperature; Cooling systems; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas plants; Gas turbines; MATLAB; Ambient air temperature; Characteristic curve; critical parameters; Dimensional design; Energy performance; integrating analysis; Off design condition; Output power and efficiencies; Air intakes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074393046

Individually, the effects of these climate factors on plants are well established, whereas experiments on the interactive effects of a combination of factors are rare. Moreover, how these environmental factors will affect tree species along a wet to dry gradient (e.g., along tropical forest-savanna transitions) remains to be investigated. We hypothesized that under the simulated environmental conditions, plant growth, physiological performance and survivorship would vary in a manner consistent with the species' positions of origin along this gradient. In a glasshouse experiment, we raised seedlings of three Eucalyptus species, each occurring naturally in a wet forest, savanna and forest-savanna ecotone, respectively. We evaluated the effect of drought, elevated temperature (4 °C above ambient glasshouse temperature of 22 °C) and elevated temperature in combination with elevated [CO2] (400 ppm [CO2] above ambient of 400 ppm), on seedling growth, survivorship and physiological responses (photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and water-use efficiency). Elevated temperature under ambient [CO2] had little effect on growth, biomass and plant performance of well-watered seedlings, but hastened mortality in drought-affected seedlings, affecting the forest and ecotone more strongly than the savanna species. In contrast, elevated [CO2] in combination with elevated temperatures delayed the appearance of drought stress symptoms and enhanced survivorship in drought-affected seedlings, with the savanna species surviving the longest, followed by the ecotone and forest species. Elevated [CO2] in combination with elevated temperatures also enhanced growth and biomass and photosynthesis in well-watered seedlings of all species, but modified shoot:root biomass partitioning and stomatal conductance differentially across species. Our study highlights the need for a better understand of the interactive effects of elevated [CO2], temperature and drought on plants and the potential to upscale these insights for understanding biome changes. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

In the current study, soil chemical characteristics, quantitative PCR of denitrifiers (nirK, nirS, nosZI and nosZII) and16s rRNA amplicon sequencing were assessed to examine the links between the soil microbial communities and short-term soil direct N2O emissions when treated with agricultural wastes. The highest soil direct N2O emissions were recorded in soils received ammonium nitrate while soils received agricultural wastes exhibited substantially lower soil direct N2O emissions. On the contrary, agricultural wastes stimulated CO2 accumulation as well as the growth of copiotrophic bacterial groups like Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Interestingly, direct soil N2O emissions were decoupled from the density of denitrifier community while agricultural wastes caused a substantial reduction of the relative abundance of bacterial taxa associated with N2O emissions in the soil. This study proves evidence that agricultural wastes could be integrated in a waste management strategy, which inter alia includes their direct use in agricultural ecosystems resulting in reduced N2O emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural wastes; Bacterial communities; Banana peels; BP; Denitrifiers; GHG; Greenhouse gases; Mandarin peels; metric tonnes; MP; N2O emissions; OP; Orange peels; Soil degradation; tn","ammonium nitrate; carbon dioxide; nitrous oxide; ribosome RNA; RNA 16S; soil water; nitrous oxide; bacterium; chemical reaction; crop residue; denitrification; greenhouse gas; microbial community; mitigation; nitrous oxide; soil degradation; soil emission; soil fertility; soil management; solid waste; waste technology; Acidobacteria; agricultural waste; amplicon; Article; Bacteroidetes; carbon footprint; comparative study; controlled study; Firmicutes; nonhuman; Planctomycetes; Proteobacteria; real time polymerase chain reaction; soil acidity; soil fertility; soil microflora; soil pollution; soil treatment; agriculture; microbiology; soil; waste management; Bacteria (microorganisms); Firmicutes; Proteobacteria; Agriculture; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071833368

The paper addresses the role of geographical location based prevailing meteorology in determining the variability of particulate matter in different seasons and processes responsible for the same. We hereby demonstrate that although Delhi has the highest level of particulate matters, the percentage share of PM2.5 in PM10 is highest for Mumbai (60%) as compared to 50% of Delhi. The pollutant levels of Delhi, Mumbai and Pune show strong seasonal variability whereas Ahmedabad does not show any significant variation for summer to winter. We have further discussed that the landlocked geography of Delhi and coastal location of Mumbai often play a dominant role in the distribution of air pollutants. Hence, the mitigation options require specific consideration of integrated approach for each city.

However, hot and dry climates are encountered in vast regions across the globe but, unfortunately, not much research has taken place in the use of GSHP systems in hot and dry regions. This paper aims to investigate the feasibility of using GSHP systems in hot and dry regions, and Saudi Arabia is an example. This paper introduces for the first time of a techno-economic analysis to evaluate the use of GSHPs compared to the conventional air source heat pump (ASHP) systems in this type of climate. In order to compare the economics of geothermal heat pump systems to other HVAC alternatives, a direct capital cost comparison is made between an example GSHP and ASHP. This is based on the initial investment, payback period, cost energy saving and length of the ground loop, which was calculated for a simple case using the ASHRAE method. Despite the increase in the initial capital costs of GSHP, because of the extra expensive drilling costs for the ground loop heat exchanger and piping the feasibility of GSHP system is worthy of investigates. It is concluded that the GSHP is feasible, albeit with a long payback period, typically 10–20 years, depending on the conditions, setup and predictions. Also it will be seen that there is a savings in CO2 emissions and there may be a substantially decrease in the total costs using GSHP compared to ASHP. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air source heat pump; Ground source heat pump; Hot/dry climates","Air source heat pumps; Costs; Economic analysis; Energy conservation; Geothermal energy; Investments; Pumps; Capital costs; CO2 emissions; Cold climate; Drilling cost; Hot/dry climates; Payback periods; Scandinavian countries; Techno-Economic analysis; Geothermal heat pumps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070384084

These organisms can be enriched at the biocathode of microbial electrosynthesis (MES) for electricity-driven CO2 reduction to acetate. Studies exploring homoacetogens in MES are mainly conducted using pure or mix-culture anaerobic inocula from samples with standard environmental conditions. Extreme marine environments host unique microbial communities including homoacetogens that may have unique capabilities due to their adaptation to harsh environmental conditions. Anaerobic deep-sea brine pools are hypersaline and metalliferous environments and homoacetogens can be expected to live in these environments due to their remarkable metabolic flexibility and energy-efficient biosynthesis. However, brine pools have never been explored as inocula for the enrichment of homacetogens in MES. Here we used the saline water from a Red Sea brine pool as inoculum for the enrichment of halophilic homoacetogens at the biocathode (−1 V vs. Ag/AgCl) of MES. Volatile fatty acids, especially acetate, along with hydrogen gas were produced in MES systems operated at 25 and 10% salinity. Acetate concentration increased when MES was operated at a lower salinity ∼3.5%, representing typical seawater salinity. Amplicon sequencing and genome-centric metagenomics of matured cathodic biofilm showed dominance of the genus Marinobacter and phylum Firmicutes at all tested salinities. Seventeen high-quality draft metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were extracted from the biocathode samples. The recovered MAGs accounted for 87 ± 4% of the quality filtered sequence reads. Genome analysis of the MAGs suggested CO2 fixation via Wood–Ljundahl pathway by members of the phylum Firmicutes and the fixed CO2 was possibly utilized by Marinobacter sp. for growth by consuming O2 escaping from the anode to the cathode for respiration. The enrichment of Marinobacter sp. with homoacetogens was only possible because of the specific cathodic environment in MES. These findings suggest that in organic carbon-limited saline environments, Marinobacter spp. can live in consortia with CO2 fixing bacteria such as homoacetogens, which can provide them with fixed carbon as a source of carbon and energy. © Copyright © 2019 Alqahtani, Bajracharya, Katuri, Ali, Ragab, Michoud, Daffonchio and Saikaly.","halophilic homoacetogens; marinobacter; metagenome-assembled genome; microbial electrosynthesis; Red Sea brine pool","carbon; electrolyte; formate dehydrogenase; hydrogen; hydrogenase; volatile fatty acid; amperometry; amplicon; Article; biofilm; biosynthesis; chemical analysis; chronoamperometry; controlled study; DNA extraction; DNA library; DNA sequence; electric conductivity; electrochemical analysis; electrolysis; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; environmental enrichment; Firmicutes; genome analysis; halophilic homoacetogen; high performance liquid chromatography; inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry; marine environment; Marinobacter; metagenome; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial electrosynthesis; nonhuman; pH; phylogenetic tree; Pseudomonas stutzeri; Red Sea; salinity; scanning electron microscopy; signal transduction; solid state; total organic carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075681231

Results show that 8.7–10.2% of 2015 electricity consumption could have been avoided by upgrading all residential units to comply with Energy Star standards. The range for this estimate stems from uncertainty on whether, under business-as-usual conditions, most buildings comply with the 1978 or the 1996 energy building codes. These energy savings would have implied a reduction of 3–4% in the costs of running the current power generation fleet and a 9–11% reduction in CO2 emissions. If this level of EE had been paired with the installation of roof-top PV providing 6.1–6.4% of the total electricity generated, the costs of operating the system would have been reduced by 8.6–9.6% and CO2 emissions would have been 24–26% lower. This level of roof-top PV penetration is the maximum permissible under this EE scenario due to the reductions it causes to daily peak electricity consumption and the limited operational flexibility of the nuclear plants. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building codes and standards; Carbon dioxide emissions; Distributed solar; Economic dispatch; Energy efficiency; Renewables integration; Residential electricity demand; Roof-top photovoltaic (PV); Unit commitment","Building codes; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Electric load dispatching; Electric power generation; Electric power utilization; Global warming; Housing; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Roofs; Scheduling; Solar power generation; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon dioxide emissions; Codes and standards; Distributed solar; Economic Dispatch; Photovoltaic; Renewables integrations; Residential Electricity demands; Unit-commitment; Energy efficiency; alternative energy; building code; carbon dioxide; emission inventory; energy efficiency; energy policy; photovoltaic system; policy analysis; power generation; solar power; standard (reference); North Carolina; South Carolina; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071993429

Using a dynamic Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) approach, the consumption of renewable energy in the panel of sixteen (16) CMCs is empirically observed to be an efficient policy vehicle for mitigating CO2 emissions. Also, in all the examined CMCs, consumption of renewables is observed to cause significant decline in CO2 emissions, thus securing a sustainable environment. However, in the long run and in the panel of CMCs, the study reveals that increase in food production (a drive toward food security) increases environmental risk. Additionally, the study found that high inflation regime in the panel CMCs is associated with low CO2 emissions especially in the long-run, thus necessitating efficient policy mechanism. In adopting the genetic resources of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources, as well as employing price control policy, the members of the CMCs might have unearthed a suitable policy directive in effectively sustaining environmental quality. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Coastline Mediterranean countries (CMCs); Food security; Inflation; Renewable energy consumption; Sustainable environment","alternative energy; carbon emission; economic conditions; energy efficiency; environmental quality; food production; food security; sustainability; Mediterranean Region; carbon dioxide; catering service; economic development; food; pollution; renewable energy; Southern Europe; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Environmental Pollution; Food; Food Supply; Mediterranean Region; Renewable Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076003934

The steam power plant is fueled by Illinois no. 6 bituminous coal and designed to deliver a gross electrical power of 600 MW. Energy performance of two different solvents (30% wt. Monoethanolamine and 40% wt. Piperazine) were considered for CO2 capture unit, and a sensitivity analysis was done to ascertain the effect of Lean/Rich heat exchanger minimum temperature approach on energy consumption of the reboiler. Two separate liquid states of CO2 (19.7 bar, −20 °C and 26.5 bar, −10 °C), which their ship-based transportation feasibility was studied by Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute, was considered as the state of produced CO2 stream. Three conventional and one novel liquefaction processes were evaluated to deliver CO2 stream at aforementioned liquid states. While both of simulated CO2 capture units are thermally integrated with the steam power plant, just the novel case of liquefaction process is integrated with the steam power plant. According to the results, the reboiler in 40% wt. Piperazine case was ascertained to have 11% less energy consumption than that of 30% wt. Monoethanolamine case. The novel liquefaction process shows the best energy performance, and its equivalent sacrificed electrical energy is the lowest among all.

Nonetheless, it is imperative to understand and analyze the long-term goals of such societies to upgrade and redirect priorities towards the low-carbon structure. Therefore, this study is carried by applying a novel multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach and the Bilan Carbone model to examine the different possibilities for cost/benefit analysis from direct reductions in carbon emission levels in the Lahore Metropolitan Area (LMA) of Pakistan. The LMA is a metropolitan city in the developing country and is marked with a huge spike in energy demands and carbon emissions due to increasing population. Three scenarios including one current (2010), and two future (business as usual—2050BaU and low carbon scenario—2050LCS), were developed. Our findings show no evidence of renewable energy use—such as solar, wind, and biomass—in the current energy mix of LMA. Furthermore, an increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from 3.5 in 2010 to 14 million tonnes (mt) in 2050 is found. Mitigation potential analysis of different sectors showed that the industrial sector of the city has the biggest mitigation capacity (13%) until the year 2050, whereas, the smallest proportion may come from the commercial sector (4%).

However, it can also lead to the unjust dislocation of the urban poor whose contributions to climate change are negligible but whose exposure to climatic risk is high. These groups of people also have little say in the decision-making about whether to retreat, when and how, thus raising concerns about equity and justice. In this paper, I examine the policy and practice of managed retreat and its environmental justice dimensions in Manila (Philippines) and Lagos (Nigeria) from 2010 to 2018. Expert interviews, focus group discussions, and policy documents were collected and analyzed for both cities. Findings reveal a complex picture of contradictions. In Lagos, retreat was stated in climate change policy but in practice only the urban poor were forcibly removed from waterfront areas and in their place new urban development projects are being constructed. In Manila, retreat was not mentioned in policy but evidence indicates informal settlers and national government offices were the target of planned retreat. Unlike Lagos, the urban poor in Manila were offered a mortgaged pathway to homeownership outside the city. However, the lack of livelihood opportunities in relocation sites engendered a cycle of retreat and return. This study further discusses how climatic uncertainties, property values, government distrust, utopian imaginaries, and environmental injustices served as barriers to managed retreat in both cities. The paper concludes with a call for an environmentally and socially just approach to retreat. It argues that the rights of the urban poor to the city must be taken into consideration even under complex climatic and socio-ecological disruptions. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Behavioral research; Decision making; Urban growth; Adaptation strategies; Climate change policies; Complex pictures; Environmental justice; Livelihood opportunities; National governments; Policy documents; Urban development; Climate change; climate change; environmental justice; homeownership; livelihood; megacity; uncertainty analysis; urban development; urban planning; urban policy; urban renewal; Lagos [Nigeria]; Manila; National Capital Region; Nigeria; Philippines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072108841

This study evaluated the performance of 36 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) GCMs in relation to their skills in simulating mean annual, monsoon, winter, pre-monsoon, and post-monsoon precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature over Pakistan using state-of-the-art spatial metrics, SPAtial EFficiency, fractions skill score, Goodman-Kruskal's lambda, Cramer's V, Mapcurves, and Kling-Gupta efficiency, for the period 1961-2005. The multi-model ensemble (MME) precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature data were generated through the intelligent merging of simulated precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature of selected GCMs employing random forest (RF) regression and simple mean (SM) techniques. The results indicated some differences in the ranks of GCMs for different spatial metrics. The overall ranks indicated NorESM1-M, MIROC5, BCC-CSM1-1, and ACCESS1-3 as the best GCMs in simulating the spatial patterns of mean annual, monsoon, winter, pre-monsoon, and post-monsoon precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature over Pakistan. MME precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature generated based on the best-performing GCMs showed more similarities with observed precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature compared to precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature simulated by individual GCMs. The MMEs developed using RF displayed better performance than the MMEs based on SM. Multiple spatial metrics have been used for the first time for selecting GCMs based on their capability to mimic the spatial patterns of annual and seasonal precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature. The approach proposed in the present study can be extended to any number of GCMs and climate variables and applicable to any region for the suitable selection of an ensemble of GCMs to reduce uncertainties in climate projections. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Atmospheric thermodynamics; Decision trees; Efficiency; Climate projection; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; General circulation model; Maximum and minimum temperatures; Multi-model ensemble; Seasonal precipitations; Spatial performance; Temporal performance; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; CMIP; general circulation model; precipitation (climatology); simulation; spatial analysis; temperature effect; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075761753

The results revealed that building characteristics, household income, and the number of households were the most important predictors of electricity and gas consumption. We also found that MNN models have outperformed MLR, RF and GB models in electricity and gas consumption prediction at MSOA and LSOA levels, with R2 values over 0.99 for the electricity consumption model.

This has forced people to extensive use of wood leading to deforestation. Therefore it is mandatory to move towards a complete sustainable energy strategy. Thermal insulation of the buildings presents a key opportunity in the energy savings. A growing interest is targeted on new insulating materials incorporating recycled and sustainable types. Judicious use of insulation materials in the buildings not only reduces the energy consumption but also reduces greenhouse gas emission and provides better indoor thermal comfort. In the present work natural insulation materials like sheep wool, goat wool and horse mane are processed and characterized in term of moisture absorption, thermal conductivity, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). The objective of the study is to explore the potential of natural materials like sheep wool, goat wool and horse mane for use in thermal insulation in the buildings. Results reveal that the horse mane absorbs more moisture content than the sheep and goat wool. Goat wool of density 269.874 kg/m3 exhibits a low thermal conductivity of 0.0314 W/mK. Horse mane shows more stability up to the temperature of 375 °C as compared to sheep and goat wool. In addition these natural insulation materials have better environmental aspects and show better efficiency compared to conventional insulation materials. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cold region; Energy saving; Natural insulating material; TGA-DSC; Thermal conductivity","Deforestation; Differential scanning calorimetry; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Moisture; Temperature; Thermal conductivity; Thermal insulating materials; Thermogravimetric analysis; Wool; Yarn; Cold regions; Environmental aspects; Indoor thermal comfort; Insulation materials; Low temperature regions; Low thermal conductivity; Moisture absorption; Tga-dsc; Thermal insulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068071794

As the climate changes, heatwaves and cold streaks have become more frequent and intense. The ClimApp project aims to develop a smartphone App that provides individualised advice to cope with thermal stress outdoors and indoors. This paper presents a method to predict indoor air temperature to evaluate thermal indoor environments. Two types of input data were used to set up a predictive model: weather data obtained from online weather services and general building attributes to be provided by App users. The method provides discrete predictions of temperature through a decision tree classification algorithm. The data used to train and test the algorithm was obtained from field measurements in seven Danish households and from building simulations considering three different climate regions, ranging from temperate to hot and humid. The results show that the method had an accuracy of 92% (F1-score) when predicting temperatures under previously known conditions (e.g., same household, occupants and climate). However, the performance decreased to 30% under different climate conditions. The approach had the highest performance when predicting the most commonly observed indoor temperatures. The findings suggest that it is possible to develop a straightforward and fairly accurate method for indoor temperature estimation grounded on weather data and simple building attributes. © 2019 by the authors.

It is found that the characteristic picosecond relaxation time τr of the emission and of the carrier density increase with an increase of the diameter of the pump pulse for a fixed density of the pump-pulse energy. Due to the relation between the density and the temperature of carriers in the case of high-intensity emission (in the saturation state of emission amplification), the time τr is associated with the characteristic temperature-relaxation time τT of photopumped carriers, which was determined previously theoretically taking into account the emission-induced heating of carriers.

This involved 300 farmers from two districts of Ghana and the data analyzed using descriptive statistics. The results showed severer climate impacts on the livelihoods of females than males in Ghana. On the contrary, the adaptive capacity of males was found to be higher than that of females. This was supported by the observed differences in gender climate adaptation where both male heads and male household members had higher mean climate adaptations than both female heads and female household members. Overall, the climate adaptation strategies mostly adopted by both males and females include changing planting dates, row planting, planting early maturing and drought tolerant seed varieties, mixed farming, intercropping and refiling of farm plots. Except for zero tillage and intercropping, male farmers had high adoption levels than female farmers. It is concluded that the observed gender adaptation differences were due to the levels and intensity of adoption other than differences in the type of strategies adopted by the different gender groups. The Ministry of Food and Agriculture should consider integrating climate adaptation policies into current agricultural policies such as “planting for food and jobs” policy. © 2019 The Author(s)Environmental science; Environmental analysis; Environmental assessment; Environmental economics; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental risk assessment; Climate change; Adaptation; Gender; Ghana. © 2019 The Author(s)","Adaptation; Climate change; Environmental analysis; Environmental assessment; Environmental economics; Environmental impact assessment; Environmental risk assessment; Environmental science; Gender; Ghana",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074919415

Climatically suitable ranges for invasive plant species are expected to expand due to future climate change. The identification of current invasions and potential range expansion of invasive plant species is required to plan for the management of these species. Here, we predicted climatically suitable habitats for 11 invasive plant species and calculated the potential species richness and their range expansions in different provinces of the Republic of Korea (ROK) under current and future climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) using the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling approach. Results: Based on the model predictions, areas of climatically suitable habitats for 90.9% of the invasive plant species are expected to retain current ecological niches and expand to include additional climatically suitable areas under future climate change scenarios. Species richness is predicted to be relatively high in the provinces of the western and southern regions (e.g., Jeollanam, Jeollabuk, and Chungcheongnam) under current climatic conditions. However, under future climates, richness in the provinces of the northern, eastern, and southeastern regions (e.g., Seoul, Incheon, Gyeonggi, Gyeongsangnam, Degue, Busan, and Ulsan) is estimated to increase up to 292%, 390.75%, and 468.06% by 2030, 2050, and 2080, respectively, compared with the current richness. Conclusions: Our study revealed that the rates of introduction and dispersion of invasive plant species from the western and southern coasts are relatively high and are expanding across the ROK through different modes of dispersion. The negative impacts on biodiversity, ecosystem dynamics, and economy caused by invasive plant species will be high if preventive and eradication measures are not employed immediately. Thus, this study will be helpful to policymakers for the management of invasive plant species and the conservation of biodiversity. © 2019 The Author(s).","Climate change; Invasive plant species; Province; Species expansion; Species richness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075762326

The findings based on the Fully Modified OLS and GMM estimation techniques show that both renewable and nonrenewable energy contribute to carbon dioxide emissions in the countries studied in the long run but only nonrenewable energy has a significant positive effect on carbon dioxide emissions in the short run. The results show that a percentage increase in nonrenewable energy consumption leads to an increase of 1.07% and 1.9% in CO2 emissions in the short and long run respectively. Additionally, economic growth contributes to environmental degradation while urbanization has a negative effect on carbon dioxide emissions.

In many cases, the relationship between the chemical structure of the gelator and the emergent hydrogel properties is poorly understood. As a result, empirical screening strategies instead of rational design approaches are often relied upon to tune the emergent properties of the gels. Herein, we describe a novel strategy to identify improved phenylalanine (Phe) derived gelators using a focused empirical approach. Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) protected Phe derivatives are a privileged class of gelators that spontaneously self-assemble into fibrils that entangle to form a hydrogel network upon dissolution into water. However, the Fmoc group has been shown to have toxicity drawbacks for potential biological applications, requiring the identification of new N-terminal modifications that promote efficient self-assembly but lack the shortcomings of the Fmoc group. We previously discovered that fibrils in Fmoc-p-nitrophenylalanine (Fmoc-4-NO2-Phe) hydrogels transition to crystalline microtubes after several hours by a mechanism that involves the hierarchical assembly and fusion of the hydrogel fibrils. We hypothesized that this hierarchical crystallization behavior could form the basis of a screening approach to identify alternative N-terminal functional groups to replace Fmoc in Phe-derived LMW gelators. Specifically, screening N-terminal modifying groups for 4-NO2-Phe that stabilize the hydrogel state by preventing subsequent hierarchical crystallization would facilitate empirical identification of functional Fmoc replacements. To test this approach, we screened a small series of 4-NO2-Phe derivatives with various N-terminal modifying groups to determine if any provided stable LMW supramolecular hydrogels. All but one of the 4-NO2-Phe derivatives assembled into crystalline forms. Only the 1-naphthaleneacetic acid (1-Nap) 4-NO2-Phe derivative self-assembled into a stable hydrogel network. Additional Phe derivatives were modified by N-terminal 1-Nap groups to confirm the general potential of 1-Nap as a suitable replacement for Fmoc, and all derivatives formed stable hydrogels under similar conditions to their Fmoc-Phe counterparts. These results illustrate the potential of this approach to identify next-generation Phe-derived LMW gelators with improved emergent properties. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Amino acids; Crystalline materials; Crystallization; Diagnosis; Supramolecular chemistry; Tissue engineering; Biological applications; Crystallization behavior; Empirical approach; Hierarchical assemblies; Low molecular weight compounds; Screening approaches; Screening strategy; Supramolecular hydrogels; Hydrogels; nanomaterial; nitrogen oxide; phenylalanine; biochemistry; chemistry; comparative study; crystallization; flow kinetics; hydrogel; molecular weight; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; pH; procedures; scanning electron microscopy; transmission electron microscopy; Biochemistry; Crystallization; Hydrogels; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Molecular Weight; Nanostructures; Nitrogen Oxides; Phenylalanine; Rheology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074880469

Therefore, the need to curb greenhouse gas emissions has been well recognized by global researchers, policymakers and academics. Carbon emissions of hotel operations have seized the attention of global researchers. However, carbon emissions of the hotels in developing countries remain to be a less explored domain. Therefore, carbon emissions of Sri Lankan hotels were explored using a case study approach. Five hotels in the Colombo suburb were explored, which revealed that each hotel released more than 7000 tons of carbon annually. Results further indicated the use of purchased electricity as the dominant source of carbon emissions. Emissions caused by transport activities were not included in the calculations due to the unavailability of data. Recommendations were made to overcome the issues identified during data collection as well as to reduce the carbon emissions from hotel operations. Wider adoption of the methodology used in this research will benefit the hotels to keep track of the carbon emissions using a systematic approach. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; GHG emission; Hotels; Reporting; Sri Lanka",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075800601

Evidence has shown that climate change exacerbates the situation and presents a daunting challenge to predominantly rain-fed agricultural livelihoods. The aim of this study was to analyze the extent and sources of smallholder famers' livelihood vulnerability to climate change/variability in the Upper Blue Nile basin. We conducted a household survey (n = 391) across three distinct agroecological communities and a formative composite index of livelihood vulnerability (LVI) was constructed. The Mann-Kendall test and the standard precipitation index (SPI) were employed to analyze trends of rainfall, temperature, and drought prevalence for the period from 1982 to 2016. The communities across watersheds showed a relative difference in the overall livelihood vulnerability index. Aba Gerima (midland) was found to be more vulnerable, with a score of 0.37, while Guder (highland) had a relatively lower LVI with a 0.34 index score. Given similar exposure to climate variability and drought episodes, communities' livelihood vulnerability was mainly attributed to their low adaptive capacity and higher sensitivity indicators. Adaptive capacity was largely constrained by a lack of participation in community-based organizations and a lack of income diversification. This study will have practical implications for policy development in heterogeneous agroecological regions for sustainable livelihood development and climate change adaptation programs. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Drought; Livelihood vulnerability; Shannon-entropy index","adaptive management; agroecology; climate change; climate variation; drought; environmental indicator; index method; livelihood; smallholder; sustainable development; vulnerability; watershed; Blue Nile Basin; Ethiopia; Nile Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075858805

The amount of GHG produced by any higher institution can be quantified using carbon footprint (CF) estimation, of which the most established is UI GreenMetric carbon footprint approach. This study determine the CF at University Malaysia Terengganu, one of the public universities in Malaysia by quantifying 6 categories that are Setting and Infrastructure (SI), Energy and Climate Change (EC), Water (WR), Waste (WS), Transport (TR) and Educational (ED). Data was collected utilising primary and secondary data collection whereby primary data collection involves TR indicator for traffic volume. Other categories data were provided by the relevant authorities of UMT. Result shows a decreasing emission of CF for academic year 2017/2018 and 2018/2019; from 1212145.524 metric ton to 1209743.2 metric ton, respectively. This positive improvement is made possible by 2 approaches: employing correct technique of measurements plus verification of data and UMT top management sustainability plans and actions. However, there are 2 categories that need more attention for improvement i.e. WR (19%) and EC (17%). The findings from this study show a better achievement compared to previous year because of overestimated for TR indicator and unverified data calculation during secondary data collection. Outcome from this study increases UMT ranking from 13 to 6, out of 18 participated universities in Malaysia and the most important, it enables the university leaders to set up the eco-accommodating strategies and oversee social changes among the academic community. © IJSTR 2019.","Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Higher institution; Malaysia; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075171564

The success of phytoremediation relies on the size of the plant biomass and bioavailability of the metal for plant uptake. This research was carried out to determine the effect of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) ligand and Cu-resistant plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) on phytoremediation efficiency of selected plants as well as fractionation and bioavailability of copper (Cu) in a contaminated soil. The test conditions included three plant species (maize: Zea mays L., sunflower: Helianthus annuus L., and pumpkin: Cucurbita pepo L.) and six treatments, comprising two PGPR strains (Pseudomonas cedrina K4 and Stenotrophomonas sp. A22), two PGPR strains with EDTA, EDTA, and control (without PGPR and EDTA). The combination of EDTA and PGPR enhanced the Cu concentration in both shoot and root tissues and increased the plant biomass. The Cu specific uptake was at a maximum level in the shoots of pumpkin plants when treated with the PGPR strain K4 + EDTA (202 μg pot−1), and the minimum amount of Cu was recorded for sunflower with no PGPR or EDTA addition (29.6 μg pot−1). The result of the PGPR-EDTA treatments showed that the combined application of EDTA and PGPR increased the shoot Cu-specific uptake approximately fourfold in pumpkin. Pumpkin with the highest shoot Cu specific uptake and maize with the highest root Cu specific uptake were the most effective plants in phytoextraction and phytostabilization, respectively. The effectiveness of different PGPR-EDTA treatments in increasing Cu specific uptake by crop plants was assessed by measuring the amount of Cu extracted from the rhizosphere soil adhering to the roots of crop species, by the use of the single extractants Diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), H2O, NH4NO3, and NH4OAc. PGPR-EDTA treatments increased the amount of water-extractable Cu from rhizosphere soils more than ten times that of the control. The combined application of the EDTA and PGPR reduced the carbonated Fe and Mn oxide–bound Cu in the contaminated soil, and increased the soluble and exchangeable concentration of Cu. Pumpkin, with high shoot biomass and the highest shoot Cu specific uptake was found to be the most effective field crop in phytoextraction of Cu from the contaminated soil. The results of this pot study demonstrated that the EDTA+PGPR treatment could play an important role in increasing the Cu bioavailability and specific uptake by plants, and thus increasing the phytoremediation efficiency of plants in Cu-contaminated areas. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Copper; DTPA; EDTA; PGPR; Sequential extraction; Single","bioavailability; biomass; copper; EDTA; ligand; rhizobacterium; rhizosphere; sequential extraction; Cucurbita pepo; Helianthus; Helianthus annuus; Pseudomonas cedrina; Rhizobiales; Stenotrophomonas sp.; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073785805
