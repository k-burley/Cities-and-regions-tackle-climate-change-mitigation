We illustrate the importance of an integrated approach by estimating costs and benefits of a proposed energy saving program for Hungary, originally designed to reduce CO2 emissions. The dominant benefit of implementing the program is likely to be reduced health damage from local pollutants. Also reduced costs of material damage and to a lesser extent vegetation damage contribute to make the net benefit considerable. Compared to the reduction in these local and regional effects, the benefits from reducing greenhouse gases are likely to be minor. Since local effects in general occur much earlier after measures have been implemented than effects of increased emissions of greenhouse gases, inclusion of local effects makes evaluation of climate policy less dependent on the choice of discount rate. In our opinion, similar results are likely for many measures originally designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases particularly in some areas in developing countries with high local pollution levels. Main uncertainties in the analysis, e.g. in the relationships between damage and pollution level, are discussed.","Climate change; Cost-benefit; Discount rate; Hungary; Integrated assessment; Mitigation; Pollution","climate change; cost benefit analysis; emission control; energy conservation; environmental economics; pollution effect; Hungary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032854441

Cylindrical specimens of 2, 3, and 4-mm diameter and length are suspended in a thermocouple wire and radiatively ignited after melting in a pure carbon dioxide environment at 1 atm under reduced-gravity conditions. This novel experimental technique allows the study of free-floating bulk metal samples exhibiting a spherically symmetric flame. Spherical flames are obtained during steady-state burning of the metal sample with increasing metal-oxide accumulation in an outer shell. Only intermittent explosions and residual accelerations in the airplane distort the spherical flame shape. Burning times twice as long as in normal gravity and five times longer than in magnesium-oxygen flames are observed. The burning time is proportional to the square of the metal sample diameter. Combustion of magnesium with pure carbon monoxide is not possible without a constant heating of the sample. A numerical model combining gas-phase chemical kinetics and transport mechanisms simulates the one-dimensional, spherically symmetric combustion process by using opposed flows of fuel and oxidizer in a diffusion flame configuration. The resulting concentration and temperature fields calculated with the model reveal a reaction zone thickness similar to that observed experimentally and a temperature profile close to the measured value. © 1999 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,"Aerospace engineering; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Diamond films; Magnesium; Metals; Rockets; Thermocouples; Combustion pro-cess; Cylindrical specimens; Experimental techniques; In-situ resource utilizations; Pure carbon dioxide; Residual acceleration; Temperature profiles; Transport mechanism; Combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983154323

Thermosphere dynamics and dynamo electric fields serving as drivers of the coupling processes are responsible for the major EITS phenomena and their variabilities at different time scales. Especially, the day-to-day variabilities of the equatorial spread F (ESF) have received specific attention because of interest in space application areas as well. Significant advances were achieved in our understanding and representation of quiet and disturbed electric fields. The STEP period also marked notable improvement in the experimental diagnostic facilities available in the equatorial regions as well as in theoretical modeling of the interactive processes that control the major EITS phenomena. Data from coordinated observational campaigns have contributed to a better understanding of the EITS global responses to magnetospheric disturbances. The advances to be briefly discussed in this paper concern most of the major phenomena and the inherent characteristics of the EITS: the equatorial electric field and its sunset enhancement; thermospheric winds and temperature including the MTM (midnight temperature maximum); peculiar features of the ionosphere in the immediate vicinity of the magnetic equator; equatorial spread F/plasma bubble irregularities, including the energy requirement for large scale field aligned irregularities; equatorial anomalies in ion/neutral densities and temperatures.

Vulnerability as defined here pertains to individuals and social groups. It is the state of individuals, of groups, of communities defined in terms of their ability to cope with and adapt to any external stress placed on their livelihoods and well-being. This proposed approach puts the social and economic well-being of society at the centre of the analysis, thereby reversing the central focus of approaches to climate impact assessment based on impacts on and the adaptability of natural resources or ecosystems and which only subsequently address consequences for human well-being. The vulnerability or security of any group is determined by the availability of resources and, crucially, by the entitlement of individuals and groups to call on these resources. This perspective extends the concept of entitlements developed within neoclassical and institutional economics. Within this conceptual framework, vulnerability can be seen as a socially-constructed phenomenon influenced by institutional and economic dynamics. The study develops proxy indicators of vulnerability related to the structure of economic relations and the entitlements which govern them, and shows how these can be applied to a District in coastal lowland Vietnam. This paper outlines the lessons of such an approach to social vulnerability for the assessment of climate change at the global scale. We argue that the socio-economic and biophysical processes that determine vulnerability are manifest at the local, national, regional and global level but that the state of vulnerability itself is associated with a specific population. Aggregation from one level to another is therefore not appropriate and global-scale analysis is meaningful only in so far as it deals with the vulnerability of the global community itself.","Climate variability; Institutional analysis; Social Vietnam; Socio-economic indicators; Vulnerability","climate change; environmental planning; methodology; socioeconomic indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033494172

The initial materials were characterized using sorption of nitrogen, Boehm titration, potentiometric titration, water sorption, thermal analysis, and temperature-programmed desorption. The breakthrough tests were done at low concentrations of H2S in the input gas to simulate conditions in water pollution control plants where carbon beds are used as odor adsorbents. In spite of apparent general similarities in the origin of the materials, method of activation, surface chemistry, and porosity, significant differences in their performance as hydrogen sulfide adsorbents were observed. Results show that the combined effect of the presence of pores large enough to accommodate surface functional groups and small enough to have the film of water at relatively low pressure contributes to oxidation of hydrogen sulfide. Moreover, there are features of activated carbon surfaces such as local environment of acidic/basic groups along with the presence of alkali metals which are important to the oxidation process.","Activated carbons; Breakthrough capacity; Hydrogen sulfide; Porosity; Surface chemistry","activated carbon; hydrogen sulfide; adsorption; article; desorption; oxidation; porosity; potentiometry; priority journal; thermal analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033563875

The numerical model of nonstationary nonuniform secondary electron emission provoked by primary low-intensity beam from a cathode was developed. The results of computer simulations of electron cloud formation due to nonlinear azimuthal instability under the condition of strong nonuniform secondary self-sustaining emission are described. The existence of an instability with transverse quasistationary leakage current of a few percent of Child-Langmuir current and rotating states of electron flow has been shown under conditions of conservation of full power and full momentum of the system. Emphasized is the dominant influence of a feedback on dynamics of electron beam modulation and on arising transverse leakage current to the anode across the external magnetic field exceeding the critical magnetic field of magnetic insulation. Strong azimuthal instability exists if the current of primary beam is much less then the secondary emission current. If these currents are comparable, the instability is weak and decays in time due to the absence of strong azimuthal inhomogeneity of secondary emission current. In the case of the emission of primary beam alone (secondary emission absent), deep modulation and leakage current arises only if the condition of saturated regime of a cathode is satisfied. Such behaviour is conditioned by a feedback on the emitting surfaces similar to the case of nonuniform secondary emission which provides additional correct azimuthal modulation of electron flow by rotating crossed E×B-field and amplifies the instability. No azimuthal instability is observed if the current of primary beam is space-charge limited.

However some points of concern remained unsolved, such as a large increase in THC and CO, higher fuel consumption, and an operating region narrowly limited to partial loads, compared to conventional diesel operation. In this paper, the causes of PREDIC's problem areas were analyzed through engine performance tests and combustion observation with a single cylinder engine, through fuel spray observation with a high-pressure vessel, and through numerical modeling. Subsequently, measurable improvements were achieved on the basis of these analyses. As a result, the ignition and combustion processes were clarified in terms of PREDIC fuel-air mixture formation. Thus, THC and CO emissions could be decreased by adopting a pintle type injection nozzle, or a reduced top-land-crevice piston. Fuel consumption was also improved by application of EGR or the addition of an oxygenated component to the diesel fuel. The operating region could be extended to higher load conditions by MULtiple stage DIesel Combustion (MULDIC), in which the first stage combustion corresponds to PREDIC. Furthermore, by combining PREDIC at low loads with MULDIC at high loads, Japanese Diesel 13 Mode NOx emissions could be reduced to 1 g/kWh.

Meanwhile, if not effectively evaluated, it could lead to disastrous consequences since its depth normally appears less than it really is. As a case study, carbon steel heat exchangers in a typical fresh cooling water environment were expected to serve under normal operating conditions for at least twelve years. However, two exchangers in service for less than one year had experienced significant failure indications related to severe localized deep pitting. This was mainly attributed to an under-deposit corrosion phenomenon inside tubes propagated by improper monitoring and a peculiar change in the cooling water treatment. To effectively and precisely evaluate the encountered pitting damage, a simple measurement and analyses approach was devised. In this paper, the pitting measurement technique and the damage evaluation approach are presented and discussed in detail. © 1999 by NACE International.","Cooling water; Heat exchangers; Pitting; Pitting measurement; Statistical analysis; Under-deposit corrosion","Carbon steel; Cooling; Cooling water; Deposits; Heat exchangers; Statistical methods; Steel corrosion; Steel heat treatment; Water treatment; Analysis approach; Damage evaluation; Inspection technique; Measurement and analysis; Measurement techniques; Normal operating conditions; Under-deposit corrosions; Water environments; Pitting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0009082508

Based on this monitoring programme, the previous national UK emission estimates by Eduljee and Dyke (1) of 560-1100 g I-TEQ a-1 for 1993 have been revised downwards to 220-660 g I-TEQ a-1.

(eelgrass) to balance the daily photosynthetic deficit by mobilization of carbon reserves stored in below-ground tissues during a period of extreme winter light limitation. A quantitative understanding of the mobilization process and its limitations is essential to the development of robust models predicting minimum light levels required to maintain healthy seagrass populations. Plants were grown in running seawater tanks under 2 light regimes. One treatment was provided with 2 h irradiance-saturated photosynthesis (H(sat)) to produce severe light limitation, while control plants were grown under 7 h H(sat), simulating the typical wintertime condition in Monterey Bay, California, USA. Although plants maintained under 2 h H(sat) were more severely carbon limited than plants grown under 7 h H(sat), whole-plant carbon balance calculated from metabolic needs and growth rates was negative for both H(sat) treatments. The eelgrass studied here responded to negative carbon balances by suppressing the production of new roots, depleting sucrose reserves, and effecting a gradual decrease in growth rate and an increase in the activity of sucrose synthase (SS, E.C. 2.4.1.13) in sink tissues in the terminal stages of carbon stress. The 7 h H(sat) plants survived the 45 d course of the experiment while the plants grown under 2 h H(sat) died within 30 d, even though one-third of their carbon reserves remained immobilized in the rhizome. Thus, extreme light limitation can prevent full mobilization of carbon reserves stored in below-ground tissues, probably through the effects of anoxia on translocation. Metabolic rates, particularly photosynthesis and respiration of the shoot, were unaffected by prolonged carbon limitation in both treatments. The patterns observed here can provide useful indices for assessing the state and fate of seagrass ecosystems in advance of catastrophic declines.","Carbon balance; Light; Photosynthesis; Resource allocation; Seagrass","carbohydrate metabolism; carbon; cell respiration; enzyme activity; growth rate; irradiation; light; metabolic regulation; model; photosynthesis; plant growth; plant metabolism; resource allocation; simulation; sucrose; sucrose synthase; survival; United States; winter; carbon budget; compensation; environmental stress; light availability; photosynthesis; physiological response; resource allocation; seagrass; Halophila; Magnoliophyta; Zostera marina; Zostera marina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033554645

Sanitary landfills are an important source of methane gas due to biodegradation processes of the organic component of municipal solid waste (MSW) used. Some sanitary landfills in Jordan are designed and operated as typical landfills where anaerobic biodegradation processes prevail in decomposing the organic part of MSW. Others, however, are basically open dump sites where aerobic decomposition of organics is significant. Sewage is dumped without any treatment into open ponds near few landfilling sites in the county. Generation rates and characterization of MSW components as well as dumping/landfilling practices are surveyed in order to estimate emissions CH4 from these sites for the year 1994. Guidelines and formulas adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) are used to reach reasonable estimates of annual emissions of methane. Locally-available waste statistics are used in cases where those of IPCC guidelines are not representative to Jordan. Total 1994 CH4 emissions from MSW management facilities in Jordan are estimated at 371.76 Giga gram (Gg). where 351.12 Gg (94.45%) are contributed by sanitary landfills, 19.83 Gg (5.33%) by MSW open dumps and 0.81 Gg (0.22%) by raw sewage dumping ponds. It is believed that this study would help determine the contribution of saanitary landfills to the GHGs emissions in Jordan and it will, also, provide decision makers with essential information with respect to Jordan's share in the global responsibility of GHGs environmental impacts.","CH4 emissions; Municipal landfilling; Sewage; Solid waste",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040441824

The Credit for Early Action bill in the Senate is a step in the right direction. But there is a much better way to stimulate large voluntary greenhouse reductions by American businesses - and to begin right away we recommend that Congress move quickly to mandate that any subsequent regulatory system - whether or not designed to meet the Kyoto commitments - be based on an efficiency ratio approach. This ratio would be established by setting greenhouse gas limits as a function of production, with the units of production depending on the specific industry. For example, electric utilities might have a standard of X tons of greenhouse gas emissions allowable for every Y units of energy produced. Steel companies would likewise have emission limits based on tons of steel produced. And so on, for each sector. This is the general approach that was used in establishing sulfur limits for utilities in the Clean Air Act's acid rain program. Under this efficiency ratio approach, any early voluntary action to reduce greenhouse emissions will receive full credit if a regulatory system were to be implemented. For example, if a utility takes steps either to reduce emissions or to replace inefficient systems, or both, it will reduce its ratio by lowering emissions for the same level of production. Put simply, if a regulatory system is implemented in the future, no matter when, companies that have improved the efficiency ratio beforehand will have a lesser need to reduce emissions. If the facility has entered into a sequestration or demand reduction project, the greenhouse gas reduction would be credited to the emissions side of the ratio. Further, it makes absolutely no difference when the action is taken. Finally, the efficiency ratio approach requires no baseline year nor government approvals. Once the ratio is established for each industry, the system is in place and functioning.",,"carbon emission; emission control; global warming; regulatory approach; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033029829

Our studies were designed to address the physiological factors which may be responsible for poor woody plant regeneration in montane riparian habitats of Rocky Mountain National Park, Colo. As these systems act to insure the delivery of fresh water to downstream users, the maintenance of their integrity is critical. We quantified plant water potentials, instantaneous rates of carbon fixation, leaf carbon isotope discrimination (δ), leaf nitrogen content and water sources using stable isotopes of water (δ18O). The carbon and water relations of Salix were significantly affected by winter browsing by elk and in some cases by landscape position with regard to proximity to active streams. Winter browsing of Salix by elk significantly increased summer plant water potentials and integrative measures of gas exchange (Δ), though browsing did not consistently affect instantaneous rates of photosynthesis, leaf nitrogen or the sources of water used by Salix. No effect of experimental manipulations of surface water conditions on Salix physiology was observed, likely due to the mesic nature of our study period. Using a two-member linear mixing model, from δ18O values we calculated that Salix appears to rely on streams for approximately 80% of its water. In contrast, the graminoid Carex derives almost 50% of its water from rainfall, indicating divergent water source use by these two life forms. Based on these findings, winter browsing by elk improved Salix water balance possibly by altering the shoot to root ratio which in turn leads to higher water potentials and higher degrees of season-long gas exchange, while experimental damming had in general no effect on the physiological performance of Salix plants. In addition, as the water sources of Salix and Carex were significantly different, competition for water may not influence the growth, development, and regeneration of Salix. Thus, under the conditions of our study, herbivory had a positive effect on the physiological performance of Salix, but it is still unclear whether these changes in physiology transcend into improved Salix regeneration and survivorship. However, under drier environmental conditions such as lower snowpacks and lower stream flows, the browsing resistance of Salix and ecosystem regeneration may be greatly hindered because the reliance of Salix on stream water makes it vulnerable to changes in surface water and hydrological conditions.","Plant-animal interactions; Riparian ecosystems; Rocky Mountain National Park; Stable isotopes; Ungulates","browsing; carbon; hydrology; isotopic analysis; riparian vegetation; water relations; United States; Carex; Salix monticola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032843857

Introduction of the high-yielding rice varieties and improvement of cultural technique have increased rice production, and self-sufficiency was attained in 1984. However, increasing population and decreasing land for rice cultivation could threaten the food supply in the country. Rice production is also threatened by interannual climate variability and possible climate change. To provide policy-makers and planners with information to formulate a strategy to cope with interannual climate variability and the possible climate change, rice yields of 2 production areas on Java were simulated using the DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) rice growth simulation model. The crop model predicted lower rice yields for different management options, compared with experiment plots, but predicted yields similar to or slightly higher than the farmers' yield. In general, the predictions relate quite well. The GISS, GFDL, and UKMO climate models predicted higher rainfall, solar radiation, and temperature in both locations. In the higher rainfall and lower temperature of the West Java site, the climate change scenarios reduced rice grain yield in both the first and second crops. During normal years in the relatively warmer and dryer climate of the East Java site, there was no significant yield reduction due to climate change, except under the UKMO scenario in the second crop. Because high temperature and CO2 concentration favor rice growth, development of more heat-tolerant varieties probably can compensate for the yield losses due to climate change in the future. Except for the GISS and GFDL climate scenarios in the first crop and the baseline climate scenario in the second crop in the West Java site, higher yield losses were predicted because of interannual climate variability. Since the dry spell threat is more imminent and frequent, to improve preparedness a short-term climate prediction for the tropical region is urgently needed.","Climate change; Climate model; Crop model; El Nino; Indonesia; Java; Rice","climate change; climate effect; rice; yield; Indonesia; Java",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033609619

NEXAFS allows studying the elemented composition and chemical bonding in a material, whereas PEEM combines this ability with imaging of the sample. Lubricated and unlubricated disks were worn under various conditions using carbon coated and uncoated sliders. The wear tracks on the hard disks were investigated using PEEM to find chemical and elemental changes caused by the wear. Local NEXAFS spectra taken in wear tracks using the PEEM microscope show no chemical changes on unlubricated disks, just a reduction of the hard carbon overcoat thickness. On lubricated disks remarkable chemical modifications of the lubricants caused by the wear are observed if the disks failed the wear tests. The chemical changes are manifested in a formation of various new carbon-oxygen (mostly carboxylic) bonds in the wear tracks and in a strong reduction of the amount of fluorine and carbon. The chemical modifications were only found inside the wear tracks and are clearly caused by the wear. It was found that lubricant degradation is not solely a mechanical process of molecule scis.sion but accompanied by oxidation reactions.

To accomplish its mission, OIT established the customer-oriented Industries of the Future initiative designed to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by the most energy-intensive industries across the country. Industries of the Future partnerships focus on achieving three major objectives: (1) lowering raw material and depletable energy use per unit of output, (2) improving labor and capital productivity, and (3) reducing generation of wastes and pollutants. Such partnerships exist in nine industrial sectors, including the agriculture, aluminum, chemical, forest products, glass, metal casting, mining, steel, and petroleum industries. Industry's efficient use of energy is critical to the U.S. economy. Industry consumed almost 31 quads of primary energy in 1994 - about 38% of all energy used in the United States. Of this amount, about 25 quads were used in manufacturing. Within manufacturing, energy use is concentrated in a relatively small number of industries. Based on the 1994 Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey, pulp and paper, primary metals, chemicals, petroleum refining, and stone, clay, and glass accounted for 82% of all energy used in manufacturing in 1994.1,2 These and other energy-intensive industry sectors are targeted by the Industries of the Future initiative to establish government/industry partnerships for developing and delivering advanced science and technology options to improve resource efficiency and competitiveness. The cornerstone of the Industries of the Future initiative involves working through these established government/industry partnerships to encourage industries to develop strategic visions and specific technology development ""roadmaps,"" or plans, that outline the pathways to fulfill these visions. OIT and other government research and development (R&amp;D) programs use such roadmaps to focus scarce public and private resources on the most important research areas. This strategy enables government and industry to work together to improve energy efficiency, environmental performance, and global competitiveness. OIT's goal is to reduce industrial energy use per unit of output by 25% by 2010. An analysis indicates that successful development of the current portfolio of technologies in which OIT and its partners have invested will lead to reductions of 1-2 quads in industrial energy demand by 2010. This would also result in annual carbon reductions of more than 30 million metric tons. This article will provide examples of the GHG emissions reduction technologies made possible through cost-shared research and development projects focusing on the needs identified by the Industries of the Future initiatives.

If states can convert all tests to consistent IM240 readings, they will be able to better characterize fleet emissions and to evaluate the impact of inspection and maintenance and other programs on emissions over time. Using a random sample of vehicles in Arizona which received full 240-second tests, we use regression analysis to estimate the relationship between emissions at second 240 and emissions at earlier seconds in the test. We examine the influence of other variables such as age, model-year group, and the pollution level itself on this relationship. We also use the estimated coefficients in several applications. First, we try to shed light on the frequent assertion that the results of the dynamometer test provide guidance for vehicle repair of failing vehicles. Using a probit analysis, we find that the probability that a failing vehicle will pass the test on the first retest is greater the longer the test has progressed. Second, we test the accuracy of our estimates for forecasting fleet emissions from partial-test emissions results in Arizona. We find forecasted fleet average emissions to be very close to the actual fleet averages for light-duty vehicles, but not quite as good for trucks, particularly when NOx emissions are forecast. © 1999 Air and Waste Management Association.",,"carbon monoxide; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxide; air pollutant; article; exhaust gas; methodology; priority journal; United States; Lanes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032599721

There is a wide spread of published data and the worst SI engines would exceed the future diesel particulate emissions regulations. However, most modern SI engines with a catalyst will easily meet the future diesel particulate emissions regulations, although their particulates emissions are a significant fraction of these regulations. Steady state lambda 1 results are presented for a Ford Zetec SI engine at conditions representative of the urban driving cycle at 5 and 10kW power output and also at WOT. The impact of a cold start and EGR at the two low power conditions was also investigated. The particulate emissions for petrol were of the order of 5% of the future (2005) diesel emissions regulations and were approximately 20 mg/kg fuel (about 2 mg/mile or 1.3 mg/km). This was much lower than all reported results for particulate emissions for SI engines over a FTP or EC test cycle, indicating that the highest emissions were generated during transient operation. Analysis of the particulates showed that the bulk of the mass was ash and the second largest fraction was unburnt lubricating oil. Carbon emissions were only significant at high power WOT with fuel enrichment, at other conditions carbon was less than 10% of the total mass. At WOT rich operation the highest particulate emissions were recorded and these were 10 times the level at the 5 and 10 kW conditions and about 50% of the EC 2005 diesel particulate levels.

Opportunities may arise in the application of gas turbines in the pulp and paper industry and the wider use of biomass derived fuels in general. These fuels, as produced, typically contain inorganic impurities originating from ash forming substances and other minor constituents of the feedstock Also, depending on the biomass treatment process, they contain varying amounts of complex organic derivatives, commonly referred to as tars, and some simpler condensable vapors. The Department of Energy is sponsoring work aimed at providing realistic data on low level constituents and impurities in gas derived by indirect gasification of wood, some of which may have disproportionately severe effects on turbine operation, durability, and emissions performance. It is planned to sample gas from both laboratory scale (up to 20 tons/ day) and pilot scale (200 tons/day) installations and to assess the effectiveness of wet scrubbing procedures and catalytic reforming of condensables in cleaning up the gases This paper discusses the rationale for this work, experimental approach, and analytic procedures that will be used. The work will include the operation of a small (220-kWe) gas turbine to provide direct information on the impact of using the final biomass derived gas delivered by the system. The laboratory scale work is currently under way, with a planned completion date in mid 2000.

In this context, with the stringent emission regulations, the chemical characteristics of fuels have become of increasing importance. Petroleum derived fuels are complex mixtures of hydrocarbons containing hundreds of different aliphatic and aromatic compounds. EPA, to control the exhaust pollutants, regularly publishes the international updates on limits for aromatic, olefins and saturate contents in gasoline fuels. The Indian legislative standard DOC No. MOST/CMVR/TAP-115/116 specifies olefin and aromatic contents to 20% and 45% max. by volume respectively for the Indian reference petrol. While, Indian specification IS: 2796-1995 has laid down the limits for benzene content to 5% max. by volume for leaded regular, unleaded regular & unleaded premium gasoline for the year 2000 norms. However, there is no control for aromatic in diesel fuels in the Indian specification IS 1460-1995. Essentially diesel fuels are olefin free with typical chemical class composition of 15-30% aromatics and 70-80% saturated aliphatic [1]. The polycyclic aromatic fraction of diesel fuel contains three, four and larger ring aromatics. These compounds are thought to contribute towards diesel exhaust polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC), both as unburned fuel and through pyrolysis plus pyrosynthetic route. The fuel droplet core, depending upon the size for surface evaporation and availability of oxygen for combustion, undergoes ""pyrolysis"". Then the unstable compounds forms some ring chains the process being defined as ""pyrosynthesis"". Many PAC are listed as EPA priority pollutants because they are known or suspected mutagens and/or carcinogens. The percentage of diesel powered vehicles on the road is increasing significantly owing to their superior fuel economy over gasoline powered vehicles. As diesel exhaust emissions are increasingly being viewed as an important contributor to environmental pollution. Accurate analysis of fuel composition and PAC in both diesel fuels and exhaust particulate is necessary to understand and control the problem. Moreover based on research findings formulation of diesel quality standards should be reviewed to improve public safety. Fuel specifications for commercial fuel and reference fuel for India year 2000 emission norms have recently been published. The worry is that the standard does not speak about the composition except certain physico-chemical properties nor seem to have taken cognisance of serious repurcussions of the specific class of aromatics present both from the point of view of gaseous and PNA emission. The recent european auto oil programme did a lot of research work on fuel vs emission taking for granted their fuel quality. However, more work is needed to get further details of fuel quality. The development of suitable methods for the determination of fuel constituents has also been the subject of interest of intense research for the last many years. The present paper is on the experimental techniques developed on High Performance Liquid Chromatography Coupled with High Resolution Gas Chromatography (HPLC/HRGC) which are used for ascertaining the composition of Indian commercial verses the reference fuel used in the developed countries. The results and discussions reveal that the Indian gasoline and diesel fuels need to be reformulated to meet the future demands of emission regulations and to be environmentally friendly with less carcinogenic and mutagenic pollutants. The paper also discusses the laboratory procedure developed to study diesel fuel adulteration with kerosene and its effects on aromatic and aliphatic contents.",,"Aromatic hydrocarbons; Aromatization; Combustion; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Environmental Protection Agency; Fuel economy; Gas chromatography; Gasoline; High performance liquid chromatography; Laws and legislation; Olefins; Pollution; Pyrolysis; Specifications; Chemical characteristic; Diesel exhaust emissions; Environmental pollutions; Experimental techniques; High-resolution gas chromatographies; Petroleum-derived fuels; Physicochemical property; Polycyclic aromatic compounds; Gas fuel analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877186269

Regulation of the carbon flow into this pathway takes place mainly by feedback inhibition of this enzyme by threonine. We have isolated and characterized three HOM3 mutants that show growth inhibition by threonine due to a severe, threonine-induced reduction of the carbon flow into the aspartate pathway, leading to methionine limitation. One of the mutants has an aspartate kinase which is 30-fold more strongly inhibited by threonine than the wild-type enzyme. The predicted amino acid substitution in this mutant, A406T, is located in a region associated with the modulation of the enzymatic activity. The other two mutants carry an aspartate kinase with reduced affinity for its substrates, aspartate and ATP. The corresponding amino acid substitutions, K26I and G25D, affect residues located in the vicinity of a highly consented lysine-phenylalanine-glycine-glycine (KFGG) stretch present in the N-terminal part of the aspartate kinase, to which no function has so far been assigned. We suggest that this region is involved in substrate binding. Mutagenesis of a HOM3 region centred in the KFGG-coding triplets generated alleles that determine threonine sensitivity or auxotrophy for threonine and methionine, but not a phenotype associated with a feedback-resistant aspartate kinase, indicating that this region is not involved in the allosteric response of the enzyme.","Allosteric regulation; Aspartate kinase; Threonine biosynthesis; Yeast","adenosine triphosphate; aspartate kinase; aspartic acid; mutant protein; threonine; amino acid sequence; amino acid substitution; article; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme regulation; fungal genetics; fungus mutant; gene mutation; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; saccharomyces cerevisiae; structure activity relation; Alleles; Allosteric Regulation; Amino Acid Sequence; Aspartate Kinase; Catalysis; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Structure-Activity Relationship; Threonine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344131962

Within this constraint two analyses have been made, the first based on regulation to tackle emissions, the other on raising prices. In the first one, called Kyoto Analysis 1, approximately half the reduction in CO2 emissions is achieved by imposing a uniform additional reduction of 1.25% per year from 1998 to 2010 in energy intensity across all sectors of final demand throughout the OECD. The other half of emission reductions is achieved by substituting fossil fuel in power generation by non-fossil fuel, whether nuclear or renewable energy. In the second scenario, which is called Kyoto Analysis 2, instead of regulation, a uniform carbon value, or charge, is added to the price of fossil fuels in the OECD which reflects the carbon content of each fuel. The additional charge would be sufficient to achieve approximately half of the fall in CO2 emissions necessary to meet the Kyoto targets. The charge to achieve that reduction has been calculated at $250 per tonne of carbon content. The two Kyoto analyses are quite different in their impacts. Because of different consumer reactions and dynamics, changes in fuel use under the market-based approach of Kyoto Analysis 2 vary considerably between fuels and between different energy uses. For example, throughout the OECD, electricity and fuel consumption for the purposes of mobility is much less price-sensitive than demand for fossil fuel for nonmobile uses. That means that most of the impact of the carbon value would be felt in demand for heating fuel, for example.

Design: A prospective study was performed in normal-hearing young adults using simple and complex regression analyses to clarify the relationship between ultrahigh frequency (UHF) hearing and DPOAE levels at lower frequencies, as well as the influence of hearing levels for frequencies within the conventional test range and subject age on this association. Methods: Average DPOAE levels between 4 to 8 kHz, which were elicited by equilevel primary tones of low to moderate levels, were measured as level-frequency functions, or distortion- product (DP) grams, and related to the mean UHF hearing levels from 11.2 to 20 kHz. The median hearing level for the UHF hearing was used to separate subjects into good and poor UHF hearers. This distinction was then used to compare DPOAE levels from 4 to 8 kHz for the 2 groups to determine if UHF hearing status influenced DPOAE levels at lower frequencies. Results: Simple regression analysis revealed that the 4 to 8-kHz DPOAE levels were significantly correlated with the pure-tone average (PTA) from 11.2 to 20 kHz. However, the PTA for 4 and 8 kHz was also significantly correlated with the PTA for UHF hearing. Further multiple regression analyses revealed that UHF hearing significantly and uniquely accounted for approximately 14% of the variance in DPOAE levels from 4 to 8 kHz for most of the primary-tone level combinations. In contrast, neither the PTA for the conventional hearing range nor subject age contributed significantly to the DPOAE variance. Conclusions: The findings suggest that UHF hearing influences DPOAEs at significantly lower frequencies because emissions are sensitive to subtle changes in outer hair cells not yet detected by pure-tone thresholds in this region or because alterations in the basal cochlea affect the generation of lower-frequency DPOAEs originating from more apical cochlear regions.",,"adolescent; adult; article; distortion product otoacoustic emission; female; frequency modulation; functional assessment; hearing; human; human experiment; male; normal human; statistical analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033048666

Indies, New York, NY, United States","The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was signed by some 153 countries at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in 1992, represented a singular triumph for the geographically dispersed group of island states and low-lying coastal developing countries, located in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans, as well as in the Carribean, South China and Mediterranean Seas, and known as the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS). This article focuses on the goals of AOSIS during the negotiations leading up to the adoption of the UNFCCC. For the first time in the history of the United Nations, a group of small states, hitherto relegated to the sidelines, was able to develop a specific negotiating agenda addressing areas which are of overriding concern to them and succeeded in having those concerns incorporated in a legally binding Convention of historic importance. As this article reveals, AOSIS set itself 12 negotiating goals during the negotiating rounds leading up to the UNFCCC, and 10 of these 12 goals were realized. Nevertheless, AOSIS, whose member states are most vulnerable to the possible adverse effects of climate change, was particularly concerned about those provisions of the UNFCCC that were either watered-down significantly, made largely meaningless or excluded altogether. These include: the absence of definite targets or specific timetables for the significant reduction of carbon dioxide by the industrialized countries of the North; the lack of permanent and clear financing arrangements in particular the lack of definitive financial provisions for adaptive response measures to the adverse impacts of climate change such as sea-level rise; and the absence of a specific provision for the implementation of coastal zone management schemes for those countries most vulnerable to sea-level rise. As the UNFCCC moves into the implementation phase, AOSIS should and must build on its past success. To do so, it will need to develop clearly defined initiatives aimed at strengthening the commitments for financing and insurance, and to seek inclusion of a provision to develop and finance coastal zone management schemes for the most vulnerable small states. While the article covers the AOSIS negotiating period up to and including the Earth Summit in June 1992, we nevertheless postulate some possible objectives which the AOSIS group might wish to consider in what is sure to be an intensive post-Earth Summit phase of the UNFCCC, leading up to the first Conference of the Parties of that Convention.","Alliance of Small Island States; Earth Summit; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change","climate change; environmental policy; negotiation process; small island state",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032728837

Weathering of waste material (2.6-26.6 wt% As) leads to the formation of water soluble. As-bearing mineral salts (pharmacolite, arsenolite, krautite) and sulfates which affect surface waters after rainfall events. Highly contaminated soils, covering about 12 ha at the mine, have extreme As (mean 0.93 wt%) and elevated Fe, Ag, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn values compared with background soils (mean 8 ppm As). Regionally contaminated soils have a mean As content of 55 ppm and the contaminated area is estimated to be 60 km2. The soils have acquired their metal enrichments by hydromorphic dispersion from the dissolution of As-rich particulates, erosion of As-rich particulates from the dumps, and atmospheric fall-out from processing plant emissions. Stream sediments within a radius of 2 km of the mine display metal enrichments (62 ppm to 27.5 wt% As) compared with the mean background of 23 ppm As. This enrichment has been caused by erosion and collapse of waste-dump material into local creeks, seepages and ephemeral surface runoff, and erosion and transportation of contaminated soil into the local drainage system. Water samples from a mine shaft and waste-dump seepages have the lowest pH (4.1) and highest As values (up to 13.9 mg/L), and contain algal blooms of Klebsormidium sp. The variable flow regime of the Mole River causes dilution of As-rich drainage waters to background values (mean 0.0086 mg/L As) within 2.5 km downstream. Bioaccumulation of As and phytotoxicity to lower plants has been observed in the mine area, but several metal-tolerant plant species (Angophora floribunda, Cassinia laevis, Chrysocephalum apiculatum, Cymbopogon refractus, Cynodon dactylon, Juncus subsecundus and Poa sieberiana) colonise the periphery of the contaminated site.","Arsenic; Contamination; Geochemistry; Mine wastes; Mole River; Soils; Stream sediments","arsenic; geochemistry; mine waste; sediment pollution; stream bed; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033493796

FT diesel fuel shows significant advantages in reducing regulated engine emissions over conventional diesel fuel primarily to: its zero sulfur specification, implying reduced particulate matter (PM) emissions, its relatively lower aromaticity, and its relatively high cetane rating. However, the actual effect of FT diesel formulation on the in-cylinder combustion characteristics of unmodified modern heavy-duty diesel engines is not well documented. As a result, a Navistar T444E (V8, 7.3 liter) engine, instrumented for in-cylinder pressure measurement, was installed on an engine dynamometer and subjected to steady-state emissions measurement using both conventional Federal low sulfur pump diesel and a natural gas-derived FT fuel. The in-cylinder combustion pressure traces obtained during the engine testing were analyzed to obtain several pressure-based variables including ignition delay, combustion duration, peak pressure, location of peak pressure, relative quantities of premix and diffusive burn heat release, indicated mean effective pressure, and location of one-half of the mass fraction burned. These parameters were chosen because of their well-known effects on regulated gaseous and particulate matter emissions. The emission variations between the two fuels tested were compared to the differences in the measured combustion characteristics, and an explanation for the lower NOx and PM emissions of FT was developed.

Historical data on sulfur content of produced coals shows little variability in coal quality for individual mines and individual coal-producing counties over relatively long periods of time. If coal-using power generators follow the compliance patterns established in Phase I of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, then the industry's response to the tighter Phase II emissions standards will result in large amounts of coal production shifting from higher sulfur areas to areas with lower cost low sulfur coal. One reason this shift will likely occur is that currently only 30% of U.S. coal-fired electrical generating capacity is equipped with flue-gas scrubbers. In 1995, coal mines in the higher sulfur areas of the Illinois Basin and Northern and Central Appalachia employed 78% of all coal miners (>70,000 miners).

This isotopic shift resulted from large seasonal changes in the pathways of methane production. On the basis of mass balance calculations, the δ13C value of methane from CO2 reduction (average =-71.4 ± 1.8%) was depleted in 13C compared to that produced from acetate (-44.4 ± 8.2%o). The dissolved methane at the site remained heavy (approximately-51%o) during most of the year. Tracer experiments using 14C-labeled CO2 indicated that during January 110 ± 25% of the methane was produced by CO2 reduction. Because of low-methane production rates during the winter, this C-depleted methane had only a slight effect on the isotopic composition of the methane pool. In early spring when peat temperatures and methane production rates increased, the δ13C value of the dissolved methane in shallow peat was influenced by the isotopically light methane and approached-61‰. Peat incubation experiments conducted at 15°C in May and June (when the peat reaches its maximum temperature) indicated that an average of 84 ± 9% of the methane production was from acetate and had an average δ13C value of-48.7 ± 5.6‰. Rising acetate concentrations during April-May (approaching 1 mmol L-1(mM)) followed by a rapid decrease in acetate concentrations during May-June reflected the shift toward methane production dominated by acetate fermentation. During this period, dissolved methane in shallow peat at the site returned to heavier values (approximately-5 l%o) similar to that produced in the incubation experiments. © Copyright 1999 by the American Geophysical Union.",,"acetic acid; environmental monitoring; methane; methanogenesis; peatland; United States; methanogenesis; peatland; porewater; seasonal variation; wetland; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345073159

The estimated air toxics concentrations in urban areas were typically twice as high as in rural areas. There were more air toxics with modeled ambient concentrations in excess of health benchmarks in urban census tracts than in rural census tracts. Ambient concentrations attributable to area sources alone exceeded health benchmarks in a majority of urban census tracts for several pollutants; similar results were found for mobile sources. For point sources, exceedances of benchmarks generally occurred in fewer census tracts. These results show that reductions in emissions of air toxics from all three types of sources will be necessary to reduce anthropogenic air toxics concentrations to levels below the health benchmark concentrations.","Air toxics; Clean Air Act; Comparative risk; Dispersion modeling; Emissions; Hazardous air pollutants; Mobile sources; Stationary sources; Urban areas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040914500

This paper reviews different weight factors that have been used in the climate economics literature. Based on a simple model, it is shown that although the different weight factors imply substantially different cost-damage estimates, they actually yield the same optimal emission reductions. This paradox is explained by the fact that some of the approaches require that also the abatement costs are weighted - and this offsets the effect of the diverging cost-damage estimates. The model is then used to analyse the importance weighting may have on the overall cost-benefit analysis. At present, when most of the global emissions of (fossil) CO2 originate from the industrialised countries, the global optimal emissions are considerably lower if costs are weighted. However, the more the emissions in developing countries grow, the less important becomes the introduction of weight factors in cost-benefit analysis of climate change for the global emission reductions, in the model developed here. On a regional level, the introduction of weight factors continues to play an important role, implying substantially lower emissions in the rich region and slightly higher (!) in the poor.","Climate change; Cost-benefit analysis; Developing countries; Value of a statistical life; Weight factors","Cost damage estimates; Optimal emissions; Weight factors; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Costs; Developing countries; Particulate emissions; Cost benefit analysis; climate change; cost benefit analysis; environmental economics; methodology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033118733

Both load and indicated torque (i.e. the torque due to the gas pressure acting on the pistons) will play an essential role in this context, since the driver pedal command may be appropriately interpreted by the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) in terms of an engine (or load) torque request. In fact, the accelerator pedal variation forces the vehicle to reach a final steady-state condition, corresponding to a new level of engine and load torques, thus making it possible to assume the existence of a direct link between the pedal position and the ""desired"" final engine (or load) torque. In this field, many research groups have recently developed methodologies aimed at the estimation of these parameters, since their measurement is at present not available on board the vehicle. In this paper we present a signal processing procedure to estimate the indicated torque, via Frequency Response Functions (FRF), and the load torque, by means of a nonlinear model-based observer. Two important aspect of this approach should be stressed: the possibility of estimating the instantaneous values of the indicated torque, which may prove useful for diagnostic applications, and the use of a single signal already available to the powertrain control module (the instantaneous flywheel velocity), to perform both indicated and load torque estimation. The feasibility of the proposed approach has been analyzed in an engine test cell, using a four-cylinder in-line production engine connected to an eddy current brake. Some experimental results are presented at the end of the paper, showing a good agreement between measured and estimated signals.

Xanthi) with altered chloroplast NADP-malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH) content were grown under ambient or under doubled atmospheric CO2 in order to analyse the effect of elevated CO2 on the redox state of the chloroplasts. Since large differences exist between the individual leaves of tobacco plants, gas exchange characteristics, enzyme capacities and metabolite contents were measured separately for each leaf of the plants. Large variations between leaves of different age were found in nearly every parameter analysed, and the differences between younger and older leaves were, in most cases, larger than the differences between comparable leaves at ambient or elevated CO2. For all parameters (chlorophyll fluorescence, P700 reduction, NADP-MDH activation) that are indicative for the redox situation in the electron transport chains and in the chloroplast stroma, more oxidized values were determined under elevated CO2. The increased redox state of ferredoxin, observed at ambient conditions in the NADP-MDH-under-expressing plants, disappeared under elevated CO2. It was concluded that the reduced rate of photorespiration under elevated CO2 decreases the amount of excess electrons. Interestingly, this lowered not only the activation state of NADP-MDH, but also the expression of the enzyme in the wild-type plants. The results are discussed with respect to a possible interaction between stromal reduction state and gene expression.","Elevated CO2; Malate valve; Redox state; Regulation of photosynthesis; Transgenic tobacco plants","carbon dioxide; enzyme activity; malate dehydrogenase; plant metabolism; redox reaction; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate dehydrogenase; stress tolerance; tobacco; Embryophyta; Nicotiana obtusifolia; Nicotiana tabacum; Nicotiana tabacum; Tabacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032944409

One method to succeed in this task is to increase the integration timestep. We have tested several techniques which may prove useful. The most successful was applied to the shallow water equations over a spherical surface in which the prediction model was represented in its normal modes, the high-frequency modes were balanced while the low-frequency modes were predicted. Experiments which we will describe extend this procedure to a state-of-the-art model (the NCAR/CCM3). We have taken the predicted data from each timestep of the model integration, projected it onto Hough modes, separated the modes into fast and slow components, integrated the slow components with a timestep 3 times longer than that used in the standard model run and balanced the fast modes. The modal data was then reconverted to model format and returned for the next iteration.

The industry's wastewater contains significant levels of ammonia and a class of compounds called oximes, some of which have been shown to strongly inhibit nitrification. Laboratory experiments were initiated with a synthetic wastewater containing readily biodegradable compounds plus oximes to demonstrate a single-sludge multiple oxidation-reduction (anaerobic/aerobic) biological treatment scheme that would enable carbon and ammonia oxidation, despite the presence of oximes. The specific oximes used in this study were methyl ethyl ketoxime (MEKO), acetaldehyde oxime (AAO), and aldicarb oxime (ADO), all of which have been shown to inhibit nitrification. A denitrifying sequencing batch reactor (SBR) and off-line anaerobic batch experiments were used to determine the fate of these oximes and the kinetics of oxime degradation. Results show that MEKO was biologically degraded under nitrate- limiting, anaerobic conditions only. Similar yet slower degradation trends were observed for AAO, while ADO was stable under all experimental conditions examined. A denitrifying/anaerobic/aerobic SBR was successfully operated so that complete ammonia oxidation and acceptable chemical oxygen demand removal were achieved over the course of a single reaction cycle, despite the presence of MEKO and AAO at concentrations higher than levels that have been shown to cause significant nitrification inhibition.An ammonia-intensive chemical process plant located in a nutrient-sensitive watershed region was evaluated.

The two-color technique was applied to 2-D soot luminosity images and area-averaged soot radiation signals to obtain spatially and temporally resolved flame temperature and soot KL factor. The imaging system used for this study was based on a wide-angle endoscope that was mounted in the cylinder head and allowed different views of the combustion chamber. The experiments were carried out on a single-cylinder 2.4 liter D.I. diesel engine equipped with an electronically controlled common-rail injection system. Operating conditions were 1600 rpm and 75% load. The two-color results confirm that retarding the injection timing causes lower flame temperatures and NOX emissions but increased soot formation, independent of injection strategy. Split injections have been shown to be a powerful tool to simultaneously reduce soot and NOX emissions when the injection timing is optimized. Injection termination and resumption prevents not only fuel-rich combustion zones but also causes more complete combustion during the injection dwell due to better air utilization. However, split injections can also result in worse soot emissions when either the injection timing is too retarded, leading to poor ignition, or the injection dwell is not optimized. ""Stereo"" views of two-color images imply that soot formation occurs most likely in the fuel-rich core of the spray plumes near its leading edge. Higher soot KL factors were found along the bottom and the wall of the piston bowl. Peak local flame temperatures for the single injections reached up to 2800 K and above. The calculated KL factors were between 0.1 (thin soot) and 3.0 (thick soot) for all injection cases.

In steady-state experiments with a 12 bp oligonucleotide substrate, Co2+ yielded a similar turnover rate to that with Mg2+, but Mn2+ gave a slower rate. Single turnovers of EcoRV on this substrate were analysed by stopped-flow and quench-flow methods, to determine the rates for the formation of the ternary enzyme-DNA-metal complex, the hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bonds and the dissociation of the cleaved DNA. With Co2+, all three steps had similar rates to those with Mg2+. In contrast, Mn2+ gave a faster rate for phosphodiester hydrolysis than either Mg2+ or Co2+, but a slower rate for product dissociation, thus accounting for its low turnover rate. Single turnovers on plasmids also yielded faster rates for substrate hydrolysis with Mn2+ compared to Mg2+ and Co2+. Since Mn2+ gave the most rapid rates for the hydrolytic step, despite being less electronegative than Co2+, the function of the metal ion at the active site of EcoRV cannot be just the polarisation of the scissile phosphate. Moreover, the minimal scheme for the Co2+-catalysed reaction requires two metal ions for DNA cleavage. The metal ions seem to be involved in the precise positioning of both the substrate and the water that acts as the attacking nucleophile and in activating that water molecule. A model is presented to account for how two metal ions might fulfil these functions.","DNA-protein interaction; Enzyme mechanism; Molecular dynamics; Phosphodiester hydrolysis; Restriction-modification","cobalt; DNA; magnesium ion; manganese; metal ion; restriction endonuclease; article; catalysis; controlled study; DNA cleavage; DNA protein complex; enzyme activity; enzyme specificity; enzyme substrate complex; hydrolysis; plasmid; priority journal; turnover time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033597347

The laboratory angular distributions and time-of-flight spectra of the products were recorded at mass to charge ratios m/e = 103-98 and 108-98, respectively. Forward-convolution fitting of our experimental data together with electronic structure calculations (B3LYP/6-311+G**) indicate that the reaction is without entrance barrier and governed by an initial attack of the CN radical on the carbon side to the aromatic π electron density of the benzene molecule to form a Cs symmetric C6H6CN(C6D6CN) complex. At all collision energies, the center-of-mass angular distributions are forward-backward symmetric and peak at π/2. This shape documents that the decomposing intermediate has a lifetime longer than its rotational period. The H/D atom is emitted almost perpendicular to the C6H5CN plane, giving preferentially sideways scattering. This experimental finding can be rationalized in light of the electronic structure calculations depicting a H-C-C angle of 101.2° in the exit transition state. The latter is found to be tight and located about 32.8 kJ mol-1 above the products. Our experimentally determined reaction exothermicity of 80-95 kJ mol-1 is in good agreement with the theoretically calculated one of 94.6 kJ mol-1. Neither the C6H6CN adduct nor the stable iso cyanobenzene isomer C6H5NC were found to contribute to the scattering signal. The experimental identification of cyanobenzene gives a strong background for the title reaction to be included with more confidence in reaction networks modeling the chemistry in dark, molecular clouds, outflow of dying carbon stars, hot molecular cores, as well as the atmosphere of hydrocarbon rich planets and satellites such as Saturn's moon Titan. This reaction might further present a barrierless route to the formation of heteropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons via cyanobenzene in these extraterrestrial environments as well as hydrocarbon rich flames. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001751504

Regional patterns in the carbon distribution became visible. High (110-130 t C/ha) and very high (> 130 t C/ha) total carbon (forest floor humus layer plus mineral soil) is found in the Alps, the foothills of the Alps, the montane and high montane areas of the mountains of central and southern Germany, as well as in the northwestern German lowlands.

The regional distribution of carbon in forest soils reflects climatic zonation (e.g., from west to east across the northern lowlands and altitudinal zonation in the mountains), orographic effects on the macroclimate (e.g., the central mountains), parent material and type of soil, and soil complex of the soil map units. After reviewing the possible influence of climate change on German forest soils, the northern lowlands, particularly the drier northeastern lowlands, were found to be highly susceptible to humus loss due to increase in decomposition rate resulting from global warming.",,"carbon; climate change; organic matter; soil; spatial distribution; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033497401

P0M 1S0, Canada","The genesis of komatiites, basalts, and associated Ni mineralization in the Dundonald township area, Ontario, is critical to understanding the metallogenic evolution of the Kidd-Munro assemblage, one of the most primitive volcanic assemblages in the world. The 2.5-km-thick stratigraphic succession has a basal calc-alkalic basalt-dacite-rhyolite sequence (2716.8 ± 2.1 Ma, U-Pb zircon) cut by the Dundonald peridotite-gabbro sill (2707 -5 -3 Ma, U-Pb zircon), overlain by komatiitic and basaltic flows containing magmatic Ni sulfide mineralization, which are, in turn, overlain by chemically distinctive low Ti basalt flows. The Dundonald komatiites correlate with komatiites in the footwall of the giant Kidd Creek volcanic-associated massive sulfide deposit 40 km to the west, but are slightly older than the komatiites of Munro township which are 40 km to the east. The Dundonald komatiites comprise a Munro-type, Al-undepleted komatiite suite, with liquid compositions having Al 2O 3/TiO 2 = 18 to 22 and MgO up to 30.3 wt percent (anhydrous, n = 24). Most samples in the komatiite suite have slightly depleted light REE contents, with La(N)/Sm(N) = 0.6 to 1.1 and La(N)/Yb(N) = 0.4 to 0.9 (n = 21), and negligible Ti/Ti(°) and Zr/Zr(°) anomalies. Their major and trace element geochemistry is consistent with a derivation by significant partial melting of a chemically primitive mantle with little or no influence of majorite garnet. Flows that are host to the Dundeal and Alexo Ni deposits have distinctively high Th(PM)/Nb(PM) ratios (&gt;1.7, n = 3), suggesting crustal contamination, and peperite textures that are consistent with contamination from nearby graphitic argillite. The chemically distinctive low Ti basalts have 49 to 53 percent SiO 2, 4.5 to 9.5 percent MgO, 18.8 to 21.5 percent Al 2O 3, 0.30 to 0.37 percent TiO 2, moderately depleted light REE contents, with La(N)/Sm(N) = 0.9 to 1.2 and La(N)/Yb(N) = 0.4 to 0.6, high Ni, Cr, and Ba contents (570-6,800, 390-630, 90-320 ppm, respectively; n = 6). Their high Al 2O 3 contents place them in the calc-alkalic field on a Jensen cation plot, although their trace element ratios (Zr/Y, La/Yb) are more consistent with a tholeiitic affinity. They are compositionally identical to, and they correlate with, low Ti basalts in the Kidd Creek Volcanic Complex. Their geochemistry is consistent with a derivation by partial melting of a refractory harzburgitic mantle that has undergone a previous melt extraction, possibly influenced by a large ion lithophile-enriched hydrous phase. The Empire flow is the thickest and most primitive komatiite flow and is host to the Dundeal Ni deposit (resource of ~0.4 Mt at 2.0% Ni). The Empire flow contains an elongate dunite-peridotite basal unit interpreted as the core of a flow that thermally eroded into footwall heterolithic breccias and pillowed andesites. The main Dundeal Ni horizon overlies part of the basal dunite-peridotite unit within the flow channel and extends over the cutbank wall. The Dundeal deposit and the nearby Dundonald South Ni deposit have low total sulfide contents and high Ni/S ratios (0.9 and 1.0, respectively) in comparison to most komatiite-hosted magmatic sulfide deposits. The high Ni tenor in sulfide is believed to be due to assimilation of reducing carbonaceous sediment which causes greater Ni partitioning into the magmatic sulfide phase.",,"geochemistry; komatiite; metallogenesis; mineralization; nickel; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033374114

These cycles represent driving patterns for different facility types (e.g., highway and arterial) and congestion conditions. Using a state-of-the-art comprehensive modal emissions model developed under NCHRP Project 25-11, one is able to predict the integrated emissions and fuel use values for these cycles for a wide variety of vehicle-technology categories. These facility-congestion results are then compared with steady-state emissions-fuel use measurements that were made in deriving the modal model. Furthermore, cruise modes that have mild speed perturbations are also investigated. All of these results are then compared with the speed correction equations used in the conventional emissions factor models. It is found that the mild acceleration perturbations at high speeds can lead to significantly higher emissions compared with the steady-state values. Because of this, the new high-speed freeway driving cycles (representing higher levels of service) in many cases have (modeled) emissions higher than those for the cycles that represent lower levels of service.

Many practices are in use to reduce climate impacts, for example in engineering design, agricultural risk management and climate prediction services, though their roles as adaptations to climate change are not widely appreciated. While there are good data sets on some factors and in some regions, in many cases the databases are inadequate and there are few data sets on adaptation-specific quantities such as vulnerability, resilience and adaptation effectiveness. Current international action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) pays little attention to adaptation and its information requirements. Furthermore there are trends toward reduced data gathering and to restrictions on access to data sets, especially arising from cost and commercialisation pressures.

From this study we can conclude that waste represents an enormous amount of emergy, that is, of past work of the biosphere and thus it has to be used as a resource. In emergy terms, investment in the collection of waste is negligible. The most sustainable collection in Modena is that of bulky objects, glass, paper and materials for compost.

The differences arise primarily from the dissimilarity in the origins and sizes of the Moon and Earth. The consequence is that the Moon does not have an atmosphere, a hydrosphere (the Moon is totally dry), a biosphere (the Moon is totally life-less), a magnetosphere, and any tectonic force. Pristine rocks on the exposed surface of the Moon are principally anorthositic and basaltic, but those on the Earth are granitic (discounting suboceanic rocks). Sediments on these two bodies probably represent two end-members on rocky planetary bodies. Sediments on other rocky planetary bodies (atmosphere-free Mercury and asteroids, Venus with a thick atmosphere but possibly no water on its surface, and Mars with a currently dry surface sculptured by running water in the past) are intermediate in character. New evidence suggests that characteristics of Martian sediments may be in-between those of the Moon and Earth. For example, impacts generate most Martian sediments as on the Moon, and, Martian sediments are wind-blown to form dunes as on Earth. A comparative understanding of sediments of the Moon and Earth helps us anticipate and interpret the sedimentary record of other planetary bodies. Impact processes, large and small, have produced the sediments of the Moon. Unlike Earth, the surface of the Moon is continuously bombarded by micrometeorites and solar wind. Processes of chemical and mechanical weathering aided by biological activity produce sediments on Earth, fixing a significant amount of carbon in the solid state. Whereas solar wind produces minor chemical changes in lunar sediments, chemical weathering significantly alters and affects the character of Earth sediments. Primarily ballistic and electrostatic forces transport lunar sediments but Earth sediments are transported by air, water, and ice. Whereas Earth sediments accumulate mostly in basins created slowly by tectonic forces, lunar sediments are deposited in craters (excavated instantaneously by impacts) or even on high grounds. Rubble, sand, mud, and carbonate material on Earth are lithified through burial, expulsion of water, and precipitation of cement from E2O-solutions. In contrast, lunar sediments are lithified through presumably low-energy shock waves that sinter and bind clastic grains into regolith breccias. Surface processes and morphological features on the Moon are dominated by impact cratering and ejecta deposition, while those on Earth are sculptured by water, ice, and air. However, comparisons in two areas assist in planning planetary exploration. (1) Dust, i.e., small particles elevated above the solid surface of a planetary body, is ubiquitous on the Moon and Earth. The composition of dust is related to but is different from the source rocks, especially where dust is transported over long distances as on Earth. Dust obscures observation of a planetary body and interferes with remote sensing; dust may also affect climate on planetary bodies with an atmosphere. (2) Because Earth's lithosphere has been recycled many times, sediments shed from rocks and regions that do not exist any more are the principal guides to the ancient Earth and its crustal evolution. Because the lunar surface is completely covered by regolith, and no bedrock has been directly observed or sampled, sediment is the principal guide to the lunar crust, past and present.

To analyze this phenomenon, the Poisson equation was solved numerically for a spherical vacuum diode with a field emission cathode. The dependence of the electric field on the geometric field has been compared with the known approximate dependencies. Strong screening of the electric field at the cathode by the space charge of emitted electrons at fields &gt;5×107 V/cm is noted. Based on the obtained dependencies of the actual field on the geometric one and using the SuperSAM code, the field emission occurring in a Muller projector has been simulated. It has been shown that the `ring effect' appearing in field emission patterns can well be explained by field emission from the peripheral regions of the field emitter.

CASTNet evolved from the National Dry Deposition Network (NDDN). CASTNet currently consists of 45 sites in the eastern United States and 28 sites in the West. Each site measures sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitric acid (HNO3), particle sulfate (SO4−), particle nitrate (NO3−), and ozone. Nineteen sites collect precipitation samples. NDDN/CASTNet uses a uniform set of site-selection criteria which provides the data user with consistent measures to compare each site. These criteria also ensure that, to the extent possible, CASTNet sites are located away from local emission sources. This paper presents an analysis of SO2 and SO4− concentration data collected from 1987 through 1996 at rural NDDN/CASTNet sites. Annual and seasonal variability is examined. Gradients of SO2 and SO4− are discussed. The variability of the atmospheric mix of SO2 and SO4− is explored spatially and seasonally. Data from CASTNet are also compared to SO2 and SO4− data from concurrent monitoring studies in rural areas. The Midwest and the Northeast have the highest annual averages of SO2, greater than 10 μg/m3. SO2 concentrations vary by a factor of 6 across the six eastern subregions. The annual SO2 concentrations for western sites average less than 1 μg/m3. A gradient in SO2 concentrations in the Ohio River Valley was observed, decreasing in northeasterly, easterly, and southeasterly directions. Also, a decreasing concentration gradient was observed for SO4− from the Midwest to the East and Southeast, although the gradient was not as pronounced as for SO2. Both SO2 and SO4− exhibited strong seasonal cycles. © 1999 Air and Waste Management Association.",,"nitrate; nitric acid; ozone; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; air monitoring; air quality; ambient air; article; controlled study; environmental impact assessment; priority journal; rural area; seasonal variation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033230949

Glucose as the preferred carbon source antagonizes this effect. Induction is dependent on the Zn2Cys6 family members Oaf1p and Pip2p, which bind to this element as a heterodimer. We show here by ectopically expressing both components and LexA fusion derivatives that this transcription factor complex is only active in the presence of oleate. In contrast to Pip2p, Oaf1p is responsive to oleate activation in the absence of the other component of the heterodimer. Therefore, it is the exclusive receptor of the oleate signal. Pip2p is active also under noninducing conditions but is effectively inhibited when complexed with Oaf1p in the absence of inducer. It contributes to the transactivation properties of the Oaf1p-Pip2p heterodimer and is required for efficient binding of Oaf1p to OREs in vivo. Repression of ORE-dependent transcription by glucose occurs via both Oaf1p and Pip2p. By dissecting functional domains of both proteins, we identified a region required for regulated activity of the C-terminal activation domain.

Upon phosphorylation by TOR, TAP42 binds and possibly inhibits type 2A and type- 2A-related phosphatases; however, the mechanism by which TOR controls nuclear events such as global repression of starvation-specific transcription is unknown. Here we show that TOR prevents transcription of genes expressed upon nitrogen limitation by promoting the association of the GATA transcription factor GLN3 with the cytoplasmic protein URE2. The binding of GLN3 to URE2 requires TOR-dependent phosphorylation of GLN3. Phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of GLN3 are also dependent on the TOR effector TAP42, and are antagonized by the type-2A-related phosphatase SIT4.

The only common sources of carbon on the Earth that yield similar δ13C values, other then some diagenetically altered marine carbonates, are C4 plants. A δ13C value of -15‰, on the other hand, is consistent with a kerogen-like component, the most ubiquitous form of organic matter found in carbonaceous chondrites such as the Murchison meteorite.

The model is compared against experimental bomb data with good agreement for spray tip penetration. When water is injected in the same stream as the fuel, the spray tip penetration increases by approximately 40% due mostly to the high latent heat of the water. Since changing injection profiles (fuel-water-fuel percentages) significantly effect the liquid penetration, changing fuel/water injection profiles may also allow optimal placement of fuel in the cylinder for better overall combustion and reduced emissions. Two methods of water injection in engine calculations axe also considered: fumigation, in which a liquid water spray is introduced into the intake manifold, and direct water (DW) injection in which water is injected in the same spray as the fuel. Good agreement with experimental NOx reduction and ignition delay are found in simulations of fumigation where liquid water is injected into the intake manifold in a Cummins N-14 engine. Of the two water induction methods considered, the DW injection technique is the most effective at reducing NOx, requiring halt the amount of liquid water for the same reduction in NOx. The fumigation method required approximately 80% water/fuel ratio to achieve a 50% reduction in engine out NOx, while the DW injection method required only 40% water/fuel ratio to achieve the same 50% reduction. The primary mechanism for NOx reduction is lowering of local temperatures due to both the vaporization of the liquid water and the local increase in the specific heat (Cp) of the working fluid.",,"Combustion; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer simulation; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Water injection; Direct injection diesel engines; Software package KIVA-II; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0343391213

These conditions will also determine the redox state of the glass and residual sulfate or sulfide concentrations in the glass. Organic contaminants will form char during heating of the batch. This char partly reacts with CO2 coming from the decomposition of the soda, limestone or dolomite forming carbon monoxide. Stable types of char or cokes or cullet-rich batches with only small amounts of carbonates will result in some carbon residues after the CO2 evolution. This carbon partly reduces sulfates and ferric iron in the fresh melts. This results in sulfide and ferrous iron formation in these glass melts. At increasing temperatures in the melt, the sulfides and sulfates react together forming sulfur-containing gases between 1000 to 1250 °C. The sulfate retention decreases, finally the glass even may contain sulfur only in the sulfide form under very reduced conditions. In batches without reducing agents, sulfates in the melt start to decompose at temperatures exceeding 1400 °C. Small amounts of carbon and water vapor reduce the fining onset temperature. Water vapor from the furnace atmosphere predominantly infiltrates the batch blanket during melting and foaming. The water will enhance the bubble and seed growth during fining.

To develop an instrument to measure corneal sensitivity. Mechanical stimulation was performed with increasing air flow. Chemical stimulation consisted of local pH decreases induced by a mixture of air and CO2 at different concentrations. METHODS. Air and 98.5% CO2 were mixed with an electronic, proportional-direction control valve to obtain gas mixtures from 0% to 80% CO2. The regulated outflow of gas was carried to a probe mounted on a slit lamp holder, where it was warmed and its CO2 concentration monitored. An electronic valve directed gas pulses of controlled duration to the cornea. Corneal stimulation was performed in 17 young human subjects. The intensity of the experienced sensation was recorded in a continuous visual analog scale (VAS). To obtain threshold values and intensity-response curves, 3-second pulses were applied. For mechanical stimulation, air pulses of increasing flow were used. For chemical stimulation, gas mixtures of increasing CO2 concentration at subthreshold flow and CO2 in stepped increases of 5% was applied. RESULTS. Mechanical and chemical stimulation of the cornea evoked a brief sensation of irritation. Mechanical threshold (flow values) varied among subjects but were reproducible within each subject and were higher with warmed air. The magnitude of the sensation increased proportionally to the flow of air. The mean chemical stimulation threshold (CO2 concentration) was 25% ± 3%. Increases in CO2 concentration from 10% to 80% augmented proportionally the intensity of the evoked sensation. CONCLUSIONS. The gas esthesiometer, which combines variable air flow and CO2 concentrations permits application to the cornea of mechanical stimuli of controlled force and pH reductions of increasing magnitude. This instrument may be useful in a separate exploration of mechanical and chemical sensitivity of the cornea in human subjects.",,"carbon dioxide; adult; airflow; article; carbon dioxide measurement; clinical article; concentration response; cornea sensibility; female; flowmeter; human; male; mechanical stimulation; nociception; pH; priority journal; reproducibility; stimulation; stimulus response; valve; Adult; Air; Body Temperature; Carbon Dioxide; Cornea; Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological; Female; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Male; Nerve Fibers; Ophthalmic Nerve; Physical Stimulation; Sensation; Stimulation, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032894769

We suggest that the observed weakness of X-ray reflection from the disk is due to bulk motion of the emitting hot plasma away from the reflector. A mildly relativistic motion causes aberration, reducing X-ray emission toward the disk. This in turn reduces the reprocessed radiation from the disk and leads to a hard spectrum of the X-ray source. The resulting spectral index is Γ ≈ 1.9/√B, where B = γ(1 + β) is the aberration factor for a bulk velocity β = v/c. The observed Γ ≈ 1.6 and the amount of reflection (R ≈ 0.3) in Cyg X-1 in the hard state can both be explained assuming a bulk velocity β ≈ 0.3. We discuss one possible scenario: the compact magnetic flares are dominated by e± pairs, which are ejected away from the reflector by the pressure of the reflected radiation. We also discuss physical constraints on the disk-corona model and argue that the magnetic flares are related to magnetorotational instabilities in the accretion disk.","Accretion, accretion disks; Black hole physics; Gamma rays: theory; Radiation mechanisms: thermal; Stars: individual (Cygnus X-1); X-rays: general",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033540220

Simple conversion to RH + CO2 occurs in most cases, except that H2O appears to be a required reactant for the anions. Real-time FTIR spectroscopy was used to determine the rate of formation of CO2 in flow reactors constructed of 316 stainless steel (SS) and of titanium. With a few exceptions, the rate of decarboxylation is similar within the 95% confidence interval in 316 SS and Ti and the difference is smaller than that caused by R. Therefore, while wall effects/catalysis may exist in some cases, it plays a lesser role in the relative rates than the substituent R. The acid form of the keto derivatives decarboxylates more rapidly than the anionic form, whereas the reverse is true for the nonketo derivatives. In keeping with the greater role of H2O as a reactant, the entropy of activation for the anions is smaller or more negative than for the acids. A Taft plot of the decarboxylation rates suggests that the mechanistic details can be interpreted in terms of the various roles of R. Where R = HOC(O)CH2- and NH2C(O)CH2-, decarboxylation occurs faster than expected, probably because a cyclic transition state can exist. The rate is slower than expected for R = CF3-, perhaps because of stabilization of the acid by hyperconjugation. The mechanism of decarboxylation of acids of the remaining R groups is similar and the steric effect of R is somewhat more influential than its electron withdrawing power.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000046327

Differences between traditional, infection-oriented and present, ecology-oriented epidemiology show major difficulties of identifying causality of non-specific diseases that are attributed to environmental factors. While epidemiology remains primarily a set of techniques tightly bound to other biomedical sciences and operates in a widely open area of population health, variables such as complex interactions and numerous confounding or ethical constraints frequently render causal interpretation of the observed increases in disease rates virtually impossible. In the specific case of air pollution by solid particles, large differences exist between exposures determined by stationary sampling sites and personal monitoring, between the outdoor and indoor exposures (people spend more time indoors than outdoors) and between the total inhaled dust and respirable portions retained in the lung. Biological monitoring can be of substantial help for more accurate exposure assessment. Similarly, principles developed for establishing causality in community studies show that general consensus exists in the scientific community concerning factors required for the conversion of the observed associations into casual relationships. However, evidence from published reports suggests that community studies comply only with a fraction of required conditions for attributing causality to a single factor i.e. inhaled particles. No plausible mechanisms exist that would explain the role of daily fluctuations in ambient particles mortality or morbidity rates across communities that vary in pollutant sources, climate and geography. More information is needed before inhaled particles can be ultimately declared as the factor responsible for the observed effects. Unless a better explanation of the mechanisms of particle effects is provided and major uncertainties in assessing actual exposures are removed, the divergence of opinion in the scientific community will remain unresolved.","Air pollution; Exposure assessment; Solid particles","air pollution; airborne particle; article; biological monitoring; climate; dust; environmental exposure; environmental factor; epidemiology; geography; human; inhalation; morbidity; personal monitoring; technique",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032961454

It can include benign and premalignant neoplasms [1, 2]. While photoaging or extrinsic aging is environmentally mediated and is characterized by fine and deep facial skin wrinkling; it can be characterized by thickened, coarse, yellow, sallow skin, that is studded with telangiectasia, macules of hyper-and hypopigmentation, benign, premalignant and malignant neoplastic lesions [1, 3-6]. There are many ways to rejuvenate aged skin, which include topical treatments with vitamin A acid [7, 8], alpha and beta hydroxy acids [9, 11 ] and various types of skin resurfacing either by chemical peelings of glycolic, trichloracetric or phenolic acids for superficial, medium to deep depth resurfacing respectively [12, 13], or by performing a mechanical dermabrasion [14, 17]. This presentation will highlight rejuvenating the photodamaged and aged skin of the face by the currently most popular modality of resurfacing, which is using a high energy carbon dioxide laser that is either pulsed or flashscanned [18-23]. There are presently two systems being utilized for high energy CO2 laser skin resurfacing. One laser system produces a high energy, super (ultra) pulsed, collimated CO2 laser light beam, called the UltraPulse® laser which is manufactured by Coherent, Inc., Palo Alto, CA. The other laser system, manufactured by Sharplan Lasers, Inc., Allendale, NJ, known as Silk Touch™ technology, utilizes a high energy continuous wave, non-collimated CO2 laser beam that is processed by an optico-mechanical flash scanner that emits a light beam that is rapidly rotated or flashscanned over the surface of the skin, lasting less than one msec. The effects of the Silk Touch™ laser are similar to and the results are comparable to those of the UltraPulse® laser [24-26]. The word laser is the acronym for Light Amplification by the Stimulated Emission of Radiation. When an atom of either a solid, liquid or gas is excited by an external power source, it causes an electron of an atom of that element to jump its usual orbital into a sub-orbital, causing it to be in a higher energy or excited state. This energized, excited electron, as it returns to its usual orbital, emits its surplus energy in the form of a photon or light energy. As this light energy is emitted, it then collides with other nearby atoms stimulating them into an excited state. This results in the additional release of photons that continue to stimulate the additional release of photons. In an actual laser, this stimulation of energy occurs in a holding container or resonator cavity, in which the emitted photons resonate or bounce back and forth within this cavity, deflected internally by mirrors at either end of the container. At one particular end there are partially reflective mirrors. At this end, the laser light is allowed to escape out of the resonator cavity and into an angulated tube which contains additional reflective mirrors at various points along its sides. As the laser light travels through and down this articulated tube or arm, these mirrors then direct the laser light through a terminal focusing lens finally to exit through an aperture and onto a target [27]. When laser light is emitted out of the external hand piece, it can be reflected either off the surface of the target that is being irradiated, or it can be scattered within or transmitted through the surface of a target, or it can be absorbed by that target. Characteristically, laser light has the features of being coherent, monochromatic and collimated. The wavelength of a photon is characterized by a sine wave consisting of peaks and troughs. When the peaks and troughs of the sine waves are parallel, and exactly in the same phase, both in time and space, they are said to be coherent. When laser light is emitted, it is non-convergent or divergent and therefore has no focal point. This means that the sine waves of the light are parallel and continuous, or collimated. Since laser light is produced from a individual gas, liquid or solid, the wavelength of the light that it produces is particular to that individual element. Consequently, this light is characterized by only one color and not by a spectrum of colors, and therefore it is monochromatic. In the case of CO2 gas, the wavelength of the emitted laser light is invisible and found in the infrared region of the electromagnetic radiation spectrum at 10,600 nanometers [27]. Another important characteristic of CO2 laser light is its extinction length in water, which is relatively shallow when compared to the light emitted by other lasers, such as the argon, holmium, ruby or KTP lasers. Since dermal tissue is made up mostly of water, this also means that the depth of penetration of CO2 laser light through skin is very shallow, i.e., within a few millimeters from the skin surface, and it is not dependent on whether the skin is pigmented or non-pigmented. When laser light penetrates the skin, the energy that is absorbed in the tissue is converted into heat. If this heat is hot enough, e.g., 100° C, it will vaporize the tissue. However, if its not hot enough, it will conduct the heat peripherally and thermally damage the surrounding tissue. This thermal damage to the adjacent surrounding tissue also is dependent on the length of time the laser light is in contact with the skin. A very short exposure time of high energy laser light pulses will cause instantaneous vaporization of tissue with minimal peripheral thermal damage [27,28]. In the past, CO2 laser light was produced as a continuous wave (CW). Since CW laser light was in contact with the skin for a relatively longer period of time, there was peripheral conduction of heat of lower temperature than that of the vaporization threshold longer than I msec, which is longer than the thermal relaxation time of skin [29]. The thermal relaxation time is that time necessary for any tissue to recover from thermal injury before irreparable charring and protein coagulation occurs because of heat diffusion to the tissue adjacent to and surrounding the targeted tissue. This resulted in extensive burning and frequent scarring. Now that CO2 lasers have a higher energy output, and their light emission time can be instantaneous, i.e., less than one msec, there is more efficient tissue ablation with much less peripheral conduction of heat, and much less charring and ultimately much less scarring. These improvements make the recently developed high energy CO2 lasers ideal for tissue resurfacing [29]. Coherent's UltraPulse® CO2 laser now is fitted with a computerized pattern generator (CPG)™ that is attached to the distal aperture of the articulated arm of the laser [30]. The CPG creates various geometric shapes of varying sizes of the emitted laser light, enabling larger spot sizes to contact the skin with each burst of ultra short pulses. This results in an automated delivery of collimated laser light, which facilitates the precise treatment of larger areas of tissue in a shorter amount of time. Sharplan's Silk Touch™ technology utilizes a CW beam that is not collimated and therefore needs to be focused. The emitted CW laser light passes through a microprocessor located at the terminal end of the articulated arm. This computerized optical microprocessor mechanically spins or flash scans the high energy laser beam away from each contact point so quickly that the laser beam at any given spot will contact the target tissue less than one msec, thereby not exceeding the thermal relaxation threshold for skin.",,"2 hydroxyacid; carbon dioxide; glycolic acid; retinoic acid; trichloroacetic acid; carbon dioxide laser; conference paper; cutaneous parameters; environmental factor; genotype; human; postoperative complication; preoperative period; priority journal; rejuvenation; skin abrasion; skin defect; skin manifestation; skin penetration; skin pigmentation; surgical technique; telangiectasia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033282765

Data identified as of 1989 and 1996, respectively, were considered in these reviews. Additional information identified as of June 1998 has been included in this document. Information on the nature of the review processes and the availability of the source documents is presented in Appendix 1. Information on the peer review of this CICAD is presented in Appendix 2. This CICAD was approved as an international assessment at a meeting of the Final Review Board, held in Tokyo, Japan, on 30 June - 2 July 1998. Participants at the Final Review Board meeting are listed in Appendix 3. The International Chemical Safety Card (ICSC 1282) for TBTO, produced by the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS, 1996), has also been reproduced in this document. In this document, the term TBTO is used when that specific chemical is intended. In the environment, however, tributyltin compounds are expected to exist mainly as tributyltin hydroxide, tributyltin chloride, and tributyltin carbonate. In those cases or when the identity of the specific chemical is not clear, the general term tributyltin is used. TBTO is an effective biocidal preservative for wood, cotton textiles, paper, and paints and stains for residential homes. It is added as an antifouling agent in numerous formulations of marine paints. Tributyltin is present in most of these antifouling formulations as an organometallic copolymer. Tributyltin is slowly released from the painted surface as the polymer is hydrolysed in seawater, providing protection against encrustations for as long as 4-5 years. As a result of its low water solubility and lipophilic character, tributyltin adsorbs readily onto particles. Its half-life in the water column ranges from a few days to weeks. Tributyltin may persist in sediments for several years. It bioaccumulates in organisms, with the highest concentrations found in liver and kidney. Uptake from food is more important than uptake directly from water. No information is available on the toxicity of TBTO in humans following long-term exposure. Some data and case reports indicate that TBTO is a severe dermal and respiratory irritant. The data, however, are not adequate to characterize the exposure-response relationships. Some studies have quantified human exposure to tributyltin from the diet in Japan. TBTO is moderately to highly acutely toxic to laboratory mammals in short-term studies. In numerous well-conducted studies, both short term and long term, the critical effect of TBTO is immunotoxicity (depression of immune functions dependent on the thymus). The no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for immunosuppression in rats following long-term exposure is 0.025 mg/kg body weight per day. Benchmark dose analysis shows that the exposure corresponding to the lower confidence limit (95%) on dose for a 10% decrease in immunoglobulin (Ig) E titre in rats is 0.034 mg/kg body weight per day. In a carcinogenicity study in rats, there was an increased incidence of some tumours in some endocrine tissues. These tumours occur spontaneously with variable incidence in the strain of rat used in the study and are of unknown significance for a human health risk assessment. TBTO is not carcinogenic in mice. The weight of evidence shows that TBTO is not genotoxic. There is no indication that reproductive or developmental effects occur at an exposure below that identified as the NOAEL for immunotoxicity. Effects on reproduction and development occur only at exposures near those causing maternal toxicity. Data show that TBTO is a severe respiratory tract and skin irritant. Based on the NOAEL for immunotoxicity and an uncertainty factor of 100, a guidance value for oral exposure is 0.0003 mg/kg body weight per day. No adequate data are available to derive a guidance value for inhalation exposure. TBTO is extremely hazardous to some aquatic organisms. It is an endocrine disruptor in some organisms. The concentration of tributyltin in some coastal waters is above a concentration causing severe adverse effects. Adverse effects have been sufficiently severe to lead to reproductive failure and population decline in some areas. The general hazard to the terrestrial environment is likely to be low.",,"bis(tributyltin) oxide; article; chemical analysis; chemical carcinogenesis; dose response; ecotoxicology; environmental exposure; environmental impact assessment; environmental protection; genotoxicity; health hazard; human; immunotoxicity; nonhuman; toxicity testing; Gossypium hirsutum; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032751883

Objective. Our objective was to assess the diagnostic accuracy of 99m-Tc- tetrofosmin whole-body scintigraphy in outpatients. Patients and methods. Thirty-one patients with an abnormal mammograph (n = 22) or follow-up patients (n = 9), 7 of whom were known to have metastatic disease, were included. Tracer (550 MBq) was injected into the cubital vein. Whole-body planar and single photon emission computed tomography images of regions of interest were obtained. Histology, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed to confirm scintigraphic results. Correlation between scintigraphy and CT or MRI was assessed by two independent radiologists. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity rates for the diagnosis of local and distant breast cancer lesions were given. Results. Of the 22 first-visit patients, 15 had breast cancer, and 7 had no evidence of any malignant disease. Of all patients examined (n = 31), 21 had distant metastases. Breast tumors were correctly diagnosed in 14/15 patients (93%), with only 1 false-negative result. Extrahepatic metastatic lesions (n = 16) were correctly diagnosed in 14 (88%) patients, whereas the method was not suitable for the diagnosis of liver metastases. Conclusion. Tetrofosmin scintigraphy has shown very high detection rates of breast tumors and of metastatic lesions and is therefore a valuable option in breast cancer diagnosis.","Breast cancer; Tetrofosmin; Whole-body scintigraphy","tetrofosmin tc 99m; adult; aged; article; breast cancer; cancer scintiscanning; cancer staging; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; female; follow up; histology; human; liver metastasis; mammography; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; whole body scintiscanning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032893935

Three main factors have combined to create a need for more effective policies on products and the environment. First, many traditional process-oriented policies have been successful in reducing emissions from industrial production activities, while the environmental impacts of consumption are being increasingly recognized by governments and consumers alike. Second, a number of new analytical approaches (life cycle approaches) for understanding the environmental burdens of product systems have been developed and are being applied in policy decisions. Third, many existing product-oriented environmental polices are believed to have been ineffective. An EU IPP will build on policy initiatives already in train at the EU member state level, and on developments within firms to improve the environmental profile of goods and services. This paper reviews product-related policy in member states, together with an assessment of product environmental management in five industrial sectors: chemicals; pulp and paper; food; electronic goods and consumer goods. A framework for an IPP composed of five 'building blocks', clusters of policies with a common objective, is described. These building blocks include policies related to consumption waste management, green product innovation, market creation for green products, environmental information and the allocation of responsibility for product management. Some policy makers argue that we may be witnessing the beginning of a general transition away from process-oriented policies, and towards product- and consumption-oriented policies. The paper illustrates some basic problems faced by an IPP, and proposes an incremental, phased approach to policy development in the EU.",,"ecolabelling; environmental policy; European Union; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032698728

These substances have been designated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as being both ""hazardous air pollutants"" and ""extremely hazardous substances"". Thus, special engineering considerations are required to address potential environmental concerns related to the use and storage of these substances. However, despite the utilization of state-of-the-art engineering controls, the potential for accidental release scenarios still exist. This carbon filter study was designed to evaluate various issues concerning the appropriateness of utilizing this type of control technology, when applied to prevent and minimize environmental and health consequences resulting from the accidental release of arsine or phosphine into the atmosphere. Evaluations were conducted to assess the ability of carbon to remove arsine at inlet concentrations ranging from approximately 0.5 to 1000 ppm/v. Removal efficiency and adsorption capacity studies were conducted on carbon filter units designed to handle gas volumetric flow rates at approximately 50 and 1000 acfrn. To evaluate the effect that ""aging"" exerts on carbon media, a test program was conducted to assess the remaining adsorption capacity of carbon filter units which were utilized at Bell Laboratories facilities for time periods ranging up to 2 years. These 1,000 acfm rated units were challenged with arsine at a design concentration of approximately 200 ppm/v. Studies were also performed to assess the ability of carbon to remove phosphine at inlet concentrations ranging from 50 to 600 ppm/v. Removal efficiency and adsorption capacity studies were conducted on a carbon filter unit designed to handle a gas volumetric flow rate of 1000 acfm. A phosphine ignition study was additionally conducted to determine phosphine levels that would ignite when exposed to air, and to document flame characteristics and downstream phosphine concentration.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347038115

Our analysis is based on a dynamic global trade model which accounts for systematic differences in the energy efficiency of production in industrial and developing countries. Emission limits adversely affect the welfare of industrial and some developing countries, including all of the oil-exporting countries. Imports from Annex-B countries become more costly while demand for most developing country exports is reduced. Oil prices simultaneously fall, so the net impact on oil-importing developing countries is ambiguous. Energy-intensive industries have a strong economic incentive to relocate production to low-energy cost developing countries. Global trading in emission rights provides the lowest cost path to Kyoto, but it is unclear whether there are incentives for all non-Annex B countries to participate. Copyright © 1999 by the IAEE.

Juni 135, D-10623 Berlin, Germany","According to the concept of the Q-cycle, the H+/e- ratio of the electron transport chain of thylakoids can be raised from 2 to 3 by means of the rereduction of plastoquinone across the cytochrome b6f complex. In order to investigate the H+/e- ratio we compared stationary rates of electron transport and proton translocation in spinach thylakoids both in the presence of the artificial electron acceptor ferricyanide and in the presence of the natural acceptor system ferredoxin+NADP. The results may be summarised as follows: (1) a variability of the H+/e- ratio occurs with either acceptor. H+/e- ratios of 3 (or even higher in the case of the natural acceptor system, see below) are decreased towards 2 if strong light intensity and low membrane permeability are employed. Mechanistically this could be explained by proton channels connecting the plastoquinol binding site alternatively to the lumenal or stromal side of the cytochrome b6f complex, giving rise to a proton slip reaction at high transmembrane ΔpH. In this slip reaction protons are deposited on the stromal instead of the lumenal side. In addition to the pH effect there seems to be a contribution of the redox state of the plastoquinone pool to the control of proton translocation; switching over to stromal proton deposition is favoured when the reduced state of plastoquinone becomes dominant. (2) In the presence of NADP a competition of both NADP and oxygen for the electrons supplied by photosystem I takes place, inducing a general increase of the H+/e- ratios above the values obtained with ferricyanide. The implications with respect to the adjustment of a proper ATP/NADPH ratio for CO2 reduction are discussed.

The fact that the same molar ratio of the two ylide forms is produced from the two isomeric oxiranes suggests the involvement of a common ylide triplet. On the other hand, under reversible electron transfer sensitization by 1,4-dicyanonaphthalene singlet excited state, the two ylide forms are produced in significantly different ratios when cis and trans-stilbene oxides are used as donors; this indicates the intermediacy of distinct, non-equilibrating, ring-opened radical cations in the two cases. Spectrally observable carbonyl ylide transients with short lifetimes (85-550 ns) are also produced from tri- and tetraphenyl oxiranes under both energy and electron transfer sensitization.

Four rice plant cultivars, Lemont, Mars, Cypress, and Della, and an unplanted plot were studied to provide possible explanations for the differences in CH4 emissions between cultivars. Using the mesured isotope values, along with data of CH4 and CO2 concentrations and other ecosystem data, we determined differences between cultivars in the processes of oxidation and production throughout the growing season. For instance, rhizospheric CH4 oxidation increased as the season progressed in both Mars and Lemont cultivars. Late in the season, however, 71±10% of CH4 produced in the Mars plot was oxidized compared to only 39±10% in the Lemont plot. The contribution of acetate fermentation to methanogenesis at specific times during the season was calculated using measured isotopic values and assuming identical isotopic fractionation factors in methanogenic pathways for the cultivars. In these calculations a range of values for the contribution to CH4 production from acetate fermentation and CO2 reduction with H2 was estimated by considering different fractionation factors for the methanogenic CO2 reduction pathway and the possibility of a 10% contribution to CH4 production from acetate produced by homoacetogenesis. In general, a steady increase in the CH4 portion produced by acetate fermentation was noted in the Lemont cultivar, while an increase followed by a decrease near the end of the season was observed for the Mars cultivar.",,"cultivar; methane; oxidation; rice; United States; Cupressus; Della",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033302385

Active landfills emit an estimated 0.28 Tg CH4 yr-1, 60% of which are generated from twelve landfills. Although uncertainty in the estimate is greater, emissions from closed landfills are on the same order of magnitude as active landfills and wetlands; 0.25 Tg CH4 yr-1.

The bottom of the conduction bands is controlled by a nearly-free-electronn state localized inside the nanotube, suggesting interesting properties under doping. In the case of nanotubes with BC2N stoichiometry, we show that in the thermodynamic limit the system is driven towards segregation of pure C and BN sections. This demixing significantly affects the electronic properties of such materials. The same process of segregation into BC3 islands is evidenced in the case of B-doped carbon nanotubes. These spontaneous segregation processes lead to the formation of quantum dots or nanotube heterojunctions.

This study focuses mainly on how macro-sociological variables influence attitudes towards the public service system in Finland. An attempt is made to investigate whether differences between municipalities in public-policy measures, political climate and the economic situation have effects on ordinary citizens' support for the service system or whether such support is only related to the individual-level factors, such as socio-economic position and gender, that are traditionally used in studies of attitudes. A focus on attitudes towards economy measures makes it possible simultaneously to investigate the kinds of municipal-level circumstances that affect the acceptance of a retrenchment of the 'service state'. The analyses are based on individual-level data (n = 1,024) and municipal-level Finnish data. The results show that different indicators of macro-sociological factors do have an impact on people's attitudes towards public services. Individuals in municipalities where economic conditions are relatively poor, where the level of social and health expenditure is low and, on some issues, where bourgeois parties are the dominating political bloc, show a lower level of support for the welfare services.

The reductions in oil consumption accompanying decreased oil volatility provide possible improved exhaust emissions and reduced servicing and maintenance. Longer drain intervals allow reduced frequency of required vehicle service, providing a lower cost of ownership to the consumer. Given these concurrent trends, this study investigates the possible impacts of volatility in extended drain applications. Four 5W30 oils having volatilities ranging from 5.3 to 21.5 wt % evaporative loss by ASTM 5800 were tested in extended drain New York City taxi service. The drain intervals were 10,000 miles and 20,000 miles, and the test duration was 100,000 miles. The additive packages were of API SJ or SJ+ quality. Oil performance was found to be significantly impacted by volatility. A primary effect of volatility was the degree of oil consumption and resultant replenishment with fresh oil. The used oils for the high volatility formulations showed an enhancement of additive metal concentrations of 20 % to 40 % relative to the initial formulation, whereas the low volatility used oils showed a slight decrease in additive metal concentrations. With the lesser amount of oil additions, the low volatility oils showed a poor control of oxidation, deposit, and wear performance, indicative of additive depletion. However due to loss of light base oil fractions, the high volatility oils showed significant oil thickening. The results suggest that for severe service, extended drain applications oil formulations require a combination of both good volatility and sufficient additive treat to provide good engine cleanliness and wear as well as acceptable levels of oil thickening.

Cat8p-dependent expression is mediated by cis-acting elements in the respective promoters, which are named UAS/CSREs (upstream activating sequence/carbon source responsive element). To establish whether the function of Cat8p is restricted to the activation of gluconeogenesis or is also involved in the regulation of a greater variety of genes, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of two genes, IDP2 and JEN1, which exhibit a similar expression pattern to gluconeogenic genes, although IDP2 at least is not linked directly to the gluconeogenic pathway. We identified functional UAS/CSRE elements in the promoters of both genes. Expression studies revealed that JEN1 is regulated negatively by the repressors Mig1p and Mig2p, and that Cat8p is needed for full derepression of the gene under non-fermentative growth conditions. Furthermore, we showed that Mig2p is also involved in the repression of CAT8 itself. The results presented in this study support a model in which Cat8p-dependent gene activation is not restricted to gluconeogenesis, but targets a wide variety of genes which are strongly derepressed under non-fermentative growth conditions.","CAT8; IDP2; JEN1; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Transcriptional regulation","carbon; cis acting element; isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP); lactic acid; permease; transcription factor; article; controlled study; cytosol; fungus growth; gene activation; gluconeogenesis; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; repressor gene; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; transcription regulation; yeast; Base Sequence; Blotting, Northern; Carrier Proteins; Cytosol; DNA Primers; Fungal Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Gluconeogenesis; Isocitrate Dehydrogenase; Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters; Mutation; NADP; RNA, Fungal; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Symporters; Trans-Activators; Fungi; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033390344

Supply curves that relate the crop price to the national biomass production potential are crucial to the comparison. The higher delivered cost of biomass that would be acceptable as feedstock for methanol production, plus the increased conversion efficiency and lower production cost that can be obtained by use of natural gas as a co-feedstock, are major factors favouring methanol.

The overall conclusion is that substantial environmental benefits, ranging from global to site-specific, could be achieved when traditional annual food crops produced with current agriculture practices are replaced by dedicated perennial energy crops. The emission of greenhouse gases could be reduced by reduced Carbon dioxide emissions from organic soils, by reduced nitrous oxide emissions caused by the use of fertilisers and through accumulation of soil carbon in mineral soils, which also leads to increased soil fertility. Nutrient leaching could be reduced by using energy crop cultivations as buffer strips along open streams and wind erosion could be reduced by using Salix plantations as shelter belts. Cultivation Of Salix and energy grass can also be used to purify municipal Waste, such as waste water, landfill leachate, and sewage sludge. Furthermore, the content of heavy metals in the soil can be reduced through Salix cultivation. The biodiversity is estimated to be almost unchanged, or slightly increased in open farmland. These environmental benefits, which could be achieved on up to 60% of current Swedish arable land and last for 25 years or more, will increase the value of the energy crops. The economic value of these benefits is calculated in Part II of the analysis, which is presented in a second paper.The substantial environmental benefits, ranging from global to site-specific, could be achieved when traditional annual food crops produced with current agriculture practices are replaced by dedicated perennial energy crops. The emission of greenhouse gases could be reduced by reduced carbon dioxide emissions from organic soils, by reduced nitrous oxide emissions caused by using fertilizers, and through accumulation of soil carbon in mineral soils which also leads to increased soil fertility. Cultivation of Salix and energy grass can also be used to purify municipal waste, such as wastewater, landfill leachate, and sewage sludge.

We also investigated whether photoelectric absorption could be responsible for the spectral evolution of the low-energy slopes of some bright BATSE γ-ray bursts displaying extremely hard spectra below the peak energy, inconsistent with the optically-thin synchrotron shock model. We find that a very strong metal enrichment (∼ 100 times solar-system abundances) in the γ-ray burst environment and a rather peculiar spatial distribution of the CBM would be necessary in order to account for the observed hard spectra below a few 100 keV and their temporal evolution.","Atomic processes; Gamma rays: Bursts; Radiative transfer; X-rays: Bursts",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000267793

The environmental equation expresses car manufacturers aptitude and desire to create zero emission vehicles at acceptable levels of performance unlike limited range electrical powered vehicle products. The cheapest solution to the environmental equation remains the conventional internal combustion engine ($30 to $50 per kW). However, new system optimization is necessary and will take many forms from alternative fuels enriched with hydrogen to diesel direct injected engines for light duty trucks and sport utility vehicles. Diesel fuel will probably be the favorite mid-term option with direct injection engines coupled with an electric motor.

In addition to the semi-Lagrangian advection and vertical diffusion schemes already present for tracers, a chemical module, dry deposition parameterization, and anthropogenic and on-line biogenic emissions were added to the CRCM. The complete model forms a single system which integrates meteorological and chemical variables simultaneously. Transport of 25 chemical species is evaluated on a 80 × 80 horizontal grid at 42.3 km resolution and for the 24 unequally spaced levels. The chemical scheme includes 47 species and 114 reactions used in the Acid Deposition and Oxidant Model (ADOM) gas-phase mechanism. Precalculated photolysis rates, corrected for the model cloud cover through the variations of the simulated solar radiation penetration, are used in the model. This limited-area model is driven at its boundaries by objective reanalyses for the meteorological fields and by climatological concentrations for the chemical counterparts. A time step of 15 min common to all processes is currently used. A two-step validation procedure, which includes specific cases and climatological simulations, was adopted. The first test consists of a week-long simulation for the first week of August 1988 when an intense ozone episode affected most of northeastern America during the first Eulerian Model Evaluation and Field Study (EMEFS) campaign. Results show that the CRCM ability to simulate this episode is comparable to other existing models using off-line approaches. The CRCM performance was substantially improved by the addition of the biogenic emission parameterization. Climatology-specific results are presented in the companion paper by Bouchet et al.

The climatology is derived from simulations of five consecutive Julys from 1990 to 1994. Biogenic emissions are calculated each time step, while anthropogenic emissions are taken to be identical for each simulated July. Comparisons of daily ozone maximum for each individual month suggest that the model is simulating satisfactorily the month-long periods and usually correctly reproduces the high and low ozone regimes associated with the different parts of the domain and/or the various synoptic conditions, the Ohio region being the exception. The climatological number of exceedences above 80 ppbv, calculated as the monthly average for the 5 years, yields better agreement with the number of exceedences calculated from the observed climatological O3 field than those for the individual months. This behavior suggests that a large fraction of the errors present in each simulation are randomly distributed. Thus it should be possible to obtain fields that are more representative of reality, for applications such as emission reduction scenario studies, by averaging over several long simulations.

A Gaussian plume dispersion model, applied to maximum emissions measured at the MWI stacks, was used to estimate the distribution of these pollutants in the atmosphere throughout the metropolitan area. A random sample telephone survey (570 subjects) gathered data on time-activity patterns, according to demographic characteristics of the population. Life- long exposure was assessed as a time-weighted average of ambient air concentrations. Inhalation alone was considered because, in the Grenoble urban setting, other routes of exposure are not likely. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to describe probability distributions of exposures and risks. The median of the life-long personal exposures distribution to MWI benzene was 3.2 · 10-5 μg/m3 (20th and 80th percentiles = 1.5·10-5 and 6.5·10-5 μg/m3), yielding a 2.6·10-10 carcinogenic risk (1.2·10-10-5.4·10-10). For nickel, the corresponding life-time exposure and cancer risk were 1.8·10-4 μg/m3 (0.9·10-4 - 3.6·10-4 μg/m3) and 8.6·10-8 (4.3·10-8-17.3·10-8); for cadmium they were respectively 8.3·10-6 μg/m3 (4.0·10-6 - 17.6·10-6) and 1.5·10-8 (7.2·10-9 - 3.1·10-8). Inhalation exposure to cadmium emitted by the MWI represented less than 1% of the WHO Air Quality Guideline (5 ng/m3), while there was a margin of exposure of more than 109 between the NOAEL (150 ppm) and exposure estimates to trichloroethane. Neither dioxins nor mercury, a volatile metal, were measured. This could lessen the attributable life-long risks estimated. The minute (VOCs and cadmium) to moderate (nickel) exposure and risk estimates are in accord with other studies on modern MWIs meeting recent emission regulations, however.","Monte-Carlo simulation; Municipal waste incineration; Risk assessment; Time activity patterns","Dioxins; Time-activity patterns; Air pollution; Air quality; Carcinogens; Computer simulation; Gas emissions; Health hazards; Health risks; Mathematical models; Monte Carlo methods; Probability distributions; Random processes; Refuse incineration; Risk assessment; 1,1,1 trichloroethane; benzene; cadmium; dioxin; heavy metal; mercury; nickel; volatile organic compound; health risk; medical geography; municipal solid waste; risk assessment; waste facility; article; cancer risk; health hazard; incineration; plume; pollutant; risk assessment; simulation; system analysis; waste; Air Pollutants; Environmental Health; France; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Incineration; Metals, Heavy; Monte Carlo Method; Risk Assessment; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033453185

After removing strong point and moderately extended sources (e.g., the core of the Virgo cluster), there remained a statistically significant component of ""diffuse"" X-rays in the plane of the supercluster. Fitting this diffuse component with a simple ""pillbox"" model of the local supercluster implies a volume X-ray emissivity of εX = 3.0 ± 0.3 × 1039(RSC/20 Mpc)-1 ergs s-1 Mpc-3, where RSC is the radius of the supercluster and the error is photon counting noise only. If one considers fluctuations in the X-ray background as an additional component of noise, then the detection is reduced considerably to 2.3 σ. However, the significance level implied by this value (i.e., 99%) is consistent with the distribution of fits to the model obtained by rotating the original data. If the source of the X-ray emission is bremsstrahlung from a uniformly distributed plasma with temperature Te, then the implied electron number density is Ne = 2.5 × 10-6(RSC/20 Mpc)-1/2(kTe/10 keV)-1/4 cm-3. This value is about an order of magnitude larger than the average baryon number density implied by nucleosynthesis and is consistent with a collapse factor of 10. A search for similar structure in the COBE 53 GHz microwave background map yielded a marginal detection with an amplitude of ~∼-17 ± 5 μK (statistical error only), which is consistent with the Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect expected from 10 keV gas. This latter value is comparable to the amplitude of intrinsic large-scale fluctuations in the microwave background and should be considered to be a 1 σ result at best.","Diffuse radiation; Large-scale structure of universe; X-rays: galaxies; X-rays: general",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033589621

The various temperature increases were then combined with each of several precipitation changes, ranging from +10% to -20%, to produce the final set of scenarios. More detailed analysis involving six of the scenarios and a subset of 28 representative, ecologically important species suggested that (1) large decreases in the Florida range of many temperate species would result if 1 °C warming occurs predominantly in winter or with a 20% decrease in annual precipitation, or (2) if 2 °C warming occurs, with or without decrease in annual precipitation, and regardless of whether there is a uniform monthly warming pattern or one that is higher in winter than in summer.

In order to assess whether taking community structure into account can also provide more reliable estimates of downward POC flux in other oceanic provinces, epipelagic observations (mainly size-fractionated primary production, biomass, community structure data and heterotrophic bacterial production) and POC flux data from deep-moored sediment traps were collated from the six different ocean regions for which suitable data are available. At each site the epipelagic data were used in conjunction with two standard versions of the foodweb/vertical-flux model (one permits direct sinking of large ungrazed algae out of surface waters, the other does not) and published empirical depth/POC-flux algorithms to predict the POC flux to the deep ocean. Predictions were also made using published primary-production/POC-flux algorithms, and the two sets of predictions were compared to the deep-ocean POC flux measurements. While the version of the foodweb/vertical-flux model permitting the direct sinking of ungrazed algae provided the most reliable predictor of POC flux for five of the six sites, no conventional algorithm provided comparable predictions for more than two sites. The reliability of these predictions is discussed in the context of recent modelling studies that explore the extent to which flow fields in the water column overlying deep-moored sediment traps confound attempts to relate particle flux measurements to observations of surface-water processes. The present study suggests that the sinking of ungrazed large cells, probably diatoms, may be the key determinant of the magnitude of the downward POC flux in a variety of ocean regions. Planned ocean-observing programmes may provide sufficient epipelagic data to allow this approach to be used to improve the accuracy of basin-scale estimates of downward POC flux and hence reduce the uncertainty of the magnitude of this flux within the oceanic carbon budget.",,"carbon budget; community structure; deep sea; food web; organic carbon; particulate flux; plankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032913263

In particular, the interactions among energy flux, plant dynamics, and soil carbon and nutrient cycling are poorly known. In this study, we examined biotic controls over soil temperature and evapotranspiration (ET) in a climate change experiment in two peatlands, a bog and a fen. Bogs are isolated from groundwater inputs (i.e., ombrogenous) and are acidic, whereas fens receive groundwater inputs (i.e., minerogenous) and are more alkaline. They also have many associated differences in soil chemistry, nutrient availability, and plant communities. We removed 27 intact peat monoliths each from a bog and a fen in northern Minnesota to construct a large mesocosm facility that allows for direct manipulation of climatic variables in a replicated experimental design. The treatment design was a fully crossed factorial with three infrared-loading treatments, three water table treatments, and two ecosystem types (bogs and fens), with three replicates of all treatment combinations. Heating was achieved with overhead infrared lamps, so soil temperature was a dependent variable. Increased infrared loading caused mean monthly soil temperature to increase by 1.6°-4.1°C at 15 cm depth during the growing season (May-October). The soil temperature response was strongly seasonal, with much greater effects during the growing season than during the winter. Within the growing season, heating caused greater increases in soil temperature in May-June in the bog plots and in May-June and September-October in the fen plots. Occasionally during the winter, increased infrared loading cooled the soil by up to 5.1°C, probably due to melting of the insulating snow cover. Fen plots were on average 0.8°-1.0°C warmer than bog plots during the growing season, although bog plots had a steeper soil temperature gradient with depth. Water level had no effect on soil temperature. Annual ET was 12-23% greater in the bog plots than in the fen plots, at least partially explaining the cooler soil temperatures in the bog plots due to latent heat of evaporation. Additionally, warmer, wetter conditions increased ET. In the fen plots, ET was more sensitive to water table depth than in the bog plots. Differences in the composition and seasonality of the plant canopies accounted for much of the observed differences in ET between bog and fen mesocosms, and hence soil temperature. We present a conceptual model of how above- and belowground ecosystem processes control energy fluxes in northern peatlands and suggest that such controls represent a general phenomenon that should be incorporated into climate change models that include biotic feedbacks.","Biogeophysical feedbacks; Bog; Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Fen; Peatlands; Soil temperature; Soil warming; Water table; Wetlands","climate change; energy flux; evapotranspiration; peatland; soil temperature; Minnesota; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032700346

This waterflood model highlighted areas in the field with current high oil saturations as priority targets for CO2 flooding and generated a forecast of reserves from continued waterflooding. Predictions for the CO2 flood used an in-house four-component simulator (stock tank oil, solution gas, water, CO2).

The internal homogeneity of the time series was tested and then they were completed for the calculation period using suitable statistical methods. Three homogeneous regions were defined in the studied zone through correlation matrices. The climatic decadal cycles were determined with the help of the integrated differences curves. The anthropogenic impact on the runoffs was estimated through the homogeneity curves. The length of the cycles were ranged from 30 to 40 years. The structure of the decadal cycles permitted the estimation of the duration of deficiency, abundance, and normality runoff periods in each region. The cyclical structure of the regional runoffs can be explained by precipitation. The anthropogenic impact was important in the middle of the general streamflow, where the two main streamflows connect through Chapala Lake. It was demonstrated that, in spite of the anthropogenic impact on part of the hydrologic system, it continues to be naturally regulated by climatic factors and still constitutes a hydrological unit. The estimation of the lengths of different phases of the decadal cycle can be used for the management of the regional water resources.","Hydrologic unit; Management of water resources; Runoff cycles","anthropogenic effect; climate cycle; rainfall-runoff modeling; time series analysis; water resource; Mexico",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032899984

This article describes progress in plasma reforming experiments and calculations of high temperature conversion of methane using heterogeneous processes. The thermal plasma is a highly energetic state of matter that is characterized by extremely high temperatures (several thousand degrees Celsius), and a high degree of dissociation and a substantial degree of ionization. The high temperatures accelerate the reactions involved in the reforming process. Hydrogen-rich gas (40% H2, 17% CO2 and 33% N2, for partial oxidation/water shifting) can be efficiently made in compact plasma reformers. Experiments have been carried out in a small device (2-3 kW) and without the use of efficient heat regeneration. For partial oxidation/water shifting, it was determined that the specific energy consumption in the plasma reforming processes is 16 MJ/kg H2 with high conversion efficiencies. Larger plasmatrons, better reactor thermal insulation, efficient heat regeneration and improved plasma catalysis could also play a major role in specific energy consumption reduction and increasing the methane conversion. A system has been demonstrated for hydrogen production with low CO content (approximately 1.5%) with power densities of approximately 30 kW (H2 HHV)/l of reactor, or approximately 10 m3/h H2 per liter of reactor.

Buoy data indicate that the wave climate is very similar along much of the California coast. We show that elements of the wave climate can be accurately reconstructed using near-coastal inland broadband seismometer data. Such reconstructions are possible because swell approaching the coast generates pressure fluctuations that are locally transformed into seismic waves at the seafloor that propagate inland and are detectable by land-based seismometers. Buoy and seismometer data show that most of the microseism energy recorded inland near the coast is generated from wave events at nearby coastal locations. A site-specific, empirically derived seismic-to-wave transfer function is demonstrated to be applicable to seismic data from the same location for any year. These results suggest that ocean wave heights estimated from near-coastal broadband seismometer data are sufficiently reliable for monitoring the coastal wave height when buoy data are unavailable, provided that adequate simultaneous nearby buoy measurements are available to calibrate the seismometer data. The methodology presented here provides an important tool that allows the investigation of potential wave climate changes from reconstructions using archived seismic data collected since the 1930s.

These estimates were determined by subtracting the total fine particle mass associated with inorganic compounds from the total fine mass determined gravimetrically. This approach, which yields an upper limit estimate of the total amount of carbon-related mass was necessary since particulate carbon was not measured in the Canadian National Air Pollution Surveillance (NAPS) network. In this paper, total carbon estimates are evaluated against organic and elemental carbon measurements at locations in the Greater Vancouver area and Toronto. In addition, particle nitrate measurements at seven Canadian locations are used to determine the importance of nitrate relative to total mass and to examine the sampling artifacts due to the loss of particle nitrate from Teflon filters used in the NAPS di-chotomous samplers. Measurements of organic and elemental carbon indicated that the total carbon estimation approach provides representative estimates of the average contribution by carbonaceous material to the total fine and coarse mass. The average total carbon among all Vancouver area measurements (N = 225) was 4.28 μg m-3, while the estimated value was 4.34 μg m-3. There was a larger discrepancy between Toronto total carbon measurements (12.1 μg m-3) and estimates (8.8 μg m-3), which is attributed in part to sampling of particles above 10 mm in diameter. However, the R2 relating the measurements and estimates was about 0.71 for both areas. Linear regression slopes of 0.98 for Vancouver and 0.78 for Toronto (nonsignificant intercepts) indicate little bias in the Vancouver estimates, but a tendency for underestimation as the observed total carbon concentration increased in Toronto. Annually, nitrate was responsible for 17% and 12% of the fine mass in the Vancouver area and Ontario, respectively. In contrast, at two rural locations in southern Quebec and Nova Scotia, only 6% of fine mass was associated with nitrate. Due to filter losses, nitrate concentrations determined through the NAPS dichot sampling were much lower than actual concentrations (0.44 μg m-3 vs. 2.63 μg m-3). As a result of these losses (attributed mostly to loss during laboratory storage), previous total carbon estimates for the Canadian NAPS sites were likely to have been overestimated on average by about 10%. © 1999 Air and Waste Management Association.",,"Air filters; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric composition; Carbon; Nitrates; Particles (particulate matter); Regression analysis; Atmospheric particulate matter; Total carbon concentration; Air pollution; carbonic acid; nitrate; politef; air monitoring; air sampling; article; Canada; city; filter; gravimetry; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; siting; total organic carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033081832

Until recently, the measurements were manual/filter-based with 24-hr sample collection varying in frequency from daily to every sixth day, using GrasebyAnderson dichotomous samplers. In the past few years, these monitoring activities have been expanded to include hourly measurements using tapered element oscillating microbalances (TEOMs). This continuous monitoring program started operation focusing on PM10 but now emphasizes PM2.5 through the addition of more TEOMs and switching of the inlets of some of the existing units. The data from all of these measurement activities show that there are broad geographical differences and also local- to regional-scale spatial differences in mass and composition of PM2.5. Due to variations in sources, significantly different PM2.5 concentrations are not uncommon within the same city. Comparison of nearby urban and rural sites indicates that 30 and 40% of the PM2.5 is from local urban sources in Montreal and Toronto, respectively. Hourly PM2.5 measurements in Toronto suggest that vehicular emissions are an important contributor to urban PM2.5. There has been a decreasing trend in urban PM2.5 with annual average concentrations between the 1987–1990 and 1993–1995 periods decreasing by 11 to 39%, depending upon the site. The largest declines were in Montreal and Halifax, and the smallest decline was in Toronto. Comparison of 24-hr TEOM and manual dichotomous sampler PM2.5 measurements from a site in Toronto indicates that the TEOM results in lower concentrations.

This model is based on research that identifies subnivial processes as a major control on the leaching loss of N from soil during snowmelt.

Eng., Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544, United States","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are important environmental contaminants because of their suspected carcinogenicity. PAH contamination is often found in the form of nonaqueous phase liquids (NAPLs), such as coal tar. These materials are very complex mixtures with the constituent compounds exhibiting a wide range of chemical, physical, and toxicological properties. This makes it difficult to characterize a PAH NAPL and predict its behavior. Lumped metrics, such as total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), are often used to specify remediation goals at PAH NAPL sites, but these metrics do not capture the variation in NAPL composition overtime and as such do not consider changes in risk over time. This paper presents an alternative method for characterizing PAH NAPLs that is based on the fraction approach developed by the Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon Criteria Working Group (TPHCWG). The fraction approach characterizes the PAH NAPL as a collection of U.S. EPA Priority Pollutants plus hydrocarbon fractions. This approach allows prediction of the NAPL compositional dynamics while retaining some of the simplified analysis of a lumped parameter approach. The fractions and priority pollutants are modeled as NAPL components for performing risks assessments and assessing the potential of remediation strategies. This makes the fraction approach amenable for use in a Risk-Based Corrective Action (RBCA) framework. In this work, the TPHCWG fraction approach was modified for description of NAPL Constituents that are solids in their pure states. This was accomplished by assigning an equivalent solid-liquid reference fugacity ratio for each fraction. Thirty-year simulations with two model coal tars are presented, comparing the risk calculations for the fraction approach to those accounting for the complete NAPL composition. These simulations show that the model using the fraction approach predicts similar NAPL compositional dynamics and PAH carcinogenic risk as the model describing all the compounds. Use of the fraction approach at PAH NAPL sites will allow a more accurate accounting of the risk variation than the TPH approach. Additionally, it will emphasize development and use of remediation methods that address risk reduction, not just the reduction in total contaminant mass.The Total Petroleum Hydrocarbon Criteria Working Group fraction approach was modified to characterize nonaqueous phase liquid (NAPL) constituents that are solids in their pure states.

Forest volume inventory data for growth and mortality were converted to units of aboveground biomass at the county level for hardwood and softwood forest types. Aboveground production of woody biomass (APWB) for hardwood forests ranged from 0.6 to 28 Mg·ha-1·yr-1 and averaged 5.2 Mg·ha-1·yr-1. For softwood forests, APWB ranged from 0.2 to 31 Mg·ha-1·yr-1 and averaged 4.9 Mg·ha-1·yr-1. Aboveground production of woody biomass was generally highest in southeastern and southern counties, mostly along an arc from southern Virginia to Louisiana and eastern Texas. Although this pattern is generally the result we would expect from the general climatic gradients of the region, it was confounded by the effects of different forest management intensities. No clear spatial pattern of mortality of woody biomass (MWB) existed, except for a distinct area of high mortality in South Carolina due to Hurricane Hugo in 1989. For hardwood forests, MWB ranged from 0 to 15 Mg·ha-1·yr-1 and averaged 1.1 Mg·ha-1·yr-1. The average MWB for softwood forests was 0.6 Mg·ha-1·yr-1 with a range of 0-10 Mg·ha-1·yr-1. The rate of MWB on an aboveground biomass basis averaged &lt; 1%/yr for both hardwood and softwood forests. A first-order carbon budget (the sum of the net change in carbon storage in all live trees, dead wood, and long-lived wood products) shows that eastern U.S. forests accumulated ~174 Tg C/yr during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Although the root and soil pools are not included in this budget, it is likely that the forests are accumulating carbon in these components too, because the eastern forests are for the most part in various stages of regrowth and recovery from past human land uses and active forest management.","Aboveground net primary production; Biomass; Biomass expansion factors; Carbon budgets; Forest inventories; Hardwood forests; Mortality; Spruce-fir forests; United States","environmental management; forest; population dynamics; United States; aboveground production; forest; mortality; spatial analysis; (East); United States; Abies; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033178486

These adaptation measures, to reduce loss of life, human suffering and economic losses come under the heading 'disaster loss mitigation'. Since 1990 the United Nations' International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction has provided for international cooperation and information dissemination. Nevertheless, world-wide economic disaster losses in the 1990s have continued to show a rapid increase - and the increase for climate related disasters has been three to four times greater than those for geological disasters. Is some of this increased loss due to anthropogenic climate change? There is some evidence of increases in frequency of heavy rainfalls in a number of regions and of severe winter storms in the northern hemisphere. On the other hand, there is little global trend in frequency or intensity of tropical cyclones whose geographical distribution is more closely related to ENSO events. But is there a possibility that increases in intensity over the past few decades of El Nino and La Nina events are related to increased radiative forcing from greenhouse gases? Whatever the outcome of emerging research on extreme events in a changing climate, it is evident that climate adaptation through disaster mitigation measures is of increasing importance with growing populations in more vulnerable regions. Measures that must be supported vigorously include improved warning and preparedness systems, safer buildings, risk-averse land use planning, better protected urban infrastructure, and more resilient water supply systems, among others. Both national and international efforts must not be allowed to diminish after the end of the IDNDR in 1999.

Large salt playas are highlighted as ephemeral lakes that can display extreme sensitivity to changes in regional rainfall patterns, and which commonly do not have extensively managed catchments. To explore the application of high temporal frequency monitoring of salt playas using remote sensing, the Chott el Djerid, a large salt playa situated in southern Tunisia was targeted. A short time series of 39 Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR; resolution 1·1 km at nadir) images of the Chott el Djerid (spanning 36 months between 1987 and 1990) were compiled along with climate information from a weather station at Tozeur. Using image histogram manipulation, lake areas were extracted from the time series. A good level of agreement was observed between recorded rainfall events and the presence of surface water on the playa, and for a limited sample of large flood events it was found that there were significant relationships between rainfall, evaporation and estimated lake areas (r2 = 98·5, p &lt; 0·001). Overall, these data suggest that contemporary lake formation is largely controlled by temporal changes in effective precipitation within the basin. In addition, it was found that the coefficient of variation of the time series, and a combination of temporal reflectance profiles extracted from it, could be used to give a direct indication of which sedimentary surfaces on the playa are affected by large flood events, and the extent to which these events may be preserved within the recent sedimentary record at these sites.","AVHRR; Chott el Djerid; Closed basin; Lake area; Playa","aridity; AVHRR; lake level; playa; Tunisia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032810678

The dicarbonyl Rh species, which is associated with Rh+ ions, is mainly observed on the catalyst oxidized at 473-823 K or reduced by H2 at 473-573 K. CO does not reduce the Rh completely to the Rh0 state, even at 823 K, not because of the stabilization of Rh+ ions by oxygen formed in the dissociation of CO, but mainly because of the difficulty of completely reducing Rh oxide that strongly interacts with the support. Calcination favors the stability of the dicarbonyl species. Complete reduction of the Rh proceeds in H2 at 823 K. The Rh particles thus formed are not disintegrated by a joint action of CO and hydroxyl groups. The linear CO species, associated with Rh0 particles, shows a higher reactivity and desorbs before the dicarbonyl species. Data on the desorption and reactivity of adsorbed CO species reveal the inhomogeneity of Rh sites. The modification of the Rh morphology during the interaction of CO with the catalyst is schematically represented. The conversion in the CO methanation reaction decreases simultaneously with the intensity of the band corresponding to the dicarbonyl species. The presence of the dicarbonyl species reflects the sintering process of metallic Rh in this reaction.","CO; DRIFTS; Rh/χ/-Al2O3","aluminum oxide; carbon monoxide; rhodium; adsorption; article; catalysis; catalyst; diffuse reflectance spectroscopy; infrared spectroscopy; oxidation; reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345040739

The results indicate that below the temperature of the maximum NOx conversion there are no NO adsorption/desorption processes taking place under these steady-state conditions. Moreover, less than 15% of the catalyst surface is covered with N2 or N2O precursors. N2O is the ""isotopically first"" product while N2 is the second. The surface lifetime of N2O precursors is relatively short while the surface lifetime of N2 precursors is significantly longer. The production of N2 and N2O are both increased by raising the temperature. In the case of N2O, this seems to be solely due to an increase in the concentration of active sites on the catalyst while in the case of N2 the increase in the number of active sites is accompanied by an increase in their intrinsic activity. At temperatures above the maximum in the NOx conversion there is a discernible amount of NO desorption taking place under steady-state conditions. This is rationalised by the formation of NO2 (ads) species on the now-oxidised Pt surface. The SSITKA results are found to support the previously proposed reaction mechanism for the NO/C3H6/O2 reaction over Pt-based catalysts. Finally, a general form for the calculation of concentrations of adsorbed species from any SSITK analysis is presented. © 1999 Academic Press.","Lean-burn conditions; NOx reduction; Pt catalysts; Reaction mechanisms; SSITKA",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0006523419

Switches of O2 and C3H6 into and out of a stream of C3H6/NO/O2 over a 1% Pt-SiO2 catalyst were performed at temperatures above and below that at which maximum NOx conversion is seen, i.e., 220 and 250°C. The transient reaction studies show that at low temperatures the Pt is reduced and covered with carbonaceous material while at high temperatures it is oxidised and covered with Oads species. Rapid changes in the surface oxidation state of the Pt are observed after the removal or reintroduction of the O2 and C3H6 reactants at all temperatures. The results of each individual switch are discussed in terms of a mechanism for NOx reduction and alkene oxidation over Pt-based catalysts in the ""lean-NOx"" process. The conclusions are found to be consistent with our previous model for the NOx reduction model.

The purpose of the present paper is twofold: first, a downscaling technique is used as a diagnostic tool to verify the performance of climate models on the regional scale; second, a technique is proposed for verifying the validity of empirical downscaling procedures in climate change applications. The case considered is regional seasonal precipitation in Romania. The downscaling model is a regression based on canonical correlation analysis between observed station precipitation and European-scale sea level pressure (SLP). The climate models considered here are the T21 and T42 versions of the Hamburg ECHAM3 atmospheric GCM run in 'time-slice' mode. The climate change scenario refers to the expected time of doubled carbon dioxide concentrations around the year 2050. The downscaling model is skillful for all seasons except spring. The general of the large-scale SLP variability are reproduced fairly well by both GCMs in all seasons. The climate models reproduce the empirically determined precipitation-SLP link in winter, whereas the observed link is only partially captured for the other seasons. Thus, these models may be considered skillful with respect to regional precipitation during winter, and partially during the other seasons. Generally, applications of statistical downscaling to climate change scenarios have been based on the assumption that the empirical link between the large-scale and regional parameters remains valid under a changed climate. In this study, a rationale is proposed for this assumption by showing the consistency of the 2 X CO2 GCM scenarios in winter, derived directly from the gridpoint data, with the regional scenarios obtained through empirical downscaling. Since the skill of the GCMs in regional terms is already established, it is concluded that the downscaling technique is adequate for describing climatically changing regional and local conditions, at least for precipitation in Romania during winter.Empirical downscaling procedures relate large-scale atmospheric features with local features such as station rainfall in order to facilitate local scenarios of climate change.

Two soil types, Galestown gravely loamy sand soil, with pH 5.8 and 0.6% humic material, and Hatborough loamy sand soil, with pH 4.5 and 3.2% humic material, were compared. Five seed types, corn, cucumber, radish, soybean, and sunflower were used. Microbial communities were characterized functionally, using a substrate utilization assay, and structurally, using fatty acid methyl ester analysis, over a 96-h period after the onset of germination. Soil type affected the microbial communities far more than seed type. The communities in Hatborough soil had greater functional and structural changes compared with the control than Galestown soil.

This paper examines one approach to achieving this aim, based on the hypothesis that car owners do not correctly perceive the full cost of a car trip. The primary objective of the research was to assess the potential for correcting this misperception through the use of a digital car running-cost meter, installed on the dashboard of a car, which displays on a real-time basis the cost of each trip. Cost meter information on marginal trip cost, external cost and the effect of driving style was provided to a sample of drivers in a small pilot action in Dublin. The findings from the data (diaries and interviews) are presented and extrapolated by means of a transport network model to assess potential energy savings. The key findings from the work are as follows. (a) There was a significant reduction in off-peak-period trips observed as a result of the car meter but there was no significant reduction in time spent in the car, distance travelled by car and the cost of driving. (b) A surprising finding from the project was that 40% of the subjects who happened to be changing their vehicle shortly after being involved in the project chose more fuel-efficient vehicles. They attributed their choice in part to their increased awareness of fuel costs as a result of their involvement in the project.",,"Automobile drivers; Costs; Decision theory; Mathematical models; Transportation routes; Transport management; Transport planning; Motor transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033334015

As such, the digestion of cattle slurries and of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste has been evaluated and has been successful. Attempts to apply the process to other types of solid organic waste, for example, to chicken manure, have met with limited success. In many areas of the UK, intensive chicken farming is leading to solids disposal problems. It has been proposed that co-digestion with cattle slurry could be a possible disposal route for chicken manure. In this study, cattle slurries were mixed with a range of solid wastes and allowed to digest in 1-1 batch digesters. The criteria for judging the success of a co-digestion were volatile solids (VS) reduction, total methane production and methane yield. In terms of the VS reductions (%), there was little difference between the various digestions. In terms of the cumulative methane production (1) the co-digestions with fruit and vegetable waste, the fish offal and the dissolved air flotation sludge were more effective than the digestion with cattle slurry alone. In terms of the specific methane yield (m3CH4 kg-1 VS removed), the co-digestions containing fish offal and the brewery sludge gave higher values than the control digestion with cattle slurry alone. Compared with their control (cattle slurry alone), both co-digestions with poultry manure (7.5 and 15% TS) gave higher cumulative productions of methane and the system with the lower concentration of poultry manure gave a higher specific methane yield. However, there was some evidence of ammonia inhibition.","Anaerobic digestion; Co-digestion; Inhibition; Performance; Solid wastes","Co digestion; Waste organic solids; Anaerobic digestion; Manures; Methane; Waste disposal; Solid wastes; ammonia; methane; agriculture; anaerobic digestion; article; chicken; fish; fruit; manure; priority journal; solid waste management; vegetable",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033080631

This study shows that despite the potential utility, managers do not use climate forecasts except for background information. The barriers to managers' use of climate forecasts include low forecast skill, lack of interpretation and demonstrated applications, low geographic resolution, inadequate links to climate variability related impacts, and institutional aversion to incorporating new tools into decision making.

Dissolution and paleokarst have a positive impact on the porosity as well as the storage capacity of carbonate reservoirs because the secondary porosity related to dissolution and paleokarst serves as excellent traps for migrating hydrocarbons. In order to evaluate the reservoir characteristics reasonably in the late Precambrian and Ordovician carbonate rocks, the secondary porosity, which was produced by dissolution and paleokarstification in late diagenetic stage, should be studied because the primary pores were mostly destroyed during the early-middle diagenesis due to serious compaction and multi-cementation. Carbonate rocks are among the most important collectors of oil and gas accumulations in the world. Important oil and gas reservoirs in paleokarst-containing carbonate rocks are known worldwide because micropores and megapores, such as solution openings, solution fissures, funnels, sinkholes, and caves, serve as the fundamentally important secondary porosity in those rocks. Several wells revealed that the Kalpin-Shaya region is a prospective target for oil and gas exploration. The reservoir carbonates of the Kalpin-Shaya uplift zone in the northern Tarim include dolomites and limestones. The best dolomite reservoirs are in the late Precambrian Qigebulake Formation (Z22), the lower Qiulitage Group (ε2-3), the upper Qiulitage Group (O11), and the Xiaoerbulake Formation (ε1), whereas limestone reservoirs are in the middle-upper formations of the upper Qiulitage Group (O12-3). On the basis of the study of petrology, paleontology, and stratigraphy from field work and well core data, the pore spaces within the Precambrian and Ordovician carbonate reservoirs are studied with the aim of proving that all secondary pores are controlled by dissolution and paleokarst.",,"hydrocarbon reservoir; Ordovician; paleokarst; Proterozoic; reservoir characterization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033502227

It is a product of the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels and is also produced by natural processes or by biotransformation of halomethanes within the human body. With external exposure to additional carbon monoxide, subtle effects can begin to occur, and exposure to higher levels can result in death. The health effects of carbon monoxide are largely the result of the formation of carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb), which impairs the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. 1.1. Chemistry and analytical methods. Methods available for the measurement of carbon monoxide in ambient air range from fully automated methods using the non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) technique and gas chromatography to simple semiquantitative manual methods using detector tubes. Because the formation of carboxyhaemoglobin in humans is dependent on many factors, including the variability of ambient air concentrations of carbon monoxide, carboxyhaemoglobin concentration should be measured rather than calculated. Several relatively simple methods are available for determining carbon monoxide by analysis either of the blood or of alveolar air that is in equilibrium with the blood. Some of these methods have been validated by careful comparative studies. 1.2. Sources and environmental levels of carbon monoxide in the environment. Carbon monoxide is a trace constituent of the troposphere, produced by both natural processes and human activities. Because plants can both metabolize and produce carbon monoxide, trace levels are considered a normal constituent of the natural environment. Although ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide in the vicinity of urban and industrial areas can substantially exceed global background levels, there are no reports of these currently measured levels of carbon monoxide producing any adverse effects on plants or microorganisms. Ambient concentrations of carbon monoxide, however, can be detrimental to human health and welfare, depending on the levels that occur in areas where humans live and work and on the susceptibility of exposed individuals to potentially adverse effects. Trends in air quality data from fixed-site monitoring stations show a general decline in carbon monoxide concentrations, which reflects the efficacy of emission control systems on newer vehicles. Highway vehicle emissions in the USA account for about 50% of total emissions; non-highway transportation sources contribute 13%. The other categories of carbon monoxide emissions are other fuel combustion sources, such as steam boilers (12%); industrial processes (8%); solid waste disposal (3%); and miscellaneous other sources (14%). Indoor concentrations of carbon monoxide are a function of outdoor concentrations, indoor sources, infiltration, ventilation and air mixing between and within rooms. In residences without sources, average carbon monoxide concentrations are approximately equal to average outdoor levels. The highest indoor carbon monoxide concentrations are associated with combustion sources and are found in enclosed parking garages, service stations and restaurants, for example. The lowest indoor carbon monoxide concentrations are found in homes, churches and health care facilities. Exposure studies show that passive cigarette smoke is associated with increasing a non-smoker's exposure by an average of about 1.7 mg/m3 (1.5 ppm) and that use of a gas cooking range at home is associated with an increase of about 2.9 mg/m3 (2.5 ppm). Other sources that may contribute to carbon monoxide in the home include combustion space and water heaters and coal- or wood-burning stoves. 1.3. Environmental distribution and transformation. Recent data on global trends in tropospheric carbon monoxide concentrations indicate a decrease over the last decade. Global background concentrations fall in the range of 60-140 μg/m3 (50-120 ppb). Levels are higher in the northern hemisphere than in the southern hemisphere. Average background concentrations also fluctuate seasonally. Higher levels occur in the winter months, and lower levels occur in the summer months. About 60% of the carbon monoxide found in the non-urban troposphere is attributed to human activities, both directly from combustion processes and indirectly through the oxidation of hydrocarbons and methane that, in turn, arise from agricultural activities, landfills and other similar sources. Atmospheric reactions involving carbon monoxide can produce ozone in the troposphere. Other reactions may deplete concentrations of the hydroxyl radical, a key participant in the global removal cycles of many other natural and anthropogenic trace gases, thus possibly contributing to changes in atmospheric chemistry and, ultimately, to global climate change. 1.4. Population exposure to carbon monoxide. During typical daily activities, people encounter carbon monoxide in a variety of microenvironments - while travelling in motor vehicles, working at their jobs, visiting urban locations associated with combustion sources, or cooking and heating with domestic gas, charcoal or wood fires - as well as in tobacco smoke. Overall, the most important carbon monoxide exposures for a majority of individuals occur in the vehicle and indoor microenvironments. The development of small, portable electrochemical personal exposure monitors (PEMs) has made possible the measurement of carbon monoxide concentrations encountered by individuals as they move through numerous diverse indoor and outdoor microenvironments that cannot be monitored by fixed-site ambient stations. Results of both exposure monitoring in the field and modelling studies indicate that individual personal exposure determined by PEMs does not directly correlate with carbon monoxide concentrations determined by using fixed-site monitors alone. This observation is due to the mobility of people and to the spatial and temporal variability of carbon monoxide concentrations. Although they fail to show a correlation between individual personal monitor exposures and simultaneous nearest fixed-site monitor concentrations, large-scale carbon monoxide human exposure field studies do suggest that aggregate personal exposures are lower on days of lower ambient carbon monoxide levels as determined by the fixed-site monitors and higher on days of higher ambient levels. These studies point out the necessity of having personal carbon monoxide measurements to augment fixed-site ambient monitoring data when total human exposure is to be evaluated. Data from these field studies can be used to construct and test models of human exposure that account for time and activity patterns known to affect exposure to carbon monoxide. Evaluation of human carbon monoxide exposure situations indicates that occupational exposures in some workplaces or exposures in homes with faulty or unvented combustion appliances can exceed 110 mg carbon monoxide/m3 (100 ppm), often leading to carboxyhaemoglobin levels of 10% or more with continued exposure. In contrast, such high exposure levels are encountered much less commonly by the general public exposed under ambient conditions. More frequently, exposures to less than 29-57 mg carbon monoxide/m3 (25-50 ppm) for any extended period of time occur among the general population; at the low exercise levels usually engaged in under such circumstances, the resulting carboxyhaemoglobin levels most typically remain 1-2% among non-smokers. These levels can be compared with the physiological norm for non-smokers, which is estimated to be in the range of 0.3-0.7% carboxyhaemoglobin. In smokers, however, baseline carboxyhaemoglobin concentrations average 4%, with a usual range of 3-8%, reflecting absorption of carbon monoxide from inhaled smoke. Studies of human exposure have shown that motor vehicle exhaust is the most important source for regularly encountered elevated carbon monoxide levels. Studies indicate that the motor vehicle interior has the highest average carbon monoxide concentration (averaging 10-29 mg/m3 [9-25 ppm]) of all microenvironments. Furthermore, commuting exposures have been shown to be highly variable, with some commuters breathing carbon monoxide in excess of 40 mg/m3 (35 ppm). The workplace is another important setting for carbon monoxide exposures. In general, apart from commuting to and from work, exposures at work exceed carbon monoxide exposures during non-work periods. Occupational and non-occupational exposures may overlay one another and result in a higher concentration of carbon monoxide in the blood. Most importantly, the nature of certain occupations carries an increased risk of high carbon monoxide exposure (e.g., those occupations involved directly with vehicle driving, maintenance and parking). Occupational groups exposed to carbon monoxide from vehicle exhaust include auto mechanics; parking garage and gas station attendants; bus, truck or taxi drivers; police; and warehouse workers. Certain industrial processes can expose workers to carbon monoxide produced directly or as a byproduct; they include steel production, coke ovens, carbon black production and petroleum refining. Firefighters, cooks and construction workers may also be exposed at work to high carbon monoxide levels. Occupational exposures in industries or settings with carbon monoxide production represent some of the highest individual exposures observed in field monitoring studies. 1.5. Toxicokinetics and mechanisms of action of carbon monoxide. Carbon monoxide is absorbed through the lungs, and the concentration of carboxyhaemoglobin in the blood at any time will depend on several factors.",,"carbon monoxide; carboxyhemoglobin; fuel; methane; article; biotransformation; combustion; death; environmental exposure; environmental health; oxygen transport; Nicotiana tabacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033506313

Direct reduction of nitrobenzene in a microemulsion of didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB), hexane, and water gave azoxybenzene as the product. With HCl in the water phase, azoxybenzene and azobenzene were produced. This, together with spectroscopic results, demonstrates that nitrobenzene resides in a polar region of low proton availability. Reduction of aryl iodides and aromatic hydrocarbons in microemulsions resulted in clean reductive cleavage of the carbon-iodine bond, followed by reduction of the aromatic rings. Doubly electrocatalytic reduction of benzal chloride to toluene was also accomplished by using various cobalt complexes in a DDAB microemulsion.

Recent efforts have focused on removing the carbon from the active regions of the device to avoid device degradation due to electrically active carbon defects and exploring remote carbon's effect on boron TED and OED, while using the boron diffusion to probe point defect concentrations. In this paper we measure quantitatively the effect of remotely located carbon on phosphorus and boron diffusion above a buried SiGeC layer at 850 °C in oxygen or nitrogen ambients. Remote carbon, located 1250 angstroms below the phosphorus edge, is found to reduce the phosphorus diffusion enhancement factor due to OED from 8 to 2. The effect of the remotely located SiGeC buried layer on the excess interstitial concentration profile, which is responsible for the enhanced dopant diffusion, is probed by measuring boron and phosphorus diffusivites of in-situ doped boron and phosphorus layers above a buried SiGe(C) layer after oxidation or nitrogen anneals at 850 °C. The enhanced boron diffusivity during oxidation is found to have a near linear dependence on depth ranging from 5-1.25. Finally, using x-ray diffraction and photoluminescence measurements of as-grown, buried, strained SiGe(C) structures and annealed SiGe(C) structures in oxygen or nitrogen ambient at 850 °C the number of substitutional carbon atoms effectively consumed by oxidation is unambiguously correlated to the absolute number of injected interstitials using published values for the interstitial injection rate during oxidation.",,"Annealing; Carbon; Diffusion in solids; Oxidation; Phosphorus; Photoluminescence; Point defects; Semiconducting boron; Semiconductor doping; X ray diffraction analysis; Oxidation enhanced boron diffusion; Transient enhanced diffusion (TED); Semiconducting silicon compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032684520

This initiative, based on the market mechanism of a sulfur dioxide tradable “allowance” system, was a dramatic departure from traditional command and control strategies designed to reduce air pollution emissions. Power plant managers have flexibility under the program to select and implement a variety of options to reduce emissions below mandated levels. Federal agencies have collected annual performance data for affected facilities covered by the program for a number of years. Coal-burning plants are typically greater generators of sulfur dioxide (SO2) than oil burners of equivalent size. This study examined the effect of fuel type as a significant factor influencing a plant’s achievement in reducing pollution emissions. Achievement was measured by using a derived variable, delta (A), defined as the difference between pounds of SO2 produced divided by the energy (in million Btu) generated, for the years 1990 and 1995. Rigorous nonparametric statistical analyses were used to compare the two populations of coal-fired and oil-fired plants. Results indicated that coal-burning facilities achieved greater program success, measured by the expected value of delta, than the oil combustors for the five-year period reviewed. Since utility managers must take steps to ensure all applicable requirements of the program are met, findings of the inquiry should prove to be useful in assessing achievable emissions reductions and aid in long-range facility planning. © 1999 Air and Waste Management Association.",,"sulfur dioxide; acid rain; air pollution; air quality; article; electric power plant; health care policy; priority journal; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033010643

Using the statistical comparison method, the performance of this 'Pathfinder + erosion' climatology is compared with the performance of the WOA94 1° in situ climatology, the Reynolds satellite and in situ blended 1° analysis, version 2.2 of the blended 1° Global Sea-Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (GISST) climatology, and the in situ 5° Global Ocean Surface Temperature Atlas (GOSTA). Overall, the Pathfinder + erosion climatology yields lower anomaly variances in the mid- and high latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere, but larger variances than the 1° climatologies in the warm, Northern Hemisphere low-latitude regions.The purpose of this study is to present a satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) climatology based on Pathfinder Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data and to evaluate it and several other climatologies for their usefulness in the determination of SST trends. The method of evaluation uses two long-term observational collections of in situ SST measurements: the 1994 World Ocean Atlas (WOA94) and the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS). Each of the SST climatologies being evaluated is subtracted from each raw SST observation in WOA94 and COADS to produce several separate long-term anomaly datasets. The anomaly dataset with the smallest standard deviation is assumed to identify the climatology best able to represent the spatial and seasonal SST variability and therefore be most capable of reducing the uncertainty in SST trend determinations. The satellite SST climatology was created at a resolution of 9.28 km using both day and night satellite fields generated with the version 4 AVHRR Pathfinder algorithm and cloud-masking procedures, plus an erosion filter that provides additional cloud masking in the vicinity of cloud edges. Using the statistical comparison method, the performance of this 'Pathfinder + erosion' climatology is compared with the performances of the WOA94 1°in situ climatology, the Reynolds satellite and in situ blended 1°analysis, version 2.2 of the blended 1°Global Sea-Ice and Sea Surface Temperature (GISST) climatology, and the in situ 5°Global Ocean Surface Temperature Atlas (GOSTA). The standard deviation of the anomalies produced using the raw WOA94 in situ observations and the reference SST climatologies indicate that the 9.28-km Pathfinder + erosion climatology is more representative of spatial and seasonal SST variability than the traditional in situ and blended SST climatologies. For the anomalies created from the raw COADS observations, the Pathfinder + erosion climatology is also found to minimize variance more than the other climatologies. In both cases, the 5°GOSTA climatology exhibits the largest anomaly standard deviations. Regional characteristics of the climatologies are also examined by binning the anomalies by climatological temperature classes and latitudinal bands. Generally, the Pathfinder + erosion climatology yields lower anomaly variances in the mid- and high latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere, but larger variances than the 1°climatologies in the warm, Northern Hemisphere low-latitude regions.",,"Algorithms; Atmospheric temperature; Clouds; Radiometers; Comprehensive ocean atmosphere data set; Sea surface temperature; Climatology; air-sea interaction; computer program; satellite sensor; sea surface temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032693555

We investigated how elevated CO2 influenced the response of paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis Britt.) seedlings to variation in soil moisture. Seedlings were grown for four months on a soil moisture gradient, individually and in mixed species stands, in controlled environment facilities at ambient (375 μL L-1) and elevated (700 μL L-1) atmospheric CO2. For both individually and competitively grown paper birch seedlings, there was a greater CO2 growth enhancement for seedlings watered less frequently than for well-watered seedlings. This differential change in CO2 responsiveness across the moisture gradient reduced the difference in seedling growth between high and low water levels and effectively broadened the regeneration niche of paper birch. In contrast, for yellow birch seedlings, elevated CO2 only produced a significant growth enhancement at the wet end of the soil moisture gradient, and increased the size difference between seedlings at the two ends of the gradient. Gas exchange measurements showed that paper birch seedlings were more sensitive than yellow birch seedlings to declines in soil moisture, and that elevated CO2 reduced this sensitivity. Additionally, elevated CO2 improved survival of yellow birch seedlings growing in competition with paper birch in dry stands. Thus, elevated CO2 may influence regeneration patterns of paper birch and yellow birch on sites of differing soil moisture. In the future, as atmospheric CO2 levels rise, growth of paper birch seedlings and survival of yellow birch seedlings may be enhanced on xeric sites, while yellow birch may show improved growth on mesic sites.","Elevated CO2; Paper birch; Seedling regeneration; Soil moisture; Temperate forests; Yellow birch","carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; community structure; forest; seedling establishment; soil moisture; Betula alleghaniensis; Betula papyrifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032857638

These rocks, of Miocene age, consist of strongly carbonate-cemented siliciclastic sediments ranging in grain size from mud to coarse sand. The methane-related origin of Monferrato carbonates is based on: (a) outcrop-scale evidence: patchiness of cementation, chemosymbiotic fossil communities, presence of a network of polyphase carbonate-filled veins not related to tectonics; (b) isotope geochemistry: very depleted δ13C values, as low as -50‰ PDB; (c) peculiar petrographic features. Diverse microbial communities have been observed in present-day cold seeps. These communities include sulphate-reducing, sulphur-oxidizing and methane-oxidizing bacteria. The present work is focused on the identification and description of fossil evidence of such microbial activity in the Monterrato carbonates. Examples of fossilization of microbial structures are probably represented by pyritic rods and dolomite tubes referable to sulphur-oxidizing and to unspecified bacteria, respectively. Less direct but more abundant evidence has been found through petrographic and SEM studies of seep carbonates. Many features point to the presence of organic clumps or mats capable of trapping sediment and promoting carbonate precipitation: microcrystalline calcite peloids; dolomite crystals with irregular hollow cores; dolomite spheroids with dumbbell-shapped cores; laminated internal sediments lining cavities completely. All these features are interpreted to result from bacterially mediated, sedimentary and diagenetic processes and can therefore be considered as an additional evidence of ancient methane seeps.","Bacteria; Cold seep carbonates; Dolomite; Monferrato; NW Italy; Peloids","bacterium; carbonate; cold seep; dolomite; microbial activity; precipitation (chemistry); Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242622732

A new downscaling approach for climate diagnosis is presented here. It is based on artificial neural network (ANN) techniques that derive relationships from the large- and local-scale atmospheric controls to the local winter climate. This study documents the large-scale conditions associated with extreme precipitation events in northeastern Mexico and southeastern Texas during the 1985-93 period, and demonstrates the ability of ANN to simulate realistic relationships between circulation-humidity fields and daily precipitation at local scale. The diagnostic model employs a neural network that preclassifies the winter circulation and humidity fields into different patterns. The results from this neural network classification approach, known as a self-organizing map (SOM), indicate that negative (positive) anomalies of winter precipitation over the study area are associated with 1) a weaker (stronger) Aleutian low, 2) a stronger (weaker) North Pacific high, 3) a negative (positive) phase of the Pacific-North American pattern, and 4) cold (warm) ENSO events. The atmospheric patterns classified with the SOM technique are then used as input to another neural network (feed-forward ANN) that captures over 60% of the daily rainfall variance over the region. This further reveals that the SOM preclassification of days with similar atmospheric conditions succeeded in emphasizing the differences of the atmospheric variance that are conducive to extreme precipitation. This resulted in a downscaling model that is highly sensitive to local- and large-scale weather anomalies associated with ENSO warm events and cold air outbreaks.",,"Atmospheric humidity; Climate change; Feedforward neural networks; Precipitation (meteorology); Atmospheric controls; Climate diagnosis; Pacific North American pattern; Self organizing map; Rain; artificial neural network; atmospheric circulation; climate modeling; extreme event; precipitation (chemistry); rainfall; Mexico; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032875821

Although most HOV lanes operate successfully and new ones continue to be built, a populist revolt has suddenly surfaced against set-aside lanes for carpools and vanpools. Critics charge that HOV lanes are often grossly underutilized, and have thus failed to relieve congestion or improve air quality as promised. In November 1998, Governor Christine Whitman decommissioned two unpopular carpool lanes in New Jersey, I-287 and I-80, which by most accounts was justified in light of their poor performance. Undersubscribed carpool lanes and oversubscribed regular lanes do little to reduce emissions or hasten traffic. New Jersey is not the first to abolish preferential lanes. In 1995, two HOV lanes were reverted back to regular lanes in Montreal within a few days of opening because of traffic snarls and relentless ridiculing of highway officials by the local media. And, of course, there was the Santa Monica Freeway fiasco of 1976 when, with little advanced warning, a regular lane was converted to a three-or-more-occupant diamond lane, causing near-instant traffic paralysis. But these instances involved the expropriation of existing lanes for carpools and vanpools. What we are seeing today is the conversion of newly built HOV lanes to regular lanes. Following New Jersey's lead, over the past year politicians in California, Minnesota, Virginia, and New York have sought to decommission HOV lanes in their own states.",,"Air pollution control; Gas emissions; Highway traffic control; Roads and streets; High-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes; Motor transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033321876

AER(x) is a microprocessor-controlled, bolus inhalation device that is actuated at pre-programmed values of inspiratory flow rate and volume. The aims of the study were to determine the effects of posture and inhaled volume upon de position of the aerosol in the lungs. Each subject inhaled the radioaerosol in two positions (supine vs sitting) and with two inspiratory manoeuvres [vital capacity (VC) vs 'fixed volume' of 1 1 above functional residual capacity]. Simultaneous transmission-emission planar and tomographic images were acquired. The results showed diffuse deposition of the aerosol in the lung. Neither the breathing manoeuvre nor the posture was found to affect the distribution of the aerosol as measured by the ratio of the activity (counts per pixel) in the peripheral:central (penetration index, PI) or in the apex:base regions of the planar lung images (P > 0.1). A small, albeit statistically significant, difference in PI (P < 0.03) was found between VC and fixed volume sitting manoeuvres with SPET only. The PI values themselves indicate that the radioaerosol was well distributed in the lung, with the periphery having 45%-64% of the activity of the central region. Superposition of transmission SPET lung outline on emission SPET visually confirmed the excellent peripheral deposition of the aerosol. The AER(x) system showed high efficiency of delivery, with approximately 50% of the extruded dose in the device depositing in the lung. The uniformity of radioactivity distributed throughout the lung is attributed to the fine particle size (mass median aerodynamic diameter of 2 μm) of the aerosol and the electronic control of aerosol inhalation by the device. In conclusion, the AER(x) system can be ideal for diffuse aerosol deposition of therapeutic or diagnostic agents and is largely unaffected by inhaled volume and posture. The efficiency of the device device can limit the total radiation exposure of patients and staff administering the radioaerosols, and can make it suitable for delivery of expensive drugs.","Drug delivery; Lung deposition; Radioaerosol; Technetium-99m diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid; Ventilation imaging","pentetate technetium tc 99m; radioactive aerosol; adult; article; body posture; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug delivery system; female; functional residual capacity; human; human experiment; inhalational drug administration; lung; male; normal human; particle size; radiation exposure; single photon emission computer tomography; sitting; supine position; vital capacity; Adult; Aerosols; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Posture; Radiopharmaceuticals; Reference Values; Respiratory Mechanics; Technetium Tc 99m Pentetate; Tissue Distribution; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032891021

A comprehensive survey was conducted from November 1995 to July 1996 in Hong Kong to assess the effect of traffic-induced air pollution inside different commuting microenvironments on commuter exposure. Microenvironmental monitoring is performed for six major public commuting modes (bus, light bus, MTR, railway, tram, ferry), plus private car and roadside pavement. Traffic-related pollutants, CO, NO(x), THC and O3 were selected as the target pollutants. The results indicate that commuter exposure is highly influenced by the choice of commuting microenvironment. In general, the exposure level in decreasing order of measured pollutant level for respective commuting microenvironments are: private car, the group consisting light bus, bus, tram and pavement, MTR and train, and finally ferry. In private car, the CO level is several times higher than that in the other microenvironments with a trip averaged of 10.1 ppm and a maximum of 24.9 ppm. Factors such as the body position of the vehicle, intake point of the ventilation system, fuel used, ventilation, transport mode, road and driving conditions were used in the analysis. Inter- microenvironment, intra-microenvironment and temporal variation of CO concentrations were used as the major indicator. The low body position and low intake point of the ventilation system of the private car are believed to be the cause of higher intake of exhaust of other vehicles and thus result in high pollution level in this microenvironment. Compared with other metropolis around the world and the Hong Kong Air Quality Objectives (HKAQO), exposure levels of commuter to traffic-related air pollution in Hong Kong are relatively low for most pollutants measured.

Carbon is observed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in four distinct chemical states, C-C, C-F, C-F2, C-F3, and the relative intensity of C-Fx to C-C increases with increasing fluorine content and decreasing deposition temperature. Heat treatment of this material in vacuum up to 450 °C results in reduction of the intensities of C-Fx relative to that of C-C. The predominant desorbing masses detected by a mass spectrometer were consistent with CF3, CF, C3F5, CF2, COF, COF2, and Ar. The temperature at which desorbing CFx species are detected increases with decreasing fluorine concentration and increasing deposition temperature. This improved thermal stability is attributed to the decreasing amount of volatile, small molecular weight CFx species and more C-C crosslinking in the less fluorinated film. To integrate with copper metallization, the interface between a-C:F and tantalum nitride was studied by depositing tantalum nitride on a a-C:F films and monitoring the interfacial chemical reactions in situ using XPS. Substantial defluorination was observed upon deposition of tantalum nitride. This leads to the formation of tantalum fluoride, whose relatively high vapor pressure and susceptibility to hydrolysis could lead to delamination. © 1999 American Vacuum Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033466464

The measurements were made during periods of high and low river flow in Apalachicola Bay, Florida, United States, over 3 yr. DIC concentration and δ13C values were related to salinity, indicating that conservative mixing of riverine and marine waters was responsible for the overall distributions. The usefulness of DIC δ13C data for characterizing the trophic processes within the estuary was dependent upon the residence time of water within the estuary. Despite the input of large quantities of terrestrial organic mater, net heterotrophy was indicated in only one fall season. Plankton δ13C values varied from -22‰ to -30‰ and were directly related to estuarine DIC δ13C, offset by a factor of roughly -20‰. This offset factor varied with salinity. Values of δ34S in esmarine plankton (station means ranged from 11.4‰ to 13.1‰) were depleted relative to marine plankton (17.7 ± 0.4‰) possibly due to the admixture of 34S-depleted sedimentary sulfide with estuarine samples. Values of δ34S in plankton were not related to δ13C values of plankton and were only weakly correlated to the salinity of the water from which the plankton were collected, indicating that marine sulfate was the primary source of planktonic sulfur. Values of δ15N in plankton varied from 5.5‰ to 10.7‰ and appeared related to dominance of the sample by phytoplankton or zooplankton.

However, several studies have shown that downscaled precipitation is either insensitive to changes in climatic forcing, or inconsistent with the broad-scale changes indicated by the host GCM(s). This has been recently attributed to the omission of the effect that changes in atmospheric moisture content have on precipitation. We describe validation of a nonhomogeneous hidden Markov model (NHMM) for changed climate conditions and apply it to a network of 30 daily precipitation stations in southwestern Australia. NHMMs fitted to 1 x CO2 LAM data were validated by assessing their performance in predicting 2 x CO2 LAM precipitation. The inclusion of 850 hPa dew point temperature depression, a predictor reflecting relative (rather than absolute) atmospheric moisture content, was found to be crucial to be crucial to successful performance of the NHMM under 2 x CO2 conditions. The NHMM validated for the LAM data was fitted to the historical 30 station network and then used to downscale the 2 x CO2 LAM atmospheric data, producing plausible predictions of station precipitation under 2 x CO2 conditions. Our results highlight that the validation of a satistical downscaling technique for present day conditions does not necessarily imply legitimacy for changed climate conditions. Thus statistical downscaling studies that have not attempted to determine the plausibility of their predictions for the changed climate conditions should be viewed with caution.","Climate change modelling; Limited area models; Precipitation occurrence; Statistical downscaling","climate change; downscaling; general circulation model; precipitation assessment; (Southwest); Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033563603

Different approaches to estimating α(SO)(4)= have led to questions regarding the appropriate range of values to be used in radiative transfer models, resulting in inconsistencies in model outputs. Approaches to estimating α(SO)(4)= divide into two general categories: (i) empirical estimates based on multiple linear regression of the scattering coefficient against sulfate and other aerosol constituent masses and (ii) Mie theory calculations based on measured or assumed size distributions and refractive index. Internally consistent results emerge from these two approaches if the mass of the sulfate compound includes the masses of chemically bound ions and water but not the masses of compounds that are merely correlated with the sulfate. Despite differences in approach, most values of α(SO)(4)= at low relative humidity (RH &lt; 60%) and 550 nm wavelength fall in the range 3.6 to 7.5 m2 per gram of sulfate ion mass. This range is shown to be consistent with theoretical expectations wherein α(SO)(4)= is controlled primarily by variations in size distribution and secondarily by differences in the molecular form of the sulfate. Based on this overview of the subject, we offer a series of suggestions to the modelling and measurement communities. Modellers should recognize that α(SO)(4)= is an inherently variable parameter but also that the values in the literature are not necessarily comparable to each other (due to a lack of standardized methodology) nor adequately representative of regional and temporal variations. To remedy this, multivariate data obtained with standardized protocols from a variety of regions and seasons are needed.",,"aerosol; anthropogenic source; climate forcing; light scattering; sulfate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032945981

The order of the relative rates and N2 yields obtained with different alkanes reveals a non-trivial chemistry. The maximum yield is lower for propane than for n-butane but about the same for n- and iso-butane. However, at temperatures below this maximum, the N2 yield is higher for propane and n-butane than for iso-butane. Deposits are formed on the catalyst that contain N atoms in a low-oxidation state which are able to react with NO2 to form N2. TPO and FTIR results show that the amount and also the character of the deposits depend on the nature of alkanes. The change of the oxidation state of nitrogen from a high value in NO or NO2 to a lower value in nitrile and amino groups of the deposit is rationalized by applying mechanistic concepts of organic chemistry, including the Beckmann rearrangement and fragmentation.

In many published models, Farquhar's equations were applied directly to plant canopies by assuming a plant canopy to function like a big-leaf. This big-leaf approximation is found to be acceptable for estimating seasonal trends of canopy photosynthesis but inadequate for simulating its day-to-day variations, when compared with eddy-covariance and gas-exchange chamber measurements from two boreal forests. The daily variation is greatly dampened in big-leaf simulations because the original leaf-level model is partially modified through replacing stomatal conductance with canopy conductance. Alternative approaches such as separating the canopy into sunlit and shaded leaf groups or stratifying the canopy into multiple layers can avoid the problem. Because of non-linear response of leaf photosynthesis to meteorological variables (radiation, temperature and humidity), considerable errors exist in photosynthesis calculation at daily steps without considering the diurnal variability of the variables. To avoid these non-linear effects, we have developed an analytical solution to a simplified daily integral of Farquhar's model by considering the general diurnal patterns of meteorological variables. This daily model not only captures the main effects of diurnal variations on photosynthesis but is also computationally efficient for large area applications. Its application is then not restricted by availability of sub-daily meteorological data. This scheme has been tested using measured CO2 data from the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS), which took place in Manitoba and Saskatchewan in 1994 and 1996.","BOREAS; Canopy photosynthesis; CO2 flux; Farquhar model; Net primary productivity; Remote sensing application; Sunlit/shaded leaves","diurnal variation; ecological modeling; photosynthesis; remote sensing; spatial resolution; Canada; Manitoba; Saskatchewan; Boreas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033552660

The boreal landscape is heterogeneous owing to different forest cover types and disturbance regimes, and regional quantification of CO2 flux is difficult without numerous species-specific flux measurements. During the Boreal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study in 1994 and 1996 the National Research Council of Canada operated a Twin Otter aircraft that measured CO2, sensible and latent heat fluxes, and other trace gases over boreal forests in Saskatchewan, Canada. A flux-unmixing method was developed to calculate flux densities for eight major cover types from the aircraft-based measurements. Using a coregistered land cover map at 30-m resolution derived from Landsat thematic mapper data, the contribution of each cover type to the CO2 flux measured by the aircraft was estimated using a contributing area (footprint) function according to the wind direction, the atmospheric stability, the horizontal distance of each pixel from the aircraft, and aircraft height. The unmixing method uses a linear inversion method with the footprint-weighted cover type fractions as the set coefficients for each segment of a flight line. In the inversion, various constraint strategies were used to confine the inversion results to minimize the effect of various sampling errors. It is shown that (1) mathematical constraint is critically important in the inversion, (2) a simple constraint toward the mean flux values is effective in producing reasonable inversion results, and (3) the inversion accuracy can be further improved when simultaneous tower measurements in the dominant cover types are used as tight constraints. With such constraints the estimated fluxes from the cover types without tower measurements appear to be reasonable. It is concluded that aircraft measurement adds to our ability to map the regional flux field using remote sensing images because (1) it allows the derivation of flux data for cover types without tower-based measurements and (2) it can be used to infer the representativeness of tower measurements for the measured cover types in the landscape.

The oxygenated additives evaluated were dimethoxy methane (DMM) (also known as methylal) and diethyl ether (DEE). Blends of 5, 10, 20 and 30% by volume were investigated. The test engine was a 1993 Cummins B5.9 diesel, and data was collected for steady state operation at nine engine speed-load conditions. Experimental results show that all of the test fuels reduce PM when data is averaged across the nine engine operating modes. The largest reductions in PM were observed with a blend of 30% DMM in diesel, which yielded a 35% reduction compared to the baseline diesel fuel. Lower DMM blend levels also resulted in PM reductions, but to a lesser extent. On a modal averaged basis, F-T diesel reduced PM emissions by 29%, and DEE in concentrations of 10 to 30% reduced PM emissions by between 13 and 24%. On a modal averaged basis, NOx emissions for F-T diesel and the DMM and DEE blends were reduced by between 1 and 10%. Corresponding increases in fuel consumption (beyond that necessary to compensate for the differences in energy densities) were also observed. Modal averaged emissions of THC and CO were in most cases higher for the test fuels, but their overall levels remained low. Investigation of individual modal data revealed large differences in the effect of the DMM and DEE blends on PM emissions. In general, measured PM levels were drastically (as much as 76%) lower for the higher engine power test modes. For the lower power modes, however, PM emissions were often unchanged or even increased.

The Incw1 gene encoded two transcripts: Incw1-S (small) and Incw1-L (large); the size variation was attributable to different lengths in the 3′ untranslated region. Both metabolizable and nonmetabolizable sugars induced Incw1-L RNA apparently by default. However, only the metabolizable sugars, sucrose and D-glucose, were associated with the increased steady-state abundance of Incw1-S RNA, the concomitant increased levels of INCW1 protein and enzyme activity, and the downstream metabolic repression of the sucrose synthase gene, Sh1. Conversely, nonmetabolizable sugars, including the two glucose analogs 3-O-methylglucose and 2-deoxyglucose, induced greater steady-state levels of the Incw1-L RNA, but this increase did not lead to either an increase in the levels of the INCW1 protein/enzyme activity or the repression of the Sh1 gene. We conclude that sugar sensing and the induction of the Incw1 gene is independent of the hexokinase pathway. More importantly, our results also suggest that the 3′ untranslated region of the Incw1 gene acts as a regulatory sensor of carbon starvation and may constitute a link between sink metabolism and cellular translation in plants.",,"3 methylglucose; beta fructofuranosidase; deoxyglucose; enzyme; glucose; protein; RNA; sucrose; article; cell suspension; cell wall; enzyme activity; gene; maize; metabolism; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; 3' Untranslated Regions; Base Sequence; beta-Fructofuranosidase; Cell Wall; Cells, Cultured; Cloning, Molecular; Enzyme Repression; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Glucose; Glucosyltransferases; Glycoside Hydrolases; Molecular Sequence Data; Recombinant Proteins; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Sucrose; Zea mays; Embryophyta; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033621143

Accompanying changes in ions that alter local pH are not as well understood. Shifts in extracellular pH can occur within milliseconds and display regionally-specific characteristics. Alkalinizations typical of the hippocampal CA1 region can be broadly classified into two groups: One, where the pH change results from the efflux of bicarbonate, (typically across GABA-A anion channels) and a second, which is bicarbonate- independent. Use of membrane-impermeant inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase have revealed the presence of this enzyme in the interstitial compartment, and have demonstrated striking differences in the way the enzyme shapes each class of pH shift. Bicarbonate-dependent alkaline shifts are catalyzed by the carbonic anhydrase. By contrast, bicarbonate-independent alkalinizations are mitigated by this enzyme. Extracellular carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, such as benzolamide, have been used to amplify the bicarbonate-independent alkaline shifts to assess the modulatory role of these pH changes. Amplification of the alkaline shift was associated with specific enhancement of NMDA receptor- mediated EPSC's. Similar enhancement of these alkalinizations may account for other reported actions of this carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, such as slow potentiation of field potentials, increased frequency of seizure discharges, and an increase in the conduction velocity of spreading depression. In addition to passive physical-chemical buffering catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase, astrocytes play a role in the active regulation of these pH changes. Synchronous neuronal activity causes a large, rapid rise in astrocyte intracellular pH. This results from the action of an electrogenic sodium bicarbonate cotransporter that moves two bicarbonate ions inward per sodium ion. This process is triggered by the activity-dependent elevation of interstitial K+, which depolarizes the astrocyte, drives the inward movement of the cotransporter, thereby causing a rise in astrocyte intracellular pH, and the net efflux of acid. This acid efflux is an important determinant of the pH change in the interstitial space, as it opposes the rapid alkalinizations triggered by neuronal activity. Regional and developmental differences in the prominence of extracellular alkaline shifts may be due to the efficacy of this activity-dependent acid efflux from astrocytes. With prolonged activity, a persistent extracellular acidification is often noted. In hippocampus, this slow acid shift was attributed to the accumulation of CO2, but in other systems may have components attributable to conventional acid extruders such as Na-H exchange. These slow acid shifts may render tissue less excitable via the H+ block of NMDA receptors. In summary, complex changes in interstitial and intracellular pH are a fundamental property of neural tissue undergoing synchronous discharges. A variety of known and unknown mechanisms give rise to these pH shifts which in turn can significantly modulate the neuronal excitability. Chesler, M. & Kaila, K.

In both cases sequestered CO2 is made available at conditions suitable to storage into deep oceanic waters. Performances and cost of electricity are evaluated for systems based on large, heavy-duty turbines representative of state of the art ""FA"" technology. Carbon sequestration reduces net plant efficiency and power output by about 10% and increases the cost of electricity from 36 to about 50 mills/kWh. Flue gas recirculation warrants slightly higher efficiencies and lower costs. CO2 removal is eventually compared with other strategies for the reduction of CO2 emissions, like switching existing coal-fired steam plants to natural gas or replacing existing steam plants with conventional CCs. At current fuel prices the latter appears the option of choice, with a cost of about 25 $ per tonn of avoided CO2 emission.

When these aquatic cells grow in alkaline conditions, proton translocating ATP synthases in the plasma membrane operate in reverse, utilizing ATP to translocate protons against an electrochemical gradient to the periplasm and creating localized acidic regions along the cell's cylindrical surface. These acidic regions, which appear as radial bands, ~ 5 mm long, between narrower alkaline bands, facilitate the uptake of bicarbonate, the plant's source of inorganic carbon for photosynthesis in the carbon dioxide-depleted alkaline conditions. Our EIT study of cell ultrastructure in the acidic and alkaline regions provides evidence that the plasma membrane is folded in localized regions (e.g., charasomes) in the acidic bands. The very low frequency capacitance dispersions were very similar to those of double fixed-charge structures. Such charge distributions are known to be present in the membrane-bound F0 portion of the ATP synthase. The theoretical dependence of the fixed-charge concentrations on pH in the proteins is shown to broadly account for the observed correlations between pH, membrane potential, conductance, and capacitance in these regions. In synthetically formed double fixed charge membranes, electric field-induced dissociation of water into H+ and OH- occurs. This leads to the speculation that H+/OH- fluxes in ATP synthases located in the alkaline regions of Chara cells might also involve the electric field-induced dissociation of water.",,"adenosine triphosphate; bicarbonate; carbon; protein; proton; proton transporting adenosine triphosphate synthase; water; cell membrane; cell membrane potential; cell surface; cell ultrastructure; computer assisted impedance tomography; conductance; conference paper; cytology; cytoplasm; dissociation; electric field; electrochemistry; nonhuman; pH; photosynthesis; plant cell",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033053856

These approaches include combining of modern solar power conversion technology with newly developed, hydraulic-driven, pumping and energy recovery technology for brackish water and seawater desalting reverse osmosis (BWRO or SWRO) desalting. The study included a literature search of existing methods, preliminary concepting and assessment, technical analysis, and comparisons of water produced per quantity of solar energy insolation for various concepts. The hydraulic driven pumping and energy recovery system is known as the VARI-RO system (patent pending). Four new combinations of solar energy conversion and SWRO desalting systems were evaluated for comparison to existing methods, as follows: System A, solar photovoltaic-electric module with the VARI-RO electric motor drive; System B, solar dish concentrator-Stirling engine electric module with the VARI-RO electric motor drive; System C, solar trough concentrator-thermal energy module with the VARI-RO direct drive engine. System D, solar dish concentrator-thermal energy module with the VARI-RO direct drive engine. It was determined that the VARI-RO technology is uniquely suited for use with solar power because of (1) high efficiency of the pumping and energy recovery system, (2) high efficiency of the direct drive engine system, and (3) the capability to adjust the power consumption to match the solar power variations throughout the day. This study has shown that this solar powered desalination technology can provide substantial environmental benefits in the next century by supplying needed water to remote regions without extensive infrastructure, and also by reducing the environmental emissions (including CO2) for desalting saline water sources.","Desalination; Desalting; Energy saving; Environmental improvement; Reverse osmosis; Solar power; VARI-RO; Water shortages","desalination; reverse osmosis; solar power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033226661

This IDDI, associated with the 10-m wind speed reanalyses from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), reveals whether or not the observed dust is associated with emission from an underlying source. This result allows one to determine the wind speed thresholds for dust emission from targets located in the western, central, and eastern Saharan-Sahelian region, by means of satellite remote sensing. Threshold values determined for seven targets are presented. A comparison is carried out between such values and direct determinations obtained through the description of the soil texture and surface roughness of these targets. The agreement between these quite independent determinations is conclusive, with an average difference of 0.3 m s-1 and a rms difference of 0.35 m s-1.

Thermodynamics of self-association and hydrogen-bonded complexes of 7HQ in various nonpolar solvents was obtained by means of absorption, emission, and theoretical approaches. Specific hydrogen-bonding sites in the complex were determined by applying various derivatives of 7HQ incorporated with guest molecules possessing only either a proton-donating or -accepting site. The result can be qualitatively rationalized by a correlation of the hydrogen-bonding strength with respect to the donor's acidity and/or acceptor's basicity. In benzene, the 7HQ cyclic dimer undergoes a fast excited-state double proton-transfer reaction, resulting in a unique keto-tautomer emission. Surprisingly, however, the 1:1 7HQ(enol)/acetic acid complex possessing only a single hydrogen bond undergoes an excited-state double proton-transfer reaction, forming a keto/acid complex. As a result, a proton-transfer mechanism incorporating the rotational diffusion dynamics of guest molecules, i.e., acetic acid, is proposed. © 1999 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28044432570

Each of the genes is flanked by putative regulatory elements such as a termination stem-loop, promoter and ribosome-binding site, suggesting independent regulation. The finding of putative cis-active operator sequences, CRE (catabolite-responsive elements) suggests additional regulation by carbon catabolite repression. As described previously by the authors, both genes can be expressed in Escherichia coli under control of their own promoters. Two putative promoters are located upstream of glcA, and both were found to initiate transcription in E. coli. Although the two permeases EIICBA(Glc)1 and EIICBA(Glc)2 show 69% identity at the protein level, and despite the common primary substrate glucose, they have different specificities towards glucosides as substrate. EIICBA(Glc)1 phosphorylates glucose in a PEP-dependent reaction with a K(m) of 12 μM; the reaction can be inhibited by 2-deoxyglucose and methyl β-D-glucoside. EIICBA(Glc)2 phosphorylates glucose with a K(m) of 19 μM and this reaction is inhibited by methyl α-D-glucoside, methyl β-D-glucoside, p-nitrophenyl α-D-glucoside, o-nitrophenyl β-D-glucoside and salicin, but unlike other glucose permeases, including EIICBA(Glc)1, not by 2-deoxyglucose. Natural mono- or disaccharides, such as mannose or N-acetylglucosamine, that are transported by other glucose transporters are not phosphorylated by either EIICBA(Glc)1 nor EIICBA(Glc)2, indicating a high specificity for glucose. Together, these findings support the suggestion of evolutionary development of different members of a protein family, by gene duplication and subsequent differentiation. C-terminal fusion of a histidine hexapeptide to both gene products did not affect the activity of the enzymes and allowed their purification by Ni2+-NTA affinity chromatography after expression in a ptsG (EIICB(Glc)) deletion mutant of E. coli. Upstream of glcA, the 3' end of a further ORF encoding 138 amino acid residues of a putative antiterminator of the BgIG family was found, as well as a putative target DNA sequence (RAT), which indicates a further regulation by glucose specific antitermination.","Glucose-specific phosphotransferase system; Kinetics; Membrane protein; Regulation; Staphylococcus carnosus","deoxyglucose; glucose transporter; glucoside; mannose; n acetylglucosamine; permease; phosphoenolpyruvate; phosphotransferase; salicin; article; deletion mutant; DNA sequence; enzyme specificity; Escherichia coli; gene locus; genetic engineering; nonhuman; open reading frame; operator gene; priority journal; promoter region; sequence analysis; Staphylococcus carnosus; transcription initiation; Escherichia coli; Staphylococcus carnosus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032875349

In this process, the keys to obtaining a flat regrown layer and fine tunnel junctions are to keep from contaminating the surface during the lithography process before regrowth and to control the side-wall profile of the gate region in which tunnel junctions are formed. The carbon contamination can be reduced significantly by using a double hard mask consisting of Si3N4 and SiO2, and oxygen contamination can be removed by atomic hydrogen irradiation. The side-wall profile, that is etched surface morphology and side-wall angle, can be optimized by adjusting the composition of the H3PO4:H2O2:H2O etching solution.

Tropospheric ozone is globally increasing due to anthropogenic sources such as industrialization and biomass burning. In addition to its hazardous effects during pollution episodes, elevated levels of tropospheric ozone may have additional detrimental environmental effects due to ozone's crucial role in tropospheric chemistry and in global climate. Ground-based lidar instruments can play an important role in meeting this measurement need. We present test results for a prototype compact, minimal-cost ozone lidar.

In addition to local pollution monitoring, this lidar satisfies the basic requirements necessary for future global monitoring projects requiring multi-instrument networks, such as that proposed for the Global Tropospheric Ozone Project (GTOP).

In this mini-review the 'state of the art' of several fermentation processes is discussed, starting with the most advanced process of ethanol production. This is followed by methane production, an established process for waste water purification which is gaining more attention because of the inherent energy production. Subsequently ABE fermentation is discussed and finally the biological production of hydrogen. The last section proposes a new way to assess and compare the different processes by relating their merit to 'work content' values and 'lost work' instead of the combustion values of their products. It is argued that, especially when dealing with energy from biomass, the application of this methodology will provide a uniform valuation for different processes and products. The described fermentation processes enable the supply of pure energy carriers, either gaseous or liquid, from biomass, yet the introduction of these processes is hampered by two major problems. The first is related to technological shortcomings in the mobilisation of fermentable components from the biomass. The second, having a much greater impact, is linked with socio-economics: until full externality costs are attributed to fossil fuels, accounting for their role in pollution and global warming, the competitiveness of the processes described here will hardly stand a chance.",,"acetone; alcohol; butanol; hydrogen; lignocellulose; methanol; bioenergy; biomass; biotechnology; Clostridium; combustion; fermentation; Methanobacterium; nonhuman; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; short survey; Clostridium; Methanobacterium; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032693513

A Malaysian Fischer-Tropsch gas-to-liquid fuel was compared with California #2 diesel by characterizing emissions from over the road Class 8 tractors with Caterpillar 3176 engines, using a chassis dynamometer and full scale dilution tunnel. The 5-Mile route was employed as the test schedule, with a test weight of 42,000 lb. Levels of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) were reduced by an average of 12% and particulate matter (PM) by 25% for the Fischer-Tropsch fuel over the California diesel fuel. Another distillate fuel produced catalytically from Fischer-Tropsch products originally derived from natural gas by Mossgas was also compared with 49-state #2 diesel by characterizing emissions from Detroit Diesel 6V-92 powered transit buses, three of them equipped with catalytic converters and rebuilt engines, and three without. The CBD cycle was employed as the test schedule, with a test weight of 33,050 lb. For those buses with catalytic converters and rebuilt engines, NOx was reduced by 8% and PM was reduced by 31% on average, while for those buses without, NOx was reduced by 5% and PM was reduced by 20% on average. It is concluded that advanced compression ignition fuels from non-petroleum sources can offer environmental advantages in typical line haul and city transit applications.

Spark ignited lean burn natural gas fueled engines have found applications in transit buses, school buses and trucks. West Virginia University, through use of one of its Transportable Heavy Duty Vehicle Emissions Testing Laboratories, characterized the emissions of a fleet of school buses in Indio, Ca. The buses were powered by 8.3 liter Cummins natural gas engines employing feedback fueling control, and by conventional 8.3 liter diesel engines. The laboratory employs a chassis dynamometer with flywheels to mimic inertia and air-cooled eddy current power absorbers to account for road load. Exhaust was routed to a full scale dilution tunnel, and regulated gas emissions and particulate matter in the exhaust were measured. The vehicles were exercised through the Central Business District cycle during emissions characterization. Oxides of nitrogen emissions, by mass, were 12% lower for the 11 natural gas buses than for the three diesel control vehicles. Particulate matter was also lower, by 46%, but carbon monoxide for the natural gas busses was six times higher. Although the total hydrocarbons from the natural gas buses were far higher than from the diesel units, the bulk of the natural gas hydrocarbon emissions were methane, which is not an ozone forming species. The non-methane organic gases constituted only 5% of the hydrocarbon mass and were only twice that of the diesel hydrocarbon emissions. Since diesel vehicles are customarily targeted as particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen producers, the natural gas vehicles offer an attractive alternative to the diesel units.",,"Buses; Carbon monoxide; Diesel fuels; Dynamometers; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Exhaust gases; Gas emissions; Methane; Natural gas; Trucks; School buses; Gas engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342521612

Three of the buses were powered with 1997 ISB 5.9 liter Cummins diesel engines, and three were powered with the 1997 5.9 liter Cummins natural gas (NG) counterpart. The NG engines were LEV certified. Objectives were to contrast the emissions performance of the diesel and NG units, and to compare results from the two laboratories. Both laboratories found that oxides of nitrogen and particulate matter (PM) emissions were substantially lower for the natural gas buses than for the diesel buses. It was observed that by varying the rapidity of pedal movement during accelerations in the Central Business District cycle (CBD), CO and PM emissions from the diesel buses could be varied by a factor of three or more. The driving styles may be characterized as aggressive and non-aggressive, but both styles followed the CBD speed command acceptably. PM emissions were far higher for the aggressive driving style. For the NG fueled vehicles driving style had a similar, although smaller, effect on NOx. It is evident that driver habits may cause substantial deviation in emissions for the CBD cycle. When the CO emissions are used as a surrogate for driver aggression, a regression analysis shows that NOx and PM emissions from the two laboratories agree closely for equivalent driving style. Implications of driver habit for emissions inventories and regulations are briefly considered.

The data bank developed using these logging techniques was used to create a Yard cycle, a Freeway cycle and a City-Suburban cycle by the concatenation of microtrips. The City-Suburban driving cycle was converted to a driving route, in which the truck under test would perform at maximum acceleration during certain portions of the test schedule. This new route was used to characterize the emissions of a 1982 Ford tractor with a Cummins 14 liter, 350 hp engine and a 1998 International tractor with a Cummins 14 liter, 435 hp engine. Emissions levels were found to be repeatable with one driver and the driver-to-driver variation of NOx was under 4%, although the driver-to-driver variations of CO and PM were higher. Emissions levels of NOx for the Ford tractor at a test weight of 46,400 lb. using the CSHVR were comparable with values obtained using the WVU 5 mile route and the EPA Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule for Heavy Duty Vehicles (""Test D""). The PM emissions were slightly higher for the CSHVR than the 5 mile route and Test D. The effect of test weight on emissions, in units of mass/distance, was assessed using the International tractor with the CSHVR at 26,000, 36,000 and 46,400 lb. test weights. Variation of all regulated exhaust emissions was small between test weights, although the CO2 level reflected the additional energy used at higher weights. The small variation in regulated emissions may be attributed to the fact that in all three cases, the route called for full power operation of the vehicle, and that any PM puff associated with gear shifting would be similar. It is concluded that the CSHVR represents a useful and realistic test schedule for truck emissions characterization.

In addition, recent literature argues that submicron diesel PM is a pulmonary health hazard. There is difficulty in attributing PM emissions to specific operating modes of a diesel engine, although it is acknowledged that PM production rises dramatically with load and that high PM emissions occur during rapid load increases on turbocharged engines. Snap-acceleration tests generally identify PM associated with rapid transient operating conditions, but not with high load. To quantify the origin of PM during transient engine operation, continuous opacity measurements have been made using a Wager 650CP full flow exhaust opacity meter. Opacity measurements were taken while the vehicles were operated over transient driving cycles on a chassis dynamometer using the West Virginia University (WVU) Transportable Heavy Duty Vehicle Emissions Testing Laboratories. Data were gathered from Detroit Diesel, Cummins, Caterpillar, and Navistar heavy-duty (HD) diesel engines. Driving cycles used were the Central Business District (CBD) cycle, the WVU 5-Peak Truck cycle, the WVU 5-Mile route, and the New York City Bus (NYCB) cycle. Continuous opacity measurements, integrated over the entire driving cycle, were compared to total integrated PM mass. In addition, the truck was subjected to repeat snap-acceleration tests, and PM was collected for a composite of these snap-acceleration tests. Additional data were obtained from a fleet of 1996 New Flyer buses in Flint, MI, equipped with electronically controlled Detroit Diesel Series 50 engines. Again, continuous opacity, regulated gaseous emissions, and PM were measured. The relationship between continuous carbon monoxide (CO) emissions and continuous opacity was noted. In identifying the level of PM emissions in transient diesel engine operation, it is suggested that CO emissions may prove to be a useful indicator and may be used to apportion total PM on a continuous basis over a transient cycle. The projected continuous PM data will prove valuable in future mobile source inventory prediction. © 1999 Air and Waste Management Association.",,"carbon monoxide; air analysis; air monitoring; ambient air; article; exhaust gas; particulate matter; pollution transport; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032853294

Although most incinerators have or will soon be retrofitted with modern equipment designs, this does not ensure that emissions are optimized at all times. Operation of equipment related to combustion and emissions control can greatly affect emissions, but MACT standards specifically exclude times when an incinerator is in start-up or shut-down mode, or when upset conditions occur.

Planar and single-photon-emission tomography images of the head were obtained 2-4 and 24 hours after the injection of 77-103 MBq of 111In-DTPA-D-Phe1-octreotide and pituitary uptake was measured by the region of interest method. A 4 point score was used to grade the pituitary-to-blood (T-to-B) ratios: 0 = negative; 1 = faint (T-to-B = &lt; 1.5); 2 = moderate (T-to-B = 1.6-3.5); 3 = intense (T-to-B = &gt; 3.5). In patients with pituitary adenomas, the percent suppression of GH and α-subunit levels after 6-12 months of octreotide treatment (0.3-0.6 mg/day) was correlated to T-to-B ratios. After 2-4 hr from injection, pituitary 111In-DTPA-D-Phe1-octreotide uptake was moderate/intense in 2 out of 49 SS-ET (4%), 18 out of 29 acromegalics (62%) and 6 NFA (66.6%), while a faint uptake was detected in 4 SS-ET (8%), 8 GH-secreting adenomas (27.5%) and 3 NFA (33.3%). Negative scan was detected in the remaining 43 SS-ET (87.7%) and 3 GH-secreting microadenomas (10.3%). 24 hr after injection, pituitary 111In-DTPA-D-Phe1-octreotide uptake was moderate/intense in SS-ET (10.2%), 21 GH-secreting adenomas (72.4%), and 9 NFA (100%) while a faint uptake was detectable in 15 SS-ET (30.6%), and 6 GH-secreting adenomas (20.7%). No uptake was visualized in 29 SS-ET, and 2 GH-secreting adenomas. By MRI a pituitary tumor was shown in the 2 SS-ET with early moderate tracer uptake. Normalization of circulating GH/IGF-I levels and suppression of α-subunit levels was achieved in 16 of 18 acromegalics (88.9%) and 5 of 6 NFA-bearing patients, respectively, with scan scored 2-3 at early images. Eleven acromegalics (37.9%) and 2 NFA (22.2%) displayed significant tumor shrinkage (≥ 30% of baseline size) during long-term octreotide therapy. Both in GH-secreting and in NFA, a significant correlation was found between percent GH or α-subunit suppression after 6-12 months of octreotide therapy and T-to-B ratios both in early (r = 0.626; p &lt; 0.0001 and r = 0.738, p = 0.003, respectively) and late images (r = 0.569; p = 0.002 and r = 0.8, p = 0.01, respectively). In conclusion, the 111In-DTPA-D-Phe1-octreotide uptake in pituitary adenomas was significantly correlated to octreotide treatment. However, since pituitary 111In-DTPA-D-Phe1-octreotide uptake was clearly detectable in 40% of patients with SS-ET not located in the pituitary region at 24 hr post-injection, 111In-DTPA-D-Phe1-octreotide scintigraphy with late pituitary images can not be considered an useful method to predict the chronic responsiveness to octreotide in individual patients. Caution should also be taken in evaluating the results of the scintigraphy with early images in patients with scant uptake before excluding them from treatment.","CH; Neuroendocrine tumors; Octreotide; Pituitary adenomas; Somatostatin; Somatostatin receptors","growth hormone; octreotide; pentetate indium in 111; prolactin; somatomedin C; diagnostic agent; drug derivative; indium; octreotide; pentetic acid; radiopharmaceutical agent; SDZ 215 811; SDZ 215-811; acromegaly; adolescent; adult; aged; article; cancer regression; carcinoid; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drug blood level; drug uptake; female; growth hormone release; human; hypophysis adenoma; insulinoma; kidney carcinoma; major clinical study; male; melanoma; neuroendocrine tumor; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; scintigraphy; single photon emission computer tomography; subcutaneous drug administration; thymoma; thyroid carcinoma; adenoma; hypophysis; hypophysis tumor; metabolism; middle aged; scintiscanning; Adenoma; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Indium Radioisotopes; Male; Middle Aged; Octreotide; Pentetic Acid; Pituitary Gland; Pituitary Neoplasms; Radiopharmaceuticals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032586754

The injector is hydraulically actuated, electronically controlled, and employs local fuel pressure intensification. The DHOS injector utilizes a digital valve developed by Sturman Industries, Inc. The main advantages of the digital valve over a conventional solenoid include high speed, increased energy efficiency, inherent feedback, and small package size. The digital valve consists of a spool, two electromagnetic coils, and the valve housing. The spool is pulled towards the open or closed position by attractive magnetic forces produces by the open or closed coil respectively. The valve is faster than a typical solenoid primarily because it does not have to work against a mechanical spring. Furthermore, once in position, the valve requires no additional energy but instead uses residual magnetism to stay latched in position. In addition, the digital valve's two-coil design allows for the monitoring of back-EMF signals which can be used for position sensing. In order to meet the demands of the diesel industry and emissions regulation community, injectors must be able to consistently control specific rate of injection (ROI) characteristics. The DHOS injector can electronically control the start, duration, and rate of injection of multiple injection events. The DHOS injector meets the shot-to-shot and injector-to-injector consistency required by the industry. The primary purpose of this paper is to present the design and advantages of the digital valve. In addition, the versatility of the DHOS injector and empirical results are presented.

Each received pulse showed early identifiable timefronts, followed by about 2 s of highly variable energy. For the identifiable timefronts, observations of travel-time variance, average pulse shape, and the probability density function (PDF) of intensity are presented, and calculations of internal-wave contributions to those fluctuations are compared to the observations. Individual timefronts have rms travel time fluctuations of 11 to 19 ms, with time scales of less than 2 h. The pulse time spreads are between 0 and 5.3 ms rms, which suggest that internal-wave- induced travel-time biases are of the same magnitude. The PDFs of intensity for individual ray arrivals are compared to log-normal and exponential distributions. The observed PDFs are closer to the log-normal distribution, and variances of log intensity are between (3.1 dB)2 (with a scintillation index of 0.74) for late-arriving timefronts and (2.0 dB)2 (with a scintillation index of 0.2) for the earliest timefronts. Fluctuations of the pulse termination time of the transmissions are observed to be 22 ms rms. The intensity PDF of nonidentified peaks in the pulse crescendo are closer to a log-normal distribution than an exponential distribution, but a Kolmogorov- Smirnov test rejects both distributions. The variance of the nonidentified peaks is (3.5dB)2 and the scintillation index is 0.92. As a group, the observations suggest that the propagation is on the border of the unsaturated and partially saturated regimes. After improving the specification of the ray weighting function, predictions of travel-time variance using the Garrett- Munk (GM) internal-wave spectrum at one-half the reference energy are in good agreement with the observations, and the one-half GM energy level compares well with XBT data taken along the transmission path. Predictions of pulse spread and wave propagation regime are in strong disagreement with the observations. Pulse time spread estimates are nearly two orders of magnitude too large, and Λ-Φ methods for predicting the wave propagation regime predict full saturation.",,"acoustics; wave propagation; acoustics; mathematical analysis; nonhuman; oceanic regions; priority journal; review; sound intensity; sound transmission; waveform; Pacific Ocean",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032970462

IR spectroscopy of CO adsorbed at low temperature on Al2O3-TiO2 samples suggests an enrichment of TiO2 on the catalyst surface. The IR spectra of the calcined (at 773 K) V2O5(12 wt.%)/Al2O3-TiO2 sample exhibits two kinds of vanadium species, monomeric tetrahedral V5+ = O species (band at 1035 cm-1) and an amorphous VO(x) monolayer phase (band at 1002 cm-1). CO adsorption at low temperature on this sample shows the presence of V4+ ← CO carbonyl species (band at 2197 cm-1). As reported in the literature no V5+ carbonyl species are observed. Reduction of the V2O5(12 wt.%)/Al2O3-TiO2 sample at 773 K induces a rearrangement of the amorphous VO(x) phase, as indicated by the disappearance of the band at 1002 cm-1. Reduced vanadium species, mainly V3+ species, were observed by CO adsorption at low temperature. This V3+ ← CO carbonyl complex (monitored by a band at 2185 cm-1) is highly resistant to evacuation which suggests some π-back donation. The V3+ species are highly stable towards reoxidation at low temperature. Reoxidation at room temperature leads to a restoration of the V5+ and V4+ species as observe in the oxidized samples. Only a small amount of V3-+ species can not be completely oxidized remaining in an oxidation state of 4+. Hence, two bands at 2197 and 2194 cm- 1 were observed and assigned to two different V4+ Lewis acid sites.",,"aluminum oxide; carbon monoxide; titanium dioxide; vanadium derivative; adsorption; article; catalysis; complex formation; infrared spectroscopy; molecular dynamics; oxidation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033564266

The distribution patterns suggest that long-range transport, probably by global distillation, occurred with these substances. Endosulfan residues appear significant in areas of usage but the data are limited. The data are in accord with a reduction in usage of chlorohydrocarbons in developed countries, but an increase in usage in many tropical countries. A systematic comparison of data on the northern and southern hemispheres indicates that the northern hemisphere is generally more contaminated than the southern hemisphere. It also suggests that the process of equilibration between the two hemispheres is relatively slow. In addition, with the HCBs there is an equatorial to polar gradation in concentration probably as a result of global distillation. With the HCHs relatively high concentrations exist in the tropics, probably due to their heavy usage in these regions. With the HCBs, DDTs, and PCBs the concentrations appear to be more localized in relation to the sources because these substances are less volatile than the compounds mentioned previously.","Chlorohydrocarbons; Endosulfan; Global contamination; Global distillation; Persistent lipophilic contaminants; Pesticides; Southern hemisphere","Chlorohydrocarbons; Endosulfan; Persistent lipophilic contaminants; Chlorine compounds; Distillation; Environmental impact; Hydrocarbons; Impurities; Pesticides; Environmental protection; chlorinated hydrocarbon; chlorphenotane; lindane; polychlorinated biphenyl; pollution; Southern Hemisphere; air pollutant; air pollution; developed country; distillation; environmental impact assessment; environmental protection; lipophilicity; pollution transport; review; sediment; soil pollution; tropics; water pollution",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032965823

X-ray diffraction patterns of samples with increasing dye loading showed that Cl-/MO- exchange occurs with a first-order phase transition from the Cl- phase (interlayer distance 7.74 angstrom) to the MO phase with an interlayer distance of 24.2 angstrom. A sample of composition [Zn0.67Al0.33(OH)2][MO0.31 Cl0.02]·0.85H2O has been studied by thermogravimetric analysis and by X-ray powder diffraction at different temperatures. The loss of hydration water between 80 and 120°C causes a decrease of the interlayer distance from 24.2 to 21.5 angstrom. Computer models and calculations based on the structure of the host showed that MO anions are arranged in the interlayer space as a monolayer of species with the main axis perpendicular to the layer plane. Emission fluorescence spectra of the dye only exchanged on the external surface of the host or intercalated, at different loading, were compared with the fluorescence spectra of MO as microcrystals or dissolved in ethanol. By changing the experimental conditions, MO fluorescence emission can cover the whole visible wavelength range. The spectrum in ethanolic solution, λmax = 480 nm, is at the highest energies, while that of microcrystals is shifted toward the red (λmax = 690 nm). The fluorescence of MO-intercalated samples is near that of microcrystalline methyl orange but shifted at higher energies. A further shift is observed for the sample containing only surface-exchanged MO. The energy difference between the fluorescence spectra of the MO in different environments has been attributed to the change of the emitting state energy caused by interactions of the excited species with neighboring unexcited species. The fluorescence measurements can thus be considered a valuable tool for studying the microenvironment of the dye.",,"Chemical modification; Computer simulation; Crystal structure; Dyes; Fluorescence; Hydration; Ion exchange; Negative ions; Phase transitions; Spectrum analysis; X ray powder diffraction; Zinc compounds; Emission fluorescence spectra; Hydrotalcite; Methyl orange; Microcrystals; Photophysical characterization; Intercalation compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032655144

The chemical composition (i.e. N, P, C, lignin and polyphenol concentrations) of Quercus pubescens leaf litter derived from a natural CO2 spring in Tuscany (Italy) was analysed and compared to litter from a nearby reference site. Litter was incubated for 25 months at both the natural CO2 spring and the reference site, and monitored for decomposition rates, nutrient and lignin concentrations. 2. Long-term exposure to elevated CO2 concentrations from the natural spring was associated with a change in the chemical composition of the Oak leaf litter, with decreases in P and polyphenol concentrations and increases in lignin. No differences in N concentrations were observed between the enriched CO2 litter from the natural spring and the reference litter. 3. Decomposition was reduced in the CO2 spring, with the lower P concentration of the native litter, combined with the lack of soil fauna observed at that site, being the factors most probably responsible for the measured decreases in mass loss. However, litter from the CO2 spring and reference litter decomposed at the reference site showed similar rates of decomposition. 4. All litter showed similar N concentrations during decomposition, with N being mineralized throughout the incubation period from both litter regardless of the site of incubation. In contrast, P dynamics differed between litter, with P being immobilized in the litter derived from the spring, and mineralized from the reference litter. When the litter from the spring was incubated at the reference site, there was a trend for net P uptake from the surrounding environment. The chemical composition of decomposing litter from the spring appeared to match that of the reference litter after 3 months of incubation at the reference site. 5. The results from the CO2 spring suggest that litter decomposition may be retarded under elevated levels of atmospheric CO2. However, results from field surveys around CO2 vents should be viewed with caution because differences may relate to factors other than the known differences in CO2 concentrations.","CO2 spring; Lignin; Litter decomposition; Nitrogen; Phosphorus","carbon dioxide; determination of content; italy; lignin; litter decomposition; mineralization; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; nutrient; phosphorus; polyphenol; chemical composition; decomposition; leaf litter; nutrient dynamics; Mediterranean Region; Quercus pubescens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032810489

By means of measurements performed on AlGaAs/GaAs power HFETs in a wide range of temperatures, we show that: 1) At relatively low drain-gate voltage, the gate current comes from thermionic-field emission. .2) As we approach off-state breakdown, impact ionization of electrons accelerated by the large drain-gate field becomes the dominant mechanism originating the gate current. 3) For even higher values of the drain-gate volt- age, both electrons and holes possibly ionize, and the drain-gate diode avalanches.

The limited data currently available suggest that the effect of increased atmospheric CO2 on herbivory will be not only highly species-specific but also specific to each insect-plant system. Several scenarios can be predicted, however: (1) local extinctions will occur; (2) the endangered species status as well as the pest status of some insect species will change; (3) geographic distributions for some insect species will shift with host-plant ranges; and (4) changes in the population dynamics of affected insect species will influence their interactions with other insects and plants. For insect conservation purposes, it is critical to begin long-term studies on the effects of enhanced CO2 levels on insect populations. An analysis of the available literature indicates that many orders containing insect species important for ecosystem conservation, and even those important as agricultural or medical pests, have not been examined. Without a major increase in research on this topic, we will be unprepared for the species changes that will occur, we will lose the opportunity to document just how some insects adapt to elevated CO2 levels, and we will lack the information necessary for effective conservation efforts.",,"carbon dioxide enrichment; larval development; mortality; plant-insect interaction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032774071

These studies tend not to include factors, such as photosynthesis, that affect the supply of carbon substrates to roots and root-associated processes. We examined the role of decreased carbohydrate source on soil CO2 flux and root respiration in an annually-burned grassland through manipulations of light intensity and removal of above ground biomass. We also quantified the contribution of root respiration to soil CO2 flux by measuring the respiration rates of excised roots. Two days of shading caused a 40% reduction in soil CO2 flux, while clipping was associated with a 19% reduction in soil CO2 flux. Both reductions were independent of soil and air temperature at the time of measurement. The relative decrease in soil CO2 flux observed in the clipping experiment was similar in magnitude to an observed decrease in root respiration per gram of root, linking decreased root activity and soil CO2 flux. From these experiments, we conclude that variation in factors that affect carbon availability to roots can be important determinants of soil CO2 flux and should be included explicitly in studies that measure or model soil CO2 flux.","Cedar Creek; Light; Minnesota; Root respiration; Scizachyrium scorparium; Soil CO2 flux; Temperature","biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; ecophysiology; ecosystem approach; grassland; Minnesota; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032441942

This new compound, named DOTATOC, has shown high affinity for somatostatin receptors, ease of labelling and stability with yttrium-90 and favourable biodistribution in animal models. The aim of this work was to evaluate the biodistribution and dosimetry of DOTATOC radiolabelled with indium-111, in anticipation of therapy trials with 90Y-DOTATOC in patients. Eighteen patients were injected with DOTATOC (10 μg), labelled with 150-185 MBq of 111In. Blood and urine samples were collected throughout the duration of the study (0-2 days). Planar and single-photon emission tomography images were acquired at 0.5, 3-4, 24 and 48 h and time-activity curves were obtained for organs and tumours. A compartmental model was used to determine the kinetic parameters for each organ. Dose calculations were performed according to the MIRD formalism. Specific activities of &gt; 37 GBq/ μmol were routinely achieved. Patients showed no acute or delayed adverse reactions. The residence time for 111In-DOTATOC in blood was 0.9 ± 0.4 h. The injected activity excreted in the urine in the first 24 h was 73% ± 11%. The agent localized primarily in spleen, kidneys and liver. The residence times in source organs were: 2.2 ± 1.8 h in spleen, 1.7 ± 1.2 h in kidneys, 2.4 ± 1.9 h in liver, 1.5 ± 0.3 h in urinary bladder and 9.4 ± 5.5 h in the remainder of the body: the mean residence time in tumour was 0.47 h (range: 0.03-6.50 h). Based on our findings, the predicted absorbed doses for 90Y-DOTATOC would be 7.6 ± 6.3 (spleen), 3.3 ± 2.2 (kidneys), 0.7 ± 0.6 (liver), 2.2 ± 0.3 (bladder), 0.03 ± 0.01 (red marrow) and 10.1 (range: 1.4-31.0) (tumour) mGy/MBq. These results indicate that high activities of 90Y-DOTATOC can be administered with low risk of myelotoxicity, although with potentially high radiation doses to the spleen and kidneys. Tumour doses were high enough in most cases to make it likely that the disired therapeutic response desired would be obtained.","90Y/111In-DOTATOC; Dosimetry; Peptides","dotatoc; indium 111; octreotide[3 tyrosine]; phenylalanine; somatostatin; somatostatin receptor; unclassified drug; yttrium 90; adult; aged; article; binding affinity; bladder; blood; bone marrow; bone marrow toxicity; cancer radiotherapy; clinical article; compartment model; dosimetry; drug absorption; human; human cell; isotope labeling; kidney; kinetics; liver; mean residence time; radiation dose; radioactivity; single photon emission computer tomography; spleen; urinalysis; Adult; Aged; Humans; Indium Radioisotopes; Middle Aged; Octreotide; Radiation Dosage; Radiopharmaceuticals; Receptors, Somatostatin; Tissue Distribution; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon; Yttrium Radioisotopes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032764336

Of the 23 supraglottic tumors treated, 16 had no signs of recurrence to date (1.5 to 9 years after surgery) a local control rate of 70%. Six patients with recurrences underwent salvage therapies that included repeated laser excisions (n = 3), radiotherapy (to 60 Gy), horizontal supraglottic laryngectomy and total laryngectomy. One patient was not resectable because of multiple metastases. Our experience with endolaryngeal CO2 laser excision indicates that it is a reasonable method in selected cases of supraglottic tumors, but one-third of the patients required salvage treatment.","Endoscopic CO2 laser surgery; Supraglottic cancer; Supraglottic laryngectomy","article; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; carbon dioxide laser; endoscopic surgery; glottis; human; Hungary; laryngectomy; larynx carcinoma; laser surgery; major clinical study; metastasis; priority journal; reoperation; retrospective study; treatment outcome; Carbon Dioxide; Carcinoma; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypopharyngeal Neoplasms; Laryngoscopy; Laser Surgery; Retrospective Studies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032872531

The orbital-dependent LDA + U potential (LDA ≡ local density approximation) used in the present work gives rise to an improved description both of the electronic structure near the energy gap and of the optical functions. Attention has been mainly focused on the effects caused by the local lattice relaxation around the defects. For compositions that deviate from the stoichiometric SiC towards higher content of carbon atoms, the small reduction of the energy gap which is observed experimentally can be explained only if the lattice relaxation is taken into account. The local electronic structure of antisite defects is characterized by s- and p-like resonance states in the valence band. Strong resonances occur also in the conduction band (especially for CSi). The Sic (CSi) antisite has more (fewer) valence electrons localized in the atomic sphere than the official Si (C) atom, but this difference is considerably reduced by the lattice relaxation. The results of the calculations show how the presence of point defects modifies the shape of the optical functions of the perfect SiC crystal and how the lattice relaxation has a strong effect on the fine structure of the optical functions. Different kinds of defect lead to different shapes of the optical functions. © 1999 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Crystal atomic structure; Crystal defects; Electron resonance; Electronic structure; Energy gap; Optical properties; Relaxation processes; Lattice relaxation; Silicon carbide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032632042

The strong correlation between dissolved cadmium and phosphorus concentrations in sea water has nevertheless been exploited for reconstructing past nutrient distributions in the ocean. In culture experiments, the addition of cadmium accelerates the growth of some marine phytoplankton and increases the activity of carbonic anhydrase, normally a zinc-based metalloenzyme that is involved in inorganic carbon acquisition. Here we show that the concentration of a Cd-carbonic-anhydrase-distinct from Zn-carbonic-anhydrases-in a marine diatom is regulated by the CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) as well as by the zinc concentration. Field studies in intensely productive coastal waters off central California demonstrate that cadmium content in natural phytoplankton populations similarly increases as surface-water pCO2 decreases. Incubation experiments confirm that cadmium uptake by natural phytoplankton is inversely related to seawater pCO2 and zinc concentration. We thus propose that biological removal of cadmium from ocean surface waters is related to its utilization in carbonic anhydrase, and is regulated by dissolved CO2 and zinc concentrations. The dissolved seawater Cd/P ratio would therefore vary with atmospheric pCO2, complicating the use of cadmium as a tracer of past nutrient concentrations in the upper ocean.",,"cadmium; carbon dioxide; sea water; surface water; cadmium; phytoplankton; seawater; alga; article; correlation function; marine environment; nonhuman; phytoplankton; priority journal; seashore; United States; algae; Bacillariophyta; Nitzschia alba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033547379

One of the defining traits of the climate change issue internationally relates to the different contributions of different groups of countries to anthropogenic emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) and the different capacity to respond to the challenge posed through mitigating activities. Developed countries have thus contributed about two-thirds of cumulative carbon emissions between 1800 and 1988, while the share emitted by developing countries is expected to rise significantly over the next few decades. This article focuses on the integration of flexibility mechanisms into the overall structure of the climate change regime. More specifically, it examines ways in which flexibility mechanisms can both contribute to climate change mitigation and to sustainable development, taking into account the common but differentiated responsibilities of state parties. It argues that strict guidelines must be laid down to ensure that flexibility mechanisms foster environmental and socio-economic goals.",,"climate change; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; international agreement",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032745393

The earlier Conventions on Climate Change had failed because sovereign states placed national economic interest before the collective wellbeing of current and future generations. The Kyoto Treaty however, contains the first legally binding reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions. It provides innovative measures called ""flexibility instruments"" which are designed to share the burden of reversing global warming among the 174 nations. These include joint implementation, emission trading, and a new clean development mechanism to encourage greater use of sustainable energy in developing countries. Despite great opportunities, the protocol has yet to be ratified because a number of nations are still jostling for competitive advantage. The strength of the treaty will depend on the commitment of its signatories, and the success of future negotiations in dealing with unresolved issues. This article examines some of the aspects arising from the Kyoto Treaty including an international emission trading scheme, and carbon sequestration in terrestrial sinks. Australia's overall position on climate change is explored, with the need for a much broader view highlighted. This article shows that Australia has more to lose if global warming is not reversed, and suggests a rethink on the possible advantages as well as the perceived costs. It will argue that Australia's protection of the fossil fuel industry, while important, should not be pursued to the detriment of long term benefits for the environment andfuture export markets for cleaner energies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0005435210

The process of moving towards equilibrium consists essentially of a densification of the matter and follows complex paths deriving from its inherent non-linear and non-exponential character. The structural relaxation is observable in a laboratory time-scale at temperatures below but close to Tg, and is related to the durability of polymeric materials because it is characterized by changes of structure-sensitive properties until equilibrium is approached. Polymer-based composites suffer the same shortcoming even if the properties are fiber-dominated. In this paper sub-Tg annealing studies have been carried out with both plain PEI and its carbon-fiber composites in order to observe the kinetics of structural relaxation. The experimental technique used is differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), which measures the enthalpy recovery during the structural relaxation. The investigation regarding the plain resin consisted of aging treatments at Tg-10°C, Tg-20°C and Tg-30°C, for different annealing times ranging between 0 and 168 h. The experimental data were used to calculate the parameters of a long-term predictive model for the enthalpy relaxation based on the Narayanaswamy approach. The structural relaxation of the in situ resin (i.e. the resin constrained into the fibers lattice) was also investigated at Tg-20°C taking into account the marked decrease of the glass transition temperature resulting from the overall manufacturing process. The comparison between the plain and the in situ matrix was done on the basis of the same degree of undercooling (i.e. the same distance from Tg). It was found that the composite aged faster than the plain matrix. The macroscopic effects of structural relaxation on PEI based composites were analyzed by fatigue tests in four-point bending geometry at different level of stress ratio R (the ratio of the minimum to the maximum stress). The aged samples showed a higher characteristic strength, which resulted in a correspondingly higher fatigue life compared to the as manufactured materials. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Annealing; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Differential scanning calorimetry; Enthalpy; Glass transition; Mathematical models; Relaxation processes; Narayanaswamy method; Structural relaxation; Nonmetallic matrix composites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033206786

The very efficient oxygen scavenging capability of carbon led to higher initial activities and turnover frequencies on Cu/C catalysts compared to Cu/ZSM-5; however, rapid gasification of the carbon support limited the lifetime of these Cu/C catalysts. Very low decomposition activity was exhibited by Cu/Al2O3 and Cu/SiO2 at temperatures below 823 K; however, addition of CO or H2 to the reactor feed stream significantly lowered the temperatures required to achieve catalytic N2O reduction. With all catalysts, the temperature at which the product ratio in the effluent stream stabilized near the stoichiometric ratio of O2/N2 (or CO2/N2) = 1/2 was found to correspond to that at which O2 either desorbs or is removed by carbon.

Different kinetic rate expressions, derived from sequences of elementary steps appropriate for each catalyst, fit the data well for N2O decomposition on Cu/ZSM-5 and Cu/Al2O3 as well as N2O reduction by carbon and CO, and they yielded meaningful values for enthalpies and entropies of adsorption for N2O, O2 and CO.","CO on Cu; Cu catalysts; DRIFTS; N2O decomposition; N2O reduction","Catalyst deactivation; Catalysts; Copper; Decomposition; Reaction kinetics; Reduction; Spectrum analysis; Stoichiometry; Catalytic cycle; Kinetic rate expressions; Nitrogen compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033588805

Significant enhancement in selectivity toward crotyl alcohol was observed with each catalyst after reduction at 773 K. DRIFT spectra under reaction conditions identified crotonaldehyde species strongly adsorbed through the C=C bond and weakly coordinated through both the C=C and the C=O bonds on these catalysts after reduction at 573 K, which gave a peak at 1693 cm-1. After reduction at 773 K, an additional adsorbed species with a strong band at 1660 cm-1, indicating a significant interaction between the carbonyl group and the surface, was observed, which is presumed to be stabilized at interfacial Pt-TiOx and Ni-TiOx sites. A decrease in the surface coverage of this species paralleled a drop in selectivity to crotyl alcohol with time on stream. After reduction at 573 K, decarbonylation occurred during the initial few minutes on stream to create adsorbed CO on Pt/TiO2 in addition to carbon deposition, but these reactions were significantly suppressed after reduction at 773 K, presumably due to a TiOx overlayer which covers part of the Pt surface and breaks up the ensembles of Pt atoms required for these reactions. © 1999 Academic Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001349796

It is striking to note that the evolution of upper Miocene carbonate ramps, characterized by the presence of coralgal bioherms, highlights the events leading to the Messinian salinity crisis. The coralgal bioherms of pre-evaporite Messinian age exhibit fossil assemblages indicating marine waters with normal salinity, whereas stromatolitic and microbial encrustations underline the deterioration of the environment during the Messinian salinity crisis. Maiella Mountain is a broad carbonate massif located in Abruzzo (Central Italy). The late lower Oligocene-Messinian part of its stratigraphic succession consists of stacked non-tropical carbonate ramp deposits related to third and higher order sequences. The investigations performed in the southernmost portion of the massif allowed to recognize a complete fourth order carbonate depositional sequence on a homoclinal ramp of pre-evaporite Messinian age. The presence of small coralgal patch reefs and overlaying microbial encrustations is significant. A transect exhibits the stratigraphic framework of the area. The data show how local parameters play a notable role in the development of these deposits.","Coralgal reefs; Late Miocene; Maiella Mountain (Central Italy); Non-tropical carbonate ramps","carbonate ramp; facies; Miocene; paleoenvironment; reef; Abruzzo; Italy; Maiella Mountains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033498588

Methane production in anoxic paddy soil slurries was stimulated by the addition of rice straw, of unsterile or autoclaved rice roots, and of the culture fluid in which rice plants had axenically been cultivated. The addition of these compounds also increased the concentrations of acetate and H2, precursors of CH4 production, in the soil. Planted compared to unplanted paddy soil microcosms exhibited lower porewater CH4 concentrations but higher CH4 emission rates. They also exhibited higher sulfate concentrations but similar nitrate concentrations. Concentrations of acetate, lactate and H2 were not much different between planted and unplanted microcosms. Pulse labeling of rice plants with 14CO2 resulted during the next 5 days in transient accumulation of radioactive lactate, propionate and acetate, and after the second day of incubation in the emission of 14CH4. Most of the radioactivity (40-70%) was incorporated into the aboveground biomass of rice plants. However, during a total incubation of 16 days about 3-6% of the applied radioactivity was emitted as 14CH4, demonstrating that plant-derived carbon was metabolized and significantly contributed to CH4 production. The sequence of the appearance of radioactive products and their specific radioactivities indicate that CH4 was produced from root exudates by a microbial community consisting of fermenting and methanogenic bacteria.","Acetate; Hydrogen; Photosynthates, 14C pulse labeling; Root exudation; Sulfate","methane; rice; soil emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032967599

An attempt to meet up the challenge has been made in the present paper in developing a computational model based on stochastic separated flow analysis of a typical diffusion controlled spray combustion of liquid fuel in a gas turbine combustor to study the influences of combustor pressure and inlet swirl on the combustion and emission characteristics within the combustor. A standard k-ε model with wall function treatment for near wall region has been adopted for the solution of conservation equations in gas phase. The initial spray parameters are specified by a suitable PDF size distribution and a given spray cone angle. A radiation model for the gas phase, based on first order moment method, has been adopted in consideration of the gas phase as a grey absorbing-emitting medium. Formation of thermal NOx, as a post combustion reaction process, is determined from Zeldovich mechanism. It has been recognized that an increase in swirl number reduces the NOx emission level and improves the pattern factor at all combustor pressures. However, though at lower pressure an increase in swirl number reduces combustion efficiency, the trend is exactly the reverse at higher pressure. With increase in pressure, pattern factor improves while the combustion efficiency falls and the level of NOx emission increases.",,"Combustion; Diffusion; Gas turbines; Liquid fuels; Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Numerical methods; Particulate emissions; Pressure; Temperature distribution; Diffusion controlled spray combustion; Radiation model; Solution of conservation equations; Swirl conditions; Zeldovich mechanism; Combustors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032638980

Fine vertical scale (0.25- and 0.5-m depth intervals) and horizontal plume-scale (>400 m) characteristics of the plume were mapped over a 5-year period from 1991 to 1996. The plume of dissolved BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) and other organic compounds originated from leakage of gasoline from a subsurface fuel storage tank. The plume was up to 420 m long, less than 50 m wide and 3 m thick. In the first few years of monitoring, BTEX concentrations near the point of leakage were in approximate equilibrium with non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) gasoline. NAPL composition of core material and long-term trends in ratios of BTEX concentrations in groundwater indicated significant depletion (water washing, volatilisation and possibly biodegradation) of benzene from residual NAPL after 1992. Large fluctuations in BTEX concentrations in individual boreholes were shown to be largely attributable to seasonal groundwater flow variations. A combination of temporal and spatial groundwater quality data was required to adequately assess the stationarity of plumes, so as to allow inference of intrinsic remediation. Contoured concentration data for the period 1991 to 1996 indicated that plumes of toluene and o-xylene were, at best, only partially steady state (pseudo-steady state) due to seasonal groundwater flow changes. From this analysis, it was inferred that significant remediation by natural biodegradation was occurring for BTEX component plumes such as toluene and o-xylene, but provided no conclusive evidence of benzene biodegradation. Issues associated with field quantification of intrinsic remediation from groundwater sampling are highlighted. Preferential intrinsic biodegradation of selected organic compounds within the BTEX plume was shown to be occurring, in parallel with sulphate reduction and bicarbonate production. Ratios of average hydrocarbon concentrations to benzene for the period 1991 to 1992 were used to estimate degradation rates (half-lives) at various distances along the plume. The estimates varied with distance, the narrowest range being, for toluene, 110 to 260 days. These estimates were comparable to rates determined previously from an in situ tracer test and from plume-scale modelling.

At this temperature the conformation of the enzyme remains essentially unaltered during reduction, so the mixed- valent EPR spectra serve to probe the active site structure of the EPR- silent, diiron(III) state. The EPR spectra of the cryoreduced samples reveal that the diiron(III) cluster of the resting hydroxylase has at least two chemically distinct forms, the structures of which differ from that of the equilibrium Fe(II)Fe(III) site. Their relative populations depend on pH, the presence of component B, and formation of the MMOH/MMOB complex by reoxidation of the reduced, diiron(II) hydroxylase. The formation of complexes between MMOB, MMOR, and the oxidized hydroxylase does not measurably affect the structure of the diiron(III) site. Cryogenic reduction in combination with EPR spectroscopy has also provided information about interaction of MMOH in the diiron(III) state with small molecules. The diiron(III) center binds methanol and phenols, whereas DMSO and methane have no measurable effect on the EPR properties of cryoreduced hydroxylase. Addition of component B favors the binding of some exogenous ligands, such as DMSO and glycerol, to the active site diiron(III) state and markedly perturbs the structure of the diiron(III) cluster complexed with methanol or phenol. The results reveal different reactivity of the Fe(III)Fe(III) and Fe(II)Fe(III) redox states of MMOH toward exogenous ligands. Moreover, unlike oxidized hydroxylase, the binding of exogenous ligands to the protein in the mixed-valent state is allosterically inhibited by MMOB. The differential reactivity of the hydroxylase in its diiron(III) and mixed-valent states toward small molecules, as well as the structural basis for the regulatory effects of component B, is interpreted in terms of a model involving carboxylate shifts of a flexible glutamate ligand at the Fe(II)Fe(III) center.",,"iron; methane monooxygenase; article; binding site; complex formation; electron spin resonance; enzyme active site; enzyme analysis; enzyme conformation; enzyme stability; enzyme structure; ligand binding; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; priority journal; structure activity relation; structure analysis; thermostability; Binding Sites; Dimethyl Sulfoxide; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Electrons; Ferric Compounds; Ferrous Compounds; Freezing; Methylococcaceae; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygenases; Phenols; Solubility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033616807

The rate at which secondary forests regain carbon (C) stocks and re-establish biogeochemical cycles that resemble those of primary forests will influence the biogeochemistry of the region. Most studies have focused on the effects of deforestation on biogeochemical cycles. In this study, we present data on the recuperation of carbon stocks and carbon fluxes within a secondary forest of the eastern Amazon, and we compare these measurements to those for primary forest, degraded pasture, and productive pasture. Along a transect from a 23-y-old degraded pasture, through a 7-y-old secondary forest, through a 16-year-old secondary forest, and to a primary forest, the δ13C values of soil organic matter (SOM) in the top 10 cm of soil were -21.0, -26.5, -27.4, and -27.9‰, respectively, indicating that the isotopic signature of SOM from C3 forest plants was rapidly re-established. The degraded pasture also had significant inputs of C from C3 plants. Radiocarbon data indicated that most of the C in the top 10 cm of soil had been fixed by plants during the last 30 years. Differences in soil C inventory among land use types were small compared to uncertainties in their measurement. Root inputs were nearly identical in primary and secondary forests, and litterfall in the secondary forest was 88% of the litterfall rate of the primary forest. In contrast, the secondary forest had only 17% of the above ground biomass. Because of rapid cycling rates of soil C and rapid recovery of C fluxes to and from the soil, the below ground C cycle in this secondary forest was nearly identical with those of the unaltered primary forest.","Amazonia; Carbon-13; Carbon-14; Forest; Soil","carbon; forest soil; nutrient dynamics; regeneration; secondary forest; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032697841

Lake Sanabria is a monomictic lake located in a gneiss-dominated glacial valley at 1000 ma. m. s. l. in NW Spain. A three-year study was carried out during 1987-89 to obtain the basic ecological knowledge required for a sustainable lake management. Water and phytoplankton samples were collected from several depths of the water column at the deepest zone of the lake. Temperature and Secchi disk visibility, and total and dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus, chlorophyll a, and phytoplankton species composition and abundance (in laboratory) were determined monthly following standard limnological methods. Stratification began in March-April, with the thermocline stabilized at between 6-10 m, and lasted until November-December. The euphotic depth was higher than the mixing depth throughout the stratification period, except in the month previous to the water column mixing. The water residence time, estimated from the volume of the lake and the inflows and outflows, was between 0.48-0.67 years. However, during the months of highest rainfall (September-February) it was up to three times greater than during the same months of low rainy years. Nutrient concentrations in the water were very low throughout the year (52 μg l-1 dissolved inorganic nitrogen, 6.1 μg l-1 soluble reactive phosphorus, and 1.45 mg l-1 soluble reactive silica) and dominated by the dissolved organic fractions, which was related to the inputs of organic materials from the densely forested catchment. The colour of the lake, 21-41 mg Pt l-1, is also indicative of the relatively high amount of organic substances dissolved in the waters of the lake. A bloom of cyanobacteria (Microcystis flos-aquae, Aphanothece clathrata, Merismopedia tenuisssima, Synechococcus sp.) persisted in most of the water column during August 1988-March 1989, associated with the high residence time of the water. In contrast, the cyanobacteria bloom was limited to the mesolimnion for 3-5 months during 1987 and 1989. A model is proposed for the seasonal variation of the phytoplankton, which differentiates the seasonal trend during years of high water turnover from that of years with long residence time. Lake Sanabria is oligotrophic, based on a range of criteria (Secchi disk visibility, chlorophyll a concentration, total phosphorus concentration). However, during years of long water residence time (e.g. 1988), the annual input of total phosphorus is critical to maintain the characteristics of the lake. Short-term strategies for the management of lakes should take into account the inter-annual variability rather than averages as indicators to prevent the impact of increased nutrient inputs derived from changes in land and water use in the catchment area. Long-term strategies should also consider the potential changes in the lake's dynamics, derived from the changes in the rainfall pattern caused by climatic changes.","Inter-annual variation; Management; Oligotrophic lakes; Spain","chlorophyll a; climate; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; lake; model; nitrogen; nutrient; phenology; phosphorus; population structure; solute concentration; Spain; temperature; water flow; water sampling; ecosystem management; lake dynamics; lake ecosystem; temporal variation; Galicia; Lake Sanabria; Spain; Aphanothece clathrata; Aphanothece clathrata; Cyanobacteria; Flos; Merismopedia; Merismopedia tenuissima; Merismopedia tenuissima; Microcystis; Microcystis flos-aquae; Microcystis flos-aquae; Synechococcus; Synechococcus; Synechococcus sp.",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6544274844

The method is based on written sources. For this purpose Flemish documentary sources are taken as an example originating from a polder region between Ghent and Antwerp dating from the period 1488 to 1609. These documentary sources are continuous and homogeneous. The polders were protected by dikes, which had had to be maintained regularly. The annual upkeep was answered for in the annual dikes accounts in which nearly each storm that caused damage to the dikes was recorded. In order to assess the impact of storminess, these storms have been categorised, based on the following three principles: (a) the exact wording in the text, (b) the circumstances in which a storm appeared, (c) the consequences to which a storm has led, e.g. number of acres flooded. Accordingly eight separate categories are distinguished with stoma ranging from one point to eight points. So in the first category the least important storms are given only one point. In category eight the storm surges appear, that have led to the flooding of large areas. These storms are given eight points. As the method enables us to assess the impact of storminess throughout the period, it shows only a small increase of storminess during the first quarter of the sixteenth century and a large increase in storminess during the second half of that century. Finally, looking at the storm pattern at Flushing between 1848 and 1990, there also appears to be a relative strong increase in storminess beginning around the 1950s. Whereas such a similarity in increase in storminess between these two quite different periods can hardly be coincidental, there must be some common cause. Could it be that periods of a relative strong increase of storminess precede periods of climatic change?.",,"methodology; paleoclimate; storm; storm surge; tide; Belgium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032803077

They also occur in similar locations in the promoters of several other ribosomal protein genes. Substitutions encompassing the -74 and -167 CreA consensus sequences in the crp-2 promoter result in a decrease in transcription. A cDNA encoding the N. crassa homologue of CreA was cloned and designated Cre-1. The Cre-1 protein is 45% identical to CreA from A. nidulans. Cre-1 protein produced in Escherichia coli binds to the CreA sites in the promoters of the 40S rRNA and crp-2 genes.

The infrared and upconverted emissions of Er3+ in single and Er3+:Yb3+ codoped samples were analyzed, and it was observed that the best set of samples for 2.8 μm emission was the single doped one, and that as the upconversion (anti-Stokes luminescence) increased as a function of Yb3+ concentration, the infrared emission decreased in the same manner. The results suggest that the codoping with Yb3+ favors only the upconversion processes which depopulate the 4I11/2 level, reducing the 2.8 μm emission intensity. On the other hand, the Yb3+ codoping will certainly increase the efficiency of an upconversion based device.

First stage turbine shroud components were fabricated using five material systems including three SiC/SiC-Si systems made by silicon melt infiltration (MI), chemical vapor infiltrated (CVI) enhanced SiCSiC and directed metal oxidation (DIMOX) A1203-SiC composite. A combustor liner was made of MI CFCC. Before and after testing the components were inspected by several NDE techniques including IR thermography, resonance testing and visual examination. A novel, high pressure test rig was used to test four shroud components and a combustor liner simultaneously. Components were exposed to hot gas temperature of 1200°C at 12.5 bar in cyclic and steady-state tests. Cyclic testing simulated engine trip conditions with 200 flame-on, flame-off cycles. Steady state testing involved 100 hours of exposure at high temperature and pressure with hot combustion gases. At the conclusion of the first phase of testing there was visible damage to two pieces of one of the material systems. Destructive testing of the components following rig exposure showed little degradation to the MI composite materials. In summary, high pressure combustion rig testing of these components demonstrated excellent performance with little degradation among the material systems.

At room temperature, nanotubes emit through adsorbate states correlated to the presence of water. These states are removed above 900 K. After adsorbate removal, the apparently clean nanotube state shows lower emission current and substantially reduced emission noise. Current-temperature measurements identify a deviation from metallic tunneling behavior. Nanotube field emission undergoes a second, field-stabilized transition at high temperatures which reduces the current by as much as five orders of magnitude relative to the room temperature current. This current decrease is 100% recoverable. In addition, the stable behavior of clean nanotube states breakdown at extremely high currents and temperatures. Rings form around the field emission images, similar to those observed in metals at extreme current densities.

An examination of the local environments of asparagine and aspartic acid in protein structures with a resolution better than 1.5 Å revealed that their side-chain carbonyls are frequently within 4 Å of their own backbone carbonyl or the backbone carbonyl of the previous residue. Calculations using protein structures with a resolution better than 1.8 Å reveal that this close contact occurs in more than 80% of cases. This carbonyl-carbonyl interaction offers an energetic sabilization for the partially allowed conformations of asparagine and aspartic acid with respect to all other non-glycyl amino acids. The non-covalent attractive interactions between the dipoles of two carbonyls has recently been calculated to have an energy comparable to that of a hydrogen bond. The preponderance of asparagine in the left-handed α-helical region, and in general of aspartic acid and asparagine in the partially allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, may be a consequence of this carbonyl-carbonyl stacking interaction.","Asparagine; Aspartic acid; Carbonyl stacking; Propensity; Ramachandran plot","amino acid; asparagine; aspartic acid; carbonyl derivative; alpha helix; article; hydrogen bond; priority journal; protein conformation; protein secondary structure; protein stability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033455572

Six categories of system behaviour for changes between and within steady-states are identified: disorder maximization; self-organization; linear process-response; stochastic; self-organized criticality; and chaotic. In practical terms, predictability only exists for linear behaviour. Simple frequency distributions of time-series data are used to identify dominant behaviour in the proxy-records from 10 000 years of annual laminations from Holzmaar, Germany. The results suggest that before ~3000 yr cal. BP the catchment-lake system may have reached a state of self-organized criticality where fluctuations in system properties, for instance diatom productivity and sediment flux, were caused by internal reorganization as much as by external forces. Comparison of the records for sediment flux with outputs from the GOLEM landscape model suggests that major shifts in the Holocene record were triggered by human actions rather than by climate. The approach offers a new perspective on the causes of minor and major changes in reconstructed environmental systems and the degree of interactions between subsystems.","Holocene; Laminated sediments; Model-testing; Nonlinear dynamics; Proxy-records; Self-organized criticality; Systems analysis","climate change; dynamics; environmental monitoring; Germany; paleoecology; systematics; Holocene; lacustrine deposit; lamination; paleoenvironment; proxy climate record; Germany; Lake Holzmaar; Bacillariophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032825587

An approach is presented which transform transient GCM output by statistical downscaling to local precipitation scenarios, which together with directly derived temperature scenarios are subsequently fed into a slope hydrological/stability model to derive future landslide activity. This model chain is applied to a landslide in the Dolomites, Italy. Validation of the approach against independent observed records suggests its applicability for estimating future landslide activity based on GCM results. One possible way of estimating the quality of the approach is to determine sources of uncertainty introduced by the GCM simulations and by different fitting periods of the downscaling technique. Differences between the GCM experiments are found to be more important than differences between the 2 fitting periods. The most striking result is the significant reduction of landslide activity in spring in all cases. This is attributable to the rise of winter temperature which impedes future storage of winter precipitation as snow. As one consequence, less melt water is available for the hillslope in spring, causing the decrease in activity. It can be concluded that differences between GCMs and differences between fitting periods permit quantification of part of the uncertainty inherent in climate change impact assessments. Impacts which emerge in all model combinations, such as the decrease in landslide activity in spring shown here, have a high level of confidence.","Climate change; Downscaling; GCM; Landslide activity","climate change; downscaling; landslide; slope stability; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033607120

It has been generally assumed that these inverted biomass pyramids are the direct result of high specific production rates of phytoplankton and a tight coupling between producers and consumers. There are, however, at least two alternative hypotheses: (1) heterotrophic biomass turnover is much slower in oligotrophic than eutrophic systems; and (2) oligotrophic planktonic communities are significantly subsidized by allochthonous organic matter. In this study we assessed these hypotheses by establishing the relationship between plankton biomass structure (partition between auto- and heterotrophs), plankton function (plankton primary production and respiration) and whole-lake gas (O2 and CO2) fluxes in 20 temperate lakes that span a large range in primary production. We show that the balance of phytoplankton production and community respiration (P/R ratio) is always below unity in unproductive lakes where heterotrophic biomass (H) is high relative to autotrophic biomass (A), suggesting that these planktonic food webs function as heterotrophic systems and must be subsidized by allochthonous organic matter. Further, rates of phytoplankton specific production are not highest in communities characterized by dominance of heterotrophic biomass. All except the most productive lakes were supersaturated in CO2 and undersaturated in O2. Our results support the hypothesis that excess CO2 in lakes originates from the breakdown of terrestrial organic carbon by planktonic organisms. A simple model in which both allochthonous organic matter and phytoplankton production support the metabolism of heterotrophs reproduced the patterns and magnitudes of metabolism, P/R ratio, biomass turnover time, and whole-system gas flux among lakes. These patterns of metabolism and structure suggest that inverted biomass pyramids in temperate lakes, and perhaps in other aquatic systems, reflect the heterotrophic nature of these plankton communities rather than turnover rates of autotrophs or heterotrophs.","Autotrophy; Carbon dioxide; Gas exchange; Heterotrophy; Lakes; Oxygen; Plankton; Primary production; Respiration","air-water interaction; biomass; lake; metabolism; plankton; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033038148

We have cloned the TOP1 gene encoding topoisomerase I from the opportunistic fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. The C. neoformans topoisomerase I contains a fungal insert also found in topoisomerase I from Candida albicans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is not present in the mammalian enzyme. We were unable to disrupt the topoisomerase I gene in this haploid organism by homologous recombination in over 8000 transformants analyzed. When a second functional copy of the TOP1 gene was introduced into the genome, the topoisomerase I gene could be readily disrupted by homologous recombination (at 7% efficiency). Thus, topoisomerase I is essential in C. neoformans. This new molecular strategy with C. neoformans may also be useful in identifying essential genes in other pathogenic fungi. To address the physiological and pathobiological functions of the enzyme, the TOP1 gene was fused to the GAL7 gene promoter. The resulting GAL7::TOP1 fusion gene was modestly regulated by carbon source in a serotype A strain of C. neoformans. Modest overexpression of topoisomerase I conferred sensitivity to heat shock, γ-rays, and camptothecin. In contrast, alterations in topoisomerase I levels had no effect on the toxicity of a novel class of antifungal agents, the dicationic aromatic compounds (DACs), indicating that topoisomerase I is not the target of DACs. In an animal model of cryptococcal meningitis, topoisomerase I regulation was not critically important to established infection, but may impact on the initial stress response to infection. In summary, our studies reveal that topoisomerase I is essential in the human pathogen C. neoformans and represents a novel target for antifungal agents.",,"camptothecin; DNA topoisomerase; amino acid sequence; antifungal activity; article; candida albicans; cell viability; cryptococcus neoformans; drug sensitivity; fusion gene; gene disruption; gene insertion; gene overexpression; genetic recombination; heat sensitivity; molecular cloning; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; radiosensitivity; saccharomyces cerevisiae; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Biotransformation; Camptothecin; Cell Survival; Cloning, Molecular; Cryptococcus; DNA Topoisomerases, Type I; Enzyme Inhibitors; Gene Expression; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Plasmids; Rabbits; Radiation, Ionizing; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Time Factors; Animalia; Candida albicans; Filobasidiella neoformans; Fungi; Mammalia; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032900947

In this study we investigate the rules for aggregating the surface parameters for the Canadian Land Surface Scheme (CLASS). The method consists of running a one-dimensional version of CLASS over a period of 105 days in summer using meteorological data observed at an agricultural site near Quebec City. The aggregation of parameters is tested by successively running the model with two homogeneous values (usually a small one and a large one) of a chosen parameter and then with a mean or aggregated value of that parameter; the results of the latter run are then compared with the area-averaged results of the two homogeneous runs. Vegetation coverage, rooting depth, soil texture and roughness lengths are the input parameters thus tested. Heterogeneity of soil moisture content due to uneven distribution of precipitation is also discussed. The results indicate that the sub-areas of CLASS must have their own soil variables, that roots must occupy full soil layers and not part of a layer, and that the aggregating rule for the roughness lengths (zo for momentum and zot for heat and moisture) should be changed from the current logarithmic averages to the blending height method for zo and to a new formula involving both roughness lengths for zot. The surface-layer scheme in CLASS was found inadequate and replaced. Results for soil texture aggregation are not as clear; it seems difficult to obtain simultaneously a good averaging of atmospheric energy fluxes and a good averaging of soil moisture contents, runoff and drainage. Horizontal variability of soil moisture due to uneven distribution of rainfall generates an overestimate of evapotranspiration and an underestimate of runoff in an aggregated model lacking this effect. Preliminary results indicate that, in order to effectively parametrize this effect in CLASS, both surface ponding capacity and ground infiltration rate must be reduced over the grid square when convective precipitation occurs. © 1999 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033246396

Since the secondary ion intensities are seen to be dependent on the primary beam parameters, the purpose of this work was to check if these parameters (mass, primary energy, and incidence angle) also influence the kinetic energy distributions of the sputtered molecular fragment ions. This is done in order to gain a better understanding of the molecular ion emission from polymer targets. In general, the shape of the kinetic energy distribution of PET fragment ions is found to be almost independent upon the primary ion nature and energy, as witnessed by the similar spectra observed with 12 keV Ga+ and 7-22 keV In+ primaries. This confirms previous studies which indicated that the main parameters governing secondary ion kinetic energies in this energy range were the secondary ion nature and the chemical structure of the organic and polymer targets. Nevertheless, the energy spectra of the fingerprint fragment ions obtained at 2 keV with an impact angle of 65° with respect to the surface normal are broader than those observed for higher energy and lower angle of incidence (∼40°). In comparison with the latter, they exhibit an additional contribution centered around 5-6 eV, i.e. in the high energy tail of the distributions. The integrated intensity of this contribution increases with the fragment size, up to 7% and 15% of the total ion intensity for C7H4O+ and C17H12O5+, respectively. The results are discussed in terms of collision cascade propagation in the surface region of the target, by comparing the experimental observations to simulations conducted with the TRIM code. TRIM calculations suggest that the variation of the impact angle is the predominant factor influencing the atom displacements in the first 25 A below the surface. In the {2 keV, 65°} configuration, the energy transferred to recoils in this region is similar, but the number of interacting atoms is more than two times greater than for the other tested combinations of energy and angle, suggesting an increased probability of collective processes for molecular ion emission. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.","Ion emission; Kinetic energy; Poly(ethylene terephthalate); Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Sputtering; TRIM",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000763287

The test chambers simulate the major features unique to estuarine systems, such as tidal flow and salinity changes. Microbial communities were colonized on artificial substrates and analyzed for productivity, biomass, and community composition. Atrazine was found to reduce chlorophyll a, phototrophic carbon assimilation and phototrophic biovolume in the 40 and 160 μg l-1 treatments. Significant reductions in phototrophic variables occurred within 24 h of pesticide exposure and no recovery was detected after 9 days. Dissolved oxygen content in the mesocosms was not significantly affected by atrazine. Atrazine induced changes in composition of the algal community. Most taxa were reduced in abundance by atrazine exposure; however, cyanobacterial taxa generally became more abundant. Bacterial abundance was significantly elevated in the highest dose after 24 h, but decreased in a dose-response manner after 48 h. There was no significant effect on small ciliates; however, large ciliates and small flagellates increased significantly in number after 48 h and remained elevated after 9 days. Atrazine at 160 μg l-1 significantly reduced large flagellate density throughout the experiment. These results suggest that exposure of the estuarine microbial food web to agricultural pesticides can lead to both functional and structural changes, which may potentially impact higher trophic levels.

Soil taken in autumn 1995 and spring 1996 from the 0-20 and 20-50 cm layers of plots with restricted and unrestricted drainage were amended with or without C2H2 to inhibit reduction of N2O to N2 and with or without chloramphenicol to inhibit de novo synthesis of reduction enzymes. Samples were incubated anaerobically for 72 h at 25°C and the production of CO2 and N2O and the concentrations of NO3- and NO2- were monitored. Restricting drainage had no significant effect on the concentrations of NO3- and NO2- nor on the production of N2O. The production of N2O was very variable and less than 1.5 mg N2O-N kg-1 after 72 h in both plots. The N2O-to-CO2 ratio on both plots was only 0.02 and no significant amounts of N2 were produced. However, conditioning soil from the 0-20 cm of the plot with restricted drainage by keeping it under waterlogged conditions for 28 d at 25°C in the laboratory changed the dynamics of the denitrification process substantially: the N2O-to-CO2 ratio increased to 0.56, 54% of the gaseous product of denitrification was N2 and the resulting N2O-to-N2 ratio was 1.84. The application of either 50 mg NO3-N or 50 mg NO3-N plus 100 mg glucose C decreased the production of N2; consequently the N2O-to-N2 ratio increased to 2.66 and 3.37, respectively. With a clay content of 55-60% and very slowly permeable subsoil, the Brimstone Farm soil was assumed to be well adapted to anaerobic conditions, but its capacity in 1995/1996 to reduce NO3- to N2O and N2 was very limited, even when it was incubated under strict anaerobic conditions and supplied with NO3-. However, waterlogging the soil in the laboratory caused the microbial community to change its functional characteristics by adapting to the anaerobic conditions. The inability to replicate this effect in the field by restricting winter drainage can be attributed to dry antecedent soil conditions resulting from the very low rainfall in summer 1995.",,"carbon dioxide; chloramphenicol; denitrification; enzymic reduction; soil degradation; united kingdom; clay soil; denitrification; nutrient dynamics; soil drainage; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032932684

We have simulated the emissions, transport, and concentration of SF6 for a 5-year period, and compared the results with atmospheric observations. In addition, we have performed an intercomparison of interhemispheric transport among 11 models to investigate the reasons for the differences among the simulations. Most of the models are reasonably successful at simulating the observed meridional gradient of SF6 in the remote marine boundary layer, though there is less agreement at continental sites. Models that compare well to observations in the remote marine boundary layer tend to systematically overestimate SF6 at continental locations in source regions, suggesting that vertical trapping rather than meridional transport may be a dominant control on the simulated meridional gradient. The vertical structure of simulated SF6 in the models supports this interpretation. Some of the models perform quite well in terms of the simulated seasonal cycle at remote locations, while others do not. Interhemispheric exchange time varies by a factor of 2 when estimated from 1-dimensional meridional profiles at the surface, as has been done for observations. The agreement among models is better when the global surface mean mole fraction is used, and better still when the full 3-dimensional mean mixing ratio is used. The ranking of the interhemispheric exchange time among the models is not sensitive to the change from station values to surface means, but is very sensitive to the change from surface means to the full 3-dimensional tracer fields. This strengthens the argument that vertical redistribution dominates over interhemispheric transport in determining the meridional gradient at the surface. Vertically integrated meridional transport in the models is divided roughly equally into transport by the mean motion, the standing eddies, and the transient eddies. The vertically integrated mass flux is a good index of the degree to which resolved advection vs. parameterized diffusion accomplishes the meridional transport of SF6. Observational programs could provide a much better constraint on simulated chemical tracer transport if they included regular sampling of vertical profiles of nonreactive trace gases over source regions and meridional profiles in the middle to upper troposphere. Further analysis of the SF6 simulations will focus on the subgrid-scale parameterized transports.",,"atmospheric transport; comparative study; fluoride; sulfur; three-dimensional modeling; trace gas; tracer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6544275411

Using one-at-a-time (OAT) sensitivity perturbations and a mini-global analysis we varied three model inputs in ihe range of their known uncertainties: mixing height; emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC); and the rate constant for the reaction OH + NO2 → HNO3. Two measures, ozone concentration ([O3]) and the ratio [O3]/[NOx], were used to assess the photochemical system's sensitivity response on an O3 response surface. We lind that: (1) these input uncertainties change the system's state in different ways, altering either the [O3] or the system's response to emissions reductions, or changing both responses together; (2) the [O3]/[NOx] measure successfully predicts the direction and relative degree of change in the system state while [O3] does not; and (3) for most of the days and locations we have examined, the system's responses to uncertainties simulated OAT are nearly additive when compared with the mini-global case, and that both of the sensitivity measures we assessed correctly tracked this additivity. We conclude that incorporating the [O3]/[NOx] ratio is a significant first step in constructing a useful sensitivity ""vector"" for understanding systems-level changes in the model. However, additional measures that can successfully track the change of shape of the response surface are still needed. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.","Emissions reductions; Input uncertainties; Ozone (O3): Nitrogen oxides (NOx); RADM; Sensitivity analysis","Air pollution control; Air quality; Computer simulation; Gas emissions; Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Perturbation techniques; Photochemical reactions; Troposphere; Vectors; Volatile organic compounds; Miniglobal analysis; One-at-a-time (OAT) sensitivity perturbation; Regional acid deposition models (RADM); Sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033097906

Transcription analysis in a Klpdc1Δ strain showed that KlPDC1 expression is subject to autoregulation. The PDC1 gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was able to complement the Rag- phenotype of the Klpdc1Δ mutant strain and it could also repress transcription of the KlPDC1-lacZ fusion on glucose.

In the lower, iron oxide from the slag is reduced to iron by carbon. In the upper, the gas from the reduction is post-combusted to CO2+H2O. The post-combustion heat is transferred from the rising post-combustion gas to the upper slag, and, therefrom, by slag circulation to the lower slag layer where the endothermic reduction reaction takes place. Unavoidably, slag circulation also transfers part of the char into the upper slag where it is oxidized. A kinetic post-combustion and heat transfer model describes these phenomena. The main process parameters, namely real post-combustion degree, carbon oxidation, heat transfer efficiency, distribution of temperatures of gas and slag in the single regions of the reactor, coal consumption, and iron production rate are given as functions of the ratio of post-combustion oxygen to gas evolution rate of the system. The main influences on which heat efficiency and off-gas temperature as the most important output parameter depend are discussed. Controlled stirring and a regular gas through-put are of primary importance. The required values are given.

Under both HCO-3/CO2- and HEPES-buffered conditions, 3-, 5- or 10-min anoxia induced a triphasic change in pH(i) consisting of an initial fall in pH(i), a subsequent rise in pH(i) in the continued absence of O2 and, finally, a further rise in pH(i) upon the return to normoxia, which recovered towards preanoxic steady-state pH(i) values if the duration of the anoxic insult was ≤5min. In parallel experiments performed on sister cultures, anoxia of 3, 5 or 10min duration evoked rises in [Ca2+](i) which, in all cases, commenced after the start of the fall in pH(i), reached a peak at or just following the return to normoxia and then declined towards preanoxic resting levels. Removal of external Ca2+ markedly attenuated increases in [Ca2+](i), but failed to affect the pH(i) changes evoked by 5min anoxia.The latency from the start of anoxia to the start of the increase in pH(i) observed during anoxia was increased by perfusion with media containing either 2mM Na+, 20mM glucose or 1μM tetrodotoxin. Because each of these manoeuvres is known to delay the onset and/or attenuate the magnitude of anoxic depolarization, the results suggest that the rise in pH(i) observed during anoxia may be consequent upon membrane depolarization. This possibility was also suggested by the findings that Zn2+ and Cd2+, known blockers of voltage-dependent proton conductances, reduced the magnitude of the rise in pH(i) observed during anoxia.Under HCO-3/CO2-free conditions, reduction of external Na+ by substitution with N-methyl-D-glucamine (but not Li+) attenuated the magnitude of the postanoxic alkalinization, suggesting that increased Na+/H+ exchange activity contributes to the postanoxic rise in pH(i). In support, rates of pH(i) recovery from internal acid loads imposed following anoxia were increased compared to control values established prior to anoxia in the same neurons. In contrast, rates of pH(i) recovery from acid loads imposed during anoxia were reduced, suggesting the possibility that Na+/H+ exchange is inhibited during anoxia.We conclude that the steady-state pH(i) response of cultured rat hippocampal neurons to transient anoxia is independent of changes in [Ca2+](i) and is characterized by three phases which are determined, at least in part, by alterations in Na+/H+ exchange activity and, possibly, by a proton conductance which is activated during membrane depolarization.

As a basis for discussion, published and new case studies from central-western Argentina are presented. Similar plant traits measured with different levels of precision are utilized in the description of ecosystem structure in different land-use situations along a steep regional climatic gradient. The general protocol followed in the case studies represents a data-driven, non-hierarchical, low-tech approach, that can be applied to a wide range of spatial scales, from plots to regions. Climatic factors (including extreme events and seasonality), disturbance frequency and intensity, and disturbance history are suggested as key factors to be considered in global comparisons of vegetation responses to land use and in predictive models of ecosystem dynamics.","Climate; Disturbance; Environmental filter; Global change; Grazing; Trait-environment link","climate effect; ecosystem structure; land use; life history trait; Argentina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032707359

Field experiments were conducted from 1989 to 1996 at the Texas A &amp; M University Agricultural Research and Extension Center near Beaumont, Texas. Eleven rice cultivars and three soil types were involved. The results of this study showed the following: 1) Rice cultivar choice slightly influenced the day-to-day seasonal pattern of methane emission, but it had a significant effect on the seasonal total methane emission. The average seasonal methane emission is 22.8 g CH4 m-2 for high-emitting cultivars (Mars and Della), ranging from 8.0 to 41.0 g CH4 M-̄2 and 17.7 g CH4 M-2 for low-emitting cultivars (Lemont, Labelle, Lebonnet, Dawn, Katy, IR 36, Cypress, and Jasmine), ranging from 1.7 to 28.4 g CH4 m-2 2) Seasonal methane emission has a positive linear correlation with postheading rice plant height. The correlation coefficient r2 is 0.736 (n = 24, and p &lt; 0.05). In this paper we suggest that plant height may be a good criteria in choosing cultivars for mitigation of methane emission. More importantly, it provides a potential method for estimating methane emission from regional or global rice paddies as plant height can be evaluated by remotely sensed imagery.",,"biogenic emission; height determination; methane; paddy field; remote sensing; Cupressus; Jasminum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033301751

The first stage is very likely to be controlled by solid state and/or gas diffusion with an apparent activation energy of 472 kJ mol-1 for pellets fluxed with 15%CAO and 25%SiO2.

The state of thermohaline ocean circulation probably governs the climate, and the triggering mechanism for climate changes is random fluctuations of the atmospheric forcing on the ocean circulation. The high temporal resolution paleoclimatic data from ice-cores are consistent with this picture and a bi-stable climate pseudo-potential can be derived. It is found that the fast time scale noise forcing the climate contains a component with an α-stable distribution. As a consequence the abrupt climatic changes observed could be triggered by single extreme events. These events are related to ocean-atmosphere dynamics on annual or shorter time scales and could indicate a fundamental limitation in predictability of climate changes.

Investigation of spectral variations shows a significant hardness-intensity correlation with no measurable effect on the curvature. This can be described as an increase of the peak TeV emission energy with intensity. Simultaneous and quasi-simultaneous CAT VHE γ-ray and BeppoSAX hard X-ray detections for the highest recorded flare on 16th April and for lower-activity states of the same period show correlated variability with a higher luminosity in X-rays than in γ-rays. The observed spectral energy distribution and the correlated variability between X-rays and γ-rays, both in amplitude and in hardening of spectra, favour a two-component emission scheme where the low and high energy components are attributed to synchrotron and inverse Compton (IC) radiation, respectively.","Galaxies: active; Galaxies: BL Lacertae objects: individual: Mkn 501 gamma rays: observations; Galaxies: nuclei",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002952136

Exponential increases in flux occurred with increasing soil waterfilled pore space (WFPS) and temperature; increases in soil mineral N content due to fertilizer application also stimulated emissions. Fluxes were low when any of these variables was below a critical value. The largest fluxes occurred when WFPS values were very high (70-90%), indicating that denitrification was the major process responsible. The relationships with the driving variables showed strong similarities to those reported for very different environments: irrigated sugar cane crops, pastures, and forest in the tropics. Annual emissions varied widely (0.3-18.4 kg N2O-N ha-1). These variations were principally due to the degree of coincidence of fertilizer application and major rainfall events. It is concluded therefore that several years' data are required from any agricultural ecosystem in a variable climate to obtain a robust estimate of mean N2O fluxes. The emissions from small-grain cereals (winter wheat and spring barley) were consistently lower (0.2-0.7 kg N2O-N per 100 kg N applied) than from cut grassland (0.3-5.8 kg N2O-N per 100 kg N). Crops such as broccoli and potatoes gave emissions of the same order as those from the grassland. Although these differences between crop types are not apparent in general data comparisons, there may well be distinct regional differences in the relative and absolute emissions from different crops, due to local factors relating to soil type, weather patterns, and agricultural management practices.

This combination of materials, or mixed materials, can have substantially different properties than either of the original materials. The PISCES-B linear plasma device is examining the formation conditions and properties of mixed-material surface layers which can form on plasma-facing components. The PISCES-B device has been modified to incorporate an impurity gas (CD4, CO, O2, etc.) puffing system in the target interaction region. It is, therefore, possible to control the fraction of impurities in the incident plasma and to perform systematic tests on the conditions necessary to form mixed-materials surface layers. The concentration of the species in the plasma column is measured spectroscopically, as well as by a residual gas monitor on the vacuum chamber. Measurements of the rate of growth of the thickness of the mixed material layer are performed. A simple erosion model can adequately describe the growth rate of the mixed-material layer and may allow for growth rate predictions in other plasma environments. It is also important to investigate the role of redeposition of metallic impurities in the formation of mixed material layers. A beryllium evaporator has been independently installed upstream of the target-interaction region to allow seeding of the incident plasma with beryllium. The presence of beryllium on the sample surface is observed to reduce the chemical erosion of the graphite by more than the reduction of the surface carbon concentration. And finally, the hydrogen isotope retention properties of carbon-containing layers on beryllium could have serious implications for tritium accumulation in ITER.",,"Beryllium; Experimental reactors; Film growth; Plasma confinement; Tritium; International thermonuclear experimental reactors (ITER); Plasma facing components; Tokamak devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032627059

This paper presents a broad summary of the spatial and temporal variations observed in ambient PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in California. Many areas that have high PM10 concentrations also have relatively high PM2.5 concentrations, and data indicate that a significant portion of the PM10 air quality problem is caused by PM2.5. To develop effective plans for attaining the ambient PM standards, improved understanding of these unique problems is needed.

In this way, a search has been made of Asturian regional newspaper archives, including data from the period between January 1980 and June 1995 (5290 newspapers reviewed). The methodology developed shows some limitations, due to the low frequency of news items relating to landslides and the lack of scientific data collected by correspondents. Moreover, there is a bias towards instability events concerning people, infrastructures and other human resources. Statistical analysis of 209 news items relating to slope instability is useful to establish the geological and spatial location of landslides. Fifty-one point two percent of them are situated in the Central Coal Basin, with a sedimentary siliceous bedrock. Temporal data are accurate in 83.2% of the cases. A comparison between climatic and slope instability events reveals that 79% of the landslides developed during rainfall events, associated with the monthly 24-h rainfall maximum values. Highest landslide frequencies are reached in years with more than 1000 mm rainfall, mainly in December and April.","Cantabrian Range; Press archives; Rainfall events; Slope instability","historical record; landslide; rainfall; slope stability; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342470989

Its X-ray morphology resembles its morphology at 20cm, seen by the NVSS. In particular, we detect diffuse emission in eight regions filling half of the 200 h-150 kpc (8′.7) radius circle around the optical center of the group: one region encompassing galaxies a &amp; b, two regions surrounding the group galaxies c &amp; d, a clumpy region roughly 140 h-150 kpc from the group galaxies, which may be gas ejected from one of the galaxies, plus regions respectively associated with a background radio-source, a probable background radio-source, a foreground star and a background group or cluster. The bolometric X-ray luminosity of the diffuse emission, excluding the regions associated with radio galaxies, is LbolX = 2.3 × 1041 h-250erg s-1, i.e., half of the luminosity found by Ponman et al. (1996). The region that is offset from the galaxies contributes half of the diffuse X-ray luminosity of the group.The diffuse emission is cool (T &lt; 0.55 keV with 90% confidence with a best fit T = 0.27 keV). At these low temperatures, the correction for photoelectric absorption in the estimate of bolometric luminosity is a factor 3.5 and varies rapidly with temperature, hence an uncertain bolometric luminosity. The clumpy distribution of hot diffuse gas in HCG 16 is illustrated by the low mean X-ray surface brightness and hot gas density of the regions of undetected emission within 8′ (at most 1/4 and 1/6 of those of the detected gas, assuming both have same temperature, metallicity and clumpiness). The irregular X-ray morphology of the diffuse emission rules out a (nearly) virialized nature for HCG 16, unless intergalactic gas had sufficiently high specific entropy to be unable to collapse with the group. In any event, the clumpy gas distribution, and high luminosity given the low temperature suggest that most of the diffuse gas originates from galaxies, either through tidal stripping or through galactic winds driven by supernova remnants. Therefore, no spiral-only HCGs are known with regular diffuse emission tracing a gravitational potential. Our results highlight the need for a careful 2D spatial analysis and multi-wavelength study of the diffuse X-ray emission from groups, suggesting that other compact groups could be significantly contaminated by superimposed X-ray sources.","Galaxies: clusters: general; Galaxies: clusters: individual: HCG 16; X-rays: galaxies; X-rays: general",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002174012

This suggests that the reduction of Cu2+ to Cu+ does not only occur via water elimination from CuOH+ species or via oxygen evolution from [Cu-O-Cu]2+ species, but also via oxidation of the carbonaceous materials to give CO and CO2. This mechanism occurs under high temperature (&gt;300°C) treatments in vacuo or He of Cu-ZSM-5 catalysts containing carbonaceous species and strongly adsorbed water molecules in the first coordination shell of the Cu2+.

The study pond was located in the northern study area (NSA) of the Boreal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study (BOREAS), near Thompson, Manitoba. Three pathways transported the CH4 produced in the rich, organic anaerobic sediments. In order of importance they were: bubble flux (ebullition), diffusion, and plant transport. The water-air flux of CH4 was related to windspeed and sediment temperature, whereas the bubble flux also showed a degree of synchronicity with changes in atmospheric pressure and water level. By mid-June the storage of CH4 in the sediments reached a quasi steady-state, and production minus oxidation approximated the water-air exchange. Since the dominant pathway of ebullition is little affected by oxidation, the mean unit area flux of CH4 for the vegetated and open portions of the beaver pond (155 and 320 mg CH4 m-2day-1) were larger than the flux observed in most wetlands of the NSA.

Furthermore, emphasis is given to the adequate modelling of demand-side management (DSM) programmes, including their effects on electricity generation, capacity expansion and electricity purchase. The results show that selected DSM programmes in the household sector lead to a cost-effective reduction of electricity demand. When ecological considerations, such as a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, are included, the cost of electricity generation increases, as does the potential for DSM savings. However, when a revenue-based approach is used, it is evident that extrinsic economic incentives for DSM need to be given by, for example, regulatory authorities.",,"Cost effectiveness; Decision theory; Electric utilities; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Mathematical models; Optimization; Urban planning; Demand-side management; Energy-emission models; Energy policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033328252

Experiments were performed in decerebrate, vagotomized, paralyzed and mechanically ventilated piglets of 3-5 days and 2-3 weeks of age (n=19). Repeated exposure to progressive hyperoxic hypercapnia induced a reproducible increase in phrenic nerve activity, accompanied by a CO2 concentration-dependent increase in expiratory duration. No differences were observed in piglets with intact or cut carotid sinus nerves. Intravenous administration of bicuculline (2 mg/kg; n=7), a γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA(A)) receptor antagonist, significantly reduced the CO2-induced prolongation of TE. These data demonstrate for the first time that in early postnatal life, hypercapnia induced increase in phrenic activity is associated with centrally mediated prolongation of expiratory duration. Furthermore, the results suggest that brainstem GABAergic mechanisms play an important role in CO2-induced prolongation of expiratory time during early development.

In a new premix burner concept the evaporation of the liquid fuel and the burning zone are decoupled. The liquid fuel is sprayed onto the porous outer surface of the evaporator tube. The flowing air and the fuel vapor enter the tube where the combustion takes place. The tube must be gastight on the inner surface. Inside the tube the temperature is about 1500°C, at the outer surface about 550°C. Previous work shows that application of porous silicon carbide (SiC) ceramics is rather promising. Due to the temperature gradient both during steady state and transient operation, high thermal stresses develop in the tube. Four different design variations of porosity gradients are investigated: a two-layer concept without FGM and three continuous porosity gradients (linear, convex, concave). By comparing the local stress distribution with the local strength of the four different design variations, a favorable porosity gradient is found.

However, most of them refer to dense stands presenting reduced horizontal heterogeneity of foliage distribution. Both gradients of leaf nitrogen and leaf irradiance related to canopy depth are significant under such conditions, and modelling radiative exchange using a turbid-medium analogy and dividing the canopy into vegetation layers is sufficient. Conversely, row crops such as maize are characterized by strong horizontal heterogeneity of foliage distribution and the one-dimensional (1D) approach may be unsuitable. We thus modelled the three-dimensional (3D) geometry of maize canopies with varying densities and at different developmental stages using plant digitizing under field conditions. The nitrogen content per unit area of each leaf part was obtained subsequently by nitrogen analysis. We next calculated radiative exchange using a 3D volume-based approach within the canopies in order to estimate local leaf irradiance on a daily integration scale. Vertical gradients in leaf nitrogen content per unit area observed in dense stands during the vegetative phase corresponded largely to those reported in the literature. We also identified significant gradients in nitrogen content along the leaves, which had not before been clearly demonstrated. Our study shows that local light climate during plant development plays a major role in leaf nitrogen distribution and remobilization. Moreover, brutal plant thinning involves rapid changes in leaf nitrogen partitioning. It is concluded that taking account of the 3D heterogeneity of nitrogen and irradiance distribution may have implications for modelling crop photosynthesis and production.","3D plant architecture; Horizontal gradients in leaf nitrogen; Leaf irradiance; Leaf nitrogen content per unit area; Maize; Nitrogen partitioning; Nitrogen remobilization; Virtual plant; Zea mays L.","Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032768081

This part also examines the trend, especially in the last decade, of increased regulatory reliance on such market incentive programs. Part II describes how air emissions trading programs have evolved in the metropolitan Los Angeles area of the South Coast Air Basin. This part then describes the harsh reality of emissions trading based on the early results of the Los Angeles experiments and introduces the environmental justice concerns that have called attention to the programs' shortcomings. The Los Angeles emissions trading programs have resulted in adverse public health impacts, fraud, and manipulation of the trading market to reward the worst polluters. Part III criticizes emissions trading by drawing on the Los Angeles experience and examines the immorality, injustice, and ineffectiveness of pollution is wrong by creating a 'right' to pollute. It creates claims that pollution is wrong by creating a 'right' to pollute. It creates environmentally unjust outcomes by placing a disproportionate burden of the region's air pollution on low-income communities, a majority of which are ethnic and racial minorities. Finally, as demonstrated in Los angeles, pollution trading makes for ineffective air quality policy in at least four ways: 1) it does not significantly reduce air pollution; 2) it does not spur technological innovation; 3) it decreases public participation in environmental decision-making; and 4) it increases the difficulty of monitoring and enforcing emission reductions. Part IV presents recommendations for reforming or altering emissions trading proposals. This part also examines the implications of pollution trading in a broader context than Los Angeles. A detailed proposal to reform urban air pollution trading programs is presented. Also, this part examines the policy implications of emissions trading for the global climate change debate. Finally, this part briefly outlines other market-based policy tools that may prevent the problems associated with pollution trading, while still realizing the goal of enhancing economic efficiency.",,"economic instrument; emission control; environmental economics; pollution tax; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032816346

The processes modeled are three-dimensional turbulent gas flow, particle motion (including dispersion and re-entrainment), heterogeneous and homogeneous chemical reactions, and heat transfer. The purpose of this paper is to provide a detailed description of the model and to present an example of its use. The model can be used as a cost-effective tool to assist in the design of original and retrofit power boiler equipment and in the diagnosis and resolution of boiler operating problems. The effects of modifying operational parameters or the physical arrangement of equipment can be quickly evaluated. Simulations can be used to optimize overfire air distribution and arrangement to produce a more uniform gas flow distribution within the furnace, resulting in more complete combustion and less particulate carryover. As an example of the model's capability, simulations were produced for a stoker-fired power boiler using wood, bark-pile reclaim, and waste-treatment sludge for fuel. The results show that changes in the air distribution and in the arrangement of operational overfire air ports can produce a significant reduction in carbon monoxide, unburned carbon loss, and particulate carryover, without increasing furnace exit gas temperature.

They can be a source or a sink of carbon and influence CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. In order to calculate the carbon budget of a region, the effect of soil management practices on carbon sequestration in soils needs to be quantified. Objectives of this experiment were to determine: (i) the effects of ridge till, plow till and no-till on the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool; (ii) the SOC loss or sequestration for mulch rates of 016 Mg ha-1 year-1 wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) straw applied in combination with each tillage method, and (iii) impacts of tillage and crop residue treatments on soil physical quality, including aggregation and porosity. The experiment was initiated in 1989 on a Crosby silt loam (Stagnic Luvisol) in Central Ohio. Seven years after initiation of the experiment, there was a positive, linear effect of residue application rate on SOC contents in all tillage treatments. In the eighth year of the experiment these trends were confirmed for plow and no-till, but not for ridge till. Linear-regression equations, relating SOC content for the 0-10 cm soil depth to mulch rate, were: for no-till: SOC (Mg ha-1) = 15.21 + 0.32 [Residue (Mg ha-1 year-1)] (r = 0.68) and for plow till: SOC = 11.95 + 0.27 [Residue] (p = 0.72). The carbon conversion efficiencies were 8% per year for plow till and 10% per year for no-till. Detailed sampling at different depths revealed that increases in SOC content were only significant for the 0-5 cm depths of plow and no-till treatments. Effects of crop residue application on water stable aggregation in the 0-10 cm layer were most pronounced with plow till and ridge till but not with no-till. Water retention characteristics, a measure of pore size distribution, was not influenced by tillage system, but crop residue application had a significant effect on water retention in the 0-10 cm layer at matric suctions of 30-300 kPa.

It is concluded that, depending on the amount of crop residue returned to the soil, the large numbers of farmers converting from plow to no-till cultivation in the Corn Belt may create an important sink for atmospheric CO2.","Aggregation; Carbon sequestration; Conservation tillage; Greenhouse effect; Mulching; Soil organic matter; Soil quality","carbon sequestration; crop production; Luvisol; tillage; United States; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032694524

Since filling in January 1994, almost the whole water column has remained anoxic, with high concentrations of reduced elements (CH4, iron sulphides, H2S) originating from degradation of the submerged primary forest. These elements deoxygenated the water drained from the dam, as they were biologically and chemically oxidized in the river. Two major physiological guilds of microorganisms occurred. They showed a characteristic stratified arrangement in the lake, below and above an oxycline. Since flooding, we observed a cyclic development of phototrophic bacteria, assumed to be sulphur-oxidizers below the oxycline. The growth of this physiological guild seems to be strongly influenced by sulphide production and by the alternation between rainy and dry seasons. At the oxycline, the population of methane-oxidizing bacteria did not vary in the same way as the green sulphur bacteria. After a lag-phase, which was probably due to inhibition by excessive illumination in the upper water column in 1994, they developed and completely stopped diffusive methane emission in February 1995. The development of both bacterial guilds is directly correlated to changes in the level of the corresponding reduced elements from the bottom and dissolved in the lake water. The decreasing production of CH4 and sulphides induces a progressive extinction of methanotrophic bacteria and phototrophic sulphur-oxidizing bacteria. Meanwhile, the water is becoming clearer and algal populations proliferate in the upper water column, constituting an autochthonous source of organic carbon. Slowly, this aquatic ecosystem is reaching a low-activity equilibrium level related to reduced element production. It is evolving from a system ruled by an anaerobic organotrophic metabolism to an ecosystem governed by phototrophy.","Bacteria; Green sulphur bacteria; Methane; Methanotrophs; Reservoir; Sulphides","bacterium; reservoir; French Guiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033560439

Earlier results on the spontaneous decay rate and far-field emission pattern which have been obtained in a perturbative fashion are shown to be contained in our theory. Time evolution of the initially excited atomic state is considered and comparison with perturbative results is given. It is found that though the Fabry-Perot cavity is of an open type, vacuum-field Rabi oscillations are still possible. Conditions that are favorable for this strong coupling regime are discussed. The near-field spontaneous-emission pattern and the transition from the near field to the far field are investigated. For moderate mirror reflectivities, the spread in the near-field emission pattern is found to be in good agreement with the effective mode radius concept. When the mirror reflectivity increases, however, one has a strong coupling regime and together with it, multiple reabsorptions and reemissions of the photon may occur, leading to a better localization of the photon around the atomic position. These considerations may be useful in designing microlasers of the planar type. © 1999 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000994485

Secondly, a focus on land demonstrates clearly how an environmental threat such as climate change can undermine economic, societal, political and military security in the island states of the South-west Pacific.

Driven by the desire to maintain consistent yields and hedge the risk of drought, farmers may implement or increase supplemental irrigation applications, obtaining water from either surface sources or aquifers. This paper presents results of an investigation of the impact of these effects on streamflows in the midwestern United States. The investigation examines the direct effect of precipitation reduction and the indirect effects of riparian and nonriparian irrigation. The crop-growth and farm-scale hydrologic model erosion-productivity impact calculator is used in conjunction with the routing features of the basin-scale hydrologic model soil water analysis tool to simulate direct and indirect effects of global change on streamflows. The analysis shows that the coupled effects of decreases in runoff and increases in irrigation may be devastating to the streams of Illinois and other midwestern states. For the example basin a 25% decrease in mean precipitation under optimal irrigation practices by both riparian and nonriparian farmers yields an increase in the annual (mean)occurrence of the historical 7Q10 from 3 days/year to 13 days/year, despite the stream flow accretion from groundwater-supplied irrigators.",,"agriculture; climate change; irrigation; low flow; water use; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032995346

The overlap of these climate envelopes produces a mutual climatic range for fossil assemblages. The method employs predatory and scavenging beetle species found in fossil assemblages. By comparing observed versus predicted mean summer and winter temperatures from MCR, we developed a set of calibration equations for fossil beetle assemblages in Alaska and the Yukon Territory. These equations showed that MCR predictions fit the observed mean temperatures of the warmest month (TMAX) reasonably well, but the predictions of mean temperatures for the coldest month (TMIN) for coastal sites were consistently below the observed values. Thus the beetle communities living in coastal Alaska today are indicative of colder winter temperatures than are indicated by the observed TMIN, and such lack of correlation is a difficulty in applying the MCR method and in estimating paleoclimates in Beringia. We postulate that periods of severely cold weather in coastal regions are sufficiently common to eliminate species adapted to maritime climates. Instead we find in coastal localities more cold-resistant species whose principal ranges are in interior regions. These species are adapted to continental climates (with extreme seasonality of temperatures), rather than maritime climates (with reduced seasonality). Another difficulty in estimating paleoclimates of Beringia is that the coastal geography has changed with each glacial/interglacial cycle. Glacial and interstadial sites that lie near the modern coast were subject to continental, rather than maritime climates.",,"climate effect; fauna; insect; paleoclimate; Alaska; United States; Coleoptera; Insecta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032982825

Retention of soil C is beneficial for soil physical, chemical and biological properties, and is essential if soils are to be used as a repository of C to mitigate atmospheric CO2 increases. Although tillage is assumed to have a major influence on soil C retention, the extent to which tillage enhances the transfer of soil C to the atmosphere is uncertain. We assessed the short-term (50 h) influence of tillage on CO2 fluxes from Chernozemic soils under a two-year wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-summerfallow rotation in a semi-arid region of the Canadian Prairie. The tillage effect and its persistence were assessed by using a portable CO2 analyzer to record several temporal series of CO2 fluxes, along undisturbed and tilled transects, at successive time intervals (from -0.5 to 50 h) after a single pass with a heavy-duty cultivator. Immediately after tillage, CO2 fluxes along the tilled transects increased from 2 to 4-fold above pre-tillage fluxes, but the increases were short-lived and fluxes along undisturbed and tilled transects were again similar within 24 h of cultivation. Total amounts of CO2 released by a tillage operation were quantified by: 1. linear interpolations among successive fluxes along tilled and undisturbed transects, and 2. by fitting a model to successive differences between fluxes along the transects. Both methods estimated the amounts of tillage-susceptible CO2 to be in the range of 3.6-7.2 kg C ha-1. The tillage-induced flush of CO2 was attributed mainly to enhanced transport of CO2 already in the soil, but enhanced production of CO2 by heterotrophic soil organisms also may have contributed to the flush. Regardless of the sources of CO2 released by single tillage operations, amounts of tillage-susceptible soil C were minor; even 10 passes with a cultivator would account for less than 5% of annual soil CO2 emissions or crop residue production in these cropping systems. Our study suggested that the short-term influence of tillage on the transfer of soil C to atmospheric CO2 is small under semi-arid conditions like those in southern Alberta, Canada.

Controlled addition of three different carbon sources (amino acids, carbohydrates, and humics) at three different concentrations (500, 1,000, and 2,000 ppb carbon) in the presence and absence of chlorine were used in separate experiments. An additional experiment was run with a 1:1:2 mixture of the above carbon sources. Biofilm and effluent total and culturable cells in addition to total and dissolved organic carbon were measured in order to estimate specific growth rates (SGRs), observed yields, population densities, and bacterial carbon production rates. Bacterial carbon production rates (μg C/L day) were extremely high in the control biofilm communities (range = 295-1,738). Both growth rate and yield decreased with increasing carbon concentrations. Therefore, biofilm growth rates were zero-order with respect to the carbon concentrations used in these experiments. There was no correlation between growth rate and carbon concentration, but there was a significant negative correlation between growth rate and biofilm cell density (r = -0.637, p = 0.001 control and r = -0.57, p = 0.021 chlorinated biofilms). Growth efficiency was highest at the lowest carbon concentration (range = 12-4.5%, amino acids and humics respectively). Doubling times ranged from 2.3-15.4 days in the control biofilms and 1-12.3 days in the chlorinated biofilms. Growth rates were significantly higher in the presence of chlorine for the carbohydrates, humics, and mixed carbon sources (p = 0.004, < 0.0005, 0.013, respectively). The concept of r/K selection theory was used to explain the results with respect to specific growth rates and yields. Humic removal by the biofilm bacteria (78% and 56% for the control and chlorinated biofilms, respectively) was higher than previously reported literature values for planktonic bacteria. A number of control experiments indicated that filtration of drinking water was as effective as chlorination in controlling bacterial biofilm growth.",,"bacterial growth; biofilm growth; biofilm reactor; carbon source; chlorination; chlorine; concentration response; drinking water; filtration; growth inhibition; growth rate; heterotrophic bacterium; mixture; model; simulation; water purification; water supply; bacterium; biofilm; chlorination; growth; nutrient availability; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0343238381

Leaf-level CO2 and H2O exchange responses and plant and soil water relations were examined in a maturing loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stand in a free-air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiment in North Carolina, USA to test if these parameters were affected by elevated CO2. Current-year foliage in the canopy was continuously exposed to elevated CO2 (ambient CO2 + 200 μmol mol-1) in free-air during needle growth and development for up to 400 d. Photosynthesis in upper canopy foliage was stimulated by 50-60% by elevated CO2 compared with ambient controls. This enhancement was similar in current-year, ambient-grown foliage temporarily measured at elevated CO2 compared with long-term elevated CO2 grown foliage. Significant photosynthetic enhancement by CO2 was maintained over a range of conditions except during peak drought. There was no evidence of water savings in elevated CO2 plots in FACE compared to ambient plots under drought and non-drought conditions. This was supported by evidence from three independent measures. First, stomatal conductance was not significantly different in elevated CO2 versus ambient trees of P. taeda. Calculations of time-integrated c(i)/c(a) ratios from analysis of foliar δ13C showed that these ratios were maintained in foliage under elevated CO2. Second, soil moisture was not significantly different between ambient and elevated CO2 plots during drought. Third, pre-dawn and mid-day leaf water potentials were also unaffected by the seasonal CO2 exposure, as were tissue osmotic potentials and turgor loss points. Together the results strongly support the hypothesis that maturing P. taeda trees have low stomatal responsiveness to elevated CO2. Elevated CO2 effects on water relations in loblolly pine-dominated forest ecosystems may be absent or small apart from those mediated by leaf area. Large photosynthetic enhancements in the upper canopy of P. taeda by elevated CO2 indicate that this maturing forest may have a large carbon sequestration capacity with limiting water supply.","CO2 assimilation; Drought; Elevated CO2; Free-air CO2 enrichment; Loblolly pine photosynthesis; Pine forest canopy; Pinus taeda L.; Stable carbon isotopes; Stomata; Water stress","canopy exchange; carbon dioxide enrichment; coniferous forest; photosynthesis; water relations; water use; United States; Pinus taeda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033046330

The model domain is located over the Arctic, but includes the majority of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions in western and eastern Europe, which together make up about 1/3 of the global CO2 emissions. The model is run for several winter periods, using anthropogenic CO2 emissions only, and the results are compared with independent CO2 measurements taken at a monitoring station on Spitsbergen in the high Arctic. We show that the initial concentrations and boundary values of the domain are not crucial for the results, and conclude that most of the measured variability above the winter baseline in CO2 at the Arctic monitoring station emanates from recent CO2 sources within the model domain. From the observed small spatial variability in the monthly mean atmospheric CO2 mixing ratio in the north Atlantic region, we assume that there is only little net exchange between the atmosphere and ocean during the studied periods. Based on the co-variation between CO2 and particulate mass, we hypothesise that most of the measured CO2 variability is due to anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions, although we can not rule out a biogenic CO2 component. Using the transport model, we compare different estimates of fossil-fuel consumption in the mid-latitudes. We find that the industrial centres and the surrounding gas-fields in the lower-Ob region (60°-72°N, 65°-80°E) occasionally have a much larger impact on the CO2 measurements at Spitsbergen than follows from a recent CO2 emission inventory. This implies that there may be an overlooked CO2 source in this region, possibly flaring of gas.",,"advection; anthropogenic source; atmospheric transport; carbon dioxide; Arctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032829921

Using the XANES spectra as fingerprints, we can analyse the influence of the local environment of the absorbing atom on the shape of the absorption spectra and the energy positions of the resonances. Effects caused by the first and by higher coordination shells can be distinguished by systematic variations of the type of atoms surrounding the phosphorus atom. The effect of the first coordination shell is to reflect the electronegativity of the nearest neighbours and the valency of the excited atom: the white line shifts to higher energies with increasing electronegativity of the neighbouring atoms and valency of the absorbing atom. Furthermore, we show that an aromatic substituent in the higher coordination shells causes a splitting of the first strong resonance. This can be traced back to the formation of a delocalised π-electron system which shortens the P-Caryl bond length because of its positive mesomeric effect. MS Xα calculations verify this assumption and indicate that the double-resonance structure can be interpreted by transitions of a 1s electron into the various unoccupied p-orbitals. These orbitals are mainly formed by phosphorus and carbon in the case of the low-energy resonance and by phosphorus and the chalcogene in the case of the high-energy resonance of the splitted white line.

Carbonate-banded iron formation (BIF) platforms characterised the first such event, at ca 2.6-2.4 Ga (Africa and Australia) to 2.7 Ga (India). These earlier globally enhanced sea levels are ascribed to increased mid-ocean ridge activity, possibly related to breakup of a postulated Late Archaean 'southern' supercontinent. Alternatively, a transition from global-scale catastrophic mantle overturn events to the onset of plate tectonics may have occurred in the Late Archaean (Nelson, 1998. Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 158, 109-119). Both explanations of increased mid-ocean ridge activity are compatible with significant Early to Middle Archaean crustal growth (Armstrong, 1981. Phil. Trans. R Soc. London A 301, 443-472), with the emergent high freeboard cratons being subjected to aggressive weathering and erosion. Enhanced continental crustal growth near the Archaean-Proterozoic boundary (McLennan and Taylor, 1982. J. Geol. 90, 347-361), related to the development of significant island arc complexes, would have resulted in common lowered freeboard-enhanced sea level conditions at the passive margins of the 'southern' cratons. The diachronous nature of these earlier transgressions in the various cratons may reflect the effect of local tectonic movements and/or the thermal state of the cratons. From ca 2.4-2.2 Ga, cratons that make up the present-day continents of India, Africa and Australia had relatively high continental freeboard and lowered sea levels. Glacigenic deposits are preserved on the Kaapvaal (Africa), Singhbhum (India) and Pilbara (Australia) cratons. The second broadly defined drowning event, at ca <2.2 and >2.15 Ga, was probably due to post-glacial climatic amelioration. Freeboard was reduced by the combination of eustatic rise and the reestablishment of aggressive weathering as warmer palaeoclimates returned. In India, carbonates were more prominent than the siliciclastic sediments (including prominent black shales) seen in Africa and Australia.","Archaean; Continental freeboard; Proterozoic; Sea level; Volcano-sedimentary record","Archean; continental freeboard; eustacy; mid-ocean ridge; sea level change; Africa; Australia; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033452235

The effects of cerium oxide addition on the cobalt particle size, on the reducibility of the cobalt and on the catalytic performance (activity and selectivity) of a Co/SiO2 catalyst have been studied. The catalysts have been prepared with an original method combining the coprecipitation of the precursors of cobalt and cerium by oxalic acid with the hydrolysis and condensation of the tetraethoxysilane. The crystallite size measurements (TEM) of Co3O4 and CeO2, which are the only structures detected by XRD and XPS in oxidized samples, indicated that the presence of cerium had a dispersing effect on the cobalt. It was also found that the ceria was well dispersed on the silica support. The reduction experiments (TPR and XPS) under hydrogen at 673 K showed that the reduction rate of ceria supported on SiO2 was similar to that of ceria with high specific surface area. The cobalt reduction degree decreased with the addition of cerium, even in low concentration. It was however equivalent for the Co/CeO2, Co-Ce(38.2 wt%)/SiO2 and Co/SiO2 catalysts allowing to conclude that the extent of cobalt reduction at 773 K was not very much affected by the reduction state of ceria. The catalytic activities (TOF) (P=2 MPa, T=493 K, H2/CO=2/1) of Co-CeO2/SiO2 and Co/SiO2 catalysts were similar. With the addition of cerium significant changes in hydrocarbon selectivities were observed: decrease in C2+ hydrocarbon selectivity and production of gasoline to the detriment of the C22+ fraction (chain growth probability (α) from 0.82 to 0.87 for Co-CeO2/SiO2 catalysts and 0.92 for the unpromoted catalyst). This modification was attributed to a smaller cobalt particle size, to the specific adsorption/desorption properties of H2 and CO on Co-CeO2/SiO2 catalysts and also to the possible presence of formate species, which could be formed on the partially reduced ceria pointed out by H2 and CO TPD studies. The hydrogenation of these species could explain the additional methane production in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis under pressure. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The training system was the typical 'goblet' for Manto Negro and a bilateral cordon for Tempranillo. The vineyards were cultivated without irrigation, as is traditional in this area. The daily carbon assimilation was estimated from diurnal time courses of leaf photosynthesis in eight different canopy positions at three different dates from mid July to mid August. The upper canopy layer (level 4) was the more active one. From July to August photosynthesis dropped from 350 to 150 mmol m~2 day' for Manto Negro and from 525 to 60 mmol m~2 day-1 for Tempranillo. Apart from level 4, the highest values were found in southeast and northwest-facing leaves of the upper levels (3 and 5), and the lowest in the inner part of the canopy (level 8). Intrinsic water use efficiency increased along the growing season for all levels. The highest values corresponded to the highest daily carbon assimilation. At the end of the growing season (early September), the total leaf area and dry mass and fruit weight were measured. Level 8 had 29% of the total plant leaf dry matter in Tempranillo, and 39% in Manto Negro. The remanding levels fluctuated between 5 and 20%. Estimates of the contribution of each level to fruit growth plant production were obtained showing good agreement with plant berry weight at harvest.","Canopy levels; Leaf area; Photosynthesis; Plant production; Vitis vinifera","Vitaceae; Vitis; Vitis vinifera",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001675768

Palladium-on-stabilised alumina has been found to be the most efficient catalyst for the complete oxidation of methane to carbon dioxide and water. However, its poor durability is considered to be an obstruction for the development of catalytic combustion. This work was aimed at identifying the origin of this deactivation: metal sintering, support sintering, transformation PdO → Pd + 1/2 O2 or coking. Catalytic combustion of methane was studied in a 15 mm i.d. and 50 mm length lab reactor and in a 25 mm i.d. pilot test rig on monolithic honeycomb substrates. Experiments were performed at GHSV of 50 000 h-1 in lab test and 500 000 h-1 in pilot test. The catalysts used were palladium on different supports on cordierite substrate. The catalysts were characterised by XRD, STEM, ATG and XPS. In steady-state conditions, deactivation has been found to be dependent on the air/methane ratio, the palladium content on the washcoat and the amount of washcoat on the substrate. An oscillating behaviour of the methane conversion was even observed under specific conditions, due to the reducibility of palladium oxide PdO to Pd. The influence of the nature of the support on the catalyst deactivation was also investigated. It has been shown that some supports can surprisingly eliminate this oscillating behaviour. However, in pilot test, deactivation was found to be very rapid, even with stabilised alumina supports. Furthermore, successive tests performed on the same catalyst revealed that the activity (light-off temperature, conversion) falls strongly from one test to another. Then, the stabilised alumina support was calcined at 1230°C for 16 h prior to its impregnation by palladium, in order to rule out its sintering. Experiments carried out on precalcined catalysts point out that deactivation is mostly correlated to the metal transformation under reaction conditions: activity decreases gradually as PdO sinters, but it dropped much more steeply in relation to appearance of metallic palladium. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

These calculations verify that multiple collisions between the light ""diluent"" gas and heavier ""seed"" rotor molecules result in a distribution of rotor molecules with negative alignment (a2&lt;0), i.e., a preference for j perpendicular to the expansion axis. These rotational alignment effects are found to be robustly insensitive to collision energy and qualitatively similar for all three collision systems, thereby providing a useful basis for comparison with experimental studies. The asymptotic alignment is observed to depend strongly on the angular momentum, increasing monotonically with j. When analyzed on a collision-by-collision basis, this j dependence can be traced to gyroscopic stability, i.e., higher j states are classically more resistant to the collisional loss of alignment. In addition, collisional formation of the alignment is found to reflect comparable contributions from both elastic (mj-changing) and inelastic (j-changing) collisions. Finally, the calculations indicate that molecules with j aligned parallel to the expansion axis are correlated with faster average velocities than molecules with j perpendicular to the axis, which is consistent with the He+CO experimental studies of Harich and Wodtke [J. Chem. Phys. 107, 5983 (1997)], as well as the He+N2+ drift tube studies of Anthony et al. [J. Chem.

Box 9825, Beijing, 100029, China","Based on a detailed study of ore fabrics, microbial remains, stable isotopes, and organic matter, the characteristics of the Late Sinian Gaoyan Mn-carbonate ores can be summarized as follows: (1) Ores have massive, laminated, spheroid-banded, and spheroidal structures. (2) Microbial remains, such as Sphareocongregus variabilis (Moorman, 1974) and Eoentophysalis sp. occur in the ores. (3) The ores contain abundant rhodochrosite, pyrite, and siliceous microframboids and possibly also multicellular magnetotactic aggregates. (4) Ca rhodochrosite in spheroidal ores always has a fibrous texture, similar to that of calcite reported to form as a product of bacterial fermentation. (5) The organic matter of ore samples records a relatively mild thermal history (up to catagenesis). Hopane and sterane indicate that bacteria and algae were the likely sources of the organic matter. (6) The mean value of δ13C(PDB) for micritic dolostone overlying the ore beds is -3.3‰, and for Mn-carbonate ores, -4.9‰. No positive correlation exists between the MnO content and δ13C(PDB) values, which is used as an indicator of enrichment of Mn in rhodochrosite formed during sulfate reduction. The above characteristics indicate that the Gaoyan Mn-carbonate ores were rich in organic matter and that sulfate reduction during early diagenesis was well developed. However, δ13C(PDB) values of Mn-carbonate ores are not consistent with formation solely in the zone of sulfate reduction. It is also difficult to explain the carbon source of the Gaoyan carbonate ores as being only from seawater bicarbonate and CO2 produced during sulfate reduction. We suggest that an integrated model for the origin of Gaoyan Mn-carbonate ores must include a combination of primary sedimentation, sulfate reduction, and fermentation processes.","Gaoyan deposit; Microbial processes; Mn carbonate; Sichuan China; Sinian","China; Eontophysalis; fermentation; manganese carbonate; microbial activity; model; ore; organic matter; sedimentation; Sphaereocongregus variabilis; sulfate reduction; manganese; metallogenesis; microbial activity; mineralization; Proterozoic; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033383411

Paleogeographic reconstruction places the deposits at the time of their formation in a gulf between Chengdu submarine rise and the Kangdian continent. The Jiaodingshan and Dawashan deposits occur in algal-reef facies, the former in an atoll-like structure and the latter in a pinnacle reef. Ores are mainly composed of rhodochrosite, kutnahorite, hausmannite, braunite, manganosite, and bementite. Dark red, yellowish-pink, brown, green-gray, and black ores are massive, banded, laminated, spheroidal, and cryptalgal (oncolite, stromatolite, algal filaments) boundstones. Blue, green, and red algal fossils show in situ growth positions. Samples of high-grade Jiaodingshan and Dawashan ores assay as much as 66.7% MnO. Jiaodingshan Mn carbonate ores have mean contents of Ba, Co, and Pb somewhat higher than in Dawashan ores. Cobalt is widely distributed and strongly enriched in all rock types as compared to its crustal mean content. Cobalt is correlated with Cu, Ni, and MgO in both deposits and additionally with Ba and Zn in the Dawashan deposit. The δ13C(PDB) values of Mn carbonate ores (-7.8 to -16.3‰) indicate contributions of carbon from both seawater bicarbonate and the bacterial degradation of organic matter, the latter being 33% to 68%, assuming about -24‰ for the δ13C(PDB) of the organic matter. Host limestones derived carbon predominantly from seawater bicarbonate (δ13C(PDB) of +0.2 to -7‰). NW-trending fault zones controlled development of lithofacies, whereas NE-trending fault zones provided pathways for movement of fluids. The source of Co, Ni, and Cu was mainly from weathering of mafic and ultramafic rocks on the Kangdian continent, whereas contemporaneous volcanic eruptions were of secondary importance. The reefs were likely mineralized during early diagenesis under shallow burial. The reefs were highly porous and acted as the locus for metasomatic replacement by Mn that combined with CO2 produced during oxidation of organic matter in the zone of sulfate reduction and seawater bicarbonate. That metasomatic replacement formed the rhodochrosite ores.","Co enrichments; Dawashan and Jiaodingshan ores; Mn carbonate ore; Ordovician carbonate reefs","manganese; metallogenesis; mineralization; Ordovician; reef; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033369067

Each year, because of low boiler efficiency, 75 million tons of coal is wasted and 130 million tons of excess CO2 are emitted. An analysis of 250 boiler thermal-balance test certificates and 6 field visits in three provinces have shown that: (1) boilers with efficiencies of less than 70% account for 75% of the total boiler-population; (2) the main causes of the low efficiencies are high excess air and unburned carbon in the slag and fly ash. The effect of unburned carbon on CO2 emission is a balance of positive and negative contributions: while the unburned carbon does not produce CO2 emissions, its replacement carbon, burned at a low efficiency, contributes to a net increase in CO2 emissions. It seems from the analysis that the average boiler efficiency can be raised to 73% by relatively simple means, such as the size grading of the coal, improved boiler operating practice and some inexpensive equipment modifications. This could then result in savings each year of 34 million tons of coal and a reduction in CO2 emissions of 63 million tons at an estimated cost of $10 per ton of CO2. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Coal utilization; Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Coal fired boilers; carbon emission; emission control; energy efficiency; energy use; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032766629

Scaling laws known to operate in our solar system (including scaling laws of planetary magnetic fields and the radiometric Bode's law of radio power generation) are applied to the extrasolar systems. We consider the possibility that each of the extrasolar planets possesses a substantial planetary magnetic field which is in quasi-continuous interaction with the local stellar wind. Cyclotron emission from extrasolar planets is then driven by the stellar wind/magnetospheric interaction, much like the coherent cyclotron radio emission processes associated with planets in our solar system. Based on the model results, the best candidate for solar-wind-driven cyclotron emission is Tau Bootes, with an expected median amplitude of about 2 janskys (1 Jy = 10-26 W m-2 Hz-1) at 28 MHz, an intensity level of about a factor of 100 below the current limit of detectability. However, variations in the local stellar medium could conceivably increase power levels by a factor of 100 for short periods of time. Like the solar planets, the extrasolar planets should radiate episodically, with emission reoccurring at the planetary rotation period. Thus spectral integration techniques could also be applied to improve the likelihood of detectability.

The latitudinal gradient observed in the pollen data was confirmed by the climatic reconstructions: there is a gradient from north to south both for temperatures and precipitation. At the beginning of the Pliocene (5.32-5 Ma), the climate in the North Mediterranean area was, on average, warmer and more humid than today (respectively 1-4°C and 400-700 mm). In the South Mediterranean region, the climate was both warmer and drier than today (respectively equal to or 5°C higher and drier or equal humidity). The pollen-based climate estimates were then used to reconstruct biomes for the region. The results show the occurrence of three biomes: the broad-leaved evergreen/warm mixed forest, the xerophytic woods/scrub biome and the warm grass/shrub biome.

In each lot, two groupings of six 60-m2 plots were established in sites where the forest had been recently felled; plots were arranged as rays in a star-shaped pattern, with pre- and post-burn measurements made in alternate rays. Pre- and post-burn above-ground biomass was estimated by cutting and weighing the felled vegetation in 15 pre-burn and 18 post-burn plots (three pre-burn plots could not be weighed before one of the colonists burned the clearing) and by line intersect sampling (LIS) done along the axis of each of the 36 plots. Because of the high variability of the initial biomass present in the plots, volume data from LIS were more reliable for assessing change in the biomass of material over 10 cm in diameter (because this technique permits measuring the same trees before, and after, burning); other quantities relied on data from direct weighing. The best estimate of the mean pre-burn above-ground biomass at the site is 263 metric tons per hectare (tha-1); considering available measurements of the proportion of below-ground biomass elsewhere in Amazonia, the total dry weight biomass at the Altamira site corresponds to ≃322 t ha-1. Assuming 50% carbon (C) content for biomass, the above-ground biomass at Altamira represents a carbon stock of 130 t ha-1. Assuming a carbon content of 75% for charcoal, 1.3% of the pre-burn aboveground carbon stock was converted to charcoal, substantially less than is generally assumed in global carbon models. Measurements at Altamira imply a 42% reduction of above-ground carbon pools if calculated along with the scattered trees that farmers leave standing in their clearings, or 43% if these trees are excluded from the analysis. These values are substantially higher than the 27,6% measured in an earlier study near Manaus. However, most of the difference between results at the two sites is explained by differences in the distribution of initial biomass among the fractions, especially greater quantities of vines and of litter (including dead wood &lt;5 cm in diameter) than at Manaus. Smaller diameter pieces bum more thoroughly than larger ones. At Altamira, the large percentage of above-ground carbon in vines (12.0%) is less typical of Amazonian forests than the lower percentage at Manaus (3.1%). The lower overall burning efficiency found at Manaus is, therefore, believed to be more typical of Amazonian burning. High variability indicates a need for further studies in many localities, and for perfecting less laborious indirect methods. Both a high biomass and low percentage of charcoal formation suggest significant potential contribution of forest burning to global climate changes from CO2 and trace gases.","Biomass; Burning; Carbon dioxide; Deforestation; Greenhouse gases; Rainforest; Tropical forest","biomass; burning; charcoal; tropical forest; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033547216

Visible emission profiles in a poloidal plane show that in ELMing H-mode prior to deuterium gas injection, CIII emission peaks in the inner SOL near the X-point and deuterium emission (from ionization and recombination) peaks at the inner target plate near the inner strike point (ISP). The spatial profiles of the recombination and ionization zones, determined by forming images of the ratio of intensities from simultaneous images of Dα and Dγ emission, show that recombination dominates the inner leg emission near the target; ionization dominates in a poloidally narrow zone upstream in the inner leg. After deuterium injection, when the PDD transition begins, the profiles of carbon visible emission show first an increase in the inner SOL near the X-point, followed by increases in emission in the lower regions of the outer leg. Deuterium emission at the transition onset decreases at the ISP and increases across the private flux region below the X-point. As the transition to PDD conditions proceeds the deuterium emission increases in the private flux region: recombination dominates near the floor and ionization higher near the X-point. Carbon emission appears along both divertor legs and at the X-point. In the final quasi-steady PDD state, the recombination emission in the outer leg is near the separatrix and along the target plate; emission from collisional excitation dominates in the upper part of the outer leg just below the X-point, and carbon emission is localized at the X-point. These results suggest that transport of neutral deuterium between the inner and outer divertor legs through the private flux region plays an important role in the initiation of outer leg detachment in DIII-D.",,"Carbon; Deuterium; Impurities; Ionization; Divertors; Inner strike point (ISP); Tokamak devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032688813

This stress, coupled with future uncertainties regarding climate change, makes arid and semiarid regions particularly vulnerable. One example is the Aral Sea where the freshwater inflow, which is dominated by snowmelt runoff, has decreased significantly since the expansion of intensive irrigation in the 1960s. The purpose of this paper is to use a river routing scheme from a global climate model to examine the flow of the Amu Dar'ya River into the Aral Sea. The river routing scheme is modified to include groundwater flow, flooding, and evaporative losses in the river's wetlands and floodplain and anthropogenic withdrawals for irrigation. A set of scenarios is designed to test the sensitivity of river flow to the inclusion of these modifications into the river routing scheme. When riverine wetlands and floodplains are present, the river flow is reduced significantly and is similar to the observed flow. In addition, the model results show that it is essential to incorporate human diversions to represent accurately the inflow to the Aral Sea, and they also indicate potential management strategies that might be appropriate to maintain a balance between inflow to the sea and upstream diversions for irrigation.",,"Aral Sea; geology; simulation model; anthropogenic effect; flood; irrigation; river flow; wetland; Uzbekistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033018399

No three-dimensional structural information has been published for this enzyme. We have isolated and characterised N2OR from Alcaligenes xylosoxidans (AxN2OR) as a homodimer of M(r) 134 000 containing seven to eight copper atoms per dimer. Comparison of sequence and compositional data with other N2ORs suggests that AxN2OR is typical and can be expected to have similar domain folding and subunit structure to other members of this family of enzymes. We present synchrotron X-ray-scattering data, analysed using a model-independent method for shape restoration, which gave a ≃ 20 Å resolution structure of the enzyme in solution, providing a glimpse of the structure of any N2OR and shedding light on the molecular architecture of the molecule. The specific activity of AxN2OR was 6 μmol of N2O reduced·min-1.(mg of protein)-1; N2OR activity showed both base and temperature activation. The visible spectrum exhibited an absorption maximum at 550 nm with a shoulder at 635 nm. On oxidation with K3Fe(CN)6, the absorption maximum shifted to 540 nm and a new shoulder at 480 nm appeared. Reduction under anaerobic conditions resulted in the formation of an inactive blue form of the enzyme with a broad absorption maximum at 650 nm. As isolated, the enzyme shows an almost featureless EPR spectrum, which changes on oxidation to give an almost completely resolved seven-line hyperfine signal in the g(II) region, g = 2.18, with A(II) = 40 G, consistent with the enzyme being partially reduced as isolated. Both the optical and EPR spectra of the oxidized enzyme are characteristic of the presence of a Cu(A) centre.","Alcaligenes xylosoxidans; Nitrous oxide reductase; Solution structure; Synchrotron X-ray scattering","nitrous oxide reductase; alcaligenes; article; denitrification; electron spin resonance; enzyme activation; enzyme conformation; enzyme isolation; nonhuman; priority journal; Alcaligenes; Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acids; Bacterial Proteins; Copper; Dimerization; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Enzyme Activation; Kinetics; Metalloproteins; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidoreductases; Protein Conformation; Scattering, Radiation; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Spectrophotometry; Temperature; Achromobacter xylosoxidans; Alcaligenes; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033083840

These targets included frozen carbon dioxide and pure frozen water. Results from these targets were compared with the more traditional liquid water target with and without additives. A very dramatic difference was found between the pure water target in the frozen state when compared with the liquid state. When frozen, more than 95% of the nitrogen-13 activity is in the chemical form of ammonia at all radiation doses. In contrast, the liquid water target yielded predominately nitrates and nitrites at high radiation doses. When frozen carbon dioxide was irradiated under these conditions, more than 95% of the nitrogen-13 activity was in the form of nitrate and nitrite. The nitrogen oxides remained on the surface of the target and could be easily removed from the surface with pure water. The wash solution was converted to [13N]ammonia using the DeVarda's alloy method for reduction. It was determined that levels of [13N]ammonia sufficient for diagnostic medical procedures could be produced directly using the frozen water targets or from frozen carbon dioxide with a wet chemical reduction. These results have significance particularly in the design of targetry for low-energy, high- beam current accelerators, because targets of this design can be used with either no vacuum isolation window or a very thin window. The substitution of carbon-13-enriched carbon dioxide for natural carbon dioxide gives access to the 13C(p,n)13N nuclear reaction, which allows protons energies as low as 6 MeV to be used to produce useable quantities of N-13 ammonia. The mechanism of these reactions has been explored to determine why there are such dramatic differences in the product distribution between the frozen state and the liquid or gaseous state.","Cryogenic targets; N-13 Ammonia; Positron-emitting isotopes","ammonia; carbon 13; carbon dioxide; nitrogen 13; nitrogen oxide; oxygen; water; ammonia formation; article; cyclotron; heart muscle perfusion; isotope labeling; nuclear reactor; phase transition; positron emission tomography; radiation dose; Ammonia; Freezing; Nitrogen Radioisotopes; Tomography, Emission-Computed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033021714

In particular, we investigated the properties and the role of the NADP-reducing flavoprotein and its possible function in cyclic electron transport, the regulation by protons of electron transport, and the redox system of ascorbate and monodehydroascorbate (the ascorbate free radical). The function of this system in providing ATP in the stoichiometric amount needed for carbon assimilation, and the regulation of the alternative transfer of electrons to NADP and to the ascorbate free radical were among the achievements of my collaborators and myself. Specifically, the early conviction that cyclic phosphorylation was essential part in photosynthesis was shattered as far as higher plants are concerned, and replaced by a modified Mehler reaction providing additional ATP to run the Calvin cycle. The situation seems to be different in unicellular green algae, where quantitatively much larger changes of the relative size of Photosystem (PS) I and PS II antennae during the so-called 'state' transitions have been reported, and these seem to be associated with a high activity of cyclic electron transport in state 2. Beyond the science, the friendly interactions with so many persons around the world sharing my interest in photosynthesis and in other aspects of human life have been most rewarding.","Ascorbate redox system; Photophosphorylation; Photosynthetic electron transport; Thylakoids flavoprotein","algae; Chlorophyta; Embryophyta; Viridiplantae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032848558

The succession in the southern part of this basin has been studied both in wells and at outcrop by microfacies analysis. It is composed of 5000 m of shallow marine carbonates and evaporites with a few thin layers of pelagic limestones rich in organic carbon and planktic foraminifera deposited during peak transgressions or maximum flooding. The sedimentation of this thick succession was not continuous, and the section is punctuated by subaerial erosional bounding surfaces and a single hardground which marks the final drowning of the carbonate platform during the late Maastrichtian. New age determinations have been obtained on the basis of planktic and benthic foraminifera from the Aptian to Santonian Coban Formation, D, C, B and A Members. Coban C (Albian) and B (Cenomanian) Members are the present oil reservoirs. The rudist and alveolinid limestones of late Campanian and Maastrichtian age referred to the Campur Formation in the Southern Peten Basin are here reassigned to the Angostura Formation, as recognized in the Chiapas area. The Actela Formation is defined here to encompass the limestone breccia deposits that occur at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary and extend into the Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina Zone of early Danian age. The D, C, B and A Members of the Coban Formation and the Angostura Formation represent second order transgressive and regressive trends in a passive margin area where the deposits indicate a succession of various environments, including fluviatile, salinas, shallow marine carbonate platform, outer shelf and intrashelf basin.

Subsequent treatment with CO or dithionite yielded C(red2). The EPR-silent state formed within 1 min of adding Ti3+ citrate, while C(red2) formed after 60 min. Ti3+ citrate appeared to slow the rate by which C(red2) formed from C(red1) and stabilize the C-cluster in the previously proposed C(int) state. This is the first strong evidence for C(int), and it supports the catalytic mechanism that required its existence. This mechanism is analogous to those used by flavins and hydrogenases to convert between n = 2 and n = 1 processes. Ti3+ citrate had a different effect on enzyme in a CO2 atmosphere; it shifted reduction potentials of metal centers (relative to those obtained using CO) and did not stabilize C(int). Different redox behavior was also observed when methyl viologen and benzyl viologen were used as reductants. This variability was exploited to prepare enzyme samples in which EPR from C(red2) was present without interfering signals from B(red). The saturation properties of B(red) depended upon the redox state of the enzyme. Three saturation 'modes', called Sat1-Sat3, were observed. Sat1 was characterized by a sharp g = 1.94 resonance and low-intensity g = 2.04 and 1.90 resonances, and was observed in samples poised at slightly negative potentials. Sat2 was characterized by weak intensity from all three resonances, and was strictly associated with intermediate redox states and the presence of CO2. Sat3 was characterized by strong broad resonances with normalized intensities essentially unchanged relative to nonsaturating conditions, and was observed at the most negative potentials. Each mode probably reflects different spatial relationships among magnetic components in the enzyme.",,"acetyl coenzyme a synthetase; argon; benzylviologen; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; citric acid; dithionite; hydrogenase; metal ion; paraquat; reducing agent; riboflavin derivative; titanium derivative; article; chemical reaction; clostridium; controlled study; enzyme active site; enzymology; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; oxidation reduction state; priority journal; time; Aldehyde Oxidoreductases; Benzyl Viologen; Binding Sites; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Monoxide; Clostridium; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Multienzyme Complexes; Oxidation-Reduction; Paraquat; Protein Conformation; Titanium; Titrimetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033619709

A framework for examining the socioeconomic impacts associated with changes in the long-term availability of water is developed and applied to the hydrologic implications of the Canadian and British Hadley2 general circulation models (GCMs) for the 18 water resource regions in the conterminous United States. The climate projections of these two GCMs have very different implications for future water supplies and costs. The Canadian model suggests most of the nation would be much drier in the year 2030. Under the least-cost management scenario the drier climate could add nearly $105 billion to the estimated costs of balancing supplies and demands relative to the costs without climate change. Measures to protect instream flows and irrigation could result in significantly higher costs. In contrast, projections based on the Hadley model suggest water supplies would increase throughout much of the nation, reducing the costs of balancing water supplies with demands relative to the no-climate-change case.A greenhouse warming would have major effects on water supplies and demands.

The climate projections of these two GCMs have very different implications for future water supplies and costs. The Canadian model suggests most of the nation would be much drier in the year 2030. Under the least-cost management scenario the drier climate could add nearly $105 billion to the estimated costs of balancing supplies and demands relative to the costs without climate change. Measures to protect instream flows and irrigation could result in significantly higher costs. In contrast, projections based on the Hadley model suggest water supplies would increase throughout much of the nation, reducing the costs of balancing water supplies with demands relative to the no-climate-change case.","Adaptation to climate change; Climate change; Economics; Socioeconomic impacts of climate change; Water and climate; Water management and climate change","Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Management science; Mathematical models; Global circulation models (GCM); Water management; Water supply; climate change; socioeconomic impact; water supply; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033395236

During the period from spring to early autumn of 1997 the exchange of two of the most important greenhouse gases namely carbon dioxide and methane were measured in a high-arctic valley in northeastern Greenland. The results show a significant temporal and spatial variation in the exchange of these gases, as well as a high dependency on the prevailing climatic conditions of this harsh location. From measurements carried out over three dominating vegetation types we found that during the summer season of 1997, the valley was a sink of CO2 in the order of 11.5 g C m-2, with the most densely vegetated areas showing the highest uptake rates. Over the same period the measurements showed that the valley was a source of CH4 with a magnitude of 0.85 g C m-2. Emission rates were mainly related to the soil temperature and to the position of the water table. This paper presents a summary of the most important processes controlling the seasonal dynamics of CO2 and CH4 exchange in high-arctic Greenland.","Carbon dioxide and methane exchange; Climate change; High-arctic Greenland","arctic environment; carbon dioxide; climate change; gas exchange; greenhouse gas; methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033398385

The treatment objectives were (1) to improve volumetric conformance in this CO2 flood by reducing excessive CO2 breakthrough through fractures, and (2) to increase oil recovery from the associated producers. Local reservoir characteristics indicate the need for a large-volume treatment to achieve these goals. The required treatment volume is beyond the economic limits of standard gel systems. Foam gel technology is one way to economically achieve in-depth conformance improvement at Rangely by replacing 60 to 80% of the liquid phase by the less expensive CO2 phase. A gelled foam system was specifically designed for application to Rangely conformance problems. The field-tested surfactant/gel system was designed according to the following criteria: (1) to produce strong and robust gelled foams under the harsh pH conditions of a CO2 flood, (2) to provide enough gelation delay to achieve the injection of a large foam volume with manageable injectivity reduction, and (3) to considerably reduce the unit cost of the treatment fluid relative to standard non-foamed gel systems. This paper describes the methodology used to design and test the optimum gelled foam system for Rangely. Laboratory results are presented to support the chemicals system selection, including gelation kinetics experiments, surfactant selection, and corefloods with supercritical CO2 at field conditions. The candidate well selection process is described, including injection profile surveys, offset well response, and by-passed reserves calculation. Data taken during the injection phase of the program, including injectivity history and on-site quality control monitoring of the chemical system behavior, are given.

This is the temperature at which ablation occurs for the ATJ graphite material for localized heating (1500°C for the face of the tile) and thus represents an operational limit for the tokamak. This theoretical prediction is confirmed by observed increased carbon contamination in the plasma and wearing of the tile edges. Several approaches were investigated to minimize the edge heating by reducing the amount of heat flux on the tiles toroidal and poloidal surfaces. This was accomplished by modifying the geometry of the top two rows of the DIII-D centerpost tiles. For the toroidal surfaces, the geometry of the tile was changed from a facetted to a curved configuration, thereby reducing the angle of surface relative to the plasma field line. For the poloidal surfaces, it is predicted that the heat flux will be reduced by closing the gaps between the tiles. Both of these design changes will be implemented in the DIII-D tokamak during the Radiative Divertor Program (RDP) upgrade in the fall of 1999.",,"Ablation; Carbon; Graphite; Heat flux; Mathematical models; Plasma heating; Temperature; Tokamak devices; Vacuum technology; Plasma field line; Radiative divertor program; Vacuum vessels; Plasma applications",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033294771

Laser techniques offer the ability to measure the concentrations of trace species in a gas stream in `real time' with sensitivity and molecular selectivity not possible with broad band spectroscopic techniques. Until recently, the use of laser-based instruments has been largely limited to laboratory or one-of-a-kind devices. However, the increased availability of solid-state tunable diode lasers, recent advancements in fiber optic coupling and advanced signal processing have made it possible to develop instruments that offer customers enabling technology at an affordable price. Spectrum Diagnostix has developed a family of tunable diode laser-based instruments used in a variety of applications including: fugitive release detection of HF and H2S in the refining and petrochemical industries, stack monitoring, and using extractive sample probe, in situ process control. SpectraScan instruments obtain their high sensitivity and chemical selectivity utilizing a technique known as wavelength modulated spectroscopy. Described simply, a near infra-red diode laser's wavelength is scanned rapidly and repeatedly through a molecular absorption line. A photo-detector senses the instantaneous fraction of emitted laser power that is transmitted through the chemical bearing gas. Measurement of the relative amplitudes of offline to online transmission yields a precise value of the quantity of chemical along the laser beam's path. The amplitude modulated signals are then detected using established radio receiver and signal processing techniques. The SpectraScan monitors are designed for permanent installation in harsh industrial and petrochemical environments and are approved for Class 1, Division 2 hazardous area use.

These are characterized by turn-on electric fields as low as 3.5 V/μm and by long-term stability of the emission current. Comparing different surface properties (topography, field electron emission intensity, surface potential and local electroconductivity distributions) on a large surface area it was found that, in most cases, emission centre position is not coincident with peaks of the surface profile. It has been noted that the diamond films studied are composed from nano-grained phases distinguished by their physical properties. These are thought to be diamond and graphitic phases. The low-field electron emission from the samples studied is considered to be associated with the presence of these phases.

Through production of tropospheric O3, NO(x) emissions lead to positive radiative forcing and warming. But by affecting the concentration of OH radicals, NO(x) also reduces the levels of CH4, thereby giving negative forcing and cooling. The lifetime of NO(x) varies from hours to days, giving large spatial variations in the levels of NO(x). We have selected geographical regions representing different chemical and physical conditions, and chemical and radiative effects of reducing NO(x) emissions by 20% in each region are studied. Due to nonlinearities in the O3 chemistry as well as differences in convective activity, there are large geographical differences in the effect of NO(x) on O3 as well as variations in the annual profile of the changes. The effect of NO(x) emissions on methane is also found to depend on the localisation of the emissions. The calculated ozone and methane forcing are of similar magnitude but of opposite sign. The methane effect acts on a global scale with a delay of approximately a decade, while the ozone effect is of regional character and occurs during weeks.","Emission reductions; Radiative forcing; Regional variation; Sensitivity studies","Radiative forcing; Computational methods; Cooling; Gas emissions; Global warming; Heat convection; Heat radiation; Mathematical models; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Sensitivity analysis; Troposphere; Atmospheric chemistry; hydroxyl radical; methane; nitrogen oxide; ozone; climate forcing; nitrogen oxides; troposphere; article; climate; model; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033103411

The GT13E2 gas turbine at KGRC was manufactured jointly by Kawasaki Heavy Industries (Kill) and Asea Brown Boveri (ASS). Kill and ABS have a joint test program with this facility to research for high reliability, high performance and low emission for the GT13E2 and future gas turbines. The performance of the KGRC GT13E2 has been monitored continuously. It was found from these monitored data that the thermal efficiency has been maintained at a high level and could be recovered by compressor washing when the compressor was fouled Several factors which influence NOx emissions were studied on the gas turbine, and it was found that atmospheric humidity has a major influence on NOx emissions, Also other factors such as the position of the variable inlet guide vanes (VIGV) and fuel gas flow through each burner of the combustor were adjusted to reduce NOx emission. As a result, NOx emission from the KGRC GT13E2 has been maintained at a very low level.

At the 3rd Session of the Conference Of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC-COP3) in Dec. 1997, advanced economic nations adopted an agreement to reduce greenhouse gases emission to 5.2% below the 1990 levels by 2008-2012. So far a number of studies have been carried out on carbon dioxide emission. However, the issue of integrated policy regarding the emission of nitrous oxide and methane issue has been overlooked. But these gases have large GWP (Global Warming Potential) value. A composite policy to control the emission of greenhouse gases is badly needed. In addition to greenhouse effect, nitrous oxide has another negative effect for the environmental degradation of ozone layer. Therefore, reducing emission of the gas will bring a double benefit to the environment. In this paper, we focus on nitrous oxide and try to incorporate the anthropogenic emission structure into economic model in order to control pollution by introducing tax subsidy systems. We present an input-output model which describes emission tax imposed on industries and households. For this purpose, a computer simulation is going on to evaluate the level of GNP and damage cost for environmental protection. We have analyzed four types of pollutants; carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides. Thirty-five industries have been distinguished.

A reducing environment was used to resolve metal ions with variable oxidation states. A suitable counteranion was employed to enable acidic pH to be used and methanol was added to improve the resolution of the electropherograms and to achieve simultaneous determination of several metal ions. Compared to existing capillary electrophoresis (CE) buffers, the buffer developed, based on direct UV detection of ion-pair with weak interaction, gives improved resolution and sharper, more stable and well-resolved peaks. It detects total irons and solves interfering problems due to the variable oxidation states of iron in environmental samples. Compared to existing mostly alkaline CE buffers for metal analysis, the acidic nature of the buffer system developed makes the pretreatment step simpler and reduces the risk of reagent contamination.

The belt-like heterogeneous surfaces are made by removing carbon atoms of the first layer in a line vertically to the permeate direction. Methane and ethane are used as permeating gases. The values of permeation resistance increase almost exponentially with an increase in the potential barrier; the resistance for ethane is always larger than that for methane. In the case of a binary system, the permselectivity is determined by the adsorption equilibrium at the feed side when the potential barrier is low, while it sharply decreases with increasing potential barrier. This result suggests that the separation mechanism changes from the adsorption equilibrium control to the permeation rate control in the pore. The curve of the molar flux of ethane against temperature has a minimum point where temperature is about 510 K.

The mean field in relativistic transport calculations is derived from microscopic Dirac-Brueckner (DB) self-energies, taking non-equilibrium effects, in particular the anisotropy of the local phase space configurations, into account. Thus this approach goes beyond the local density approximation. A detailed analysis of various in-plane and out-of-plane flow observables is presented for Au on Au reactions at incident energies ranging from 250 to 800 A MeV and the results are compared to recent measurements of the FOPI Collaboration. An overall good agreement with in-plane flow data and a reasonable description of the out-of-plane emission is achieved. For these results the intrinsic momentum dependence of the non-equilibrium mean fields is important. On the other hand, the local density approximation with the same underlying DB forces as well as a standard non-linear version of the σω model are less successful in describing the present data. This gives evidence of the applicability of self-energies derived from the DB approach to nuclear matter also far from saturation and equilibrium. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.","Dirac-Brueckner; Non-equilibrium mean field; Nucleon flow; Relativistic BUU, Au + Au, E = 250-800 MeV/nucleon reaction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033525982

Dissociation of the labeled β2m from the ternary complex restored the probe's fluorescence and absorption spectra and reduced the emission intensity. Thus changes in xanthene probe fluorescence upon association/dissociation of the labeled β2m molecule with/from the ternary complex provide a simple and convenient method for studying the assembly/dissociation mechanism of the class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) encoded molecule. The photophysical changes in the probe can be accounted for by the oligomerization of free labeled β2m molecules. The fluorescence at 610 nm is due to β2m dimers, where the probes are significantly separated spatially so that their emission and excitation properties are close to those of xanthene monomers. Fluorescence around 630 nm is due to β2m oligomers where xanthene probes interact. Minima in the steady-state excitation (550 nm) and emission (630 nm) anisotropy spectra correlate with the maxima of the high-order oligomer excitation and emission spectra, showing that their fluorescence is more depolarized. These photophysical features are explained by splitting of the first singlet excited state of interacting xanthene probes that can be modeled by exciton theory.",,"beta 2 microglobulin; major histocompatibility antigen class 1; xanthene; anisotropy; article; excitation; fluorescence; molecular probe; oligomerization; protein assembly; spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033020586

Recent efforts have concentrated on evaluating the involvement of different isocitrate dehydrogenases, distinguished by co-factor specificity and sub-cellular localization.

The main fuel used in vehicular transportation is gasoline, and the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is now an alternative as low emission technology to decrease the environmental impact of transportation operations. The environmental impact of commercial gasoline consumption in the Valley of Mexico was estimated by on-road and FTP-75 testing of three formulations of gasoline (one leaded [octane 81] and two unleaded [one octane 87 and one octane 93]). A fleet of 30 vehicles was used: 10 were chosen that had pre-1990 technology, while 12 were 1991-1996 vehicles equipped with fuel injection, catalytic converters, and air/ fuel ratio control technology. The remaining eight vehicles were high-performance new model vehicles (1995-1996) equipped with the newest technology available for pollution control. Fifteen vehicles in the fleet were also tested for the effect of changing from leaded to unleaded gasoline. Three different LPG formulations were tested using three vehicles representative of the LPG-powered fleet in the MAMC. Two gasoline-to-LPG conversion certified commercial systems were evaluated following the BAR-90 and the HOT-505 procedures. Emissions corresponding to the high-octane (premium) gasoline showed a 15% higher contribution to HCs with a 6% lower reactivity than the 87 octane gasoline; the HCs in the exhaust for premium gasoline are mainly isoparaffins. When the vehicles were tested on the road at high speeds, an average 3% increase in mileage was obtained when vehicles were switched from leaded to unleaded gasoline, while a 5% increase in mileage was observed when vehicles were switched from 87 octane to premium gasoline. The tests of LPG formulations indicated that a change in composition from 60% vol of propane to 85.5% vol reduces levels of HCs and CO emissions; such is not the case for the NOx emissions. The higher the concentration of propane, the higher the levels of NOx that reached values above the maximum limits set by the environmental standard. A value of 70% vol of propane in the LPG mixture, with variations no greater than 4%, seems to be the best method for reducing pollutant emissions in Mexico City. © 1999 Air and Waste Management Association.",,"carbon monoxide; fuel; gasoline; hydrocarbon; liquefied petroleum gas; nitrogen oxide; octane; air pollutant; altitude; article; environmental impact assessment; exhaust gas; Mexico; motor vehicle; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032599722

Negative DC bias voltage at the substrate and the composition of the process gas are two significant parameters in the deposition process. By applying a higher bias voltage the growth rate is increased. The dependence on the ratio of CH4 to Ar shows a saturation effect in the region of high CH4 concentration. This shows the significant contribution of an ion current to the film growth and a rf/mf power limited ion current in the selected parameter range. A decrease of the Cr content in the a-C:H films by increasing the CH4 to Ar flow ratio is measured by XPS while a correlation of the density of the electronic states at the Fermi level with the metal content in the a-C:H matrix is observed by UPS. No significant change in the ratio of sp2 to disordered bonded carbon atoms in the films deposited with the two methods is observed by Raman spectroscopy.

The complete assimilation of these compounds requires two additional routes that specifically catabolize the phenylacetyl-CoA or the benzoyl-CoA generated from these polyesters through β-oxidation. Genetic studies have allowed the cloning, sequencing, and disruption of the genes included in the pha locus (phaC1, phaC2, and phaZ) as well as those related to the biosynthesis of precursors (fadD) or to the catabolism of their derivatives (acuA, fadA, and paa genes). Additional experiments showed that the blockade of either ladd orphaC1 hindered the synthesis and accumulation of plastic polymers. Disruption of phaC2 reduced the quantity of stored polymers by two-thirds. The blockade of phaZ hampered the mobilization of the polymer and decreased its production. Mutations in the paa genes, encoding the phenylacetic acid catabolic enzymes, did not affect the synthesis or catabolism of polymers containing either 3-hydroxyaliphatic acids or 3-hydroxy-n-phenylalkanoic acids with an odd number of carbon atoms as monomers, whereas the production of polyesters containing units of 3-hydroxy-n-phenylalkanoic acids with an even number of carbon atoms was greatly reduced in these bacteria.

Moreover, Na+0 depletion resulted in a decreased cytosolic pH (pH(i)), suggesting involvement of a Na+-dependent pH(i) regulatory mechanism during the P-initiated AR. We now report that the decreased pH(i) resulting from Na+0 depletion is reversible and mediated by a Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) mechanism. To determine the role of an NHE in the regulation of pH(i), capacitated spermatozoa were incubated in Na+-deficient, bicarbonate/CO2-buffered (ONaB) medium for 15-30 min, which resulted in an intracellular acidification as previously reported. These spermatozoa were then transferred to Na+-containing, bicarbonate/CO2-buffered (NAB) medium; Na+-containing, Hepes-buffered (NaH) medium; or maintained in the ONaB medium. Included in the NaH medium was the NHE inhibitor 5-(N-ethyl-N- isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA). The steady-state pH(i) was then determined by spectrofluorometric measurement of bis(carboxyethyl)5(6)-carboxyfiuoroscein (BCECF) fluorescence. EIPA (0.1 μM) significantly (P &lt; 0.05) inhibited the pH(i) recovery produced by Nail medium. Moreover, the pH(i) in Nail medium was not significantly (P &lt; 0.05) different than NaB medium. These results indicate that a Na+-dependent, bicarbonate-independent pH(i) regulatory mechanism, with a pharmacological characteristic consistent with an NHE, is present in capacitated spermatozoa. In support of the involvement of a sperm NHE, we also demonstrated specific immunoreactivity for a 100 kBa porcine sperm protein using an NHE-1 Specific monoclonal antibody. Interestingly, no significant (P = 0.79) effect was seen on the P-initiated AR when EIPA was included in either the Nail or NaB medium. While these findings suggest that inhibition of NHE-dependent pH(i) regulation in capacitated spermatozoa is not sufficient to block initiation of the AR by P, they do not preclude the possibility that an NHE mediates the regulation of capacitation or sperm motility.","Acrosome reaction; Ethylisopropyl amiloride; NHE; Progesterone","bicarbonate; acidification; acrosome reaction; article; cell pH; human; human cell; male; priority journal; proton sodium exchange; regulatory mechanism; spermatozoon capacitation; spermatozoon motility; transport kinetics; Acrosome; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Immunoblotting; Intracellular Fluid; Male; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sodium-Hydrogen Antiporter; Sperm Capacitation; Spermatozoa; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032924197

An ammonia-water generator absorber heat exchange system was developed and modeled to use waste heat from the boiler flue gases and deliver chilled water. Based on approximately 1000 process steam boilers at an average throughput of 2000 kg/h in one metropolitan area in India, the study estimates that installation of these systems could result in annual operating cost savings of $10,200,000 in this region alone. These 1000 systems would also reduce the installed electric capacity needs by 16 MW. Annual coal consumption would decrease by 87,000 tonnes, while ash production would decrease by 39,000 tonnes. Carbon-based emissions are estimated to decrecKe by 176,000 tonnes. Therefore, installation of these systems on a countrywide basis and also in other developing countries with high yearround cooling loads and coal-ba.sed power generation would significantly alleviate installed power capacity shortages, conserve energy resources, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. © 1999 by ASME.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033201182

In all five models, the responses of global surface temperature and column water vapour are non-linear and fairly tightly constrained. Thus, global warming lies between 1.9 and 2.7 K at doubled, and between 3.1 and 4.1 K at tripled, CO2, whilst column water vapour increases by between 3.5 and 4.5 mm at doubled, and between 7 and 8 mm at tripled, CO2. Global cloud fraction tends to decrease by 1-2% out to tripled CO2, mainly the result of decreases in low cloud. Global increases in column water, and differences m these increases between models, are mainly determined by the warming of the tropical oceans relative to the middle and high latitudes; these links are emphasised in the zonal profiles of warming and column water vapour increase, with strong water vapour maxima in the tropics. In all models the all-sky shortwave flux to the surface S↓ (global, annual average) changes by less than 5 W m-2 out to tripled CO2, in some cases being essentially invariant in time. In contrast, the longwave flux to the surface L↓ increases significantly, by 25 W m-2 typically at tripled CO2. The variations of S↓ and L↓ (clear-sky and all-sky fluxes) with increase in CO2 concentration are generally non-linear, reflecting the effects of ocean thermal inertia, but as functions of global warming are close to linear in all five models. This is best illustrated for the clear-sky downwelling fluxes, and the net radiation. Regionally, as illustrated in zonal profiles and global distributions, greatest changes in both S↓ and L↓ are the result primarily of local maxima in warming and column water vapour increases.","Climate change; Model simulations; Surface radiation fluxes","carbon dioxide; climate change; climate modeling; radiation balance; surface flux; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032933926

The feasibility of reducing system cost by minimizing the number of sensors is explored. The objective is to use only the following signals to determine the operational state of the engine: Magneto Voltage Signal (Speed/Load) Engine Temperature Lambda Exhaust Gas Oxygen (Optional) Another objective in the on-going development is to maintain the performance enhancements that EFI offers over carbureted engines: cold starting, fuel economy, and reduced emissions. Special focus is applied to the creation and analysis of a load signal that is related to the torque produced by the engine. Constrained by certain conditions, the load signal is related to the air charge entering the cylinder. The load signal, along with the engine speed signal, provides a basis for a fueling look-up table. The fuel table gives the engine manufacturer greater freedom in tailoring the air/ fuel ratio (A/F) at different operating points. A description is given for how load is calculated from the periodic speed fluctuations between the power revolution and non-power revolution. The algorithms and required signal processing are described to achieve an accurate measure of this signal. A high-pass filter is used on the speed samples to reduce noise before the calculation of the load signal. Issues pertaining to throttle transitions, application load transitions, application inertia effects and inertia compensation are described.

Hydrogeologic and geochemical theories for ore genesis are explored in this paper with mathematical models that allow for complex permeability fields in two or three dimensions, hydrothermal flows in fault systems, and coupled effects of geochemical reactions. The hydrogeologic framework of carbonate-hosted ores is analyzed with the aim of developing a quantitative understanding of the necessary and sufficient processes required to form large ore deposits. Numerical simulations of basin-scale hydrodynamics and of deposit-scale reactive flow are presented to demonstrate the processes controlling low-temperature Pb-Zn ore genesis in two world-class ore districts, in southeast Missouri, USA, and central Ireland. The numerical models presented here provide a theoretical basis for the following observations: (1) topography-driven brine migration was the most effective mechanism for forming the large ore districts of the Mississippi Valley, such as the Viburnum Trend of southeast Missouri, during the uplift of the Appalachian-Ouachita mountain belt in late Paleozoic time; (2) three-dimensional flow fields were created by a dolomite facies of the Viburnum Trend, which acted as a giant lens for focusing metal and heat in southeast Missouri to produce the largest known concentration of lead in the Earth's crust; (3) ore-mineralization patterns were controlled locally by basement relief, permeability structure, and sandstone pinchouts, because of their effects on cooling and fluid-flow rates along the Viburnum Trend; (4) both density-driven and topography-driven fluid flow were important for ore genesis in the Irish midlands, where brines moved northward away from the Variscan orogen, leaked into the Hercynian basement, and discharged along normal faults up into the sedimentary cover; and (5) mixed convection within northeast-southwest fault planes elevated heat flow and flow rates that fed ore deposition by fluid mixing, in some cases near the Carboniferous seafloor in Ireland.","General hydrogeology; Hydrochemical modeling; Hydrothermal ore deposits; Numerical modeling; Paleohydrology","Carboniferous; Viburnum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000743315

Laboratory, Livermore, CA, United States","The Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP), initiated in 1989 under the auspices of the World Climate Research Programme, undertook the systematic validation, diagnosis, and intercomparison of the performance of atmospheric general circulation models. For this purpose all models were required to simulate the evolution of the climate during the decade 1979-88, subject to the observed monthly average temperature and sea ice and a common prescribed atmospheric CO2 concentration and solar constant. By 1995, 31 modeling groups, representing virtually the entire international atmospheric modeling community, had contributed the required standard output of the monthly means of selected statistics. These data have been analyzed by the participating modeling groups, by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison, and by the more than two dozen AMIP diagnostic subprojects that have been established to examine specific aspects of the models' performance. Here the analysis and validation of the AMIP results as a whole are summarized in order to document the overall performance of atmospheric general circulation-climate models as of the early 1990s. The infrastructure and plans for continuation of the AMIP project are also reported on. Although there are apparent model outliers in each simulated variable examined, validation of the AMIP models' ensemble mean shows that the average large-scale seasonal distributions of pressure, temperature, and circulation are reasonably close to what are believed to be the best observational estimates available. The large-scale structure of the ensemble mean precipitation and ocean surface heat flux also resemble the observed estimates but show particularly large intermodel differences in low latitudes. The total cloudiness, on the other hand, is rather poorly simulated, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. The models' simulation of the seasonal cycle (as represented by the amplitude and phase of the first annual harmonic of sea level pressure) closely resembles the observed variation in almost all regions. The ensemble's simulation of the interannual variability of sea level pressure in the tropical Pacific is reasonably close to that observed (except for its underestimate of the amplitude of major El Niños), while the interannual variability is less well simulated in midlatitudes. When analyzed in terms of the variability of the evolution of their combined space-time patterns in comparison to observations, the AMIP models are seen to exhibit a wide range of accuracy, with no single model performing best in all respects considered. Analysis of the subset of the original AMIP models for which revised versions have subsequently been used to revisit the experiment shows a substantial reduction of the models' systematic errors in simulating cloudiness but only a slight reduction of the mean seasonal errors of most other variables. In order to understand better the nature of these errors and to accelerate the rate of model improvement, an expanded and continuing project (AMIP II) is being undertaken in which analysis and intercomparison will address a wider range of variables and processes, using an improved diagnostic and experimental infrastructure.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002642530

The objective of this study, which was based on soil solution measurements, was to examine the relation between the localized NH3-rich area deriving from one granule and the surrounding plants. The influence of rice on the ammoniacal N was examined in terms of a model of diffusion describing the time course of the ammoniacal N concentration. Treatments were granule mass (1, 2, 3, and 4 g). Since greater amounts of NH3 are expected for larger granules, we asked whether this would hinder N consumption by the plant, and thus delay disappearance of the ammoniacal N from the soil. The soil solution was sampled with probes buried close to the granules. Urea was quickly hydrolyzed in the soil: 78 to 91% of the reaction was performed within 4 d and 95 to 98% within 13 d. As early as 4 d, the ammoniacal N generated was 0.313 mol dm-3 for 2-g granules, with a diffusion coefficient for NH3 of 0.998 cm2 d-1 (equivalent to an instantaneous point source of NH3). In the field, diffusion drove the time course of NH3 until 10 mmol dm-3, a level attained earlier in the lower-mass treatments (1 and 2 g) than in the 3- and 4-g treatments. Thereafter, the patterns of NH3 disappearance changed: the lower-mass treatments displayed a faster evolution than the larger treatments. This change indicates a different speed in the consumption of ammoniacal N, possibly in relation with the vegetative or reproductive stage of the plant, throughout the carbon investment into NH3 assimilation.

With respect to the dominating influence parameters on the full load behavior which are the runner length and cross section, the requirement of a variable intake manifold geometry becomes stronger than ever before. For the part load behavior, the intake charge motion is gaining more significance as well, which leads to new requirements for variable elements in the intake manifold. Besides these directly influencing layout parameters on the gas exchange and combustion process, secondary aspects such as the satisfaction of the acoustical requirements, the weight reduction and the integration of other components and functions into the complex intake manifold module will be discussed. The intake manifold of passenger car gasoline engines has undergone a significant development progress during the last two decades. The introduction of the multi point fuel injection (MPI) and the multi valve technology has increased the freedom for the layout and the design. On the other hand, the requirements with respect to the engine fuel consumption, the emission reduction, the driveability and the riding comfort of the vehicles have increased. Both developments have raised the intake manifold of modern engine concepts to an important and highly complex integral part of the entire engine system. Subject of this paper is to highlight about the measures on the intake side which are pursued to optimize the operational behavior and the cost and weight reduction of today's gasoline engines. It has to be noted that similar development trends can be observed on Diesel engines as well. Following the survey over the various influences of the intake manifold layout, the motivation and the realization of design of variable intake manifolds (VIM) will be addressed. Subsequently the measures to reduce the intake orifice noise will be discussed. Finally a view to alternative materials, manufacturing processes and the trend to multi functional intake modules will be given.",,"Diesel engines; Emission control; Gasoline; Alternative materials; Combustion pro-cess; Complex integrals; Development trends; Emission reduction; Influence parameter; Manufacturing process; Operational behavior; Automobile engine manifolds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028862663

Chemical mechanisms for oxidant and acid formation, on which expensive air pollution control strategies are based, must accurately predict these radical concentrations. We have used the fluorescence assay with gas expansion (FAGE) technique to carry out the first simultaneous, in situ measurements of these two radicals in highly polluted air during the Los Angeles Free Radical Experiment. A complete suite of ancillary measurements was also made, including speciated hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, aldehydes, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone along with meteorological parameters. Using this suite of measurements, we tested the ability of a lumped chemical mechanism to accurately predict radical concentrations in polluted air. Comparison of model predictions with measured radical concentrations revealed generally good agreement for OH early and late in the day, including the early evening hours, when OH persisted at low concentrations after dark. During midday, however, modeled [OH] was high by about 50%. Agreement for HO2 was quite good in the early morning hours, but model-calculated HO2 concentrations were significantly too high during midday. When we used our measured HO2 concentrations as model input, agreement between calculated and measured OH concentrations was improved. It seems likely that (1) the model's HOx sources are too large, (2) there are unaccounted HOx loss processes in Los Angeles air, and/or (3) the complex parameterization of RO2/HO2 radical chemistry in the reaction mechanism does not adequately describe the behavior of these radicals in the Los Angeles atmosphere.

Both woody plant expansion into grasslands and the invasion of annual grasses into shrublands have potential influence on regional carbon cycling. Soil carbon content, chemistry, and distribution may change following shifts in dominant plant life form because plant life forms differ in litter chemistry and patterns of detrital input. This study assesses the amount, quality, and distribution of soil C below woody vegetation and grasses at three rangelands in Texas, New Mexico, and Utah. At each of these sites there has been a well-documented shift in dominant plant life form. In Texas and New Mexico, woody plants have increased in grasslands, while grasses have invaded into former shrublands in Utah. We measured total soil carbon, particulate organic matter (POM) C, and the carbon isotopic composition of soil carbon beneath woody plants and grasses at each of these three sites. At the La Copita Research Area in south-central Texas there was significantly more soil C found beneath Prosopis glandulosa, the dominant woody plant, than was found beneath grasses. Mean soil C content to 1 m was 7.2 kg C m-2 beneath P. glandulosa and 6.0 kg C m-2 beneath grasses. There was also significantly more POM C beneath P. glandulosa than beneath grasses. Stable carbon isotopic composition indicated that the expansion of P. glandulosa in savannas in Texas first influences carbon cycling in surface soils, then deep soil C, and finally throughout the soil profile. At the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge in central New Mexico, we found that there was significantly more soil C in the upper 10 cm of the soil profile beneath Larrea tridentata than was found beneath Bouteloua spp. Stable carbon isotopic composition indicated that the expansion of L. tridentata influenced C cycling throughout the soil profile. At Curlew Valley in northern Utah, we found no significant differences in total profile soil C beneath different plant life forms. However, there was significantly more soil C found at the soil surface beneath woody plants than was observed beneath annual grasses. There was significantly less POM C beneath annual grasses than was found beneath woody plants or perennial grasses. Based on stable carbon isotopic analyses, we concluded that the invasion of grasses into shrublands influenced only the upper 30 cm of the soil profile. We determined that following changes in plant life form dominance, the most consistent change in soil C was an alteration in content and distribution of POM C, a slowly cycling pool of soil C. While we failed to find a consistent change in total profile soil C with plant life form across our sites, the change in soil C chemistry may have important implications for long-term soil C storage in semiarid systems where there have been shifts in plant life form.","Plant invasion; Plant life form; Root distribution; Soil carbon chemistry; Soil depth","community dynamics; nutrient cycling; rangeland; semiarid region; soil carbon; vegetation dynamics; United States; Bouteloua; Larrea tridentata; Prosopis glandulosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033427908

Convergence of these series is expected to be slower for conjugated hydrocarbons as compared to their saturated analogues. In this connection, the third and fourth order terms of the power series for the DM absent in the previous articles were derived, and the particular case of an alternant hydrocarbon was studied in a detail. In contrast to saturated hydrocarbons, considerable differences in the rates of convergence of the power series for the DM prove to be peculiar to conjugated molecules. Thus, the convergence rate of power series for linear polyenes decreases gradually when the chain length increases. Again, turning from linear to cyclic constitution of the chain leads to drastic reduction of the convergence rate. These results along with the interdependence between power series for LMOs and for the DM allowed us to compare the extents of localizability Of one-electron orbitals and thereby tile nature of chemical bonds in conjugated and saturated hydrocarbons.","Conjugated hydrocarbons; Localized MOs; Non-canonical method of MOs; One-electron DM; Saturated hydrocarbons","hydrocarbon; article; chemical bond; conjugation; molecular dynamics; quantum chemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033598423

There are still many uncertainties in the importance of this trait for plant performance, and clear guidelines on how partitioning should be quantified in relation to growth rate and resource supply are of fundamental importance for such an understanding. This paper reports an attempt to show how plant nitrogen status relates to root:shoot partitioning and other plastic responses, in a manner that can be used for quantitative predictions. The reactions to nitrogen limitation of five grassland plant species, with different ecological demands, were compared. The species used were the forbs Polygala vulgaris and Crepis praemorsa, and the grasses Danthonia decumbens, Agrostis capillaris and Dactylis glomerata. The experiment was conducted in a climate chamber where the plants were grown hydroponically (1) under non-limiting nutrient conditions and (2) at a steady-state nitrogen limitation, which enabled the plants to express half of their growth potential. The relative growth rate (RGR) of the species was strongly related to plant nitrogen concentration (PNC) and leaf area ratio (LAR), whereas the effects on net assimilation rate (NAR) were very small. Despite large differences in maximum relative growth rate, the species showed remarkable similarities in dry matter partitioning between root and shoot. It is concluded that root:shoot partitioning can be treated as a direct function of the relative resource limitation of the plant. The difficulty of attaining well-defined levels of resource limitation in soil, other solid substrates and many hydroponic systems may be the most important reason for the divergent results in earlier studies. Better knowledge of soil-root interactions, and plant responses to the whole span of resource-supply levels, is required for a thorough understanding of how nutrients limit growth.","Biomass; Grassland; Growth rate; Nitrogen; Nutrient limitation; Partitioning; Plant strategies; Plasticity","biomass; grassland; nitrogen; nutrient limitation; plasticity; Agrostis; Agrostis capillaris; Agrostis capillaris; Crepis; Crepis praemorsa; Crepis praemorsa; Dactylis; Dactylis glomerata; Dactylis glomerata; Danthonia decumbens; Danthonia decumbens; Poaceae; Polygala vulgaris; Polygala vulgaris; Polygalaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032732650

Ice sheet models have already been coupled to atmospheric models with some degree of success, but before such tools are used to predict the past and future evolution of the ice sheets, it is important that the atmospheric model is capable of reproducing the current mass balance distribution of the ice sheets reasonably. At first inspection, the surface mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet predicted by the United Kingdom Universities Global Atmospheric Modelling Project general circulation model (UGCM) is typical of that produced by the majority of GCMs, with a moderate overestimation of accumulation and a large overestimation of ablation. Further investigation reveals that there are a number of systematic errors involving the treatment of orography and radiation within the UGCM, some of which are likely to affect most other GCMs. A postprocessing method is developed that allows these errors to be corrected without performing further GCM integrations. This procedure is based on the downscaling of GCM output to a finer grid and correction for altitude changes. The degree by which the resolution of the fine grid exceeds that of the GCM grid has a strong effect on the predicted mass balance although these changes become smaller as very high resolutions are reached. A resolution of about 0.7° in each direction appears to be sufficient for such a reanalysis and provides results for the components of the surface mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet that are significantly closer to observations than the initial estimates.

A sensitivity study suggests that uncertainties related to the turface forcing, or the choice of atmospheric lapse rate, are of secondary importance.",,"Mathematical models; Sea ice; Ice sheet; Orography; Surface mass balance; Climatology; climate forcing; general circulation model; ice sheet; mass balance; orography; spatial resolution; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033080376

These problems are frequently blamed on unrestricted use of private vehicles. This paper applies the concept of sustainability to urban areas by formulating an explicit ecological constraint on airshed capacity in a region within a model of cost-effective emissions control. Solution of the model suggests that restrictions on vehicle use should play a role in achieving regional air-quality targets cost-effectively. A tradable vehicle-use permit system is described for implementing the sustainability constraint, and its relationship to other demand management proposals for constraining vehicle use is discussed, as well as the implications for the form and vitality of urban areas. This control policy would have substantially favourable impacts on air quality, vehicle congestion and uncontrolled suburban development and, given the general political unacceptability of environmental taxes, could form part of a workable and politically palatable set of policies to control greenhouse-gas emissions from the transport sector. The proposed vehicle-use permits mechanism represents a natural extension of current discussions for globally tradable carbon emission permits, and could be a principal method by which such national carbon emissions budgets might be allocated regionally.",,"air quality; pollution control; sustainable development; transportation planning; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033374299

We focus particular attention on how the optical depth affects the derived total column density and the temperature. We derive an optical depth correction factor that can be evaluated based on observations and that incorporates the effect of saturation on derived upper level populations. We present analytic results for linear molecules in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). We investigate numerically how subthermal excitation influences the population diagram technique, studying how the determination of kinetic temperature is affected when the local density is insufficient to achieve LTE. We present results for HC3N and CH3OH, representative of linear and nonlinear molecules, respectively. In some cases, alternative interpretations to the standard optically thin and thermalized picture yield significantly different results for column density and kinetic temperature, and we discuss this behavior. The population diagram method can be a very powerful tool for determining physical conditions in dense clouds if proper recognition is given to effects of saturation and subthermal excitation. We argue that the population diagram technique is, in fact, superior to fitting intensities of different transitions directly, and we indicate how it can be effectively employed.","ISM: clouds; ISM: molecules; Radiative transfer",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033450268

This work concerns the application of a one-dimensional, multi-zone, thermochemical model for calculating NO formations from a small bore, lean burning, natural gas engine. Because of the potential for significant non equilibrium behavior due to lean operation, high engine speeds and small combustion chamber sizes, detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms are used to integrate the reaction rates over the duration of the product combustion history. The model is used to predict NO emission at two lean conditions: φ = 0.91 and φ = 0.66. Results show good agreement with the experimental data, with better agreement for the higher equivalence ratio case for conditions which are investigated in detail and are related to the mechanism governing the net formation rate in each case. We show that the richer mixture produces NO by processes which are formation limited in the colder, later burned region, and decomposition limited in the hotter, earlier burned region. In the lean engine, however, NO is formed solely via a formation limited process. The results suggest several avenues to reducing both the absolute value of NO concentration in the exhaust by changing the design and/or operating parameters, as well as the specific NO formation.

Excess Mn decreases leaf CO2 assimilation through a reduction of chlorophyll content in immature leaves with no effect detected on mature leaves. We hypothesized that differential accumulation of Mn in chloroplasts occurs at different leaf developmental stages. Chloroplasts of immature leaves accumulated at least three times as much Mn as those of mature leaves at equivalent total foliar Mn. Chlorosis was positively correlated with Mn concentration in chloroplasts from high-Mn plants (r2 = 0.96; P = 0.003) but was not correlated with Mn in unfractionated tissue (r2 = 0.026; P = 0.793) nor with Mn in the epidermis-enriched fraction (r2 = 0.33; P = 0.314). Both cultivars showed high accumulation of Mn in the vacuoles as determined by the co-localization of α-mannosidase and Mn content on a continuous density gradient. Cultivars differed significantly in Mn concentration in an epidermis-enriched fraction, with the tolerant cultivar Calima accumulating more Mn in this fraction than the sensitive cultivar ZPV-292. In both cultivars, Mn was accumulated up to 2400 μg g-1 dry weight in crystal-type structures whereas the unfractionated leaf tissue contained about 500 μg g-1 dry weight. The results demonstrate that Mn compartmentation occurs at both the tissue and the organelle level and that Mn accumulation in the epidermis-enriched fraction could contribute to Mn tolerance in common bean. The role of Mn accumulation in structures resembling oxalate crystals is discussed.","Chloroplast; Ion compartmentation; Mn tolerance; Phaseolus vulgaris; Tissue compartmentation; Vacuole","Phaseolus vulgaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642586812

That industry's dominant installed technology, the steam turbine, is no more efficient today than it was in the early 1960s. Much of the motivation behind the restructuring effort is to permit competition from more energy-efficient technologies, particularly gas turbines. For example, the new generation of economically competitive electric supply technologies can lower greenhouse gas emissions by 40-80 percent as a result of their more efficient operation. Technological improvements in the production of electricity are essential to reducing energy costs, air pollution, and carbon dioxide emissions. At the same time, monopoly regulation appears to have stifled productivity and long-term innovation in the U.S. electric utility sector. Other factors also played a part in dampening the incentive to innovate, including overcapacity and the grandfathering of older plants by the Clean Air Act. Experience in the deregulation of other industries suggests that the capacity for sustained innovation may not be supported by the restructuring process alone. For example, the current electric utility restructuring proposals may produce less than one-third of the savings that are economically available in the generation and use of electricity.

Species inhabiting the nival zone of today are threatened by competitors which move from the alpine zone towards the summits. The manner in which species move depends on their abilities to cope with microtopographical situations. We present a spatially explicit predictive model which draws scenarios of future species distribution patterns at a typical high mountain of the European Alps. The altitudinal temperature gradient is examined. Based on the lapse rate and on definitions of topographical niches of species, a + 1 °C- and a + 2 °C-warming scenario are modelled using a fine-scaled digital elevation model. Nival species will lose area and become restricted to specific topographical situations. Alpine and subnival grassland species are predicted to expand their area, mainly along stable surface situations. Whether the migration will take place as a filling or a moving process is specific to the particular species. Overall, biodiversity is apparently not threatened on the decadal scale. In special cases, however, genetic losses are likely both on a local and on a regional scale.","Altitudinal gradient; Climate change; Digital elevation model; European Alps; Mountain vegetation; Predictive model","biodiversity; global warming; mountain environment; spatial distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033360975

In the third step of this reaction sequence, N5-formyl-H4MPT is converted to methenyl-H4MPT+ by the enzyme methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase. The cyclohydrolase from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Methanopyrus kandleri (Mch) is extremely thermostable and adapted to a high intracellular concentration of lyotropic salts. Results: Mch was crystallized and its structure solved at 2.0 Å resolution using a combination of the single isomorphous replacement (SIR) and multiple anomalous dispersion (MAD) techniques. The structure of the homotrimeric enzyme reveals a new α/β fold that is composed of two domains forming a large sequence-conserved pocket between them. Two phosphate ions were found in and adjacent to this pocket, respectively; the latter is displaced by the phosphate moiety of the substrate formyl-H4MPT according to a hypothetical model of the substrate binding. Conclusions: Although the exact position of the substrate is not yet known, the residues lining the active site of Mch could be tentatively assigned. Comparison of Mch with the tetrahydrofolate-specific cyclohydrolase/dehydrogenase reveals similarities in domain arrangement and in some active-site residues, whereas the fold appears to be different. The adaptation of Mch to high salt concentrations and high temperatures is reflected by the excess of acidic residues at the trimer surface and by the higher oligomerization state of Mch compared with its mesophilic counterparts.","Halophilic enzyme; Hyperthermophilic enzyme; Methanogenic archaea; Methanopyrus kandleri; Methenyltetrahydromethanopterin cyclohydrolase","bacterial enzyme; hydrolase; Archaebacterium; article; crystal structure; enzyme active site; enzyme analysis; enzyme structure; enzyme substrate; nonhuman; priority journal; structure analysis; thermophilic bacterium; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Methanopyrus kandleri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033570116

In this study, the morphology, transepithelial ion transport, fluid constituents, and histochemistry of the alkaline glands of the Atlantic stingray, Dasyatis sabina, were investigated. The duct from each gland joined the corresponding vas deferens and the resulting two common ducts emptied into the cloaca. Dark burgundy, aqueous fluid (pH 8.0-8.2) was secreted into the sacs by a simple columnar epithelium with extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum and large secondary lysosomes containing lipofuscin and membrane fragments. Zonulae occludentes were deep (~22 fibrils), reflecting an electrically tight epithelium (732 ohms/cm2). Carbonic anhydrase activity was localized histochemically within the intercellular spaces and less intensely in the mid-basal cytoplasm. In vitro electrophysiology showed that baseline short-circuit current (Isc, 29.1 μA/cm2) was reduced 67.0% after Cl- removal from the medium. Cl- removal also completely abolished luminal alkalinization (baseline 4.5 ± 0.7 μEq of acid/cm2/h). Luminal exposure to the chloride-bicarbonate exchange inhibitor, DIDS, reduced Isc by 38%. Simultaneous administration of DIDS and bumetanide (Na+/K+/C1- cotransport inhibitor) to the serosal side of the tissue caused the Isc to decrease &gt; 100%. Serosal exposure to ouabain (Na-K, ATPase inhibitor) decreased Isc 48%, whereas amiloride (sodium ion channel blocker) and acetazolamide (carbonic anhydrase inhibitor) had no statistically significant effect on Isc or alkalinization rates.

By the end of June, before the development of macroscopic leaf injury, the raised O3 levels had not affected the light and dark reactions of photosynthesis. However, acclimation to elevated CO2 had resulted in lowered chlorophyll and nitrogen concentrations, whereas photosynthetic performance, examined over a wide range of parameters from light and dark reactions, remained unchanged or showed only slight reductions (e.g. apparent electron transport rate, ETR; apparent quantum yield of CO2 gas exchange, Φ(CO2); apparent carboxylation efficiency, CE; and photosynthetic capacity at light and CO2 saturation, PC). In August, after the appearance of leaf necroses, plants grown under ambient CO2 and twice-ambient O3 conditions declined in both the photosynthetic light reactions (optimum electron quantum yield, F(v)/F(m), non-photochemical energy quenching, NPQ, reduction state of Q(A), apparent electron quantum yield, Φ(PSI)I, maximum electron transport rates) and the dark reactions as reflected by CE, Φ(CO2), as well as the maximum CO2 uptake rate (i.e. PC). CE, Φ(CO2) and PC were reduced by c. 75, 40 and 75%, respectively, relative to plants exposed to ambient CO2 and O3 levels. By contrast, plants exposed to twice-ambient O3 and elevated CO2 levels maintained a photosynthetic performance similar to individuals grown either under ambient CO2 and ambient O3, or elevated CO2 and ambient O3 conditions. The long-term exposure to elevated CO2 therefore tended to counteract adverse chronic effects of enhanced O3 levels on photosynthesis. Possible reasons for this compensatory effect in F. sylvatica are discussed.","Chlorophyll fluorescence; Chronic effects; Elevated CO2; European beech (Fagus sylvatica); Gas exchange; Ozone (O3); Photosynthesis; Stomatal conductance","carbon dioxide enrichment; ozone; photosynthesis; physiological response; Fagus sylvatica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032694846

The primary aim of this research was to quantitatively assess the extent and nature of the topographic influence of both the surface and the underlying substrate on the distribution of bog and heath communities within a blanket bog complex. Three blanket bog sites on the southeastern lobe of the Avalon Peninsula, Newfoundland, were studied. Terrain shape characteristics such as slope, plan and profile curvature, and upslope catchment area were derived from digital elevation models (DEMs) of surface and mineral substrate, and analysed using Partition d'un Ensemble Geographique pour l'Analyse Spatiale Ecologique (PEGASE), a procedure based on concepts from information theory. The analysis showed that topography accounted for approximately 22% of the structure underlying the distribution of bog and heath communities within the blanket bog complexes studied. Furthermore, only substrate morphology, which represents the topographic conditions at the initiation of peat accumulation, strongly affected the present pattern of bog and heath at the sites. Although lower elevations were more favourable for bog development, bog communities persisted in upper elevations in areas where the topography assisted in detaining water.","Blanket bog; Heathland; Peatland; Topography","blanket bog; climate effect; pedogenesis; topographic effect; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033041004

The present study, focusing on the Swiss Alps between 1850 and 1973, seeks to relate the concomitant rise in equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) to recorded climate shifts. The approach taken involves the development of a regression model, but differs from most other studies in that the relationship of (midlatitude) ELAs to climate is examined at a resolution such that regional values are treated as individual data-points. Although such a treatment implies loss of resolution at small scales, a coherent relationship between climate and ELA is nonetheless obtained, due in large part to the primary control exercised by temperature, as well as the relatively wide range of ELAs included in the regression dataset. The derived relationship is applied to observed Swiss climate shifts, and is found to predict a secular rise in ELA somewhat greater than that observed. It is hypothesized that the difference represents climate change that had not yet been expressed by changes in glacier morphology.

This paper uses a synoptic climatological approach, which combines a number of atmospheric factors, to better identify the relationships between atmospheric pollution and climatological conditions. Synoptic events represent holistic units of atmospheric conditions which commonly occur at a given locale, and possess specific weather and pollution characteristics. A number of weather variables, including temperature, are used in the development of a synoptic index, which can be used to identify synoptic events associated with specific pollution episodes. Results from the analysis illustrate that there is a substantial difference in pollution loads under different synoptic patterns, and that the cities do have substantially different relationships. Information from this study could be used to assist in the analysis of the differential impacts of weather and pollution upon human morbidity. Specific information as to the linkages between the synoptic weather patterns, pollution concentrations, and human health could be used in the development of weather/health watch-warning systems to alert the public that a synoptic episode is imminent.",,"atmospheric pollution; ozone; particulate matter; synoptic meteorology; weather; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032856626

All LNTs were installed in an underbody location behind a close-coupled TWC on vehicles equipped with either port fuel injection (PFI) or direct injection spark ignition (DISI) engines. In addition to the standard regulatory European drive cycles, a series of steady-state tests were conducted to determine changes in LNT NOx efficiency with increasing NO x storage, and changes in the levels of individual nitrogen-containing exhaust components. Each vehicle system was subjected to a durability cycle up to an equivalent of 80,000 km. The early LNT formulations on systems '1' and '2' suffered from inadequate thermal durability with system efficiencies for NOx deteriorating to ≤ 55% after vehicle aging under lean operating drive cycle conditions (from ≥ 80% when fresh). As a result, improvements were made to the LNT formulations on systems '3' and '4'. Only minor deterioration in lean NOx performance was observed after vehicle aging on these systems (≥ 90% NOx efficiency after aging). These improvements have been such that ECE Stage III and IV NOx emission targets have been achieved after aging with PFI and DISI lean-burn gasoline technology, respectively.

This study includes line and continuum emission covering a wide range of temperatures, and the data have been used to create a number of intensity maps with a field of view of ∼60″ × 300″ and a spatial resolution of ∼1″. These maps reveal bright features that extend from ∼6000 K to ∼2 MK, indicating that much of the observed transition region emission arises in an atmospheric interface between the chromosphere and corona. The emission-line intensities over our field of view vary by up to 2 orders of magnitude and have lognormal distributions suggestive of small-scale magnetic fragmentation. We find empirical evidence for a power-law relationship between line emission and electron density, with an exponent in the range ∼0.3-1.0. Possible temperature dependence of the exponent is reflected in the slope of the emission measure curve, which appears to change slightly with varying electron density. However, there is no major variation in the shape of the lower transition region emission measure distribution with either the intensity or the size of the area studied. This indicates that ensembles of ""cool loops"" (loops physically distinct from those structures which reach coronal temperatures) are unlikely to be the source of this emission unless the size of the structures is considerably less than 1″. We also find that the Li-sequence N v λ1240 emission is higher than expected, in agreement with several previous studies. It seems that this effect diminishes with intensity, suggesting that it is unlikely to be due to the omission of density dependence in dielectronic recombination calculations.","Sun: transition region; Sun: UV radiation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033585686

The fall of the communist system at the beginning of the 1980s and the economic changes that followed resulted in changes in industrial production, in the emission of pollutants, and in the pollution levels in the atmospheric precipitation. This paper describes these changes throughout Poland during the past 10 to 15 years. Increasing acidification of the atmospheric precipitation was found due to a large reduction of alkaline particulates emissions and a decrease in the concentration of acidic ions (SO42-, Cl-, NH4+, NO3-) deposited. In Poland a significant differentiation in the pollution of atmospheric precipitation as well as differentiation between urban and rural areas was observed. Despite the reduction in these emissions and in the deposition of pollutants, Poland still occupies a leading place in the pollution map of the European continent.","Acid rain; Alkaline particulates; Forest decline; Nitrogen oxides; Poland; Sulphur dioxide",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345778537

Hydrochemical data show that the dominant redox potentials shift spatially and temporally from O2/H2O2 during spring to a Fe3+/Fe2+,Mn4+/Mn2+ and SO42-/HS- system with the onset of summer. In autumn, both iron and sulfate reduction processes are more pronounced in the upper meter of the water table a condition that persists until spring snow melt infiltration. Infiltration of spring snow melt transports dissolved oxygen to the top of the aquifer where it reacts with Fe2+ and HS- and shifts the redox potentials from moderately reducing to moderately oxidizing in the upper regions of the aquifer. Redox is strongly controlled by inputs of organic carbon, the primary reductant in the system. Low molecular weight organic acids (acetate, formate, propionate and oxalate) are vertically zoned with a greater abundance in the upper meter of the aquifer. Organic acids, derived from organic-rich sediments in the aquifer, are transported from the overlying vadose zone reservoir providing a substrate for heterotrophic bacteria that reduce the terminal electron acceptors (TEAs) O2, MnO(2(s)), Fe(OH)(3(s)) and SO42-. We postulate that two central mechanisms are primarily responsible for transient redox gradients during an annual cycle: (1) bacterially mediated reduction of manganese, iron and sulfate shifts redox to moderately reducing conditions during autumn and (2) transport of molecular oxygen to the top of the water table during infiltration events oxidizes Fe2+ and HS- diminishing their concentrations and shifting redox towards more oxidizing conditions.","Biogeochemistry; Ground water; Redox gradients; Redox processes; Terminal electron accepting processes","groundwater; redox conditions; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033385507

The presence of extensive soil carbon reserves in the Arctic suggests that substantial feedbacks to CO2-induced climate change could occur if warming alters carbon cycling belowground. Characterization of the controls on regional patterns of belowground CO2 release through the annual cycle is an important step towards evaluating potential feedbacks from arctic ecosystems to climate change. In this study, we assess seasonal control over the influences by climate and vegetation-type on CO2 efflux from belowground in the Alaskan tundra. Our results indicate that climate had strong effects on belowground CO2 release in both seasons. By contrast, vegetation-type had little impact on CO2 efflux from belowground in whiter but was the principal control in summer. Together, these results demonstrate that seasonality is a critical factor regulating climate and vegetation-type effects on belowground CO2 release, which should be included in regional models of net carbon balance in arctic ecosystems.","Arctic; Carbon dioxide; Climate; Soda lime; Soil respiration; Vegetation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032728947

The diamond films were deposited at substrate temperatures between 950 and 980°C using a high methane concentration of 5% in H2. The films obtained showed good field emission properties with threshold fields of around 5 V μm-1 (for 1 nA emission current). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy showed that the nanocrystalline films still exhibit the basic electronic features of diamond with a band gap of 5.5 eV and a negative electron affinity when the surface is hydrogen plasma treated. The Fermi level position in these films is found to be 1±0.2 eV above the valence band maximum. The energy resolved field emission measurements show the typical asymmetric peak shape of Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling through a surface potential barrier. The electrons emitted originate from a continuum of electronic states at the Fermi energy of the emitter. From a combined measurement of the field emitted electron energy distribution and the field emission I-V characteristic of an emitter we could independently determine the work function and the local electric field present at the emission site. In the case of nanocrystalline CVD diamond emitters we determined work function values around 5.7 eV and local fields in the range of 2000-3000 V μm-1 (for emission currents of 10-1000 pA).

Roles of different elements of this forest ecosystem in determining net ecosystem exchanges (NEEs) of sensible heat, water vapor and CO2 were analyzed by using the model. In this model, plant canopies are divided vertically into multiple layers. It first predicts profiles of air temperature, water vapor and CO2 partial pressures inside plant canopies by using the localized near-field (LNF) theory. Then from these predicted profiles, exchanges of sensible heat, water vapor and CO2 in each layer are computed. Canopy-scale fluxes are obtained by integrating these exchanges over the canopy depth. The model was tested against measurements for diurnal cycles of canopy net radiation, sensible heat flux, water vapor flux, CO2 flux, friction velocity, and profiles and diurnal cycles of air temperature, water vapor partial pressure and CO2 concentration. Once tested, the model was used to decompose NEEs into contributions from different ecosystem elements. The results showed that daytime exchanges of energy and mass in this two-story boreal forest were largely controlled by the overstory even through its LAI was smaller than that of the understory. However, the degree of dominance varied for sensible heat, water vapor and CO2, and from daytime to nighttime. Relative contributions of different ecosystem elements to NEEs of sensible heat and water vapor remained largely unchanged from day to day during the testing period. In contrast, relative contributions of different ecosystem elements to NEE of CO2 fluctuated significantly from day to day in responses to changes in environmental conditions. The role of the understory was most significant for the CO2 exchange and least significant for the sensible heat exchange with the water vapor exchange in the intermediate. The soil and stem respirations balanced much of the foliage CO2 absorption during the daytime while during the nighttime they dominated the CO2 exchange. The contribution from soil to the NEEs of sensible heat and water vapor was trivial.","Energy and mass exchanges; Micrometeorology; Multilayer canopy models; NEE decomposition","atmosphere-biosphere interaction; boreal forest; canopy exchange; micrometeorology; modeling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033586632

Thus, variations in emissions of these compounds are expected to cause changes in concentrations of important atmospheric trace gases. Here, we assess the relative magnitude of potential changes in NMHC (e.g., isoprene and monoterpene) emissions using field flux measurements from a subtropical savanna parkland/thorn woodland site in conjunction with model predictions of climate and landcover change. NMHC emissions of about 40 plant species were characterized. Grasses, as a group, had low emission rates. Several common woody species had high emission rates. However, there was little evidence of emissions being consistently related to woody plant taxonomy, growthform or functional groups. Above-canopy measurements were used to validate modeled isoprene flux predictions of about 2 mg C m-2 h-1 for savanna parkland/thorn woodland and ca. 0.7 mg C m-2 h-1 for the regional landscape, which is a mixture of savanna parkland/thorn woodland and cropland. Linkage of the biogenic emissions model with a plant succession model indicated that landcover change since the early 1800s has elicited a 3-fold increase in total NMHC emissions. This increase reflected changes in vegetation species composition (from domination by grasses which were typically 'low emitters', to shrubs and trees, many of which were 'high emitters') and increases in foliar density. Field measurements on two common shrub species indicated that isoprene emission increased exponentially with increases in leaf temperature from 20 to 40°C and were not suppressed by drought stress. Accordingly, our model predicted that projected increases in ambient temperature (3 to 6°C) emissions could produce a 2-fold increase in biogenic NMHC emissions. Cloud cover, precipitation, relative humidity, and winds also exerted some control over NMHC emissions, but their influence was highly variable and difficult to estimate. Although our results are specific to southern Texas USA, they indicate the magnitude of change in NMHC emissions that could occur at other locations when climate and vegetation composition are altered.",,"atmospheric pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033390942

The sampling station was chosen for its isolation from any local and regional sources of contamination. The year-to-year variability of the total atmospheric deposition was found to be high (up to a factor of 2). Using Al as the crustal reference indicates that Pb, Cd, and Zn are mainly associated with man-made aerosols (> 85%), and Fe is mainly associated with crustal aerosols (> 70 %). However, our results indicate that Saharan dust is a potential source of ""natural"" lead, especially in the case of a major input of dust to the northwestern Mediterranean. To determine the spatiotemporal variability of the trace metals over the northwestern Mediterranean Sea, the observed fluxes were compared to those found in the past decade using the same methodology. The comparison indicated a relative homogeneity of Cu and Ni fluxes over the northwestern Mediterranean and over the past decade. The decrease found in Al and Fe since 1985 (by a factor of 4 to 6) can be related to the decrease in Saharan dust fallout. The limitation in the use of lead additives in gasoline may have resulted in a decrease in the European atmospheric lead emissions by a factor of about 6 since 1985 and in a maximum decrease in the total atmospheric flux by a factor of 12 at most if the natural interannual variability of atmospheric deposition in this region is taken into account. So the recorded decrease in the atmospheric lead flux since 1985 (by a factor of ∼30) reveals a slight local contamination at the earlier Corsican station. In the case of Cd and Zn, there was a decrease by a factor of 30 and 23, respectively, between the data obtained at La Tour du Valat (July 1988 to June 1989) and those at Pirio (March 1996 to March 1997); such a decrease cannot be the consequence of either a reduction in emissions in Europe as a whole (the factor being at most 4), or the distance from the emission sources. Hence, we can confirm that Zn and Cd fluxes at La Tour du Valat and Zn fluxes at Cap Ferrat were not representative of a long-range transport to the Mediterranean but the result of a local/regional contamination. The large decrease observed for metals (Cd, Zn, and Pb) mainly mobilized by human activities, results from a combination of the actual diminution of the concentrations due to a reduction in the emissions and the occurrence of local/regional contamination for some elements at some sampling sites.

We have applied a new method, based on fuzzy logic, to the comparison of 17 model simulations of the mid-Holocene (6 ka BP) climate with reconstruction of three bio-climatic parameters (mean temperature of the coldest month, MTCO, growing degree-days above 5°C, GDD5, precipitation minus evapotranspiration, P - E) from pollen and lake-status data over Europe. With this method, no assumption is made about the distribution of the signal and on its error, and both the error bars related to data and to model simulations are taken into account. Data are taken at the drilling sites (not using a gridded interpolation of proxy data) and a varying domain size of comparison enables us to make the best common resolution between observed and simulated maps. For each parameter and each model, we compute a Hagaman distance which gives an objective measure of the goodness of fit between model and data. The results show that there is no systematic order for the three climatic parameters between models. None of the models is able to satisfactorily reproduce the three pollen-derived data. There is larger dispersion in the results for MTCO and P - E than for GDD5. There is also no systematic relationship between model resolution and the Hagaman distance, except for P - E. The more local character of P - E has little chance to be reproduced by a low resolution model, which can explain the inverse relationship between model resolution and Hagaman distance. The results also reveal that most of the models are better at predicting 6 ka climate than the modern climate.",,"fuzzy mathematics; Holocene; paleoclimate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032694932

With the faster light-off requirement, the catalyst support must have a lower thermal mass so as to reach the 50% conversion temperature as quickly as possible. Simultaneously, for higher warmed-up efficiency, the catalyst support must offer higher geometric surface area. Similarly, for improved fuel economy and for preserving engine power, the catalyst support must exert lower back pressure. Indeed, these three performance requirements might be met by certain thin wall ceramic substrates, including 400/4.5 and 600/4.3, which have 22% lower thermal mass, 25% higher geometric surface area and 8% larger open frontal area than the standard 400/6.5 substrate. Testing by automakers and international laboratories on engine dynamometers has verified the above advantages of thin wall substrates. This paper will focus on calculated and measured strength and physical durability of thin wall substrates, both mechanical and thermal, in the coated and uncoated states. Such a durability is critical for meeting the 100,000 mile vehicle life requirement specified by automakers. Both the strength and calculated thermal shock capabilities of thin wall substrates, before and after coating, are compared with those of standard substrates. These data show that thin wall substrates with a compatible washcoat system should provide adequate strength and thermal shock resistance to meet the automakers' 100,000 mile vehicle life requirement.

By potentiodynamic scans on bare steel in CO2/HCO3- solutions of various pH, an anodic peak and a passive domain are effectively observed. However the passivation pH of carbon steel lies within the pH range of the carbonate/bicarbonate buffer, and it should not normally be attained in the presence of CO2. Possible passivation mechanisms are then discussed. Two alternative ways are essentially open: • the achievement of locally very high pH values, through the local disconnection of CO2 from bicarbonate (due to the rate limiting hydration of CO2 into H2CO3 and the resulting depletion of H2CO3 by cathodic reactions), followed by a further increase in pH due to the local generation of carbonate by the cathodic reduction of bicarbonate. • at lower pH, the involvement of mill scale and rust layers containing FeIII compounds. Then the permanent release of Fe3+ ions and their cathodic reduction can contribute to pass the critical current for passivation, when it cannot be supplied only by H+ reduction. © 1999 by NACE International.","Carbon dioxide; Carbon steel; Corrosion; Oxide films; Passivation","Carbon dioxide; Carbon films; Carbon steel; Corrosion; Iron compounds; Oxide films; Passivation; pH; Cathodic reactions; Cathodic reductions; CO2 corrosion; Corrosion layers; High pH value; Possible mechanisms; Potentiodynamic scans; Steel passivation; Steel corrosion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027965656

Opiate receptors in the periaqueductal gray region and α2 adrenoceptors in the spinal cord of the rat mediate the antinociceptive properties of nitrous oxide (N2O). The availability of genetically altered mice facilitates the detection of the precise protein species involved in the transduction pathway. In this study, the authors establish the similarity between rats and mice in the antinociceptive action of N2O and investigate which α2 adrenoceptor subtypes mediate this response. Methods: After obtaining institutional approval, antinociceptive dose-response and time- course to N2O was measured in wild-type and transgenic mice (D79N), with a nonfunctional α(2A) adrenoceptor using tail-flick latency. The antinociceptive effect of N2O was tested after pretreatment systemically with yohimbine (nonselective α2 antagonist), naloxone (opiate antagonist), L659,066 (peripheral α2-antagonist) and prazosin (α(2B)- and α(2C)- selective antagonist). The tail-flick latency to dexmedetomidine (D-med), a nonselective α2 agonist, was tested in wild-type and transgenic mice. Results: N2O produced antinociception in both D79N transgenic and wild-type litter mates, although the response was less pronounced in the transgenic mice. Antinociception from N2O decreased over time with continuing exposure, and the decrement was more pronounced in the transgenic mice. The antinociceptive response could be dose dependently antagonized by opiate receptor and selective α(2B)-/α(2C)-receptor antagonists but not by a central nervous system-impermeant α2 antagonist (L659,066). Whereas dexmedetomidine exhibited no antinociceptive response in the D79N mice, the robust antinociceptive response in the wild-type litter mates could not be blocked by a selective α(2B)-/α(2C)-receptor antagonist. Conclusion. These data confirm that the antinociceptive response to an exogenous α2-agonist is mediated by an α(2A) adrenoceptor and that there appears to be a role for the α(2B)- or α(2C)-adrenoceptor subtypes, or both, in the analgesic response to N2O.","Analgesia; Opiate receptors; Tail flick","alpha 2b adrenergic receptor; alpha 2c adrenergic receptor; n [2 (1,3,4,6,7,12b hexahydro 2' oxospiro[2h benzofuro[2,3 a]quinolizine 2,4' imidazolidin] 3' yl)ethyl]methanesulfonamide; nitrous oxide; animal experiment; antinociception; article; controlled study; drug receptor binding; inhalation anesthesia; inhalational drug administration; male; mouse; neuromodulation; nonhuman; priority journal; tail flick test; Analgesics, Non-Narcotic; Anesthetics, Inhalation; Animals; Male; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Nitrous Oxide; Pain; Rats; Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032911410

This is because the leadership paradigm underlying the climate change regime is fast evolving into a conditional leadership paradigm. The leadership paradigm refers to the fact that agreement in the climate change regime was developed on the basis of the principle of 'common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities' in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Under this principle the developed countries would be the first to take action to reduce their emissions of greenhouse gases and developing countries would subsequently follow. However, even though the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC embodies this paradigm, domestic political events in several countries have resulted in a situation that contradicts its spirit. Several months before the Kyoto Protocol, the US senate made clear that it would be unlikely to ratify any Protocol which set binding targets unless there was clear evidence of the willingness of developing countries to participate meaningfully in the process. This was partly prompted by growing fears in the US that reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the domestic context could lead to high domestic unemployment, and that such a risk should only be taken if and when there was some degree of certainty that the developing countries would be willing to eventually take on commitments. The US stance can be viewed in two ways: from a positive perspective, one could argue that all the United States needs is some assurance that the developing countries are serious about taking some sort of action in the future; from a negative perspective it might be said that this position is merely an excuse for postponing action in the US. The fact remains that even if the US president wanted to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, he cannot do so without the support of Congress. The US stance has repercussions on the other developed countries, who are unwilling to ratify if the United States does not do so. This is an understandable response in that if Europe and other developed countries were to take on unilateral commitments in the absence of ratification by the US (the main emitter of GHGs) the fear is that their domestic economies could suffer disproportionately while the main source of the problem remained unaddressed. Like the United States, the other developed countries are also concerned that the advantages of being 'first movers' in the process of industrial transformation may be difficult to reap if other countries do not eventually join in the regime. Given the contingent nature of willingness to ratify therefore, the entry into effect of the Kyoto Protocol may depend on the signals that the developing countries send.",,"climate change; environmental policy; negotiation process; North-South relations",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032724944

The aim of the study was to assess gastric mucus and bicarbonate secretion as well as local microcirculation in elderly patients. Methods: Fasting gastric juice was collected in 45 elderly patients and in 45 control subjects devoid of endoscopic gastric abnormalities. Total mucoproteins, 'mucoprotective index' (as qualitative expression of mucus secretion) and gastric bicarbonate (Feldman's method) were measured. In addition in 24 elderly patients, and in a matching group of younger subjects, gastric mucosal blood flow was measured by laser Doppler flowmetry. Results: Mucus and bicarbonate production was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) in elderly patients, the quality of mucus secretion being unaltered. Gastric mucosal perfusion was also significantly decreased (p < 0.01) in aged subjects. Conclusion: In the elderly gastric mucosal defences are impaired. This is in keeping with a reduced gastric prostaglandin biosynthesis and may account for the higher susceptibility of the mucosa to damaging agents. The possible role of atrophic gastritis and Helicobacter pylori infection as independent confounding factors remains to be determined.","Aging; Bicarbonate; Gastric mucus; Mucosal blood flow","bicarbonate; mucoprotein; adult; aged; aging; article; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; laser doppler flowmetry; male; mucus secretion; priority journal; stomach blood flow; stomach juice; stomach mucosa; Adult; Aged; Aging; Bicarbonates; Female; Gastric Mucosa; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mucoproteins; Mucus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032811561

Although extensional regions are dominated by abundant normal faulting, local thrust duplication may occur during the same phase of deformation, and on a regional scale may concentrate important quantities of hydrocarbons. Characteristics of extension-related fold belts have mostly been derived from seismic sections; thus fault geometries, mechanisms of formation, and kinematics of these structures are not precisely understood. Abundant kinematic indicators and complete exposure of an extended sedimentary sequence within the Dead Sea Transform, however, provide the opportunity to examine these fault geometries and mechanisms in detail. The local contractional geometry developed within an imbricate normal fault system, as a result of an out-of-sequence normal fault that detached at a higher structural level. The out-of-sequence normal fault offset pre-existing faults, but was deflected into a contractional geometry upon encountering an earlier-formed rollover anticline, whose curved bedding surface served as a convenient ramp. Consequently, displacement across the out-of-sequence fault generated coeval extensional and contractional geometries along the same detachment surface. Geometries and kinematics derived from the outcrop structural analysis may serve as important analogs for larger structures identified as potential targets for hydrocarbon exploration. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"fault geometry; normal fault; Arava Valley; Israel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342514700

One of the most important aspects with regard to landfills is the treatment of the expected polluting leachate emissions, requiring simple and low-cost systems. A combination of aeration, dams and filtering techniques is likely to result in the best treatment options. Biological treatment systems, like aerated lagoons or sequenced batch reactors in combination with natural systems like soil infiltration, spray irrigation, filtration or constructed wetlands can be cost-effective systems for MSW leachate treatment in Norway. Aerated lagoons appeared to be an efficient treatment stage for landfill leachate treatment in cold climates. The hydraulic retention time should be > 20 d to keep the nitrifiers in the lagoon during periods with low temperatures. Landfills can be grouped into categories depending on landfill size, age, hydrology and climate before evaluating sampling programmes prior to treatment system installation and during operation. Simple filtration techniques with bark and crushed concrete can significantly improve leachate quality during treatment and remove nitrogen, colour, heavy metals and pesticides, buffer the pH and add phosphorous.","Lagoons; Landfill; Leachate; Leachate treatment; Norway","buffer; concrete; heavy metal; nitrogen; organic compound; oxygen; pesticide; phosphorus; biological treatment; filtration; landfill; leachate; municipal waste; aeration; bacterium contamination; bioreactor; cold climate; color; conference paper; cost effectiveness analysis; economic aspect; filtration; hydraulic permeability; irrigation (agriculture); leaching; nitrification; Norway; pH; pollution; priority journal; respirometry; river; sampling; soil; solid waste management; urban area; wood; Bacteria (microorganisms); Hydraulic retention time (HRT); Municipal solid wastes (MSW); Biological sewage treatment; Bioreactors; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Filtration; Hydrology; Infiltration; Sewage aeration; Sewage lagoons; Soil conditioners; Solid wastes; Wetlands; Leachate treatment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033237173

Three different surface species corresponding to two coordination modes only, η1-C and η2-side-on, are predicted. These are an almost undistorted CO2 molecule and two highly bent adsorbed species. The undistorted adsorbate appears at a rather large distance from the surface and is tentatively attributed to a precursor physisorbed state. The other two species closely resemble CO2- and, in both cases, the equilibrium distance above the surface is much smaller than in the previous case.

The two chemisorbed species have very similar geometrical parameters and vibrational frequencies, and hence it is not possible to use these properties to differentiate both species. Nevertheless, the larger energetic stabilization of the η1-C chemisorbed CO2 suggests that this is the one which is observed experimentally.",,"Adsorption; Calculations; Catalysis; Chemical bonds; Mathematical models; Molecular dynamics; Molecular vibrations; Palladium; Probability density function; Quantum theory; Single crystals; Surfaces; Coordination mode; Density functional cluster model; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032658844

This is due to the fact that glacier mass changes provide important quantitative information on rates of change, acceleration tendencies and pre-industrial variability relating to energy exchange at the earth/athmosphere interface. During the coming decades, excess radiation income and sensible heat (a few watts per square metre) as calculated with numerical climate models are both estimated to increase by a factor of about two to four as compared to the mean of the 20th century. The rate of average annual mass loss (a few decimetres per year) measured today on mountain glaciers in various parts of the world now appears to accelerate accordingly, even though detailed interpretation of the complex processes involved remains difficult. Within the framework of secular glacier retreat and Holocene glacier fluctuations, similar rates of change and acceleration must have taken place before, i.e. during times of weak anthropogenic forcing. However, the anthropogenic influences on the atmosphere could now and for the first time represent a major contributing factor to the observed glacier shrinkage at a global scale. Problems with such assessments mainly concern aspects of statistical averaging, regional climate variability, strong differences in glacier sensitivity and relations between mass balance and cumulative glacier length change over decadal to secular time scales. Considerable progress has recently been achieved in these fields of research.",,"acceleration; glacier dynamics; mass balance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033496262

We couple the Frankfurt biosphere model (FBM) with a model of the age class development (AGEDYN). The coupled model is applied to simulate the temporal development of carbon pools in German forests under the influence of climate change taking into account changes in the age class structure. In the base case, the growth of forest stands is simulated using a temporally averaged climate dataset, being representative for the contemporary climate conditions. To assess the sensitivity of forest growth to changes in environmental conditions, the FBM is run in several scenarios. In these simulations the effects both of climate change and of the direct effect of increased levels of atmospheric CO2 on photosynthesis (CO2 fertilization) on forest growth are assessed. In another simulation run with the FBM both effects - climate change and CO2 fertilization - are combined. In simulations under present day's climate conditions a good agreement is gained between simulation results and statistical data of the present standing stock carbon density of Germany's forests. A pure climate change leads to a decrease of the annual increments as well as to the climax standing stocks. The negative effect of climate change alone is overcompensated by enhanced photosynthesis in the simulations with combined climate change and CO2 fertilization. In the transient case, the coupled model is used in two scenarios describing first a continuation of present day's climate conditions and second a transient climate change from present conditions (1990) to 2 x CO2 conditions in 2090. Here, the simulations indicate that changes in the forest's age class structure can have a stronger influence on the future carbon balance of the forests in the considered region than the combined effect of climate change and CO2 fertilization.",,"age class; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; biomass; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; ecosystem modeling; forest; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344631707

Graphite surfaces are bombarded with energy-selected beams of Ar+ and Kr+ ions at low energies (&lt;100 eV) to generate the defects on atomic scale. The ion bombardment produces mostly carbon vacancy defects (VD’s) and interstitial defects (ID’s), the latter formed by trapping an incident ion beneath the surface carbon plane. A VD appears as a protrusion in STM image and so does an ID, but they can be distinguished from each other in the measurements of local tunneling barrier height (F) and tunneling spectroscopy (I-V curve). They can also be physically separated by heating the defected surface to a temperature high enough to evaporate the noble-gas interstitials. By employing these methodologies, we are able to examine the electronic structure of individual VD’s and ID’s. A VD exhibits a F value substantially lower than an ID or a clean graphite. Both VD and ID increase the local charge density of states near the Fermi energy, but this effect is largest for a VD due to its dangling bonds. A √3 × √3 superlattice structure appears from an ID, but not from a VD. This observation disproves the existing theoretical interpretation that the superlattice structure results from electron scattering at a VD site. The absolute yield is measured for production of VD’s and ID’s at ion impact energies of 40–100 eV. The features of the yield curves, including the dependency on ion energy and the threshold energies for defect creation, provide reasonable explanations for the ion-surface collisional events leading to VD and ID creation in the low-energy regime. © 1999 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347579807

For the case of polycarbonates it is shown how the chemical details can be reintroduced into relaxed coarse grained melts. Three polycarbonate modifications (BPA-PC, HIP-PC, TMC-PC), which are chemically similar, but exhibit strongly different material properties, have been chosen to test the approach. In each case one chemical repeat unit is mapped onto two coarse grained monomers. By applying the chosen mapping, intra-chain potentials are derived for the coarse grained chain, which reproduce the conformational statistics of the underlying polymer at a given temperature. MD simulations of coarse grained melts are then mn with these potentials in order to determine the diffusion coefficient and to relax the melt on large length scales. The temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficients is found to agree well with experiment. The chosen mapping allows us to reintroduce the full chemistry in the relaxed coarse grained melt. This `inverse mapping' is done in two successive steps: geometric optimization and atomistic relaxation. For the geometric optimization each chain of the cg-melt is considered individually. An atomistic chain with arbitrarily chosen torsions is constructed. In an optimization process the torsions of the atomistic chain are adjusted to fit its backbone onto the cg-chain. The atomistic relaxation of the melt is started by smoothly switching on the excluded volume. Then a short MD mn with the full chemistry is performed to allow for local relaxations. A comparison of the obtained structure factors with experimental ones shows a very good agreement for fully protonated BPA-PC and different deuterated versions, while the deviations are somewhat larger for TMC-PC.",,"Chemical modification; Computer simulation; Diffusion in solids; Graph theory; Monomers; Optimization; Relaxation processes; Statistical methods; Thermal effects; Abstract only; Coarse grained melts; Conformational statistics; Numerical renormalization method; Polycarbonates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033185489

Traditional applications of altimeter data have not placed serious demands on the timeliness of this precise orbit information. Many of these applications involve retrospective scientific analysis of phenomena such as ocean current patterns, permanent geoid features, and slow changes in the thickness of the polar ice sheets. For these studies, latencies of days to weeks in receiving the precise altimeter data sets provide little impediment to successfully completing the research. Owing to the continuing successes of the Topex/Poseidon (T/P) and ERS missions, however, we are presently witness to the beginnings of a new operational era in satellite altimetry. The most demanding of the operational applications, e.g., short-term climate forecasting, require that accurate orbits be made available in near-real time. Precise orbit determination techniques based on data from on-board global positioning system (GPS) receivers have contributed significantly to meeting these requirements and show great promise for keeping pace with the demands of future missions. In this paper, we describe recent advances in near-real-time orbit determination for the T/P mission. New results suggest that GPS-based orbits computed within one day of recording the last element of tracking data have radial accuracies of about 3 cm in a root-mean-square (RMS) sense. These orbits are used by a variety of specialized users in the oceanographic community in order to support climate forecasting and real-time monitoring of the global ocean.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040313338

Values of δ 18O are directly influenced by temperature and evaporation and may be related to salinity. δ13C values of δ13C are sensitive to organic and inorganic sources of carbon and are influenced by productivity. Analyses of eight mollusk species from five short-core localities across Florida Bay show large ranges in the values of δ13C and δ18O, and reflect the variation of the bay over decades. Samples from southwestern Florida Bay have distinct δ13C values relative to samples collected in northeastern Florida Bay, and intermediate localities have intermediate values. 13C values of δ13C grade from marine in the southwest bay to more estuarine in the northeast. Long cores (&gt; 1 m) with excellent chronologies were analyzed from central and eastern Florida Bay. Preliminary analyses of Brachiodontes exustus and Transenella spp. from the cores showed that both δ13C and δ18O changed during the first part of the twentieth century. After a century of relative stability during the 1800s, δ13C decreased between about 1910 and 1940, then stabilized at these new values for the next five decades. The magnitude of the reduction in δ13C values increased toward the northeast. Using a carbon budget model, reduced δ13C values are interpreted as resulting from decreased circulation in the bay, probably associated with decreased freshwater flow into the Bay. Mollusk shell δ18O values display several negative excursions during the 1800s, suggesting that the bay was less evaporitic than during the twentieth century. The isotope records indicate a fundamental change took place in Florida Bay circulation early in the twentieth century. The timing of the change links it to railroad building and early drainage efforts in South Florida rather than to flood control and water management measures initiated after World War II.",,"environmental change; estuarine ecosystem; historical ecology; Holocene; isotopic analysis; paleoecology; reconstruction; Florida; Florida Bay; United States; Brachiodontes; Brachiodontes exustus; Brachiodontes exustus; Mollusca; Transenella; Transenella; Transennella; Transennella",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032833316

Two representative GCM simulations from the Hadley Centre (HC) and Max Planck Institute (MPI) were selected from a group of GCM simulations made available via the National Assessment for climate change. From these simulations, quasi-stationary, decadal mean temperature and precipitation changes were used to perturb historical records of precipitation and temperature data to create inferred conditions for 2025, 2045, and 2095. These perturbed records, which represent future climate in the experiments, were used to drive a macro-scale hydrology model of the Columbia River at 1/8 degree resolution. The altered streamflows simulated for each scenario were, in turn, used to drive a reservoir model, from which the ability of the system to meet water resources objectives was determined relative to a simulated hydrologic base case (current climate). Although the two GCM simulations showed somewhat different seasonal patterns for temperature change, in general the simulations show reasonably consistent basin average increases in temperature of about 1.8-2.1°C for 2025, and about 2.32.9°C for 2045. The HC simulations predict an annual average temperature increase of about 4.5°C for 2095. Changes in basin averaged winter precipitation range from -1 percent to +20 percent for the HC and MPI scenarios, and summer precipitation is also variously affected. These changes in climate result in significant increases in winter runoff volumes due to increased winter precipitation and warmer winter temperatures, with resulting reductions in snowpack. Average March 1 basin average snow water equivalents are 75 to 85 percent of the base case for 2025, and 55 to 65 percent of the base case by 2045. By 2045 the reduced snowpack and earlier snow melt, coupled with higher evapotranspiration in early summer, would lead to earlier spring peak flows and reduced runoff volumes from April-September ranging from about 75 percent to 90 percent of the base case. Annual runoff volumes range from 85 percent to 110 percent of the base case in the simulations for 2045. These changes in streamflow create increased competition for water during the spring, summer, and early fall between nonfirm energy production, irrigation, instream flow, and recreation. Flood control effectiveness is moderately reduced for most of the scenarios examined, and desirable navigation conditions on the Snake are generally enhanced or unchanged. Current levels of winter-dominated firm energy production are only significantly impacted for the MPI 2045 simulations.As part of the National Assessment of Climate Change, the implications of future climate predictions derived from four global climate models (GCMs) were used to evaluate possible future changes to Pacific Northwest climate, the surface water response of the Columbia River basin, and the ability of the Columbia River reservoir system to meet regional water resources objectives.

From these simulations, quasi-stationary, decadal mean temperature and precipitation changes were used to perturb historical records of precipitation and temperature data.","Climate change; ColSim Water Resources Model; Columbia River; Hydrology; National Assessment of Climate Change; Snow pack; VIC Hydrology Model; Water budgets; Water resources","Climate change; Climatology; Computer simulation; Hydrology; Mathematical models; Reservoirs (water); Snow; Snow pack; Rivers; climate change; hydrological response; water resource; Columbia River Basin; United States; Serpentes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033370059

A cubical digester was constructed under the ground surface as a biogas generator using local construction materials. Tap water was used to prepare the slurry. The methane percentage in the biogas produced ranged from 57 to 65%. The produced methane gas was used as an energy source for heating water by direct burning and fuel for a piston engine to produce electricity for domestic use. Fluctuation of the ambient temperature and using dry (non-fresh) wastes affected markedly the quantity of biogas produced and percentage of methane. Also, the results showed that both the biogas quantity and methane percentage increased as the ambient temperature increased to the optimum temperature of about 35 °C. The results also showed that cattle manure is the best animal waste and olive product waste is the best plant waste for methane production. Fermenting organic waste and animal manure in particular resulted in an odorless fairly stabilized organic matter which could be used as soil conditioner and therefore protect the environment from a major source of pollution. The animal manure, which is considered a source of pollution and disturbance in the environment, could be converted into a source of energy in farms nearby, especially those away from the national electricity grid. The results showed that a family of four to five persons living in the farm house can have sufficient source of energy by using such unit of 16 m3 for cooking and lighting. The cost analysis comparing the biogas costs with those of the market available LPG bottles showed a pay back period of about 20 years, which suggests the non-feasibility of the units.

The air-mass categories identified possess differential influences on snow and ice melt dependent upon their thermodynamic properties. The observed climate-glacier links are employed to predict the impact of a shift in air-mass type frequency on Pyrenean snowpacks and glaciers. Typically, cyclonic patterns are associated with low ablation whereas high melt is associated with anticylonic systems. An extension of the North African-Mediterranean subtropical ridge with an associated polar shift in the westerlies, as proposed under global warming, would favour an increase in the prevalence of high energy air-masses, thus enhancing Pyrenean ablation climates. Further work is required to extend this air-mass identification scheme over a number of years and to include atmospheric conditions during the accumulation season.",,"Atmospheric circulation; Local glacier ablation climates; Atmospheric movements; Geographical regions; Glaciers; Global warming; Snow; Thermodynamics; Climatology; ablation; air-ice interaction; atmospheric circulation; climate effect; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033397399

Copepod biomass in the upper 50 m declined over the interval from 20 mg C m-3 to virtually nothing due to the downward seasonal migration by Calanus spp. The ontogenetic vertical distribution of larger species, Calanus spp., revealed that the juvenile stages predominantly were associated with upper water strata and remained there until September. The decline in Calanus dominance was followed by increasing abundance of smaller copepods (Pseudocalanus, Oithona and Acartia) and of meroplanktonic larvae, a general restructuring of the grazer food chain in the euphotic zone. The large Calanus spp. had finished their spawning season before late August, while small copepods produced eggs throughout late August to mid-September. According to a statistical path analysis the specific egg production of Acartia longiremis was associated primarily with phytoplankton biomass and secondarily with protozooplankton biomass. Daily egg production per female declined gradually from 10 d-1 on August 27 to 1.6 d-1 on September 27. The biomass of A. longiremis was rather modest, indicating that it was not a dominant grazer in the euphotic zone. Weight specific egg production of A. longiremis declined from 0.11 to 0.02 d-1, and was used as an index for secondary production; grazing by mesozooplankton was subsequently estimated as 3 × secondary production. Grazing impact was thereby roughly calculated for the entire copepod standing stock and compared with data from parallel studies on phytoplankton, bacteria and protozooplankton into a comprehensive pelagic carbon budget for the euphotic zone, the upper 30 m. The estimated total grazing upon phytoplankton was 3 times the primary production. It is proposed that phytoplankton was primarily grazed by ciliates and secondarily by ciliated meroplankton and copepods. Additionally, a large fraction of the ciliate production was presumably grazed by heterotrophic dinoflagellates.The protozooplankton were key grazers in the pelagic carbon cycling of Disko Bay. © Inter-Research 1999.","Arctic mesozooplankton; Carbon budget; Egg production; Life strategies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000346793

The thermodynamic temperature of the caps is ∼145 K, in equilibrium with the ∼6 mbar atmosphere. The optical properties of CO2 ice require that pure snow with a sufficiently small particle size has a high visible/near-infrared albedo and a low infrared emissivity in parts of the thermal infrared, particularly in the region between 20 and 50 μm. Dust mixed into or on top of the CO2 ice will lower the visible albedo and bring the thermal infrared emissivity closer to 1. Water ice mixed with the CO2 will have little effect in the visible and near-infrared to 1.4 μm but can raise the 20-50 μm emissivity if the particle size is &gt;50 μm. Observations of both seasonal polar caps during two of the assessment orbits of the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft are used to show that there is a strong correlation between visible brightness and low 20-50 μm emissivity. The infrared spectra from the Thermal Emission Spectrometer from regions with low 20-50 μm brightness temperature are consistent with surface deposits of CO2 with millimeter-sized grains and containing varying small amounts of dust, and they are not consistent with the expected signature of water ice or clouds. Large regions of low emissivity in the spring seasonal caps have not been observed previously. They are correlated with visible bright regions which are known to become brighter as the spring progresses. The visible brightness of the south polar deposits examined is inferred from historical observations, while the brightness of the north polar region is determined from Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter measurements at 1.06 μm. The model of seasonal CO2 caps with bright, low-emissivity regions agrees with previous visible observations of bright crater rims, streaks, and other bright areas within the polar caps, some of which may evolve in time from dark, high-emissivity sheet ice to brighter, fractured, lower-emissivity ice layers. It is also in agreement with models of the CO2 cycle, which require average polar cap emissivities &lt;0.9.

This 'geophysiological' model is stable in the sense that it resists perturbation.

New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, NY 11794-5245, United States","Isoprene (2-methyl-1,3,-butadiene), produced by many woody and a few herbaceous plant species, is the dominant volatile organic compound released from vegetation. It represents a non-trivial carbon loss to the plant (typically 0.5-2%, but much higher as temperatures exceed 30°C), and plays a major role in tropospheric chemistry of forested regions, contributing to ozone formation. This review summarizes current knowledge concerning the occurrence of isoprene production within the plant kingdom, and discusses other aspects of isoprene biology which may be of interest to the ecological community. The ability to produce significant amounts of isoprene may or may not be shared by members of the same plant family or genus, but emitting species have been found among bryophytes, ferns, conifers and Ephedra and in approximately one-third of the 122 angiosperm families examined. No phylogenetic pattern is obvious among the angiosperms, with the trait widely scattered and present (and absent) in both primitive and derived taxa, although confined largely to woody species. Isoprene is not stored within the leaf, and plays no known ecological role as, for example, an anti-herbivore or allelopathic agent. The primary short-term controls over isoprene production are light and temperature. Growth in high light stimulates isoprene production, and growth in cool conditions apparently inhibits isoprene, production of which may be induced upon transfer to warmer temperatures. The stimulation of isoprene production by high irradiance and warm temperatures suggests a possible role in ameliorating stresses associated with warm, high-light environments, a role consistent with physiological evidence indicating a role in thermal protection.","Hydrocarbons; Isoprene; Volatile organic carbon","biogenic emission; ecology; evolution; isoprene; vegetation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033027048

Like the Balmer lines of H, Balmer lines of He II also radiate because of collisional excitation at the shock, though the complexities of broad and narrow components present in the H lines should be absent in He II emission. New narrowband images of the Trapezium region of Orion in He II λ4686 and the adjacent continuum near this wavelength fail to show any He II emission signatures from shocks. Upper limits on the He II fluxes in these images, combined with predictions of the brightness of He II λ4686 in nonradiative shocks, give an upper limit to the mass-outflow rate from Θ1 Ori C consistent with the mass-loss rate estimated from UV observations. The new images show that HH 202 represents the superposition of two bow shocks moving in opposite directions, which explains some anomalies seen previously in emission-line images of this source taken with Hubble Space Telescope (HST).","ISM: individual (Orion Nebula); Shock waves",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033589624

It is, therefore, impossible to decrease emissions only by energy savings and by improvements of the energy efficiency. Global CO2 recycling can solve this problem and supply abundant renewable energy. Global CO2 recycling consists of three districts: (i) in deserts, all necessary electricities are generated by solar cells; (ii) on coasts close to the deserts, the electricity is used for production of H2 by seawater electrolysis, H2 is converted to CH4 by the reaction with CO2 and liquefied CH4 is transported to energy consuming districts; (iii) at energy consuming district, after CH4 is used as a fuel, CO2 is recovered, liquefied and transported to the coasts close to the deserts. A CO2 recycling plant for substantiation of our idea has been built on the roof of our Institute (IMR) in 1996, using key materials tailored by us. The key materials necessary for global CO2 recycling are the anode and cathode for seawater electrolysis and the catalyst for CO2 methanation. Since the quantities of CO2 to be converted far exceed an industrial level, the system must be very simple and the rate of conversion must be very fast. These requirements are satisfied in our global CO2 recycling system. When global CO2 recycling is conducted on a large scale, the energies and costs required to form liquefied CH4 in our global CO2 recycling system are almost the same as those for production of LNG from natural gas wells. A project for field experimenting the global CO2 recycling using pilot plants in Egypt has been planned in cooperation with Egyptian scientists, engineers and industries. © 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.","Amorphous alloys; Manganese oxide electrode; Methanation of CO2; Renewable energy supply; Suppression of CO2 emissions","Air pollution control; Amorphous alloys; Carbon dioxide; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrolysis; Energy conservation; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Methanation; Recycling; Global carbon dioxide recycling; Manganese oxide electrodes; Suppression of carbon dioxide emissions; Renewable energy resources; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; emission control; energy resource; global warming; recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032872185

Moreover, there is also a region of stoichiometric mixture formed when fuel mixes with air in diffusion combustion, where NO(x) is also produced. In MULDIC, premixed combustion and diffusion combustion are separated in time, and optimized independently.

Peak location estimates, in conjunction with real-time measured wind direction data, are used to reconstruct the fugitive source location. We conducted a synthetic data study to evaluate the proposed peak location SBFM reconstruction. Furthermore, the methodology was validated with open-path Fourier transform infrared concentration data collected with wind direction data downwind from a controlled point source.

One hundred and fifty vehicles (half cars - half light duty trucks) were recruited at a local I/M lane, and tested for running loss emissions at the ATL Facility in Mesa, AZ. The previous CRC programs had studied hot soak, and then diurnal emissions. Running loss emissions were measured in a Running Loss SHED (RL-SHED) for a 25 minute, 7.5 mile trip on a hot summer day (95°F). Vehicles from model years 1971 through 1991 were tested. A wide range in emission levels was observed - from a low of 0.13 g/mile to 43 g/mile. The test results were not able to establish whether car emissions are different, or the same, as light duty trucks. The major causes of the high emissions were liquid leaks on carburetor equipped models. Speciation analysis of the end-of-test data indicated that approximately 50% of the emissions come from vapor sources and 50% come from liquid sources. The program identified 30 vehicles as candidates for repair and retest. The result showed a very high (90+%) effectiveness for the repairs. Repeat tests were run on 10 vehicles to provide an estimate of test-to-test variability.

The results have shown that Kuala Lumpur and Penang had greater Global Warming Potential (GWP) and the costs spent on the solid waste management were also higher as compared to that in suburban areas. In the second part of the study, a detailed evaluation was carried out by analyzing the implication of introducing incineration and composting into the solid waste management system, and the results were compared with the current system, i.e. 100% landfilled. The relative GWP was lower for incineration, but the cost was extremely high. The results also showed that the final solid waste to be disposed to landfills and the impact due to water emissions could be reduced significantly when incineration and composting were introduced.","Composting; Global Warming Potential; GWP; Incineration, LCI; Life Cycle Inventory; Malaysia; Management, solid waste; Solid waste disposal; Waste disposal","composting; cost; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; incineration; landfill; life cycle; Malaysia; model; priority journal; review; rural area; solid waste management; urban area",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032840542

With the introduction of the Common-Rail injection system splitting the injection into separate pulses has become possible. Experiments using multiple injections indicated that there is the chance to shift the soot-NOx curve closer to the origin. In order to understand the underlying physical process multidimensional simulations have been carried out for a baseline as well as a split injection case using the Representative Interactive Flamelet (RIF)-Model. The computations are compared to experimental data showing good agreement for both cases. The computations as well as the experiments confirm the possibility of reducing soot with only a slight increase in NOx emissions.

The physical processes which maintain the halocline and, in turn, its physical, biological, and geochemical effects have long been subjects of intense inquiry. The stratification of polar surface waters influences the exchange of CO2 between ocean and atmosphere, so the history of the subarctic Pacific halocline may have played a role in past changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Here we report opal accumulation rates and nitrogen-isotope data from sediments in this region which indicate that the subarctic Pacific halocline developed abruptly 2.73 million years ago, coincident with the onset of extensive Northern Hemisphere glaciation. The halocline would have reduced the transport of nutrient-rich deep water into the euphotic zone, leading to a decrease in biological production but an increase in the fraction of nutrient stocks utilized. This increase in the efficiency of the 'biological pump' would have lowered the rate of CO2 evasion from ocean to atmosphere, potentially reducing atmospheric CO2 concentrations from the suggested higher level of the preceding mid-Pliocene warm interval.",,"halocline; Pliocene; Quaternary; stratification; article; climate; geography; natural science; oceanic regions; priority journal; temperature; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033592668

Using femtosecond pump/probe experiments and photoluminescence spectroscopy we investigate the interplay of nonlinear radiative and nonradiative recombination processes. Amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) leads to an ultrafast depletion of the excited state at excitation densities above 1018cm-3 in an ladder-type poly(p-phenylene) film deposited on a glass substrate. Owing to the different waveguide structure ASE is not observed for the same polymer deposited on an indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated substrate. Instead, we observe nonradiative bimolecular annihilation with a coefficient γ=4.2×10 -9cm3s-1. Our results demonstrate that even in the absence of a resonator collective stimulated emission can be much more efficient than nonradiative recombination.

This has been demonstrated by throttling the diesel intake to reduce the fresh air inlet manifold pressure so allowing more EGR flow by virtue of a higher exhaust-side pressure due the effects of the turbocharger. The method reported here investigates a different approach to increasing the EGR rates by replacing a fixed geometry turbocharger (FGT) with a variable geometry turbocharger, (VGT). Under part-load operation, where emission production is significant in the European drive cycle, independent control of both VGT vane position and EGR valve position was used to optimise emission levels. A reduction in the FGT levels of NOx of up to 45 percent was observed at discrete operating points without compromising fuel consumption or smoke.

An extensive steady state experimental investigation has been undertaken on a prototype 1.8 L direct injection (DI) diesel engine to compare the potential benefits of VGT relative to the standard build of the engine with a wastegated fixed geometry turbocharger (FGT).

The presence of Ac"" in oilfield brines can significantly increase the rate of corrosion of carbon steel. In the presence of Ac-, the corrosion rate can increase even if the pH increases. Many corrosion prediction models cannot accommodate this observation. On a ppm basis, Ac"" increases the corrosion rate more than the HCO3- decreases it. The presence of Ac"" only affects the corrosion rate and not the corrosion mechanism. The mechanism by which HAc increases the corrosion rate may be explained by its ability to both decrease the pH and solubilise Fe2+, thus reducing the iron carbonate film thickness. Ac"" has been shown to attack existing iron carbonate films and make them thinner. If local film thinning were to occur this would result in localised corrosion. Nitrate, another small anion, did not increase the corrosion rate. Brines containing Ac"" can be inhibited using conventional oilfield inhibitors. The presence of Ac"" can result in positive errors in the determination of HCO3-. The routine analysis of HCO3- and Ac- need to be undertaken carefully otherwise significant errors can result. Some commercial laboratories have been shown to be incapable of these 'routine' procedures. All of the above could result in the corrosion rate being significantly underestimated and consequently the specification of too low a corrosion allowance and/or the implementation of an insufficient inspection and corrosion control strategy. This is the acetate double whammy: © 1999 by NACE International. 1. Acetate may lead to an overestimation of the HCO3- and thus an underestimation of the corrosion rate for CO2 only. 2.

Dental fluorosis occurs as a result of excessive total fluoride intake during tooth development. Some children may receive substantial intake from soft drinks, but few studies have reported fluoride levels in soft drinks. The authors examined the fluoride concentrations of 332 soft drinks. Methods. Soft drinks were purchased from Iowa grocery stores. To identify production sites, the authors recorded product details and batch numbers. After decarbonating the drinks, the authors assayed samples for fluoride content using a fluoride ion-specific electrode, and reported the results in parts per million, or ppm, using appropriate standards and duplicate assessments. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the findings. Results. The fiuoride levels of the products ranged from 0.02 to 1.28 ppm, with a mean level of 0.72 ppm. Fluoride levels exceeded 0.60 ppm for 71 percent of the products. Results varied substantially by production site, even within the same company and for the same product. There were no substantial differences between flavors or between diet and regular soft drinks. Conclusions. The majority of soft drinks had fluoride levels exceeding 0.60 ppm. Variation in fluoride levels probably is due largely to the different water sources used in production. Clinical Implications. With no fluoride levels marked on the soft drink products or easily available from the manufacturers, it is not possible for clinicians or consumers to directly estimate fluoride ingestion from carbonated beverages. Therefore, to reduce the risk of dental fluorosis, dental and medical practitioners should be cautious about prescribing dietary fluoride supplements to preschool-aged children in nonfluoridated areas who consume large quantities of carbonated soft drinks.",,"fluoride; article; carbonated beverage; child; comparative study; human; longitudinal study; risk factor; statistics; tooth disease; United States; Carbonated Beverages; Child; Fluorides; Fluorosis, Dental; Humans; Iowa; Longitudinal Studies; Risk Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033220217

Numerical correlation within each data set suggest compellingly that for both types of data there is a fractal/mixed (""multi"") fractal property. Hydrocarbon pools and fields in the Granite Wash play appear to be somewhat fractally distributed, but not in a totally scale-invariant manner, indicative of a ""multifractal"" property to the distribution of pools and fields within the Granite Wash. Faults in the area of the Peace River Arch appear to show a fractal influence at all scales, and for different ages of faulting, including Devonian or older and Carboniferous. Fractal analysis allows one to combine data from fault-networks of different ages to assess the cumulative spatial and size distributions of faults within a given study area. Differentiation of fractal versus multifractal distributions of pool and field data is a potential tool that can be used to differentiate those plays in which there are simple controls on reservoir formation (fractal), versus those plays in which the controls are more complex (multifractal). Estimations of undiscovered hydrocarbon potential of the Granite Wash in the Peace River Arch area through fractal geometry give encouraging preliminary results, suggesting that there is much potential in the Granite Wash for the discovery of future small pools and fields. Although the present study points to an approach that may be used for approximation of hydrocarbon potential in an area, further documentation of fractal and mixed (""multi"") fractal distributions of oil and gas fields in immature play areas remains to be done. The possibilities for locating additional pools and fields locally within the Granite Wash using paleotopographic and paleostructural reconstructions, along with fractal/multifractal analysis remain to be explored.",,"fractal analysis; hydrocarbon exploration; lineament; tectonics; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033509445

We describe a prototype FACE system currently in operation in forest plots in a maturing loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stand in North Carolina, USA. The system uses feedback control technology to control [CO2] in a 26 m diameter forest plot that is over 10 m tall, while monitoring the 3D plot volume to characterize the whole-stand CO2 regime achieved during enrichment. In the second summer season of operation of the FACE system, atmospheric CO2 enrichment was conducted in the forest during all daylight hours for 96.7% of the scheduled running time from 23 May to 14 October with a preset target [CO2] of 550 μmol mol-1, ~ 200 μmol mol-1 above ambient [CO2]. The system provided spatial and temporal control of [CO2] similar to that reported for open-top chambers over trees, but without enclosing the vegetation. The daily average daytime [CO2] within the upper forest canopy at the centre of the FACE plot was 552 ± 9 μmol mol-1 (mean ± SD). The FACE system maintained 1-minute average [CO2] to within ± 110 μmol mol-1 of the target [CO2] for 92% of the operating time. Deviations of [CO2] outside of this range were short-lived (most lasting &lt; 60 s) and rare, with fewer than 4 excursion events of a minute or longer per day. Acceptable spatial control of [CO2] by the system was achieved, with over 90% of the entire canopy volume within ± 10% of the target [CO2] over the exposure season. CO2 consumption by the FACE system was much higher than for open-top chambers on an absolute basis, but similar to that of open-top chambers and branch bag chambers on a per unit volume basis. CO2 consumption by the FACE system was strongly related to windspeed, averaging 50 g CO2 m-3 h-1 for the stand for an average windspeed of 1.5 m s-1 during summer. The [CO2] control results show that the free-air approach is a tractable way to study long-term and short-term alterations in trace gases, even within entire tall forest ecosystems. The FACE approach permits the study of a wide range of forest stand and ecosystem processes under manipulated [CO2](a) that were previously impossible or intractable to study in true forest ecosystems.","Elevated CO2; FACE; Forest ecosystem; Free-air CO2 enrichment; Pinus taeda; Trace gas exposure technology","carbon dioxide enrichment; field method; forest ecosystem; United States; Pinus taeda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032789783

We now report on the cellular localization and hormone secretory function of a CO-producing constitutive heme oxygenase (HO-2) in mouse islets. Islet homogenates produced large amounts of CO which were suppressed dose-dependently by the HO inhibitor zincprotoporphyrin-IX (ZnPP-IX). We also show, for the first time, that glucose markedly stimulates the HO activity (CO production) in intact islets. A further potentiation was induced by the HO substrate heroin. Western blot showed that islet tissue expressed HO-2, and confocal microscopy revealed that HO-2 resided in insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide cells. ZnPP-IX dose-dependently inhibited, whereas heroin enhanced, both insulin and glucagon secretion from glucose-stimulated islets. Stimulation or inhibition of CO production was accompanied by corresponding changes in islet cGMP levels. Exogenously applied CO stimulated insulin and glucagon release from isolated islets, whereas exogenous nitric oxide (NO) inhibited insulin and stimulated glucagon release. Islets stimulated by glucose or L-arginine displayed a marked increase in their NO-synthase (NOS) activity. Such an increase was suppressed by hemin, conceivably because NOS activity was inhibited by hemin-derived CO. Consequently, heroin enhanced L-arginine-induced insulin secretion. Insulin release stimulated by either hemin-derived CO or exogenous CO was strongly inhibited by the guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ, but it was unaffected by ZnPP-IX. Glucagon release induced by CO (but not by heroin) was inhibited by ODQ and partly inhibited by ZnPP-IX. We propose that the islets of Langerhans are equipped with a heme oxygenase-carbon monoxide pathway, which constitutes a novel regulatory system of physiological importance for the stimulation of insulin and glucagon release. This pathway is stimulated by glucose, is at least partly dependent on the cGMP system, and displays interaction with islet NOS activity.",,"arginine; carbon monoxide; cyclic GMP; glucagon; heme oxygenase; hemin; insulin; nitric oxide; nitric oxide synthase; protoporphyrin zinc; animal tissue; article; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme substrate; female; glucagon release; hormonal regulation; insulin release; mouse; nonhuman; pancreas islet alpha cell; pancreas islet beta cell; priority journal; Animals; Blotting, Western; Carbon Monoxide; Cyclic GMP; Drug Interactions; Enzyme Inhibitors; Female; Glucose; Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing); Hemin; Hormones; Immunohistochemistry; Islets of Langerhans; Mice; Mice, Inbred Strains; Microscopy, Confocal; Nitric Oxide; Oxadiazoles; Protoporphyrins; Quinoxalines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032961802

Data from the '1000 lake survey' carried out in Norway in 1986 were used to derive a dose-response function for the probability of damage to fish populations as a function of the critical load exceedance, by means of a logistic regression model for fish damage. A corresponding function based on a fish damage database (brown trout, arctic char, and perch) and the national critical load database for Norway compared well with the derived dose-response function. When the critical load is not exceeded there is only a very small probability that the fish population will be damaged, but when the critical load is exceeded the chance of damage increases with the amount of exceedance. At critical load the probability of damage to fish populations is about 20. These results confirm that the critical load concept is a strong tool for estimating the extent of biological damage caused by long-range transported air pollution, and that prognoses based on this method can give reliable estimates of the extent of fish damage under future scenarios of acidic deposition.",,"acid deposition; critical load; fishery production; pollutant; Salmo trutta; Salmonidae; Salvelinus alpinus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033367886

Concentrations of available N (straw N and soil inorganic N) below 1.2% of straw dry matter significantly reduced the rate of carbon mineralization from straw residues and the growth of total soil microbial biomass (chloroform fumigation-extraction). The negative effects appeared shortly after the pool of soil mineral N had been depleted. The N effect on the microbial community was mainly caused by reduced fungal growth (ergosterol), while total bacterial biomass (epifluorescence microscopy) was not significantly affected. However, number of cellulase-producing, colony-forming bacterial units decreased with decreasing N availability. In straw-amended soil, decreasing N concentrations reduced activities of exocellulase, endocellulase and hemicellulase, while in unamended control soil the effects were opposite. We developed a model in which three fractions of straw residues, determined by proximate analysis (Van Soest), and a humus pool were assumed to decay according to first-order rate kinetics. In accordance with the microbial measurements, the microbial community was subdivided into three groups consuming readily decomposable, structural and humus materials respectively. When holocellulose decay rate was modified as a function of N availability, the model simulated N effects on C mineralization and microbial biomass growth very well. Our experiment showed that wheat straw mineralization may be retarded at N concentrations well above those frequently found after grain harvest in the field and that effects of N availability should be taken into account when modelling C and N turnover in agricultural soils. Moreover, the trial exemplified a situation where studies of functional groups of decomposer organisms were required to explain and model satisfactorily differences observed at the process level.","Cellulase; Decomposition; Ergosterol; Mathematical modelling; Microbial biomass; Nitrogen fertilization; Nitrogen immobilization; Xylanase","bacterial growth; chloroform; decomposition; enzyme activity; fluorescence microscopy; fungal growth; infection control; mineralization; model; nitrogen metabolism; soil analysis; decomposition; enzyme activity; mineralization; nitrogen; nutrient availability; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033000977

Sampling of communities was carried out along the Cape coast for species richness, species diversity, importance values and species associations. The influence of soil and other environmental factors on vegetation were also compared. While species richness values in A. arenaria communities appear similar to those of indigenous dune plant communities, diversity indices are significantly lower. However, on the basis of importance values of individual species, A. arenaria does not show extreme dominance to the exclusion of other species, as it does on the North American Pacific coast, where it has also been introduced. Because of its growth in dense tufts, A. arenaria is accompanied mostly by small chamaephytes and therophytes, while indigenous stands support more phanerophytes. Moreover, A. arenaria forms weaker species associations than dominant indigenous dune plant species. The alien status of A. arenaria in South Africa is confirmed by applying classification and ordination analyses which failed to differentiate A. arenaria communities according to their geographical origin as achieved with indigenous communities. This may be attributed to the lack of vigorous indigenous plants in A. arenaria communities, which accounts for the low variety in species composition of A. arenaria communities along the coastline. With regard to environmental factors, A. arenaria communities were observed to be less sensitive to extrinsic factors, such as climate, than indigenous dune plant communities. Results confirm that A. arenaria is an alien plant species in South Africa, but do not imply its invasiveness in the present or near future.","Biological invasion; Classification; Correspondence Analysis; Importance value; Ordination; Species association; Species diversity; Species richness","Ammophila arenaria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033392496

The computation of XRD patterns has been summarized and the origin of the distinct patterns of long-spacing compounds has been illustrated with the aid of such simulations. This also provided the possibility to evaluate the retrievable amount of information used for graphical or numerical indexing programs. Numerical indexing programs were applied and limits of indexing method have been discussed. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements and temperature-dependent XRD measurements have been carried out for the concentrations x(KC12) = 0.50 and 0.30 of the K-laurate/glycerol system. The analysis of the small- and wide-angle diffractograms in the various phase regions of the binary system as well as the DSC measurements provided the following results: The creation of the lamellar phase extends over a temperature range of ΔT ≃ 20 K at a concentration of x(KC12) = 0.50. The lamellas show a reduced degree of order. The crystalline-to-gel phase transition is accompanied by a leap in the d values corresponding to the small-angle reflexes. Also a distinct splitting of the small-angle reflexes is observed within the gel phase. Simultaneously a rearrangement and intensity decay of the wide-angle reflexes occurs. Since some wide-angle reflexes are still present, the structure can be considered to have a partially reduced three-dimensional order. During the creation of lamellar phases the d value decreases sharply with rising temperature. This decrease of d can be interpreted as a further decay of molecular order in the hydrocarbon chains of the K-laurate within the bilayers. The XRD measurements correlate with the DSC data. According to our measurements a revision of the phase diagram with respect to the actual extension of the gel-phase region was necessary.","Data acquisition; Indexing; K-laurate; Lyotropic liquid crystals; X-ray diffraction","glycerol; hydrocarbon; lauric acid; algorithm; article; crystal structure; data analysis; differential scanning calorimetry; gel; liquid crystal; mathematical computing; noise reduction; phase transition; priority journal; temperature; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344117505

The reduction of carbon generation in helium discharges is consistent with this conclusion. CD-band intensities in the private flux region were smaller in the w-shaped divertor than in the open divertor, suggesting that the divertor dome is effective in decreasing chemically sputtered hydrocarbon molecules. The observed CD-band intensity was fairly reproduced by simulation using the IMPMC-code. When deuterium gas was puffed into the divertor, Zeff value in the main plasma became about 15% larger than with puffing from main chamber. For reducing impurity in the main plasma, the gas puffing from the top of main plasma was effective.",,"Carbon; Computer simulation; Impurities; Plasma simulation; Sputtering; Chemical sputtering; Divertors; Impurity transport; Software package IMPMC; Tokamak devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032689598

Replacing the hydrocarbon tail connected to the quinone ring by an ethyl group, we have computed the rotational potential energy surfaces for psQ- and ubQ-. Our results show that in the absence of environmental effects both systems have global minima for near-perpendicular orientations of the γ-carbon relative to the quinone ring. For psQ-, however, a low-lying local minimum is also observed for an in-plane arrangement with Cγ pointing away from the O4 oxygen. These differences in head-to-tail rotational energy surfaces may explain the experimentally observed differences in β-proton hyperfine couplings of psQ- vs ubQ- and mnQ-, and their corresponding model compounds. By replacing the C6 methyl group in ubQ and mnQ by hydrogen, or the C6 hydrogen in psQ by methyl, we show that the crucial factor determining the rotational arrangements of the quinones in biological systems (planar psQ in green plants; perpendicular ubQ and mnQ in bacteria) is the presence or absence of this methyl group. The computed barrier height to rotation in ubQ-, ca. 6 kcal/mol, and the β-proton hyperfine coupling constants for the planar vs perpendicular arrengements are in excellent accord with experimental data. Finally, we show that the methoxy group at the C2 position in ubiquinone displays a conformational preference as a result of the electron addition process, which may effect the hydrogen bonding pattern and hence promote the electron-transfer processes.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000346611

Thirty-nine Vi/Vc and 26 Vc/C1 neurons that responded to mechanical and electrical stimulation of the cornea were examined for convergent cutaneous receptive fields, responses to natural stimulation of the corneal surface by CO2 pulses (0, 30, 60, 80, and 95%), effects of morphine, and projections to the contralateral thalamus. Forty-six percent of mechanically sensitive Vi/Vc neurons and 58% of Vc/Cl neurons were excited by CO2 stimulation. The evoked activity of most cells occurred at 60% CO2 after a delay of 7-22 s. At the Vi/Vc transition three response patterns were seen. Type I cells (n = 11) displayed an increase in activity with increasing CO2 concentration. Type II cells (n = 7) displayed a biphasic response, an initial inhibition followed by excitation in which the magnitude of the excitatory phase was dependent on CO2 concentration. A third category of Vi/Vc cells (type III, n = 3) responded to CO2 pulses only after morphine administration (&gt; 1.0 mg/kg). At the Vc/C1 transition, all CO2-responsive cells (n = 15) displayed an increase in firing rates with greater CO2 concentration, similar to the pattern of type I Vi/Vc cells. Comparisons of the effects of CO2 pulses on Vi/Vc type I units, Vi/Vc type II units, and Vc/C1 corneal units revealed no significant differences in threshold intensity, stimulus encoding, or latency to sustained firing. Morphine (0.5-3.5 mg/kg iv) enhanced the CO2-evoked activity of 50% of Vi/Vc neurons tested, whereas all Vc/C1 cells were inhibited in a dose-dependent, naloxone-reversible manner. Stimulation of the contralateral posterior thalamic nucleus antidromically activated 37% of Vc/C1 corneal units; however, no effective sites were found within the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus or nucleus submedius. None of the Vi/Vc corneal units tested were antidromically activated from sites within these thalamic regions. Corneal-responsive neurons in the Vi/Vc and Vc/C1 regions likely serve different functions in ocular nociception, a conclusion reflected more by the difference in sensitivity to analgesic drugs and efferent projection targets than by the CO2 stimulus intensity encoding functions. Collectively, the properties of Vc/C1 corneal neurons were consistent with a role in the sensory-discriminative aspects of ocular pain due to chemical irritation. The unique and heterogeneous properties of Vi/Vc corneal neurons suggested involvement in more specialized ocular functions such as reflex control of tear formation or eye blinks or recruitment of antinociceptive control pathways.",,"carbon dioxide; morphine sulfate; naloxone; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; cornea; dose response; electrostimulation; intravenous drug administration; male; mechanical stimulation; nociception; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; receptive field; spinal cord dorsal horn; thalamus; trigeminal nucleus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032693864

During the course of the work presented in this series, accumulations of such radionuclides have been studied at austenitic stainless steel type 08X18H10T (GOST 5632-61) surfaces (this austenitic stainless steel corresponds to AISI 321). Comparative experiments have been performed on magnetite-covered carbon steel (both materials are frequently used in some Soviet VVER type PWRs). For these laboratory-scale investigations a combination of the in situ radiotracer 'thin gap' method and voltammetry is considered to be a powerful tool due to its high sensitivity towards the detection of the submonolayer coverages of corrosion product radionuclides. An independent technique (XPS) is also used to characterize the depth distribution and chemical state of various contaminants in the passive layer formed on austenitic stainless steel. In the first part of the series the accumulation of 110mAg has been investigated. Potential dependent sorption of Ag+ ions (cementation) is found to be the predominant process on austenitic steel, while in the case of magnetite-covered carbon steel the silver species are mainly depleted in the form of Ag2O. The XPS depth profile of Ag gives an evidence about the embedding of metallic silver into the entire passive layer of the austenitic stainless steel studied. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this report, the organization of the human secretin receptor (hSR) gene was characterized by overlapping genomic phage clones. The hSR gene consists of 13 exons and 12 introns with all the splice donor and acceptor sites conforming to the canonical GT/AG rule. By transient reporter gene assays, the wild-type promoter, containing 3.0 kb of the hSR gene 5' flanking region, was able to drive 5.8±0.6 and 6.6±0.2-fold (P<0.01) increases in luciferase activities in pancreatic ductule-derived PANC-1 and BPD-1 cells, respectively. By subsequent 5' and 3' deletion analysis, a promoter element was identified within -408 to -158, relative to the ATG codon. This promoter element was found to be cell-specific since it could drive reporter gene expression in PANC-1 and BPD-1 cells but not in Hs 262.St, Hs 746T and αT3-1 cells. The study of the transcriptional control of human secretin and its receptor should shed light on the pathological developments of pancreatic cancer and autism in the future.

Two different General Circulation Models (GCMs) are used to examine the response of water budget variables to changes in temperature and precipitation. The changes in temperature and precipitation when going from a simulated 1xCO2 atmospheric concentration to a simulated 2xCO2 atmosphere are applied to a current climatic data set and interpolated to 29 0.5°of latitude by 0.5°of longitude grid points covering the study region. The Thornthwaite-Mather water budget is evaluated at each grid point for both GCM data sets. Evaluation of data developed by two different GCMs over the Delaware River Basin shows only minor changes in temperature (an increase) and precipitation (a decrease) in going from current to hypothetical 2xCO2 conditions. The hydroclimate of the area should experience warmer and dryer conditions with less surplus of water, a decrease in streamflow, as well as increase in water deficit conditions, and a marked decrease in snow accumulation.

Central to the determination of quantitative critical loads of acidity for forests (and other ecosystems) is the rate at which the minerals in the soil weather or dissolve. Seven methods for determining these rates on a regional basis for the production of critical load maps have been suggested by the official bodies which are responsible for co-ordinating the European critical load mapping efforts. These methods are largely correlations which require a knowledge of the soil parent material and/or the soil mineralogy. The purpose of this paper is to review these weathering rate calculation methods and to assess whether it is currently possible to calculate numerically accurate critical loads for the production of regional critical load maps. A consideration of the data used to generate these methods and comparisons of the weathering rates calculated using various methods leads to the conclusion that at present it is not. Further work is needed to develop and maintain the initial credibility of critical loads both scientifically and as an aid to policy decisions.

Depletion of pore-water sulfate resulted in a period of elevated H2 concentrations that made acetogenic CO2 reduction thermodynamically favorable. During this period, 14C-acetate was produced from 14CO2 at rates comparable to those of methanogenesis or sulfate reduction during their respective periods of dominance in the incubation.

In the future, high efficient vehicles at very low emission levels will include low temperature fuel cell systems (e.g., polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC)) as units of hydrogen-, methanol- or gasoline-based electric power trains. In the case of methanol or gasoline/diesel, hydrogen has to be produced on-board using heated steam or partial oxidation reformers as well as catalytic burners and gas cleaning units. Methanol could also be used for direct electricity generation inside the fuel cell (direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC)). The development potentials and the results achieved so far for these concepts differ extremely. Based on the experience gained so far, the goals for the next few years include cost and weight reductions as well as optimizations in terms of the energy management of power trains with PEFC systems. At the same time, questions of fuel specification, fuel cycle management, materials balances and environmental assessment will have to be discussed more intensively. On the basis of process engineering analyses for net electricity generation in PEFC-powered power trains as well as on assumptions for both electric power trains and vehicle configurations, overall balances have been carried out.

Summer, mid-day carbon dioxide uptake was higher than at other boreal coniferous forests, averaging about -13 μmol CO2m-2s-1. Nocturnal summer ecosystem respiration averaged ~6 μmol CO2m-2s-1 at a mean temperature of ~15°C. Significant ecosystem C uptake began with the thawing of the soil in early April and was abruptly reduced by the first autumn frost in early October. Half-hourly forest CO2 exchange was regulated mostly by the incident photosynthetically active photon flux density (PPFD). In addition to the threshold effects of freezing temperatures, there were seasonal effects on the inferred photosynthetic parameters of the forest canopy. The functional response of this forest to environmental variation was similar to that of other spruce forests. In contrast to reports of carbon loss from northerly boreal forest sites, in 1996 the Howland forest was a strong carbon sink, storing about 2.1 t C ha-1.","AmeriFlux; Bowen ratio; Carbon exchange; Eddy covariance","carbon dioxide; ecosystem function; environmental change; forest ecosystem; gas exchange; respiration; temporal variation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033384922

The total release of carbon to the atmosphere over the period 1850-1995 was 43.5 PgC. The clearing of forests for permanent croplands released 33.5 PgC, about 75% of the total. The reduction of biomass in the remaining forests, as a result of shifting cultivation, logging, fuelwood extraction, and associated regrowth, was responsible for a net loss of 11.5 PgC, and the establishment of plantations withdrew from the atmosphere 1.5 PgC, most of it since 1980. Based on comparisons with other estimates, the uncertainty of this long-term flux is estimated to be within ±30%. Reducing this uncertainty will be difficult because of the difficulty of documenting the biomass of forests in existence &gt;40 years ago. For the 15-y period 1981-1995, annual emissions averaged 1.07 PgC y-1, about 50% higher than reported for the 1980s in an earlier study. The uncertainty of recent emissions is probably within ±50% but could be reduced significantly with systematic use of satellite data on changes in forest area. In tropical Asia, the emissions of carbon from land-use change in the 1980s accounted for approximately 75% of the region's total carbon emissions.

Because of unusually good foraminiferal preservation for sediments of this age, we have obtained an unaltered oxygen and carbon isotope profile and an accompanying record of planktic and benthic foraminifer abundance changes across the OAE 2 interval. Biostratigraphic, sedimentologic, and chemostratigraphic analyses indicate that more than 0.5 m.y. between the onset and tail end of OAE 2 are missing. This explains why organic-rich sediments are absent from the Site 1050 sequence and why the planktic and benthic carbon isotope shifts are minor (∼0.8‰) compared with the most complete OAE 2 sections. While planktic species diversity shows relatively minor change across the OAE 2 interval, extinction of the rotaliporids and Globigerinelloides bentonensis, a shift to Heterohelix-dominated assemblages, and increased abundance of helvetoglobotruncanids at the onset of OAE 2 cause a dramatic change in the planktic foraminifer assemblage composition. The rotaliporid extinction occurs at the level where middle bathyal temperatures are estimated to have increased from 15 to 19°C, which is warmer than any other time during the Cretaceous and Cenozoic. This deep water warming may have caused a breakdown in the vertical structure of the water column, and could explain the extinction of deeper dwelling planktic species, including Rotalipora and G. bentonensis. On the other hand, sea surface temperature estimates based on planktic foraminiferal δ18O values (corrected for salinity) remain steady throughout the CTBI, varying between 23 to 26°C. The presence of volcaniclastic sediments within the OAE 2 interval at Site 1050 is consistent with previous suggestions that the CTBI was a time of anonymously high rates of CO2 flux into the atmosphere and oceans during a major phase of explosive volcanic activity and large igneous province emplacement in the Caribbean and other regions worldwide.

A review of environmental and health conditions in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the newly industrialized states (NIS) shows that pollution has declined across the area, but for different reasons. In the slower-reforming countries, reduced pollution may be simply the temporary effect of an economic downturn and could be erased when growth resumes. By contrast, the advanced reformers, mainly in the CEE group, have made solid gains in improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions intensity of pollutants. Both groups of countries inherited environmental 'hot spots' where highly polluting activities cause poor environmental quality. The report looks at the key environmental issues identified in the 1993 Environmental Action Program for Central and Eastern Europe, including air and water pollution and the associated health burdens. The concept of a disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) was used, along with other indicators, to assess the health effects of changes in environmental conditions under the transition. Damages from air pollution have declined in the CEE group but have increased in the NIS, partly because of the general worsening of the health status of the population. Water quality depends greatly on local infrastructure, which has deteriorated in the economically hard-hit NIS. Nevertheless, infant mortality rates do not indicate any increase in water-related deaths and disease, except in some countries. Although use of agricultural fertilizers and pesticides might be expected to lead to a decrease in nitrate-laden runoff, nitrate levels in rural drinking water do not appear to have improved significantly. Air pollution and dirty water are more serious problems in the NIS than in the CEE group. Within the NIS, air pollution is the more important problem in the northwestern part, and clean water is a high priority in the southeastern countries, especially in rural areas. International and country efforts should reflect these differing concerns and needs.",,"economic reform; environmental economics; environmental impact; transitional economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032786865

Transmyocardial laser revascularization (TMR) has been demonstrated effective for relieving angina, although prior studies have yielded inconsistent results regarding postoperative myocardial perfusion and function. This study evaluated long-term changes in myocardial perfusion and contractile reserve after TMR in a model of hibernating myocardium. Methods. Miniswine had subtotal left circumflex coronary artery occlusion to reduce resting blood flow to 10% of baseline. After 2 weeks in the low-flow state, positron emission tomography and dobutamine stress echocardiography were performed to document ischemic, viable (hibernating) myocardium in the left circumflex distribution. Animals then had sham redo thoracotomy (n = 4) or TMR (n = 6). Six months later the positron emission tomography and dobutamine stress echocardiography studies were repeated. Results. Myocardial blood flow in the left circumflex distribution as measured by positron emission tomography was significantly reduced in all animals after 2 weeks in the low-flow state. In animals that had TMR, there was significant improvement in myocardial blood flow to the lased regions 6 months postoperatively. No significant change in myocardial blood flow was seen in sham animals at 6 months. Dobutamine stress echocardiography after 2 weeks of low-flow demonstrated severe hypocontractility at rest in the left circumflex region of all animals, with a biphasic response to dobutamine consistent with hibernating myocardium. In animals that had TMR, there was a trend toward improved resting function and significantly improved regional stress function in the lased segments 6 months postoperatively, consistent with a reduction in ischemia. Global left ventricular wall motion at peak stress improved significantly as well. There was no change in wall motion 6 months postoperatively in sham-operated animals. Conclusions. This study found improvements in myocardial perfusion and regional and global contractile reserve 6 months after TMR in a porcine model of hibernating myocardium. This improved perfusion and function likely accounts for the clinical benefits of the procedure.",,"dobutamine; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; coronary artery circumflex branch; heart infarction; heart muscle blood flow; heart muscle contractility; heart muscle revascularization; heart perfusion; laser surgery; male; nonhuman; positron emission tomography; priority journal; stress echocardiography; swine; thoracotomy; Animals; Coronary Circulation; Disease Models, Animal; Laser Surgery; Male; Myocardial Contraction; Myocardial Revascularization; Myocardial Stunning; Swine; Swine, Miniature; Tomography, Emission-Computed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033001591

We isolated a Tn917-insertional mutant of L. monocytogenes (strain LO28), which expressed a hemolytic phenotype in the presence of cellobiose. Using hly fusions to luxAluxB genes, we show that hly expression was derepressed in the presence of cellobiose at the transcriptional level. Surprisingly, hly expression was still repressed by glucose, as observed for the parental strain. Genetic analysis of the Tn917-flanking regions indicated that the transposon had inserted in a non-coding region located between two genes in opposite orientations. These two newly identified genes were designated orfA and mdrL. The insertion occurred immediately upstream of orfA, likely into its promoter region. Transcriptional analysis of orfA and mdrL revealed that Tn917 had abolished orfA expression whereas it had activated expression of mdrL. orfA encodes a putative protein of 176 amino acids homologous to YfiO of Bacillus subtilis (28% identity), a protein of unknown function. mdrL codes for a putative protein of 398 amino acids homologous to Bmr and Blt of B. subtilis (21-24% identity), two members of the multidrug resistance efflux pump family.

As a result, modern structural steel is based on less than 0.09 % C, guaranteeing also that any deterioration of the heat affected zone toughness by local brittle zones (LBZ) is avoided. The origin of LBZ can be traced back to microsegregations originated during the solidification via the peritectic reaction. Based on a clean steel strategy with low carbon, phosphorus and sulphur, high strength grades of 355 to 460 MPa yield strength have become common in steel structures. In order to guarantee both, high strength and good toughness, the thermomechanical rolling of low carbon steel in combination with accelerated cooling or direct quenching gets applied, which simultaneously leads to a well balanced property profile in the steel and, consequently, increased safety of the fabricated structure. The excellent property combination of HSLA steel allows weight reduction as well as cost reduction in transportation and fabrication, leading to an increased realisation of steel structures.

Two trends are consistent across the response of plant species to growth at elevated CO2: decreased leaf nitrogen content and increased photosynthetic gas exchange. While both of these are very important to the understanding of plant and ecosystem responses to climate change, little research has evaluated the consequences of these patterns on reproductive allocation and seed production. 2. For this reason, Bromus madritensis ssp. rubens was grown in ambient (360 μmol mol-1), x 1.5 ambient (550 μmol mol-1) and elevated (700 μmol mol-1) CO2 environments to compare the relationship between allocation to growth and reproduction as a function of CO2 growth environment. 3. There were no differences in final total biomass or reproductive mass between CO2 growth environments. There were significant decreases in reproductive mass per unit total mass and per unit vegetative mass, but not per unit leaf surface area (LSA), as growth CO2 environment increased from 360 to 700 μmol mol-1 CO2. Despite these decreases, the number of seeds produced per unit LSA in elevated CO2 significantly increased as compared to ambient CO2. These results may be owing to a shift in allocation to greater investment in vegetative growth as compared to reproduction under elevated levels of atmospheric CO2. 4. Prior to reproduction, there were no significant differences between CO2 treatments in carbon uptake by leaves. In contrast, plants grown in elevated CO2 did not show a decline in photosynthetic rate during seed filling, suggesting that nitrogen may not have been re-translocated from leaves to seeds as apparently occurred in ambient plants. 5. Patterns measured here may partially explain the parental effect of CO2 environment exhibited in Bromus. Seeds produced from elevated parental CO2 growth conditions lead to seedlings that produce smaller leaves that are delayed in development and smaller roots as compared to structures produced by seeds from ambient-grown parents. 6. Because the success of Bromus is partially owing to its ability to produce large numbers of viable seeds, these changes in reproductive allocation and subsequent seedling performance with respect to growth in an elevated CO2 environment may have impacts on community composition in the Mojave Desert.","Allocation; Bromus; Elevated CO2; Gas exchange; Mojave Desert; Reproduction","carbon dioxide enrichment; grass; reproductive strategy; seed production",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033428022

In greening potato tubers, similar to some procaryotes, formate is directly synthesized via a ferredoxin-dependent fixation of CO2, serving as the main precursor for carbon skeletons in biosynthetic pathways. In other plant species and tissues, formate appears as a side-product of photorespiration and of fermentation pathways, but possibly also as a product of direct CO2 reduction in chloroplasts. Formate metabolism is closely related to serine synthesis and to all subsequent reactions originating from serine. Formate may have a role in biosynthesis of numerous compounds, in energetic metabolism and in signal transduction pathways related to stress response.

These catalytic functions were partial-reduction of CO2 to CO, C-C bond formation, and -OH group formation.

This first method is the default methodology and is the easiest method to apply for estimating country-specific methane emissions and requires the least amount of data. Alternatively, the second method is more complex and requires more information than the first method. As many countries do not have detailed information on solid waste disposal practices, it is anticipated that most countries use and will continue to use the mass-balance approach for estimating time-series of methane emissions. The mass-balance approach uses an assumption regarding annual waste disposal that can overestimate methane emissions. In this paper a correction factor is presented for adjusting the mass-balance approach to account for non-steady state conditions in annual waste disposal. Use of such a correction factor results in estimates that approach those generated by more complex methods. In summary, the analysis performed indicates that the modified approach typically results in more than a 20 reduction in the methane emissions inventory and methane emissions that are within the range of estimates based on the more complex first-order kinetics approach.","Emissions; Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC); Landfills; Methane; National","biogas; methane; bioassay; climate; conference paper; greenhouse effect; kinetics; methodology; priority journal; solid waste management; First-order kinetics method; Greenhouse gases; Mass balance method; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Kinetic theory; Mathematical models; Methane; Solid wastes; Land fill",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033237185

Research Lab., Research Triangle Park, NC 27711, United States","Biogenic emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from forests play an important role in regulating the atmospheric trace gas composition including global tropospheric ozone concentrations. However, more information is needed on VOC emission rates from different forest regions of the world to understand regional and global impacts and to implement possible mitigation strategies. The mixed deciduous and coniferous forests of northern Wisconsin, USA, were predicted to have significant VOC emission rates because they are comprised of many genera (i.e. Picea, Populus, Quercus, Salix) known to be high VOC emitters. In July 1993, a study was conducted on the Chequamegon National Forest near Rhinelander, WI, to identify and quantify VOC emitted from major trees, shrubs, and understory herbs in the mixed northern forests of this region. Emission rates were measured at various scales - at the leaf level with cuvettes, the branch level with branch enclosures, the canopy level with a tower based system, and the landscape level with a tethered balloon air sampling system. Area-average emission rates were estimated by scaling, using biomass densities and species composition along transects representative of the study site. Isoprene (C5H8) was the primary VOC emitted, although significant quantities of monoterpenes (C10H16) were also emitted. The highest emission rates of isoprene (at 30°C and photosynthetically active radiation of 1000 μmol m-2 s-1) were from northern red oak (Quercus rubra, &gt; 110 μg(C) g-1 h-1); aspen (Populus tremuloides, &gt; 77); willow (Salix spp., &gt; 54); and black spruce (Picea mariana, &gt; 10). Emission rates of hybrid poplar clones ranged from 40 to 90 μg(C) g-1 h-1 at 25°C; those of Picea provenances were generally &lt; 10, and emission rates of a hybrid between North American and European spruces were intermediate to parental rates. More than 30 species of plants were surveyed from the sites, including several from previously unstudied genera such as Alnus, Chamaedaphne, Ledum, Tilia, Rubus, and Sphagnum. Based on the measured isoprene concentrations in the daytime atmospheric surface layer and mixed layer, area-averaged fluxes of isoprene were estimated to be about 1 mg(C)m-2 h-1. This estimate agrees reasonably well with model predictions. Our results indicate that mixed forests in the Lake States region of the USA are a significant source of reactive VOC to the atmosphere. Accurate estimates of these emissions are required for determining appropriate regulatory air pollution control strategies. Future studies are needed to extrapolate these estimates to other landscapes and to better understand the factors controlling observed variations in VOC emissions.","Isoprene; Monoterpene; Picea; Populus; Quercus; Salix; Tropospheric ozone; VOC","Biogenic emission; Isoprene; Estimation; Mathematical models; Ozone layer; Plants (botany); Volatile organic compounds; Particulate emissions; volatile organic compound; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; boundary layer; coniferous forest; deciduous forest; emission; volatile organic compound; air analysis; air monitoring; air pollution; air pollution control; article; atmospheric dispersion; forest; ozone layer; priority journal; United States; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033167854

This process is demonstrated for Virginia pine (Pinus virginiana). USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data for more than 100 000 plots and nearly 3 million trees east of the 100th meridian were analyzed and aggregated to the county level to provide species importance values for each of more than 2100 counties. County-level data also were compiled on climate, soils, land use, elevation, and spatial pattern. Regression tree analysis (RTA) was used to devise prediction rules from current species-environment relationships, which were then used to replicate the current distribution and predict the potential future distributions under two scenarios of climate change (2 x CO2). RTA allows different variables to control importance value predictions at different regions, e.g. at the northern versus southern range limits of a species. RTA outputs represent the potential 'environmental envelope' shifts required by species, while the migration model predicts the more realistic shifts based on colonization probabilities from varying species abundances within a fragmented landscape. The model shows severely limited migration in regions of high forest fragmentation, particularly when the species is low in abundance near the range boundary. These tools are providing mechanisms for evaluating the relationships among various environmental and landscape factors associated with tree-species importance and potential migration in a changing global climate.","Climate change; FIA; GIS; Landscape ecology; Migration; Model; Regression tree analysis; Species distribution","climate change; ecological modeling; spatial distribution; tree; United States; Pinus virginiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033082620

The PCB pollutants in the Baltic Sea are mainly by long-range atmospheric transports (the PCB deposition with the atmospheric precipitation onto the sea surface) making about 8 t/yr. It was estimated that each year the Baltic Sea receives 9 tons of PCB. The water exchange with the North Sea results in the removal of around 3.5 tons of PCB per year. This circumstance underlines the necessity to study the importance of biological processes in the decomposition, transformation, and removal of pollutants from a marine ecosystem. The expedition materials that characterize the processes of biosedimentation of suspended organic matters (SOM) in different Baltic Sea regions are analyzed.

Collisional activation experiments were used to establish a Ge-C-H connectivity in this species, for which a significant fraction of the ion population was found to survive neutralisation- reionisation mass spectrometry (NRMS) experiments. Thus, the neutral counterpart [Ge,C,H]0 is stable on a microsecond timescale. Becke's 3 parameter hybrid density functional (B3LYP) was used to map the ion and neutral potential-energy surfaces, in conjunction with double-zeta and triple-zeta basis sets. The computational results obtained using the triple- zeta basis sets suggest that, for the cation, the global minimum is the high spin 3Σ GeCH+, with the first Ge-C-H excited state, 1Σ GeCH+, approximately 39 kcal mol-1 less stable. The lowest energy ion structure with H-Ge-C connectivity is bent (3A''HGeC+,angleH-Ge-C = 126.3) and 69 kcal mol-1 less stable than the global minimum. For the neutral, a doublet (2π) with Ge-C-H connectivity is predicted to be the global minimum. The classical barrier for the neutral 1,2-hydrogen shift reaction on the doublet surface is negligible (0.1 kcal mol-1), while the smallest barrier for the cation is 13.0 kcal mol-1, corresponding to (3A'') HGeC+ → (3Σ) GeCH+. Natural bond order analysis has been used to establish the order of the metal-carbon bond for selected states of both the neutral and the ion. Neutral and cationic isomers with Ge-C triple bonds were found to be high- energy excited states, with the metal-carbon bonds in the cation and neutral ground states of order 2.0 and 2.5, respectively. The instability of Ge-C triple bonded species is attributed to the energy required for electronic promotion in the metal in order to achieve a hybrid configuration suitable for the formation of such a bond.","Ab initio theory; Mass spectrometry; NBO; Organogermanium ions","carbon; germanium; germanium derivative; hydrogen; metal; article; chemical bond; ionization; isomer; mass spectrometry; quantum chemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032837559

However, it has still been implemented - for a month in 1996 and for the period June-September in 1997 and 1998 - and accompanied by a large information programme. Its implementation brought significant reductions in some air pollutants and reduced traffic congestion. It also received considerable public support.

Herbarium specimens provide physiognomic data for published species lists for the 30 sites; climate data are from a variety of published sources. By limiting the sampled region to equatorial Africa, where annual amount and seasonality of rainfall are critical determinants of vegetation, leaf physiognomy is found to be related linearly to moisture variables. Principal components analysis demonstrates that the pattern of variation among leaf variables is primarily a function of mean annual and wet months (total of all months with ≥50 mm) rainfall. Multiple regression models are derived for mean annual rainfall, wet months rainfall and the number of dry months. Accuracy of each model is tested by comparing the adjusted predicted values (the value for a case when it is not included in calculation of the regression line) to the actual climate values at the 30 sites. Leaf size is the strongest correlate of moisture; the mesophyll size class has the most significant positive relationship with annual and wet months rainfall. Entire-margined species increase with wet months rainfall and temperature. Acuminate tip and length/width ratio are also positively related to mean annual and wet months rainfall. Rounded base, emarginate tip, and acute tip are inversely related to rainfall variables. Regression models derived from modern plants and climate can be used to reconstruct seasonal and annual rainfall from Cenozoic African leaf fossils.","Africa; Leaves; Mathematical models; Paleobotany; Paleoclimatology; Regression analysis","Cenozoic; paleoclimate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032945531

It was a project developed through a public/private partnership involving several leading technological and industrial organizations, with primary funding by the Department of Energy (DOE). The primary goals of the project were to gain valuable information on the technical readiness and economic viability of hydrogen fueled buses and to enhance the public awareness and acceptance of emerging hydrogen technologies. The bus completed its field-testing and was placed into public service on September 4, 1998 by Augusta Public Transit in Augusta, Georgia. The bus employs a hybrid Internal Combustion (IC) engine/generator and battery powered electric drive system, with onboard storage of hydrogen in metal hydride beds. The initial operating results demonstrated an overall energy efficiency (miles/BTU) twice the range of a similar diesel-fueled bus, while doubling the range of an all-electric vehicle by providing in-transit recharging of the batteries. Subsequent data showed that the power controller was not optimized for maximum battery life and, therefore, some efficiency was lost. Correction of that condition would provide a daily range of at least 120 miles in a hybrid hydrogen/electric-operating mode. The project developed reduced engine tail-pipe emissions, with NOx measured at less than 0.2 ppm. In addition todemonstrating the inherent safety of a solid-state hydrogen storage system, the project also addressed permit, liability, and safety issues, including a safety risk assessment of the metal hydride storage system. State-of-the-art technology in battery system management was likewise demonstrated.

Awareness about increasing contribution of automotive vehicles to air pollution particularly in major Indian cities has led to the enforcement of more and more stringent vehicle emission regulations. Emission norms to be applicable from April 1, 2000 for gasoline and diesel vehicles call for major changes in the engine design and a substantial improvement in the present level of fuel quality. Various fuel characteristics significantly affect the vehicle emissions. Main properties of attention are content of lead, sulphur, benzene, aromatics, olefins and oxygenates, and fuel stability in case of gasoline; and cetane number, distillation range, oxidation stability, aromatics content, sulphur content and density in case of diesel fuel. This paper presents a review of the worldwide trends in fuel quality changes for meeting emission norms. Future Indian requirements and their implications are discussed. Effect of various fuel characteristics on vehicle emissions has been reviewed. An effort has been made to co-relate emission norms with fuel quality requirements in India for meeting projected emission norms up to year 2005. Indian vehicle emission norms for the year 2005 have been speculated. In India, for the year 2005, total elimination of leaded gasoline and the gasoline and diesel fuel specifications similar to proposed European fuel specifications for the year 2000 have been proposed.",,"Automotive fuels; Benzene refining; Diesel fuels; Distillation; Environmental regulations; Fuel gages; Gasoline; Machine design; Specifications; Sulfur; Automotive vehicle; Diesel vehicles; Fuel characteristics; Leaded gasoline; Oil industries; Oxidation stability; Sulphur content; Vehicle emission; Vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028754466

The core enzyme is homologous to those of bacteriophages T3, T7 and SP6 whereas the specificity factor shows similarities with bacterial sigma factors. Recently it was shown that the bacteriophage-type core enzyme is widespread among the eukaryotic lineage and a common picture for the mitochondrial transcription apparatus in eukaryotic cells is now emerging. In contrast to the situation for the core enzyme, the gene for the specificity factor has only been identified from S. cerevisiae and more recently from two other yeast species. As the specificity factor is the key component for initiation of transcription at the mitochondrial promoter we wanted to study in more detail gene expression, regulation, and the function of the promoter of the nuclear MTF1 gene. For this purpose the messenger RNA level for scMTF1 was investigated under a large number of different growth conditions and thereby exhibited a very low, but regulated and carbon source-dependent, expression. Deletion experiments identify the minimal promoter for functional complementation in yeast. To evaluate the functional conservation of the promoter elements the homologous MTF1 gene from the closely related yeast Sacchaormyces douglasii was isolated and tested in heterologous complementation experiments. In spite of a highly conserved protein sequence these studies demonstrate that at low-copy number sdMTF1 is not able to substitute for scMTF1 in S. cerevisiae. Promoter exchange experiments with MTF1 from S. cerevisiae and S. douglasii demonstrate that differences in gene expression are responsible for the failure in heterologous complementation. This finding prompted us to compare the promoter regions of MTF1 from four different yeast species. For this purpose the sequences of the 5' regions from S. douglasii, S. kluyveri and Kluyveromyces lactis were determined. A comparison of these sequences identifies significant differences and rapid changes in the intergenic regions, even between closely related yeast species.","Heterologous gene expression; Mitochondrial transcription; Regulation; Specificity factor MTF1; Yeast","cell nucleus DNA; RNA polymerase; sigma factor; transcription factor; article; bacteriophage t3; bacteriophage t7; eukaryotic cell; fungal genetics; gene expression; genetic complementation; genetic conservation; mitochondrion; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; saccharomyces cerevisiae; transcription initiation; 5' Untranslated Regions; Antibodies; Base Sequence; Cell Nucleus; Conserved Sequence; Evolution, Molecular; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Genes, Fungal; Genetic Complementation Test; Kluyveromyces; Mitochondria; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutagenesis, Insertional; Promoter Regions (Genetics); RNA, Messenger; Saccharomyces; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Sequence Deletion; Species Specificity; Transcription Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032880464

Since PHM is a copper-containing monooxygenase, a study of the interaction between the reduced enzyme and carbon monoxide has been carried out as a probe of the interaction of the Cu(I) sites with O2. The results show that, in the absence of peptide substrate, reduced PHM binds CO with a stoichiometry of 0.5 CO/Cu(I.), indicating that only one of the two copper centers, Cu(B), forms a Cu(I)-carbonyl. FTIR spectroscopy shows a single band in the 2200-1950 cm-1 energy region with v(CO) = 2093 cm-1 assigned to the intraligand C-O stretch via isotopic labeling with 13CO. A His242Ala mutant of PHM, which deletes the Cu(B) site by replacing one of its histidine ligands, completely eliminates CO binding. EXAFS spectroscopy is consistent with binding of a single CO ligand with a Cu-C distance of 1.82 ± 0.03 Å. The Cu-S(met) distance increases from 2.23 ± 0.02 in the reduced unliganded enzyme to 2.33 ± 0.01 Å in the carbonylated enzyme, suggesting that the methionine-containing Cu(B) center is the site of CO binding. The binding of the peptide substrate N-Ac-tyr-val-gly perturbs the CO ligand environment, eliciting an IR band at 2062 cm-1 in addition to the 2093 cm- 1 band. 13CO isotopic substitution assigns both frequencies as C-O stretching brads. The CO:Cu binding stoichiometry and peptide/CO FTIR titrations indicate that the 2062 cm-1 band is due to binding of CO at a second site, most likely at the Cu(A) center. This suggests that peptide binding may activate the Cu(A) center toward O2 binding and reduction to superoxide. As a result of these findings, a new mechanism is proposed involving channeling of superoxide across the 11 Å distance between the two copper centers.",,"carbon monoxide; copper; oxygen; peptide; superoxide; unspecific monooxygenase; animal cell; article; chemical binding; chemical interaction; crystal structure; energy; enzyme analysis; enzyme binding; infrared spectroscopy; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; spectroscopy; stoichiometry; Alanine; Animals; Binding Sites; Carbon Isotopes; Carbon Monoxide; Catalytic Domain; CHO Cells; Copper; Cricetinae; Histidine; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Multienzyme Complexes; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Spectrum Analysis; Substrate Specificity; Superoxides; X-Rays; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033576285

The operons encode most enzymes of the Calvin-Benson-Bassham carbon reduction cycle required for CO2 assimilation. Their transcription depends on the activator protein CbbR. Structure-function relationships in the cloned chromosomal promoter region were analyzed by site-directed mutagenesis. P(L) was altered in its presumed hexameric -35 and/or -10 box or in the spacer region between the boxes to achieve a greater or lesser resemblance to the structure of the σ70 consensus promoter of Escherichia coli. P(L)::lacZ transcriptional fusions of various promoter variants were assayed in transconjugant strains of R. eutropha as well as in corresponding cbbR deletion mutants. Mutations increasing the similarity of the -35 and/or -10 box to the consensus sequence stimulated P(L) activity to various extents, whereas mutations deviating from the consensus decreased the activity. The length of the spacer region also proved to be critical. The conversion of the boxes, either individually or simultaneously, into the consensus sequences resulted in a highly active P(L). All improved P(L) mutants, however, retained the activation under inducing or derepressing growth conditions, although the full-consensus promoter was nearly constitutive. They were also activated in the cbbR mutants. The activity of the overlapping, divergently oriented cbbR promoter was less affected by the mutations. The half- and full-consensus P(L) mutants were comparably active in E. coli. Two major conclusions were drawn from the results: (i) the location and function of P(L) were verified, and (ii) indirect evidence was obtained for the involvement of another regulator(s), besides CbbR, in the transcriptional control of the R. eutropha cbb operons.",,"carbon dioxide; transcription factor; article; deletion mutant; DNA sequence; Escherichia coli; nonhuman; operon; priority journal; promoter region; site directed mutagenesis; Wautersia eutropha; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli; Negibacteria; Prokaryota; Ralstonia; Ralstonia eutropha; Wautersia eutropha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032808780

Emission transients are obtained near the cathode, at the end of the steady-state cathode fall, and near the anode. Spatial scans of absolute optical emission at the 750 and 811 nm lines are taken during the development of the cathode fall.

A recently developed mathematical model was used to study the individual effects of fleet mass distribution, impact speed reductions and inherent vehicle protection on average injury and fatality rates for downsized fleets. A baseline fleet of 700-2000 kg was downsized by a) reducing all vehicle masses by 10% or 20% and b) by removing all cars heavier than 1400 or 1200 kg. The results showed that the safety can be maintained if the vehicle masses are reduced proportionally to their original mass. A higher safety level can be achieved by removing the heavier vehicles. Traffic safety can be further enhanced by impact speed reductions or by improvements of restraint systems and vehicle compatibility. The safety level would rise more by implementation of radar-activated brakes or controlling city speed limits than by intensified highway patrols, to eliminate crashes with impact speeds over 140 mph or with an average velocity change of 70 mph. However, a maximum impact speed at 100 mph would reduce the number of fatalities more effectively than a small reduction in all impact speeds. It was concluded that a downsized fleet can result in fewer fatalities, depending on the downsizing strategy.

To obtain the skin temperature diurnal cycle and fully utilize satellite measurements, we have designed an efficient algorithm that combines model results with satellite and surface-based observations and interpolates satellite twice-daily observations into the diurnal cycle. Climatological information from a climate model, CCM3/BATS, is used to determine a normalized shape (typical pattern) of the diurnal temperature for different latitudes, seasons, and vegetation types. The satellite observations, which are by themselves inadequate, are combined with the normalized modeled diurnal typical patterns to obtain the skin temperature diurnal cycle. The normalized typical patterns depend on the parameters of the diurnal insolation, such as sunrise, sunset, and peak times, and are also affected by the type of vegetation cover and soil moisture. The underlying physical foundation of this algorithm is that the diurnal cycle of temperature can be viewed as a composite of a daily average, diurnal periodic component, and random aperiodic component (noise). With the assumption that the noise can be ignored, the daily average can be inferred from satellite twice-per-day measurements and the periodic part can be obtained from modeled climatologies, providing a reasonable approach for estimation of the diurnal cycle of skin temperature. The general framework of the algorithm and its application for the clear-sky (cloud free) conditions are presented. This cloud-free version of algorithm is evaluated using FIFE and BOREAS field experiment surface observations. Regional tests over the Mississippi River basin have also been conducted using GOES-8 and AVHRR observations. Uncertainties of this cloud-free algorithm have been analyzed, indicating an accuracy of about 1-2 K for monthly cloud-free diurnal cycles at near-pixel resolution.

The costs were calculated separately for rural, urban and city-center traffic.In this study, the costs involved in the use of petrol, diesel, natural gas, biogas, and methanol (produced from natural gas and biomass) in cars and heavy trucks are compared. The cost includes fuel cost, extra capital cost for vehicles using alternative fuels, and the environmental cost of VOC, NO(x), particulate and CO2 emission based on actual 1996 and estimated 2015 emission factors. The costs have been calculated separately for rural, urban and city-centre traffic. A complete macroeconomic assessment of the effect of introducing alternative fuels is not, however, included in the study. The study shows that no alternative fuel can compete with petrol and diesel in rural traffic when the economic valuation of CO2 emission is taken as current Swedish CO2 taxes ($200/tonne C). In cities with a natural gas network, natural gas is the fuel with the lowest cost for both cars and heavy trucks, based on 1996 emission factors. Methanol from natural gas and biogas from waste products can also compete with diesel in urban traffic. With predicted improvements in technology and subsequent emission reductions, no alternative fuel can compete with petrol in any of the traffic situations studied by 2015, and only in city-centre traffic will alternative fuels be less costly than diesel in heavy vehicles. Of the biomass-based fuels studies, low-cost biogas from waste products is the most competitive one and is, already at current CO2 taxes, the fuel with lowest cost for heavy trucks in urban traffic in areas where natural gas networks do not exist. To enable the more widespread use of biomass-based fuels, i.e. using feedstocks such as energy crops or logging residues that are available in larger amounts, the economic valuation of CO2 emission has to be 2-2.5 times higher than current Swedish CO2 tax level.","Alternative fuels; Emissions; Environmental costs; Transportation","air pollution; carbon dioxide; economics; Air pollution; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Crude petroleum; Diesel fuels; Gas emissions; Methanol; Motor transportation; Natural gas; Nitrogen oxides; Synthetic fuels; Volatile organic compounds; Economic valuation; Environmental costs; Automotive fuels; alternative fuel; atmospheric pollution; emission control; traffic emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033105291

The response of global tropospheric ozone in the period 1990-2075 was an increase of 6.4 ppb when both climate and emissions changes were included, compared to an increase of 10.3 ppb when only emissions changes were considered. This difference is mainly due to water vapor and temperature increases, together with some dynamical effects.

Aims: To determine prevalence of and risk factors for clinical hypothyroidism in patients treated with lithium carbonate. Method: Retrospective case-note review of 718 patients who had undergone serum lithium estimation during a 15-month period. Patients on thyroxine had a more detailed review. Results: The prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism during lithium treatment was 10.4%. The main risk factor was female gender (women 14% v. men 4.5%). Women were at highest risk during the first two years of lithium treatment, and women starting lithium aged 40-59 years had the greatest prevalence (> 20%). No equivalent risk factors emerged in men, although, like women, their prevalence of hypothyroidism was substantially higher than community rates. Conclusions: The high rates of clinical hypothyroidism identified may call for a review of the drug information given to women, particularly to those starting lithium in middle age. Consideration should be given to screening for thyroid antibodies before treatment in high- risk cases. Monitoring of thyroid function should take into account gender, age and stage of lithium treatment.

Similarly, changes in decomposition and nutrient mineralization are likely to occur if the soil warms and the soil moisture conditions are altered. Plant and microbial responses have usually been investigated separately, and few, if any, studies have addressed simultaneous responses to environmental changes in plants and soil microorganisms, except in models. We measured simultaneous responses in biomass, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) incorporation in plants and microorganisms after five years of factorial fertilizer addition, air warming, and shading. We expected increased N and P uptake by microorganisms after fertilizer addition and also after warming, due to increases in mineralization rates in warmer soils. Plant productivity and N and P uptake were expected to increase after fertilizer addition but less after warming, because microbes were expected to absorb most of the extra released nutrients. Shading was expected to decrease plant production and also microbial biomass, due to the reduced production of labile carbon (C) in plant root exudates associated with reduced photosynthesis. We found that the plants responded strongly to fertilizer addition by increased biomass accumulation and N and P uptake. They responded less to warming, but more than expected, showing a decline in N and P concentrations in many cases. There were few significant responses to shading. The strongest response was found in combined fertilizer addition and warming treatments. All functional vascular plant groups responded similarly. However, mosses declined under those conditions when vascular plant growth was most pronounced. Contrary to our expectation, microbial C, N, and P did not increase after warming, but microbial N and P increased after shading. As expected, fertilizer addition led to increased microbial P content, whereas microbial N either increased or did not change. In general, microbial C did not change in any treatment. The microbes accumulated extra N and P only when soil inorganic N or P levels increased, suggesting that the soil microorganisms absorbed extra nutrients only in cases of declining N and P sink strength in plants.","Arctic; Climate change; Ecosystem nutrient uptake; Fertilizer addition; Field experiment; Light attenuation; Microbial biomass C, N, and P; Nutrient cycling; Plant biomass; Plant-microbe interactions","climate change; growth response; light availability; microbial community; nutrient availability; plant; warming; Arctic; Bryophyta; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032873720

The nitrogen functionality in some of the carbons was investigated by nitrogen X-ray Absorption Near-Edge Structure Spectroscopy (XANES), and thermogravimetric analysis-mass spectrometry was used as a means of studying the combustion properties. The nitrogen species present in the carbon are similar to those observed in coals and carbons, and there is some indication of a portion of chelated metal still being present for a lower (873 K) heat-treated carbon prepared from tetraphenylporphine cobalt (II). Even so, the effect of nitrogen functionality on NO emission is secondary to the effect of carbon structure on NO reduction. A model is presented which discusses NO emission in terms of the steady-state surface oxygen concentration on the carbon. In the case of catalyzed carbon combustion, the NO reduction reaction is also catalyzed. Carbons prepared from these types of metal-containing precursors show larger catalytic effects in combustion than transition metal-impregnated carbons.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Carbonization; Catalysis; Catalysts; Coal combustion; Cobalt compounds; Gas emissions; Heat treatment; Nitrogen oxides; Organometallics; X ray spectroscopy; Tetraphenylporphine cobalt; X ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy; Charcoal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032638808

Reoxidation in N2O ambient showed three distinguished oxidation regions as a function of tube pressure; that is, enhancement at 10-40 torr, retardation at 40-100 torr, and enhancement at 100-600 torr. The N2O-nitridation at 40 torr incorporated much less nitrogen in oxide bulk than that at near-atmospheric pressure. The 40 torr N2O-nitridation case exhibited about 70% of nitrogen incorporation at the Si/SiO2 interface compared to that of the 600 torr N2O-nitridation case. The low-pressure N2O-nitridation at 40 torr results in improvement of TDDB of gate dielectrics and the transconductance of nMOSFET's compared to the nitridation at near-atmospheric pressure. These data suggest that low pressure oxynitridation should be more recommendable for device application.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Dielectric materials; MOSFET devices; Nitrogen; Oxidation; Pressure effects; Transconductance; Gate dielectrics; Oxynitridation; Gates (transistor)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032595883

Based on the values observed for these biological variables, the Sep Reservoir was considered to have evolved to an oligo-mesotrophic state. Spatiotemporal variations of bacterial variables were a consequence of the seasonal evolution of the reservoir coupled with the resource availability. Multivariate regression analyses suggest that about 14 and 26% of the variance in bacterial standing stock and activity may be explained by the physical environment (i.e., temperature) and a resource availability index (chlorophyll a concentration or primary production), respectively. A carbon budget indicated that 4-126% (mean = 20%) of the ambient PP may be channeled through the microbial loop via bacterial biomass production. Heterotrophic bacterial production in the Sep Reservoir may therefore, on occasion, represent a significant source of carbon for higher order consumers.","Bacteria; Heterotrophic uptake; Plankton; Primary and bacterial production; Reservoirs","carbon; chlorophyll a; abundance; bacterium; biomass; carbon budget; heterotrophy; population dynamics; reservoir; article; bacterial colonization; bacterial metabolism; biomass; glucose transport; nonhuman; phytoplankton; priority journal; reservoir; temperature sensitivity; water temperature; Auvergne; France; Sep Reservoir; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033306229

This recovered energy can be used for heating or cooling purposes, eliminating the need for a separate boiler. Significant reductions in energy, criteria pollutants, and carbon emissions can be achieved from the improved efficiency of fuel use. Generating electricity on or near the point of use also avoids transmission and distribution losses and defers expansion of the electricity transmission grid. Several recent developments make dramatic expansion of CHP a cost-effective possibility over the next decade. First, advances in technologies such as combustion turbines, steam turbines, reciprocating engines, fuel cells, and heat-recovery equipment have decreased the cost and improved the performance of CHP systems. Second, a significant portion of the nation's boiler stock will need to be replaced in the next decade, creating an opportunity to upgrade this equipment with clean and efficient CHP systems. Third, environmental policies, including addressing concerns about greenhouse gas emissions, have created pressures to find cleaner and more efficient means of using energy. Finally, electric power market restructuring is creating new opportunities for innovations in power generation and smaller-scale distributed systems such as CHP. Our integrated analysis suggests that there is enormous potential for the installation of cost-effective CHP in the industrial, district energy, and buildings sectors. The projected additional capacity by 2010 is 73 GW with corresponding energy savings of 2.6 quadrillion Btus, carbon emissions reductions of 74 million metric tons, 1.4 million tons of avoided SO 2 emissions, and 0.6 million tons of avoided NO x emissions.

The momentum, energy and mass transport in the curtain and surrounding regions were calculated using a two dimensional finite volume model of a lithography tool. Argon was used for the gas curtain. The results from the calculations quantify the relationship between the argon flow rate and the hydrocarbon partial pressure in the region of the optical elements. In general, the hydrocarbon partial pressure decreases as the mass transfer Peclet number, Pe = Vh/D, increases, where V is the velocity of the argon, h is the thickness of the gas curtain and D is the mass diffusivity.

Three new features are described that give significant new capabilities to this class of models. These are: endogenization of end-use demands, which allows computation of partial equilibria in energy markets; modelling future uncertainties using multi-stage stochastic programming; and combining several bottom-up models as a multi-region model to explore issues of cooperation and burden-sharing. Each of these new features is illustrated by results taken from large-scale extended MARKAL models of Quebec and Ontario. The focus of the paper is on the nature of issues that can be addressed by this methodology, rather than on specific conclusions drawn from the discussed examples. We believe that a very promising avenue of research lies in exploring the role of multiple advanced bottom-up models in the integrated assessment of climate change.",,"Greenhouse effect; Mathematical models; Mathematical programming; Regional planning; Strategic planning; Bottom-up energy models; Multi-region models; Stochastic programming; Supply-demand equilibrium; Energy policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033320351

A case of endogenous HEV infection has been reported in the US. Recently, HEV-like virus was isolated from swine in Iowa. Swine production is a major industry in Iowa with the potential for human exposure to swine in and around industrial and family farm operations. Objective: The study objective was to determine whether individuals in Iowa are exposed to HEV. Study design: Anti-HEV antibody prevalence in four selected Iowa populations was determined. Sera were collected from 204 patients with non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis (non-A-C); 87 staff members of the Department of Natural Resources (DRN); 332 volunteer blood donors in 1989; and 111 volunteer blood donors in 1998. All sera were tested for anti-human HEV IgM and IgG by ELISA with confirmation of positivity by a peptide neutralization test. Results: Both the patients with non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis (4.9%) and the healthy field workers from the Iowa DNR (5.7%) showed significantly higher prevalence of anti-HEV IgG antibodies compared to normal blood donor sera collected in 1998 (P<0.05). Conclusions: Human HEV or a HEV-like agent circulates in the Iowa geographical area. At-risk human populations with occupational exposure to wild animals and environmental sources of domestic animal wastes or with unexplained hepatitis have increased seroprevalence of HEV antibodies.

Data Ctr., Asheville, NC, United States","Trends and multi-decadal variations of weather and climate extremes have only recently received attention from the climate community. Interest has stemmed from exponentially increasing economic losses related to climate and weather extremes, and apparent increases in deaths attributed to these events, suggesting that key decision makers need a better understanding of the potential uses of climate information. The need for data on climate extremes in disaster mitigation activities such as the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction also has provided another motivation for focus in this area. The losses cited above raise questions as to whether extreme weather events are actually increasing in frequency, whether society as a whole is becoming more vulnerable to extreme weather events, whether public perception has been unduly influenced by enhanced media attention, or some combination. Given these questions, of particular interest here is the extent to which we can document changes in climate and weather extremes. Attribution of ongoing trends to specific climate forcings, such as anthropogenic effects or other factors related to natural climate variability are still equivocal. For some areas and variables increases in the frequency of extreme events are apparent, while in other areas there are suggestions of declines in these events. A review of this information suggests that further understanding of the cause(s) of the apparent changes in climate and weather extremes is strongly dependent upon progress in our ability to monitor and detect these multi-decadal trends. Based on these analyses we show that this will likely require increased attention in the following areas: 1) The development of more effective international data exchange for high resolution historical climate and weather records, 2) Increased emphasis on rescuing data with appropriate resolution from deteriorating manuscripts and other non-electronic media, 3) A greater emphasis on removing inhomogeneities in the instrumental record and ongoing weather monitoring programs (that provide much of our information about changes and variations of weather and climate extremes), 4) More effective use of space-based measurements and reanalysis products derived from models, 5) More robust monitoring of local extreme weather events such as tornadoes, hail, lightning, and wind, and 6) More effective means to integrate and communicate information about what we know and do not know about changes in climate extremes. Progress in each of these areas is reviewed in context with outstanding remaining challenges, and the benefits that can be expected if we meet these requirements.",,"climate change; extreme event; forecasting method; natural hazard",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032776172

In several past studies that developed BHC emissions estimates for urban areas, a volumetric approach was used to estimate leaf masses of urban trees. Crown volumes were modeled by geometric solids and then multiplied by species-specific leaf-mass constants (experimentally determined leaf mass-to-volume ratios) to obtain leaf mass, although associated uncertainties were not well characterized. The purpose of the present study was to examine the precision and accuracy of a volumetric approach using geometric solids to compare estimated leaf masses to measured whole-tree leaf masses, and to compare leaf-mass constants derived from selective sampling within crowns to whole-tree values. Accordingly, total leaf masses obtained through tree harvest and leaf removal of 21 urban trees were compared to leaf masses calculated using geometric solids to model the shapes of tree crowns and leaf-mass constants found in the literature. Leaf masses were also calculated from recently published allometric equations. Using the experimentally measured total leaf mass and dimensions of each tree, whole-tree leaf-mass constants were also calculated. Results from this study suggest that leaf-mass estimates developed for individual trees through a volumetric approach may be within ~50% of actual values. For the 21 trees in this study, sums of leaf-mass estimates were within ~20% of the sum of the measured leaf masses when the vertical ellipsoid, sphere, or preferred solids were used. Leaf masses per unit area of crown projection for these urban trees were greater than the values of leaf mass per ground surface area reported for eastern deciduous forests.","Accuracy of; Biogenic hydrocarbon emissions inventory; Leaf mass of urban cf. forest trees; Leaf-mass constants; Leaf-mass estimation; Urban forest","biogenic emission; hydrocarbon; leaf area; measurement method; propose leaf mass as; Viridiplantae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032697839

In two patients, the mucous cyst recurred within 3 weeks and 11 months, respectively, after laser therapy. Although complete remission cannot be achieved in all patients, carbon dioxide laser vaporization of mucous cysts is fast and easy to perform.

Both prehistoric and modern faunal species were analysed with all fish from the modern context. Results indicate that regional variation is greater than temporal variation and can be attributed to proximity to Lake Baikal and its rich aquatic resources. Stable isotope analyses of fish and seals from Lake Baikal indicate a wide range of variation in isotope values. δ15N values for the freshwater seals of Lake Baikal average 14 ± 1.1‰. Freshwater fish are highly variable in the δ13C values ranging from -24·6‰ for the pelagic omul (Coregonus autumnalis migratorius) to -12.9‰ for littoral species such as ide (Leuciscus idus). Terrestrial herbivores have much lower δ15N values, ranging from 4 to 5‰ for deer and elk.

Among the CA isoenzymes, CA IV and II have been shown to be present in the rat epididymal duct epithelium. In the present study, we examined the expression and androgen regulation of CA IV and II mRNAs along the epididymal duct. Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of CA II mRNA in all regions of the epididymis with the strongest signal in the corpus region, while CA IV mRNA was expressed predominantly in the corpus epididymidis. Three days after bilateral castration, CA IV and II mRNAs were decreased by 80-90% in the corpus epididymidis. Testosterone (T) replacement maintained the expression of CA mRNAs at 50-60% of the control levels, indicating that circulating androgens alone are not sufficient to recover the CA expression in the corpus region. However, unilateral castration did not affect the mRNA levels of CA IV and II, suggesting that factors in testicular fluid do not play a major role in the regulation of CA expression in the corpus epididymidis. Immunoblot analysis showed that CA IV protein levels decreased 3 days after castration, while T administration maintained the protein expression virtually at the precastration levels. These data demonstrate that mRNAs for CA IV and II are predominantly expressed in the corpus region of the rat epididymis and can be regulated by androgens in that region. The present data suggest that the regulation of CA expression in the corpus epididymidis by androgens contributes to the known androgen effects on epididymal acidification.",,"androgen; carbonate dehydratase II; messenger RNA; testosterone; animal tissue; article; controlled study; corpus luteum; epididymis; gene expression; hormonal regulation; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; regulatory mechanism; spermatozoon maturation; spermatozoon motility; testis; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032758630

In only one unrepeatable case did the time response differ from a first order function: showing an overshoot in PM emissions during transition from the initial to the final steady state PM emission level. PM emissions during controlled, motored start-up experiments show a peak at start-up followed by a period during which emissions are either relatively constant or drift somewhat. When the fuel injection and ignition are shut off, PM emissions also peak briefly, but rapidly decay to low levels. Qualitative implications on the study and modeling of PM emissions during transient engine operation are discussed.

When these plants are operated at inland areas the dry type cooling towers used may significantly increase ambient concentrations of air pollutants due to the building downwash effect. When one or more buildings in the vicinity of a point source interrupt wind flow, an area of turbulence known as a building wake is created. Pollutants emitted from relatively low level sources can be caught in this turbulence affecting their dispersion. In spite of the fact that natural gas-fired combined-cycle power plants have lower air emission levels compared to other power plants using alternative fossil fuel, they can still create significant local air pollution problems. In this paper, local air quality impacts of a natural gas-fired combined-cycle power plant located in a coastal area are compared with those of another natural gas-fired combined-cycle power plant having identical air emissions but located in an inland area taking into account differences in topography and meteorology. Additionally, a series of scenarios for the inland site have been envisaged to illustrate the importance of plant lay-out configurations paying particular attention to the building downwash effect. Model results showed that different geometrical configurations of the stacks and cooling towers will cause remarkable differences in ambient air pollutant concentrations; thus it is concluded that when selecting a plant site, a detailed site-specific investigation should be conducted in order to achieve the least possible ambient air pollution concentrations with the given emissions.","Building downwash effect; Natural gas-fired combined-cycle power plants; Regulatory air quality modelling","Building downwash effect; Regulatory air quality modeling; Air pollution; Combined cycle power plants; Computer simulation; Environmental impact; Particulate emissions; Air quality; air quality; environmental impact assessment; power plant; air pollution; air quality; article; building; cooling tower; dispersion; electric power plant; meteorology; seashore; topography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032792939

In a warehouse fumigation, phosphine is most rapidly vented just after opening the warehouse for aeration. Therefore, alternative aeration techniques were tested with the objective of minimizing peak concentrations outside the warehouse through a slower and more uniform emission rate. Three types of warehouse aerations were tested: (1) a standard aeration with all doors and vents open for 3 d, (2) a modified aeration with only roof vents open for 1 d and then all doors and vents open for the following 2 d, and (3) a second modified aeration with only one large door open for 1 d and then all doors and vents open for the following 2 d. Rates of phosphine emission from the warehouses throughout aeration, gas concentrations downwind from the warehouse, and the adequacy of aeration in both the commodity and warehouse freespace were determined. Modified aerations greatly reduced phosphine peak emission rates, adequately aerated the warehouse freespace, and for most application situations, adequately aerated the tobacco. At one warehouse complex, the three types of aeration (Standard, Roof-Vent-Only and Door-Only) released 45.7, 8.5 and 9.7%, respectively, of the available gas during the first 30 min of aeration. Compared with the Standard aeration, both types of modified aeration delayed aeration of both freespace and tobacco by less than 24 h. Outside downwind concentrations of phosphine were greatly reduced by the modified aerations, especially the Roof-Vent-Only in which downwind concentrations were virtually undetectable.","Aeration; Emissions; Fumigation; Phosphine; Tobacco","Nicotiana tabacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033213694

Compositional and isotopic analyses of CO2-CH4-H2O and CH4-H2O-H2 fluids show that methane production involved two phases of magma-hydrothermal activity, which spanned super-solidus to greenschist facies metamorphic conditions. The first phase of methane generation is characterized by fluid inclusions that contain up to 30-50 mol % CO2 and 43 mol % CH4. Isotopic analyses of CO2, CH4, and H2O released at &gt;900°C yields δ13C(CO2) values of -24‰ to -2‰, δ13C(CH4) values of -30‰ to -19‰, δD(CH4) values of -244‰ to -128‰, and average δD(H2O) values of -43 ±6‰. Phase equilibria and isotopic data strongly indicate that the CO2-CH4-H2O fluids reflect Rayleigh distillation of evolved magmatic CO2, subsequent closed-system respeciation, and attendant graphite precipitation at temperatures of ∼500-800°C, and at fO2 from -3 log units below, to close to quartz-fayalite-magnetite oxygen fugacity (QFM) conditions. The second phase of CH4 production involves CH4-H2O±H2±C-fluids that contain &gt;40 mol % CH4. Phase equilibria indicate that the CH4-H2O fluids were trapped under equilibrium conditions at 400°C, very near to QFM conditions. Our study suggests that in the absence of CO2 as a stable fluid component, extensive distillation fractionation or alteration processes are required to form this later generation of methane. The mean δ13C values of methane extracted at 500°C from the gabbros (-25±4.4‰) are remarkably similar to the range of light carbon observed in studies of mantle rocks. We conclude that the presence of reduced carbon species in oceanic gabbros and mantle peridotites is a potential source of carbon in hydrothermal fluids and that serpentinization processes play a key role in the production of methane at greenschist facies conditions. Although total methane concentrations are low (0.3-0.6 mmol/kg) in the SWIR samples, on a global scale, plutonic layer 3 comprises ∼60% of the oceanic crust and thus represents a potentially immense reservoir (∼1019gCH4) for abiogenic methane in mid-ocean ridge hydrothermal systems. Production of methane and hydrocarbon species should be a common process in mid-ocean ridge systems where high-temperature fluids interact with mafic mineral phases. This is particularly significant because carbon-bearing fluids may provide sustenance to subsurface- and vent-associated microbial communities and therefore represent an important link between deep-seated hydrothermal systems and more shallow crustal environments.

Forest floor F(CO2) was regulated by surface soil water content, related to the limited storage capacity of the sandy soil equivalent to only 4 mm water per 100 mm depth of soil. Following 12 mm rainfall, forest floor FCO2 increased by 52% to a maximum value of 4.1 μmol m-2 s-1. However, the rate had returned to the general lower level by the next day in response to rapid drying of the surface soil. There was little correspondence between forest floor F(CO2) and the distributions of root and soil carbon or soil temperature. However, for soil samples returned to the laboratory, sieved to remove roots and re-watered, microbial respiration rate was positively and exponentially related to temperature. Measurements of forest floor F(CO2) by eddy covariance were in good agreement with the chamber data during the daytime when the atmosphere was regularly mixed by turbulence. Micrometeorological flux measurements at the forest floor and above the trees showed how, on average, 77% of the carbon sequestered by tree canopy photosynthesis was lost to the atmosphere by root and soil microbial respiration during the observation period. On a daily basis, the boreal forest was generally a modest net sink (-75 mmol m-2 per day), but also a small carbon source on hot and dry days.","Carbon dioxide efflux; Eddy covariance; Pinus sylvestris forest; Siberia; Soil water","carbon dioxide; coniferous forest; forest floor; soil emission; Russian Federation; Pinus sibirica; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033519210

In search of a robust, policy-relevant framework, we define vulnerability in terms of the capacity of individuals and social groups to respond to, that is, to cope with, recover from and adapt to, any external stress placed on their livelihoods and well-being. The approach that we develop places the social and economic well-being of society at the centre of the analysis, focussing on the socio-economic and institutional constraints which limit the capacity to respond. From this perspective, the vulnerability or security of any group is determined by resource availability and by the entitlement of individuals and groups to call on these resources. We illustrate the application of this approach through the results of field research in coastal Vietnam, highlighting shifting patterns of vulnerability at the household- and community-level in response to the current economic transition and drawing conclusions concerning means of supporting the adaptive response to climate stress in the case of tropical cyclone impacts. Four priority areas are identified which would improve the situation of the most exposed members of the community: poverty reduction, risk-spreading through income diversification, respecting common property management rights, and promoting collective security. A sustainable response, we argue, must also address the underlying causes of social vulnerability, including the inequitable distribution of resources.",,"climate change; environmental stress; sustainability; vulnerability; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032737542

The observed spectra contain several UV resonance lines, of which the Si IV lines (λλ1394 and 1405) are the strongest. These lines are observed in absorption, so we must remove the photospheric absorption line contribution to the spectra in order to see the emission produced by the circumstellar gas. We have developed a robust method for creating such difference spectra from IUE data. In the observed spectra we see a variation in the line profiles and line centers with an orbital phase suggesting the presence of circumstellar gas. The residual emission seen in the difference spectra is strongest between phases φ = 0.3 and φ = 0.7, with a strength of up to 0.2 of the continuum flux. This is confirmed by the presence of an emission region visible in the Doppler tomogram of the λ1394 line. This is consistent with the location of an Hα ""absorption zone"" seen in tomograms of U Sge and U CrB, and with theoretical predictions of a high temperature accretion region.","Accretion, accretion disks; Binaries: eclipsing; Circumstellar matter; Stars: individual (U Sagittae); Ultraviolet: stars",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033540487

Adding to the complexity of the evolving tailpipe emission standards are differing vehicle and dynamometer test cycles and increased emphasis on CO2 reduction and higher vehicle fuel economy. In addressing the challenges posed by increasingly more stringent emissions standards and demands for high efficiency powertrain technologies, partitioning the tailpipe emissions requirements has the potential to identify and dimension significant design, development and systems tasks. This paper describes the use of emissions index, the ratio of emissions mass flow to fuel mass flow, to define the tailpipe emissions capabilities required from engine/fuel/calibration and after-treatment/control systems. When the tailpipe standard and vehicle fuel economy are fixed, engine out emissions index and after-treatment/control system effectiveness are uniquely related. The resulting partitioning is not perfect. Some base engine design and fuel characteristics, which do not strongly influence engine out emissions, can affect the performance of control and after-treatment systems. However in spite of this fuzziness, use of emissions index provides a high level structure for analyzing vehicle systems and setting development priorities. Finally, the paper examines the development challenges of selected North American, European and Japanese passenger car tailpipe emissions standards. Comparisons are made that illustrate the magnitude of changes required to move a technology developed for one market or emissions standard to others.

And, as the 21st century approaches, more attention is being placed on this issue because of the problematic global outlook for traditional oil supplies, and the effect that the burning of fossil fuels has on greenhouse gas emissions. Automobile cities, such as those in the United States, use eight times more energy per capita in private passenger transport systems than in more public transport-oriented Asian cities. These patterns can be traced to population trends in metropolitan regions and the various transport factors that flow from low-density, heavily zoned suburban-based cries compared to high-density, mixed land-use cities such as those in Asia, especially Hong Kong. Energy-use patterns cannot be defined in terms of a city's wealth, as is often claimed. Public transport energy use per capita represents a tiny fraction of that in private transport, even where public transport plays the major role in a city's transport system. Public transport offers huge savings in energy use and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Some policy implications, in terms of urban land-use change and transport infrastructure priorities, can further reduce energy use in transport and offer cities other positive outcomes for livability and sustainability.",,"Air pollution control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Land use; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Urban transport systems; Motor transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033312765

This paper supplements an earlier work dealing with a smaller sample of SRa and SRb variables. The fitted parameters T*, Td and Rd/R* are related to physically meaningful quantities. Also, quantities derived from the fits like the ratio of the luminosities of the two fitted blackbodies are confronted with independent mass-loss estimators. For the O-rich Lb variables all of the 'blue' objects can be reasonably well approximated by only one blackbody whereas the 'red' ones need two. Among the 'blue' objects a significant fraction seem to be not on the AGB at all but a kind of 'RGB pollution'. The T* values, reflecting mainly offseted (-500 K) effective temperatures for objects with small to moderate mass-loss, are significantly higher in the 'blue' cases. Carbon-rich objects differ significantly from the O-rich ones in their fit parameters. Sometimes 'unphysically' low T* are found - a result of circumstellar reddening in the high mass-loss cases. Furthermore louer values of Td, accompanied by normal T*s and large shell radii are common and can be related to the phenomenon of detached shells.

To improve the understanding and characterization of fine particulate matter in the SCAB, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) initiated a comprehensive PM10 Technical Enhancement Program (PTEP). Using enhanced PTEP monitors (specially designed multichannel/multifilter samplers), a one-year fine particulate matter (PM) monitoring program was initiated in January 1995. As part of the special monitoring program, nitric acid, ammonia, and speciated PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations were measured at five locations in the SCAB (downtown Los Angeles, Anaheim, Diamond Bar, Fontana, and Rubidoux) and at one background station (San Nicolas Island). The PM2.5 data are the first spatially resolved speciated data collected in the SCAB on an annual basis. Within the SCAB, where nitrate is a major component of PM2.5 nitrate losses have been documented. The spatial and temporal variations of the nitrate losses during PM2.5 sampling and the uncertainties of the nitrate losses are discussed. Significant losses occur at a low mass range, between 10 and 50 ìg/m3. Significant gains occur at an even lower mass range of less than 30 ìg/m3. On an annual average basis, nitrate losses vary between 1.25 and 2.32 ìg/m3 and the SCAB-wide average value of nitrate loss is 1.8 ìg/m3 based on five PTEP stations in the SCAB. The maximum nitrate losses for each station vary from 6.4 ìg/m3 to 22.5 ìg/m 3. Theoretical prediction of the sampling efficiency of the nitrate during PM2.5 sam - pling was compared with the PTEP data. In general, theoretical prediction was in good agreement with measured values. © 2001 Air and Waste Management Association.",,"nitric acid derivative; air analysis; air monitoring; air quality standard; air sampling; article; particulate matter; priority journal; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032881945

By analyzing the line shape functions of the absorption and fluorescence spectra, the first moment and the full width of the half maximum (FWHM) have been determined. Both the free energy difference (ΔG) between the ground and the Sl states and the fluorescence Stokes shift (Δν), evaluated by the first moments of the absorption and fluorescence line shape functions, show larger shift to the values in vapor in the order of Ar, C2H6, CO2, and CF3H if compared at the same ρr. There are three characteristic density regions on the density dependence of ΔG and Δν, these values show larger dependence in the lower-density region (ρr&lt;0.5) and the higher-density region (ρr&gt;2), than that in the medium-density region. The solvent density and species dependence of the FWHM of the absorption spectrum is quite similar to that of Δν. The density dependence of Δν and FWHM in Ar and C2H6 indicates that the intramolecular reorganization energy decreases with increasing the solvent density, while the effect is small. We have estimated the solvent reorganization energy (λS) in CO2 and CF3H by assuming no contribution of λS in C2H6 and Ar. We have demonstrated that the dielectric continuum model makes a good prediction on the relation between ΔG and λS, while it is poor on their density dependence. The invariance of ΔG and λS in the medium-density region can be interpreted as the density saturation around the solute molecule. In the lower-density region (ρr&lt;∼0.5), the way of the solvation is suggested to be different from those in the medium- and high-density regions. The lifetime of 5j shows a large dependence on the solvent density and species in the very low-density region (ρr∼0.05). We have also found that slow solvation dynamics exists in the lower-density region of CF3H. The origin of the dynamics is discussed in relation with the static Stokes shift. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000467595

Ten to 25% of the estimated global CO flux may be consumed by soils annually. Depth profiles for 14CO oxidation and CO concentration indicated that CO oxidation occurred primarily in surface soils and that photooxidation of soil organic matter did not necessarily contribute significantly to CO fluxes. Kinetic analyses revealed that the apparent K(m) was about 18 nM (17 ppm) and the V(max) was 6.9 μmol g (fresh weight)-1 h-1; the apparent K(m) was similar to the apparent K(m) for atmospheric methane consumption, but the V(max) was more than 100 times higher. Atmospheric CO oxidation responded sensitively to soil water regimes; decreases in water content in initially saturated soils resulted in increased uptake, and optimum uptake occurred at water contents of 30 to 60%. However, extended drying led to decreased uptake and net CO production. Rewetting could restore CO uptake, albeit with a pronounced hysteresis. The responses to changing temperatures indicated that the optimum temperature for net uptake was between 20 and 25°C and that there was a transition to net production at temperatures above 30°C. The responses to methyl fluoride and acetylene indicated that populations other than ammonia oxidizers and methanotrophs must be involved in forest soils. The response to acetylene was notable, since the strong initial inhibition was reversed after 12 h of incubation; in contrast, methyl fluoride did not have an inhibitory effect. Ammonium did not inhibit CO uptake; the level of nitrite inhibition was initially substantial, but nitrite inhibition was reversible over time.

Significant changes to gasoline properties that occurred in the first half of 1996 included an increase in oxygen content; decreases in alkene, aromatic, benzene, and sulfur contents; and modified distillation properties. Vehicle emissions were measured in a San Francisco Bay Area roadway tunnel in summers 1994-1997; gasoline samples were collected from local service stations in summers 1995 and 1996. Equilibrium gasoline headspace vapor composition was calculated from measured liquid gasoline composition. Addition of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and reduction of alkenes and aromatics in gasoline between summers 1995 and 1996 led to corresponding changes in the composition of gasoline headspace vapors. Normalized reactivity of liquid gasoline and headspace vapors decreased by 23 and 19%, respectively. Ozone formation should be reduced because of both lower gasoline vapor pressure, which leads to lower mass emissions, and reduced reactivity of gasoline vapors. The reactivity of on-road emissions measured in the tunnel decreased by 8% or less. The reduction in reactivity of on-road emissions was less than that of evaporative emissions because of increased weight fractions of highly-reactive isobutene and formaldehyde in vehicle exhaust, which resulted from the increased use of MTBE in gasoline. On-road vehicle emissions of volatile organic compounds in the tunnel appear to be dominated by vehicles that have reduced catalytic converter activity.",,"gasoline; air pollution; article; exhaust gas; health care policy; motor vehicle; petrochemical industry; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033556292

Phase 2 RFG was introduced in the San Francisco Bay Area in the first half of 1996, resulting in large changes to gasoline composition. Oxygen content increased from 0.2 to 2.0 wt%; and alkene, aromatic, benzene, and sulfur contents decreased. Gasoline density and T50 and T90 distillation temperatures also decreased. Light-duty vehicle emission rates were measured in a Bay Area roadway tunnel in summers 1994-1997. Vehicle speeds and driving conditions inside the tunnel were similar each year. The average model year of the vehicle fleet was about one year newer each successive summer. Large reductions in pollutant emissions were measured in the tunnel over the course of this study, due to a combination of RFG and fleet turnover effects. Between summers 1994 and 1997, emissions of carbon monoxide decreased by 31 ± 5%, non-methane volatile organic compounds (VOC) decreased by 43 ± 8%, and nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) decreased by 18 ± 4%. It was difficult to separate clearly the fleet turnover and RFG contributions to these changes. Nevertheless, it was clear that the effect of RFG was greater for VOC than for NO(x). The RFG effect on vehicle emissions of benzene was estimated to be a 30-40% reduction. Use of RFG increased formaldehyde emissions by about 10%, while acetaldehyde emissions did not change significantly. RFG effects reported here may not be the same for other driving conditions or for other vehicle fleets. RFG effects on evaporative emissions are also important. The combined effect of phases 1 and 2 of California's RFG program was a 20% reduction in gasoline vapor pressure, about one-fifth of which occurred following the introduction of phase 2 RFG.",,"gasoline; air pollution; article; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; petrochemical industry; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033555731

Analysis reveals that in Los Angeles, most atmospheric particles with diameters between 0.6- 0.8 μm begin as water-soluble nonsea salt background particles over the Pacific Ocean which then are transformed by significant accumulation of gas- to-particle conversion products as they are advected across the urban area. Control of primary particulate emissions alone does not reduce the amount of secondary aerosol which forms in the atmosphere and may even serve to redistribute this secondary material to particles with diameters that scatter light more efficiently. Strategies originally designed to reduce ambient ozone concentrations through the control of emissions of reactive organic gases (ROG) and oxides of nitrogen (NO(x)) would reduce fine particle mass concentrations at Claremont CA on August 28, 1987 by 9.5% under the conditions studied here, primarily by reducing aerosol nitrate concentrations.

The NOx reduction potential was often limited to 20 - 30 % in the European MVEG-A or the US FTP cycle by just adding a DeNOx catalyst on a vehicle. This result is explained by the fact that the catalyst was treated as a separate item and that the emission reduction strategy was not developed in a system approach. This paper summarizes results regarding the potential of state of the art Diesel DeNOx catalysts fitted to passenger cars and trucks when the exhaust gas system is optimized as a whole. The easiest way for a system approach is the combination of DeNOx catalysts with different working temperatures for NOx reduction. This has been demonstrated by the usage of several base metal catalysts for heavy duty applications. For passenger cars Platinum containing catalysts are strongly favored. In order to achieve high DeNOx activity a two catalyst concept has to be used. Hydrocarbons as reducing agents have to be present at both catalysts. This can be attained by multiple hydrocarbon injection or by applying a bypass solution. The catalyst type, the Platinum content and the catalyst location along the exhaust line has to be selected so that the DeNOx temperature window of the catalyst and the average gas temperature at the catalyst location fit well together. Temperature control of the exhaust gas before catalyst is one of the key parameters in this type of system development. The beneficial aspects of implementation of an exhaust gas cooler on the DeNOx performance will be shown. The type of hydrocarbon is important for the DeNOx performance as well. This can be controlled by the post injection timing using Common Rail. The usage of special diesel fuels is another alternative to use the suited hydrocarbons.

For SO2, we also compared the data from the forest sites with data obtained in nearby cities and also found no indications for any systematic effects. Applying nonparametric trend statistics we found a significant decrease of the SO2. Most of the observed decrease is due to the reductions of SO2 emissions in eastern Germany, but reductions in western Germany and the Czech Republic also played important roles.

The coordination environments of the transition metal ions in the xerogels were analysed by UV-Vis absorption, luminescence, IR absorption and EPR spectroscopies. Moreover, the spectral data are complemented with thermoanalytical methods such as differential thermal analysis (DTA), differential thermogravimetry (DTG) and thermogravimetry (TG). The UV-Vis absorption and EPR spectra show that Ni and Co ions are in the +2 valence state in both xerogel series studied.

Seasonal Climate Studs., South African Weather Bureau, Private Bag X097, Pretoria 0001, South Africa","Forecasts can never be perfect, but with improved understanding of South Africa's climate systems, the ability to predict certain climate scenarios s increased. The South African Weather Bureau is obliged to forecast these different weather and climate scenarios, while government and the private sector have a role to play in advising the public, and farmers in particular. Since climate scenarios such as seasonal drought cannot be prevented, the farming community and other water sensitive sectors of society has to accept variability and adapt to it as a normal part of management. A wide range of measures is required in response to climate variation, such as the improvement of early warning systems and the co-operation between different private and public sectors. During the 1997/98 rainfall season in South Africa, warnings of a strong El Nino event developing stimulated a great awareness and need for seasonal climate prediction by the public. As part of a strategy to be pro-active in planning and decision-making, the South African Weather Bureau issues seasonal outlooks through the Long-term Operational Group Information Centre (LOGIC) on a monthly basis to a large number of end-users in South Africa. The outlooks are distributed through fax, mail, the internet, e-mail and telephone. The Weather Bureau has a responsibility to ensure that this information is used to maximum benefit by their clients. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the use and understanding of this information by the end-user. A questionnaire was compiled and sent to end-users in order to determine how the information was absorbed by the end-user community, and what influence this information had on their planning processes during the 1997/98 summer rainfall season. Responses were received from a wide variety of sectors, including agriculture, water management, energy supply, construction, education and policy-making. It is evident from the results that users did change decisions because of the El Nino warnings during the 1997/98 rainfall season. The need for education and collaboration between different stakeholders in the user- and scientific communities is evident - users need more information on how to use and interpret the information, while forecasters need to assess what information the user actually needs, and what is the best way in presenting the information to the end-user. These issues need further attention. This paper summarises the responses to the questionnaire.",,"agricultural management; climate prediction; forecasting method; seasonal variation; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032767020

Will the Kyoto Protocol enter into force? Will there be a 'Kyoto' factor in the decisions on energy demands/fuel type in the EU15 (over and above the structural changes occurring via deregulation of electricity and gas markets)? What will happen in Japan, the only Asian Annex I country - the world's largest coal importer? What will happen in the North American energy market? With much of the detail surrounding key elements of the Kyoto Protocol still subject to determination it is impossible to predict the overall impact of either universal or partial adoption by Annex I Parties. Ratification and entry into force will be dependent on the details to underpin the principles established in the Kyoto Protocol being consistent with the expectations of the key players who signed on to the final text in Kyoto. At present, only about 12 per cent of all global coal production (480 million tonnes) is traded internationally - but the EU15 and Japan account for almost half of the global coal trade. Annex I Parties account for around 53 per cent of coal consumed globally - a declining share as demand grows in key developing economies, particularly in Asia. Asia, the growth area for the coal industry in recent years, is isolated from the direct impact of the Kyoto Protocol, with the exception of Japan. If Japan has to meet the Kyoto targets, this will impact on Japan's coal consumption and also on its economic growth. How much effect this will have will depend on the mix of policies chosen by Japan to achieve the Kyoto target (bubble/ umbrella opportunities, emissions trading, joint implementation, clean development mechanism etc.). In the second largest market region - North America - a Kyoto influence is unlikely because ratification remains very much in doubt, but cannot be ruled out. Most commentators suggest the United States will not ratify the Kyoto Protocol. But will the United States stay out of the game? Domestic actions independent of (but similar to) the Kyoto Protocol are likely to become a feature of US environmental policy action before 2005. There would be very significantly higher economic costs for Japan in implementing the Kyoto Protocol in the absence of the United States taking similar action. The other market region of significance in considering the Kyoto implications (particularly for coal) is Europe. Hard coal consumption in the European Union has fallen from around 350 million tonnes in 1991 to an estimated 240 million tonnes in 1998. This consumption pattern is likely to continue with the structural changes in the electricity market resulting in natural gas taking an increasing share of the electricity generation market. This situation is expected to be reinforced by actions taken by the European Union to achieve greenhouse gas emission reductions. But, underpinning European Union hard coal demand is around 63 million tonnes used by the steel industry-and a further 20 million tonnes into other industry (outside the power sector usage).",,"coal industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033372042

In addition, the coexistence of carbonate with silicates and reduced carbon (diamond or graphite), allows constraints to be placed on the oxidation state of the mantle. Carbonate-silicate-vapor reactions control how carbonate + silicate assemblages may form from carbon-bearing vapor + silicate assemblages with increasing pressure. In olivine-bearing rocks such as peridotite, considered the dominant rock type in the upper mantle, the lowest-pressure carbonate-forming reactions involve olivine (±clinopyroxene) reacting with CO2 (e.g., Wyllie et al. 1983). In eclogitic rocks, the essential mineral assemblage is omphacitic clinopyroxene + garnet, without olivine. Therefore, alternative carbonate-forming reactions must be sought. The carbonation of clinopyroxene via the reaction dolomite + 2 coesite = diopside + 2 CO2 was studied experimentally by Luth (1995). The alternative possibility that garnet reacts with CO2 is explored here by determining the location of the reaction 3 magnesite + kyanite + 2 coesite = pyrope + 3 CO2 between 5 and 11 GPa in multi-anvil apparatus. At the temperatures ≥1200 °C, carbonation of eclogitic rocks with increasing pressure will proceed initially by reaction with clinopyroxene, because the pyrope-carbonation reaction lies at higher pressures for a given temperature than does the diopside-carbonation reaction. Diluting the pyrope component of garnet and the diopside component of clinopyroxene to levels appropriate for mantle eclogites does not change this conclusion. At lower temperatures, appropriate for 'cold' slabs, it is possible that the converse situation will hold, with initial carbonation proceeding via reaction with garnet, but this possibility awaits experimental confirmation. Decarbonation of an eclogite under 'normal mantle' geothermal conditions by a decrease in pressure, as in an ascending limb of a mantle convection cell, would be governed by the formation of clinopyroxene + CO2. At higher pressure than this reaction, any CO2 produced by the breakdown of magnesite reacting with kyanite and coesite would react with clinopyroxene to produce dolomite + coesite. Release of CO2 from eclogite into mantle peridotite would form carbonate at sub-solidus conditions and produce a dolomitic carbonate melt if temperatures are above the peridotite-CO2 solidus.",,"carbon; carbonate; eclogite; garnet; gas phase reaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032821635

The large-scale initial conditions and boundary conditions for the regional model experiments, including SSTs, are derived from control and transient CO2 increase experiments with the GFDL R30-resolution global coupled climate model. In a case study approach, 51 northwest Pacific storm cases derived from the global model under present-day climate conditions are simulated with the regional model, along with 51 storm cases for high CO2 conditions. For each case, the regional model is integrated forward for five days without ocean coupling. The high CO2 storms, with SSTs warmer by about 2.2 °C on average and higher environmental convective available potential energy (CAPE), are more intense than the control storms by about 3-7 m/s (5%-11%) for surface wind speed and 7 to 24 hPa for central surface pressure. The simulated intensity increases are statistically significant according to most of the statistical tests conducted and are robust to changes in storm initialization methods. Near-storm precipitation is 28% greater in the high CO2 sample. In terms of storm tracks, the high CO2 sample is quite similar to the control. The mean radius of hurricane force winds is 2 to 3% greater for the composite high CO2 storm than for the control, and the high CO2 storms penetrate slightly higher into the upper troposphere. More idealized experiments were also performed in which an initial storm disturbance was embedded in highly simplified flow fields using time mean temperature and moisture conditions from the global climate model. These idealized experiments support the case study results and suggest that, in terms of thermodynamic influences, the results for the NW Pacific basin are qualitatively applicable to other tropical storm basins.",,"forecasting method; global warming; hurricane; prediction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032720896

The stacking size obtained from X-ray diffraction approaches the Lc value of the resulting carbon films as the heat treatment temperature increased. The mean average carbon basal planes in crystalline (Lc/d] also increased with increasing pyrolysis temperature. Raman spectra confirmed the progressive structural ordering as treatment temperature increased. During pyrolysis, a substantial decrease in the intensity of the band near the 1350 cm-1 region was observed, indicating a decrease in the disordered structure. The crystal size (La) of the resulting carbon films also showed a remarkable increase with increased heat treatment temperature. The resulting carbon films developed from the modified PAN films had higher Lc and La than those developed from the original PAN film. It was established that cobalt catalyzes graphitization of amorphous carbon during pyrolysis.

ORC treatment represents a “low intensity” approach to site remediation. It provides a simple, passive, low-cost and long-term acceleration of aerobic natural attenuation and has been shown to cost-effectively reduce time to site closure. ORC is now a proven technology as evidenced by its five years of use on over 5,000 sites in 50 states and 11 countries, and the existence of a full body of independent, peer reviewed literature on its performance. The first applications of ORC were for the treatment of benzene, toulene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) and other light petroleum hydrocarbon fractions. Use has now expanded to the treatment of heavier fractions such as heating oil and some of the Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). More recently. ORC has been used to bioremediate the highly mobile and problematic gasoline oxygenate methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and has been applied to sites impacted with nitroaromatics, chloroaromatics, and some of the lower-order chlorinated hydrocarbons that can be treated aerobically—most notably vinyl chloride. Since ORC is an insoluble powder, it can be packaged in material composed of a specially designed filter fabric. These “filter socks” are then contacted with contaminated groundwater via an array of wells or trenches. ORC can also be mixed directly with water to form a slurry for permanent injection applications in the saturated zone or dispersed in powdered form for the in-situ or ex-situ treatment of soil. A broad array of treatment points, in which ORC slurry is backfilled or injected, can be implemented with low-cost, small-bore push-point technologies to directly treat dissolved phase plumes and moderate levels of sorbed contaminants. Powder or slurry is traditionally used in the remediation of residual contamination at the bottom of contaminated soil excavations. © 1999 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002409523

The reduction of nitrous oxide was always enhanced by increasing temperature, whereas maximum NO conversions were observed at temperatures around 300°C. The addition of up to 7% of water was found to decrease the achievable conversions of the nitrogen oxides moderately. The activity for the removal of nitrous oxide was strongly inhibited in the presence of NO, probably via an intermediate formed from NO2 and the hydrocarbon. On the other hand, the observed NO conversions were not affected by the presence of nitrous oxide. In all cases, considerable amounts of carbon monoxide were formed from the hydrocarbons. It could be shown that the degree of ion-exchange achievable during the solid-state procedure is limited.

Fluorine and oxygen are synclinal (with an FCCO torsion angle near 70°) in the dominant conformational isomer for both the crystalline and gas phases. The minor conformer observed in the gas phase has antiperiplanar substituents (FCCO torsion angle = 180°), with a relative abundance comparable to that previously inferred from NMR measurements in solution. Hartree - Fock-based computations, as well as second-order Møller - Plesset and density functional geometry optimizations, predict the structural features closely, and the computed (unsealed) normal modes ≤350 cm-1 have frequencies not far from those measured by vibrational spectroscopy. CI singles calculations give reasonable estimates of the isomeric differences in the UV absorptions and fit the observed overtones well, though they err in predicting the absolute wavelengths. Ab initio calculations of the electronic ground states do not give a useful ordering of the relative energies of the conformational isomers, for they predict high stability for a highly nonplanar structure for which no experimental evidence is seen. Atoms-in-molecules analysis of theoretical electron densities correlates the preferences for synclinal versus antiperiplanar geometries (in 1-phenoxypropane as well as β-fluorophenetole) with double bowing of the bond paths between two methylene carbons, which (in-planar conformations with Cs symmetry) cut across the lines of centers.

This analysis assesses the potential energy, dollar, and carbon impacts of those standards at the state and national levels. We explicitly account for improvements in efficiency likely to occur in the absence of standards, but because our method for characterizing these exogenous improvements probably overestimates them, both the energy and cost savings presented in this article represent lower bounds to the true benefits. Cumulative present-valued dollar savings after subtracting out the additional cost of the more efficient equipment are about $30 billion from 1990 to 2010. Each dollar of federal expenditure on implementing the standards will contribute $165 of net present-valued savings to the US economy over the 1990 to 2010 period. Average benefit/cost ratios for these standards are about 3.5 for the US as a whole. Projected carbon reductions are approximately 9 million metric tons of carbon per year in the years from 2000 to 2010. Because these standards save energy at a cost less than the price of that energy, the resulting carbon emission reductions are achieved at negative net cost to society.Minimum efficiency standards for residential appliances have been implemented in the US for a large number of residential end-uses. This analysis assesses the potential energy, dollar, and carbon impacts of those standards at the state and national levels. We explicitly account for improvements in efficiency likely to occur in the absence of standards, but because our method for characterizing these exogenous improvements probably overestimates them, both the energy and cost savings presented in this article represent lower bounds to the true benefits. Cumulative present-valued dollar savings after subtracting out the additional cost of the more efficient equipment are about $30 billion from 1990 to 2010. Each dollar of federal expenditure on implementing the standards will contribute $165 of net present-valued savings to the US economy over the 1990 to 2010 period. Average benefit/cost ratios for these standards are about 3.5 for the US as a whole. Projected carbon reductions are approximately 9 million metric tons of carbon per year in the years from 2000 to 2010. Because these standards save energy at a cost less than the price of that energy, the resulting carbon emission reductions are achieved at negative net cost to society.",,"Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Electric appliances; Energy conservation; Environmental impact; Regional planning; Standards; Appliance efficiency standards; US residential sector; Gas emissions; carbon emission; energy conservation; energy use; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032891990

The conversion efficiency, however, declines very steeply for temperatures below about 350°C and is practically zero during the starting and warming-up period. Improving the conversion efficiency under these conditions is important, particularly in large cities, where the number of starlings per vehicle per day tends to be high. Among the more successful solutions are preheating of the catalyst electrically, warming up of the catalyst in an external combustion chamber, installation of an auxiliary small-capacity catalytic converter, and employment of an adsorbing unit between two catalysts. Although these methods are quite effective, their disadvantage lies in the fact that they require an external energy source, an additional component (a control unit) or a three-stage catalyst. In the present work an investigation was made of a solution based on the exploitation of thermal capacitance to keep the catalyst temperature high during off-operation periods. A phase-change material (PCM) with a transition temperature of 352.7°C, which is slightly above the light-off temperature of the metallic catalyst, was specially formulated, and a system comprising a catalytic converter embedded in the PCM was designed and tested. Under normal engine operating conditions, some of the thermal energy of the exhaust gases was stored in the PCM. During the time that the vehicle was not in use, the PCM underwent partial solidification, and the latent heat thus produced was exploited to maintain the catalyst temperature within the desired temperature range for maximum conversion efficiency.

Pd/Na-ZSM-5 was also studied for comparison. The states of Pd (dispersion, distribution, and oxidation state) were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), TEM, and NaCl titration before the reaction and after 10 min, and 4 and 14 h of the NO-CH4-O2 reaction at 673 K and GHSV = 90,000 h-1. Except for the initial variation in 1-2 h, the differences in the catalytic performances as well as their variation with reaction time very well corresponded with the differences and variation of the state of Pd. For example, preoxidized Pd/H-ZSM-5(A), of which Pd atoms were mostly in the isolated Pd2+ state and distributed almost uniformly in the zeolite particle, showed a high activity for NO reduction from the beginning and rapidly reached steady state. On prereduced Pd/H-ZSM-5(A), Pd was initially in highly dispersed metallic state but oxidized very quickly in the NO-CH4-O2 stream and after that the state of Pd and the catalytic performance exhibited a similar behavior as the preoxidized Pd/H-ZSM-5(A). Pd/H-ZSM-5(B), preoxidized and prereduced, had initially large PdO and Pd0 particles (140-160 Å) on the external surface, respectively, which were dispersed gradually into the micropores as isolated Pd2+. The oxidation of Pd0 was very fast. The catalytic performance changed correspondingly; from low to high activity for NO reduction and from high to low activity for CH4 oxidation. In the steady state at 673 K, all four catalysts showed the same high activity for NO reduction and modest activity for CH4 oxidation, corresponding to the same state of Pd. On preoxidized Pd/Na-ZSM-5, which showed a low activity for NO reduction, Pd atoms were mainly in the form of PdO particles (170 Å) on the external surface, and they changed little during the reaction. These results clearly demonstrate that isolated Pd2+ ions in the zeolite micropore are active and selective for NO reduction, and PdO particles on the external surface are active mainly for CH4 oxidation. These conclusions are consistent with the results in the literature and our earlier work. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

The hprK gene from Enterococcus faecalis was cloned via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence was confirmed by microscale Edman degradation and mass spectrometry combined with collision-induced dissociation of tryptic peptides derived from the HPr kinase of E. faecalis. The gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, which does not contain any ATP-dependent HPr kinase or phosphatase activity. The homogeneous recombinant protein exhibits the expected HPr kinase activity as well as a P-Ser-HPr phosphatase activity, which was assumed to be a separate enzyme activity. The bifunctional HPr kinase/phosphatase acts preferentially as a kinase at high ATP levels of 2 mM occurring in glucose-metabolizing Streptococci. At low ATP levels, the enzyme hydrolyses P-Ser-HPr. In addition, high concentrations of phosphate present under starvation conditions inhibit the HPr kinase activity. Thus, a putative function of the enzyme may be to adjust the ratio of HPr and P-Ser-HPr according to the metabolic state of the cell; P-Ser-HPr is involved in carbon catabolite repression and regulates sugar uptake via the phosphotransferase system (PTS). Reinvestigation of the previously described Bacillus subtilis HPr kinase revealed that it also possesses P-Ser-HPr phosphatase activity. However, contrary to the E. faecalis enzyme, ATP alone was not sufficient to switch the phosphatase activity of the B. subtilis enzyme to the kinase activity. A change in activity of the B. subtilis HPr kinase was only observedwhen fructose-1,6-bisphosphate was also present.",,"adenosine triphosphate; bacterial DNA; bacterial enzyme; carbon; fructose 1,6 bisphosphate; phosphatase; phosphate; protein serine kinase; recombinant protein; sugar; amino acid sequence; article; bacillus subtilis; bacterial gene; catabolite repression; controlled study; DNA sequence; enterococcus faecalis; enzyme activity; escherichia coli; gene overexpression; hydrolysis; mass spectrometry; molecular cloning; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; streptococcus; sugar transport; Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Proteins; Cloning, Molecular; Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression; Genes, Bacterial; Phosphoprotein Phosphatase; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Recombinant Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032921470

The dynamics of methane oxidation followed the Michaelis-Menten equation with low values of km (2.2-27.5 nM CH4) and Vmax (12.5-153.0 nmol CH4/(h g wet peat)). Ammonium salts introduced at concentrations exceeding 100 μg N/g, which was two orders of magnitude higher than the total content of mineral nitrogen in the peat, inhibited methane oxidation. The inhibition by ammonium was more pronounced in the samples with high intensities of methane oxidation (taken from the cotton grass and dwarf shrub-cotton grass associations). The inhibition by ammonium was found to be noncompetitive: it did not increase the saturation constant value (ks), and increasing the methane concentration did not reduce the extent of inhibition. It is suggested that the inhibiting effect of ammonium on methane oxidation is related to the toxic action of intermediates of its microbial oxidation (nitrite, hydroxylamine, and nitrate). This suggestion is based on the positive correlation between the potential nitrifying activity and the extent of inhibition of methane oxidation by ammonium (r2 = 0.89). © 1999 MAHK ""Hayka/Interperiodica"".","Inhibition by ammonium; Methane-oxidizing activity; Raised bog",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000946867

But since the origins of most of these problems lie in the activities of a variety of economic sectors, effective action to deal with the problems has to be integrated into all of the contributing sectors. Since each economic sector contributes to several environmental problems, actions within that sector can deliver benefits in several areas. Emissions of nitrogen oxides from the transport sector, for example, contribute to tropospheric ozone, acidification and urban air pollution, while sulphur dioxide emissions from the energy sector contribute to acidification and urban air pollution. If transport fumes are reduced by curbing traffic growth and providing alternative, cleaner transportation, the benefits also include reduced noise, fewer accidents and less traffic congestion - all improving the urban environment. If these 'multi-effect pollutants' as well as the secondary benefits are accounted for, the real cost-effectiveness of environmental actions is greatly improved. The UN Environmental Commission has recognised this, including a new multi-effect/multi-pollutant protocol in its Convention for Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution. A more integrated approach to pollution control can also widen political support for such measures, since it brings benefits to different areas: reducing air pollution will mean less summer smog in southern and central Europe and a decrease in acidification in northern Europe.",,"environmental economics; environmental planning; integrated approach; pollution control; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032793424

We used a metallic catalyst which was deposited onto the silicon surface prior to the CVD deposition. The films are very pure, adhere well and are very well suited for electron field emission. We measured emission at 2.6 V/μm (for 1 nA emission current) and an emission site density reaching 104/cm2 at 3-4 V/μm as measured on a phosphor screen. Electrons originate at the Fermi level and the high local fields at the emission site is produced by the geometry of the nanotube. The results obtained on these films are comparable to those from differently prepared CVD diamond films. So far, we have no evidence that electron injection occurs. The emission process is governed by field amplification at protrusions and tips. In a second experiment we have measured emission from a metallic micrometer sized grain fixed on a diamond (100) surface, with different surface termination (hydrogen, oxygen, sp2 carbon).

This isotopic shift resulted from an increase in the rate of sedimentary burial of 13C-depleted organic carbon in response to the C/T 'oceanic anoxic event. The enhanced burial rate should have led to a significant drop in the atmospheric CO2 concentration, which could explain the apparent climate cooling of early Turonian times. Here we present stable carbon isotope data for specific compounds from terrestrial leaves and marine phytoplankton, and quantify the abruptness and magnitude of the atmospheric CO2 concentration change. Isotope shifts in leaf-wax components extracted from abyssal sediments in the northeastern tropical Atlantic Ocean the components are wind-delivered from Africa indicate a sudden change in plant communities of the north African continent.

If C4 plants can outcompete C3 plants only at atmospheric CO2 concentrations below 500 p.p.m.v. (ref. 5), the observed vegetation change indicates a far larger reduction in C/T CO2 concentration some 40-80% than previously suggested. The isotopic excursion in the marine phytoplankton compounds is consistent with this estimate.

On the basis of previous observations and a previous model [Segall et al., 1994], we assume that the cause of induced seismicity is a poroelastic stressing, such that the production rate can be viewed as a stress rate for the rocks adjacent to the reservoir. During the 20-year study period the production rate has decreased dramatically, leading to a change of poroelastic stress rate from 4.5×10-3 to 1.5×10-3 MPa/yr. Accordingly, we observe a significant decrease in the size of activated fractures and a reduction of the spatial clustering of fracturing, both arguing for a stress rate impact on the fracturing pattern in the gas field. We interpret these changes in terms of a change in the deformation mode of stressed rocks from a more brittle to a more ductile behavior as the stress rate was decreased. This hypothesis is supported by independent evidence from a number of experimental, numerical, and field studies. The loading rate thus appears as a possible candidate to drive changes of b and D in time and space. The apparent sensitivity of the Earth's crust fracturing pattern to loading rate variations of much lower frequency than the tidal variations suggests that the Earth's crust deformation mode itself be frequency dependent. Also, our observations may have strong implications in contexts where the loading rate is induced by human intervention (e.g., hydrocarbon recovery, mines), suggesting the possibility of adjusting the loading rate so as to shape the fracturing pattern locally according to human needs.

Extensive use of vehicle experiments to evaluate design system tradeoffs is far too time consuming and expensive. Imperative to successfully meeting the challenges of future emission regulations and cost constraints is the development of an exhaust system simulation model which offers the ability to sort through major design alternatives quickly while assisting in the interpretation of experimental data. Previously, detailed catalyst models have been developed which require the specification of intricate kinetic mechanisms to determine overall catalyst performance. While yielding extremely valuable results, these models use complex numerical algorithms to solve multiple partial differential equations which are time consuming and occasionally numerically unstable. Furthermore, keeping these kinetic data updated with improvements in catalyst formulations is also a very time consuming process. To resolve these issues, a simple model (SIMTWC, which stands for SIMple Three Way Catalyst) to predict tailpipe exhaust emissions has been developed by combining fundamental conservation expressions for mass and energy with a first order oxygen storage model and an empirical data base of steady-state catalyst performance obtained during engine dynamometer assessments, thus eliminating the need to specify the detailed kinetic mechanisms. Advantages of SIMTWC over more complicated techniques are computational expedience and robustness with comparable accuracy. Updates to SIMTWC as catalyst formulations change are also accomplished in a timelier manner. This paper describes the mathematical formulation of SIMTWC, solution technique, input data requirements, and provides a comparison of model results with vehicle experiments.

The data presented herein amply demonstrate, however, that scientific agriculture can also provide solutions to these environmental issues in general and to mitigating the greenhouse effect in particular. In fact, agricultural practices sequester more C in soil that farming emits through land use and fossil fuel combustion. This points to another important criterion that must be considered in evaluating agricultural sustainability: The effectiveness and efficiency of agricultural practices in sequestering C in soil. Sustainable agricultural systems thus involve those soil, crop, and water management techniques that increase productivity while enhancing C sequestration in soil- crop residue management, conservation tillage, nutrient management, site specific farming, water management involving drainage and irrigation, and restoration of degraded soils through CRP/WRP, afforestation, and other proven technologies. By adopting a holistic approach and identifying and implementing appropriate policies, we can realize the vast potential of U>S> cropland to mitigate the greenhouse effect at the rate of 123-295 MMTC/yr. The net gain in c through adoption of recommended agricultural practices is 100 MMTC/yr (209 MMT/yr gain- 109 MMT/yr emissions). Like the other components of an ecosystem (Costanza et al. 1997), SOC is a valued commodity. There is a need to develop criteria for assessing the economic worth of SOC. The economic value of SOC may depend on several on-site (benefits to farmer) and off-site or societal benefits. Furthermore, the value of C in SOC vis-a-vis that in a biomass must also consider the decomposition fraction. Only 10 to 20% of the C in the biomass may be converted to SOC content. Some agronomists estimate the value of plant nutrients and available water in SOC at about $0.20/kg or $200/MT. It is also estimated that reduction in C emissions at national scales would require a carbon tax ranging from $50 to $350/MT of C (OECD 1994). Assuming a tax credit of $50/MT, net saving of 100 MMTC/yr. amounts to $25 billion/yr. or $96/capita/yr.",,"agriculture; biomass; carbon; environment; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; nutrient; soil; United States; water contamination; carbon sequestration; crop production; soil management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033404868

Both economic and environmental impacts are related to on-site and off-site effects of soil degradation (Figure 23.1). On-site impacts are due to decline in soil quality with attendant reduction in productivity and additional costs of input needed to grow plants under suboptimal conditions (Lal, 1998). Decline in soil quality has also adverse environmental effects related to emissions of greenhouse gases, and reduction in the ability of soil to denature pollutants. The latter results in pollution and eutrophication of natural waters. The off-site adverse effects of soil degradation may be agronomic due to reduction in plant growth, economic due to siltation of waterways and reservoirs, and environmental due to pollution and eutrophication of water. An important off-site adverse economic effect of soil erosion by water is the damage to recreational facilities and aquaculture (e.g., the fish and shrimp industry). In view of these concerns, several important issues have been raised among the scientific community: • Relative magnitude of on-site vs. off-site impacts of soil degradation, • Success of watershed management and participatory strategies for global food security and environment quality, and • Knowledge gaps and research and development priorities. © 2000 by CRC Press LLC.",,"Economic and social effects; Eutrophication; Food supply; Greenhouse gases; Plant life extension; Research and development management; Reservoirs (water); Soil conservation; Soils; Water conservation; Water pollution; Water treatment; Watersheds; Additional costs; Environment quality; Environmental quality; Global food security; Research and development; Scientific community; Soil degradation; Watershed management; Soil pollution",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010331680

This need was particularly brought to the fore by the Convention's research programme on long range transboundary air pollution conducted by the United Nations European Economic Commission, and in particular over the last few years, as part of the preparatory negotiations for a 'multi-pollutant, multi-effect' protocol. The objective of this protocol is to reduce the production of ground-level ozone as well as acidification and eutrophication phenomena affecting certain ecosystems, by setting maximum limits, within the various countries of Europe, for the emission of nitrogen oxides NO(x), sulphur dioxide SO2, volatile organic components (VOCs), and ammonia NH3. RAINS, an integrated assessment model, was developed to provide negotiators with a summary of the issues and to propose a rational distribution of limits between the various countries. At the request of the Ministry for the Environment and Regional Development, the INERIS formed part of the Special Team put in charge of monitoring the development of the model and succeeded in getting a part of the model to function. From a pedagogical point of view, the RAINS model represents a very interesting attempt to highlight the various components of the transboundary air pollution problem as well as the links that exist between these components. Nonetheless, in its efforts to account for both a complex and unexplored phenomenon, it cannot avoid simplification and is inevitably confronted with tricky methodological choices. It was necessary to carry out a critical analysis of the problems posed by the RAINS model, firstly because of the high stakes involved in the negotiation of the 'multi-pollutant, multi-effect' Protocol, and secondly because the model is considered as a reference for future research in the field.",,"methodology; modeling; pollution control; transboundary pollution; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033503948

Very often, customary rules control access to common-property resources. In the last few decades, many of these finely tuned systems of resource use have been disrupted by land alienation and increasing marginalization of pastoralists within national societies. In the Hanang plains of Tanzania, the grazing rotation of Barabaig pastoralists has been transformed by the appropriation of wetter pasture areas for wheat farms within a bilateral agricultural development scheme. Internal evaluations and independent assessments have challenged the economic performance of the wheat project, which has also resulted in a range of negative environmental impacts.

Industries such as painting facilities may have to treat large volumes of air, which increases the cost of an air control system. Recirculating a portion of the air back into the facility is an option to reduce the amount of air to be treated. The authors of this study developed a computer model written in Microsoft Excel 97® to analyze the impact of recirculation on worker safety and compliance costs. The model has a chemical database with over 1300 chemicals. The model will predict indoor air concentrations using mass balance calculations and results are compared to occupational exposure limits. A case study is performed on a C-130 aircraft painting facility at Hill Air Force Base, Utah. The model predicts strontium chromate concentrations found in primer paints will reach 1000 times the exposure limit. Strontium chromate and other solid particulates are nearly unaffected by recirculation because the air is filtered during recirculation. The next highest chemical, hexamethylene dusocyanate, increases from 2.6 to 10.5 times the exposure limit at 0 percent and 75 percent recirculation, respectively. Due to the level of respiratory protection required for the strontium chromate, workers are well protected from the modest increases in concentrations caused by recirculating 75 percent of the air. The initial cost of an air control system is $4.5 million with no recirculation and $1.8 million at 75 percent recirculation. The model is an excellent tool to evaluate air control options with a focus on worker safety. In the case study, themodel highlights strontium chromate primers as good candidates for substitution. Themodel shows that recirculating 75 percent of the air at the Hill painting facility has a negligible impact on safety and could save $2.7 million on the initial expenses of a thermal treatment system. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Because of the strong affinity of carbonaceous surfaces for organic species and because of the ease with which compounds in a high oxidation state can oxidize the carbonaceous surface, it is highly likely that carbonaceous aerosols are interacting chemically with a range of organic species in ways that have, as yet, not been fully characterized but may significantly affect the oxidizing capacity of our atmosphere. If HONO is formed on the surface of carbonaceous aerosols then this could be a significant source of HOx as HONO is readily photolyzed to give OH, and it could explain the large values of HONO often observed in the troposphere. In general, the reduction of NOy on carbonaceous aerosols is an important consideration, and it is addressed here.

The smooth gradients in precipitation and temperature are the reasons why most gradients in ecosystem properties are also smooth. The west-east gradient in precipitation and the north-south gradient in temperature result in corresponding gradients in plant community types, net biomass production by plants, soil carbon storage, and nitrogen availability to plants.

To provide data in this area, this study measured above-ground productivity in western wheatgrass (Agropyron smithii) and vegetative stem growth in big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), and carbon isotope discrimination in both species over several years of varying water availability. Estimates of Δ were regressed against spring soil moisture estimates, and plant productivity measurements against Δ estimates. For sagebrush, carbon isotope discrimination estimates were positively related to spring soil moisture levels (p = 0.027, r2 = 0.11) and productivity estimates (p = 0.002, r2 = 0.23).

In plants that reproduce sexually, fitness can be described both by a female and a male component. Whereas the existence of genetic variation in the response to elevated CO2 of traits related to female fitness has been the focus of recent studies, studies on the response of the male component of fitness are still missing. Here, we report on the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and nutrient availability on the pollen quality of five full-sib families of Epilobium angustifolium. We did not detect an effect of the treatments on the in vitro pollen tube growth. However, we observed significant variation among families for pollen germination probabilities and a significant family x CO2 x nutrient interaction on this trait. This indicates that, in combination with nutrients, increased CO2 could exert a selection pressure resulting in changes in the genetic structure of populations and in their mean response to CO2. It seems important that this evolution is included in models simulating the consequences of climate change on plant communities.","Carbon dioxide; Epilobium; Genetic variation; Genetics; Male fitness; Nutrients; Pollen","carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; genetic variation; germination; nutrient availability; Epilobium angustifolium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033042919

The number of major spills occurring each year has decreased since the 1970s, but spillages and operational discharges from tankers nonetheless constitute a significant input of oil to the marine environment. The rapid uptake of oil and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by exposed fish and shellfish, resulting from large oil spillages in coastal waters, poses a potential threat to human consumers of fish and shellfish and also affects the marketability of catches. In this article, the processes influencing uptake and retention of PAHs in fish and shellfish are outlined by drawing on the experience gained from previous incidents. This includes particular reference to three recent major oil spills from tankers in the United Kingdom and the United States, those involving the Exxon.Valdez, Braer, and Sea Empress, and to the resulting contamination of local stocks. A more uniform approach to oil spill monitoring would aid comparisons between spills and would help interpret the kinetics and dynamics of released hydrocarbons in future cases.

The results of the study, above all the map of city climatopes are based on the latter a map of planning tips serve as an important basis for urban planning and have already been used for the setting up of a land-use and development plan. Finally the paper will focus its interest on the exceptional quality of the tributary valleys east of Graz, where as a consequence of their highly significance for fresh air supply, a zoning into areas of restricted and banned construction has been carried out. This inclusion of climatological results in urban planning is unique within Austria and is now also being practised in other cities of the province of Styria.

This highly diverse, semi-natural plant community is dominated by the perennial grass Bromus erectus and is mown twice a year to maintain species composition. Plots of 1.3 m2 were exposed to ambient or elevated CO2 concentrations (n = 8) using a novel CO2 exposure technique, screen-aided CO2 control (SACC) starting in March 1994. In the 1st year of treatment, the annual harvested biomass (sum of aboveground biomass from mowings in June and October) was not significantly affected by elevated CO2. However, biomass increased significantly at elevated CO2 in the 2nd (+20%, P = 0.05), 3rd (+21%, P = 0.02) and 4th years (+29%, P = 0.02). There were no detectable differences in root biomass in the top 8 cm of soil between CO2 treatments on eight out of nine sampling dates. There were significant differences in CO2 responsiveness between functional groups (legumes, non-leguminous forbs, graminoids) in the 2nd (P = 0.07) and 3rd (P &lt; 0.001) years of the study. The order of CO2 responsiveness among functional groups changed substantially from the 2nd to the 3rd year; for example, non-leguminous forbs had the smallest relative response in the 2nd year and the largest in the 3rd year. By the 3rd year of CO2 exposure, large species-specific differences in CO2 response had developed. For five important species or genera the order of responsiveness was Lotus corniculatus (+271%), Carex flacca (+249%), Bromus erectus (+33%), Sanguisorba minor (no significant CO2 effect), and six Trifolium species (a negative response that was not significant). The positive CO2 responses in Bromus and Carex were most closely related to increases in tiller number. Species richness was not affected by CO2 treatment, but species evenness increased under elevated CO2 (modified Hill ratio; P = 0.03) in June of the 3rd year, resulting in a marginally significant increase in species diversity (Simpson's index; P = 0.09). This and other experiments with calcareous grassland plants show that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations can substantially alter the structure of calcareous grassland communities and may increase plant community biomass.","Bromus erectus; Calcareous grassland; Elevated CO2; Mesobromion; Species diversity","biomass; calcareous grassland; carbon dioxide enrichment; community structure; Switzerland; Bromus erectus; Carex flacca; Lotus corniculatus; Sanguisorba minor; Trifolium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032929987

Undisturbed sediments were collected by freeze-coring, sectioned in approximately annual intervals, and analyzed for fossil carotenoids, chlorophylls, and derivatives by high performance liquid chromatography. Concentrations of fucoxanthin (diatoms, chrysophytes, some dinoflagellates) were correlated with algal standing crop (r2 = 0.67, p &lt; 0.05; 1978-1989) and increased 6-fold following acidification of Lake 302S with H2SO4 from pH 6.6 to 5.0, consistent with observed reductions in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from 7 to 4.5 mg liter-1, improved water clarity, and increased biomass of deep-water chrysophytes. However, fucoxanthin concentrations declined to baseline values in sediments from 1988 to 1990, concomitant with severe acidification to pH 4.5, continued DOC loss (&lt; 1.5 mg liter-1) and an estimated 8-fold increase in the penetration of UVb radiation (UVR-b). Increased penetration of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) was recorded also by increased relative abundance of pigments characteristic of UVR-transparent environments. In contrast, pigments from green algae (Chl b, pheophytin b, lutein-zeaxanthin) doubled during acidification with H2SO4, while those from cryptophytes (alloxanthin) were unaffected and diatoxanthin from diatoms declined. Patterns of ubiquitous β-carotene, Chl a, and pheophytin a suggested that total algal biomass increased ~200-400% by the mid-1980s, but declined to near-baseline under severe acidification. Variance partitioning using redundancy analysis captured 80-83% of variation in fossil chlorophylls and carotenoids and suggested that the direct effects of pH were greater (~50% of total variance) than those of irradiance (~12%), but that ~20% of variance was attributable to factor interactions. Fossil concentrations of pigments from green algae and diatoms increased ~100% following acidification of Lake 302N to pH 6.1, but there were few signals of deep-water blooms, possibly because DOC remained 3.5-5.0 mg liter-1. Such complex interactions between pH, DOC, and light may help explain the high variability of algal biomass response to lake acidification.",,"acidification; alga; community response; dissolved organic carbon; paleolimnology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032954202

All irradiations were observed to produce a reduction in the as-deposited compressive stress. We have modeled the irradiation induced stress reduction in DLC by considering the different bond states of carbon that are possible in these materials, i.e. sp2 and sp3. An Avrami-Johnson-Mehl analysis of irradiation induced transformation indicates that at low doses the transformation occurs in one-dimensional-like volumes associated with non-overlapping collision cascades. As the irradiation dose increases, a full transformation occurs at the peak in the irradiation damage profile. With further increasing dose, the transformation product spreads out from the peak damage region. The rate of stress change is well correlated with the displacement damage produced in the collision cascade at a low dose linear region of ó-ö curves. © 1999 Eisevier Science B.V.

Of these base cations, calcium has been found to be the most important in terms of mass deposited. However, the sources of calcium to the atmosphere are not well understood. Recently, the first spatially disaggregated inventory of industrial calcium emissions for Europe was presented by Lee and Pacyna (1998) who estimated a total European emission of 0.7-0.8 Mt yr-1. However, it is thought that wind blown dust from soils contributes a substantial fraction to the deposition of calcium. In this work, the source strength of calcium from arid regions within the EMEP modelling domain was estimated using the global mineral dust emission data base of Tegen and Fung (1994) and an estimation of the calcium content of soils. This results in a 'natural' calcium emission of 6 Mt yr-1. A long-range transport model, TRACK, was used to calculate the wet and dry deposition of calcium arising from these industrial and natural sources to the UK which resulted in a total deposition of 29-30 kt yr-1. Of this annual deposition, 0.6-0.7 kt arises from cement manufacturing, 0.02- 0.03 kt from iron and steel manufacturing, 0.8-0.83 kt from a large point source power generation, and 28 kt from power generation from a small boiler plant. The natural emissions of calcium from arid regions result in a deposition of calcium to the UK of 0.5 kt yr-1. The measured wet deposition of calcium to the UK is 89 kt yr-1 and the estimated dry deposition 14 kt yr-1. The short-fall in the modelled deposition of calcium is thus of the order of 70 kt yr-1, which is suggested to arise from wind-blown dust from agricultural land in the UK and mainland Europe. The estimated emissions, and thus modelled deposition are rather uncertain, such that estimating deposition of calcium attributable to agricultural soil emissions by differencing has a large uncertainty. However, this is the first such study of its kind for Europe and represents a first step towards understanding the sources of calcium and their contribution to mitigating deposited acidity from acidifying pollutants such as sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and ammonia.","Base cations; Calcium; Modelling; Sources","Dry deposition; Wet deposition; Agriculture; Arid regions; Calcium; Cement manufacture; Computational methods; Dust; Electric power plants; Industrial emissions; Iron and steel plants; Mass transfer; Mathematical models; Positive ions; Air pollution; ammonia; calcium; cation; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; acid deposition; atmospheric deposition; calcium; long range transport; magnesium; potassium; provenance; agriculture; article; calcium transport; dry deposition; Europe; geographic distribution; iron and steel industry; model; pollution transport; priority journal; soil pollution; wind; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033575040

Its expression has been analyzed in the wild type and in NtcA-null mutant cells grown under different conditions of nitrogen and carbon supply. RNA-DNA hybridization experiments revealed the presence of one transcript species 680 nucleotides long, whatever the nutrient conditions tested. A second transcript species, 620 nucleotides long, absent in the NtcA null mutant, was observed in wild-type cells that were nitrogen starved for 2 h under both high and low CO2 and in the presence of nitrate under a high CO2 concentration. Primer extension analysis indicated that the two transcript species are generated from two tandem promoters, a σ70 Escherichia coli-type promoter and an NtcA-dependent promoter, located 120 and 53 nucleotides, respectively, from the glnB initiation codon. The NtcA- dependent promoter is up-regulated under the conditions mentioned above, while the σ70 E. coli-type promoter displays constitutive levels of transcripts in the NtcA null mutant and slightly different levels in the wild-type cells, depending on the nitrogen and carbon supplies. In general, a good correlation between the amounts of the two transcript species and that of the P(II) protein was observed, as revealed by immunodetection with specific antibodies. The phosphorylation level of P(II) in the wild type is inversely correlated with nitrogen availability and directly correlated with higher CO2 concentration. This regulation is correspondingly less stringent in the NtcA null mutant cells. In contrast, the dephosphorylation of P(II) is NtcA independent.",,"bacterial DNA; bacterial protein; carbon; carbon dioxide; gene product; nitrate; nitrogen; regulator protein; article; bacterial gene; carbon dioxide tension; controlled study; DNA RNA hybridization; Escherichia coli; gene expression regulation; gene induction; Gram negative bacterium; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein determination; protein DNA binding; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; reaction analysis; strain difference; transcription regulation; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli; Negibacteria; Prokaryota; Synechococcus; Synechococcus; Synechococcus sp.; Synechococcus sp.

This device was fabricated in order to control emission current by drain current of HVTFT and to be used for pixels of large area displays. For smooth surface morphology, amorphous silicon is chosen for tip material and etch-back process is used for fabricating gate hole of FEA at low temperature. Amorphous silicon is recrystallized to poly-silicon with relatively high mobility to be active layer material of HVTFT. Designed HVTFT has offset regions between drain electrode and gated region, and between source electrode and gated region in order to have high breakdown voltage of about 100 V and a low leakage current of several pA at off state. By slight implantation in the offset regions, the resistance in the regions can be reduced to increase on state current. For 25×25 FEA combined with HVTFT, the emission current of about 1.2 μA corresponding to 2.0 nA/tip was obtained at the bias of 80 V between gate of FEA and the source of HVTFT.

Changes in erosion could in turn cause changes in productivity and sustainability of agricultural systems, and changes in air quality (PM10) and water quality (sediment transport). Substantial effects on productivity may, however, only occur several decades after climate changes. This paper presents a procedure for assessing the potential effects of climate change on erosion and productivity. A preliminary screening process is used to identify and prioritize regions and management systems. Subsequent simulation of selected sites with the EPIC model is used to investigate potential practices to adapt agricultural systems to climate change. In some cases, proposed adaptation strategies might reduce sustainability if they are not matched to environmental conditions found at specific sites.

Under natural conditions, sediment pore-water NH4/+-concentrations were higher at CCB (100 μM) than at LLM (30 μM); this difference was reflected in a significantly higher leaf and rhizome N-content at CCB than at LLM. However, sediment NH4/+-enrichment using a commercial fertilizer resulted in significantly higher tissue N-content relative to controls at both sites. N enrichment also influenced plant carbon metabolism, as reflected by distinct increases in leaf C-content at both sites. Significant decreases in rhizome NSC-content was recorded during the first two months of the experiment, suggesting that C was reallocated from rhizomes to leaves to support stimulated leaf growth at both sites. At LLM, leaf growth-rates increased and leaf turnover-time decreased as a result of sediment NH4/+-enrichment. With respect to chlorophyll, concentrations did not change significantly at CCB, but increased steadily at LLM after the first month following fertilization. In general however, chlorophyll concentrations in control plots were significantly higher at CCB than that at LLM. These observations suggest that leaf function related to C-fixation is enhanced under higher sediment N conditions, as reflected in higher leaf growth-rates and increased blade chlorophyll-content. In contrast, under low-N conditions, below-ground tissue production is enhanced at the expense of the aboveground shoots and leaves, resulting in the high below; above-ground biomass ratios often observed in seagrass beds of oligotrophic environments.",,"carbon; nitrogen; nutrient availability; nutrient dynamics; seagrass; United States; Thalassia testudinum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032773266

Perceived effects of anti- and pro-government speech on national climate and general harm were investigated in one quantitative study. Specifically, negative rhetoric impacted national climate in terms of increasing feelings of fear and hostility and reducing the sense of security and solidarity. Positive rhetoric influenced the national climate by affecting security and solidarity. Furthermore, people found negative speech more socially detrimental and personally upsetting than positive speech. A discussion of the implications and importance of these findings concludes with the paradox that free speech involving negative rhetoric both underscores democratic values as well as undermines them.","First Amendment; Hate Speech; Militia; National Climate; Political Rhetoric",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0009807687

We have previously described a 34-kDa human epididymal sperm protein, P34H, that has been shown to be involved in sperm-zona pellucida interaction. In the present study, we report the cloning and characterization of the full-length complementary DNA encoding human P34H. The predicted amino acid sequence revealed 65% identity with P26h, the hamster counterpart of the P34H. The deduced P34H amino acid sequence revealed a 71% similarity with a pig lung tetrameric carbonyl reductase, a member of the short chain dehydrogenase/reductase family proteins. Northern blot analysis revealed that P34H messenger RNA (mRNA) was highly expressed in the human epididymis, principally in the corpus region. A single 912-bp P34H transcript was detected. In situ hybridization experiments showed that the P34H mRNA was predominantly expressed in the proximal and distal sections of the corpus epididymidis. The staining was restricted to the principal cells of the epididymal epithelium. The localization of P34H mRNA was in agreement with the appearance of P34H protein along the male reproductive tract. Western blot analysis revealed that recombinant P34H expressed by a yeast expression system, is antigenically related to the native P34H sperm protein. Based on its pattern of expression and its function in one of the key steps leading to fertilization, P34H can be considered as a marker of epididymal sperm maturation in humans.",,"carbonyl reductase; messenger RNA; prostate protein; amino acid sequence; article; epididymis; fertilization; gamete; gene expression; gene location; human; human tissue; molecular cloning; priority journal; sequence homology; sperm; spermatozoon maturation; zona pellucida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033304796

Particulate organic carbon, including both vascular plant debris and soil carbon, was utilized as a tracer of the distribution and modification of the shelf flood deposit. These components were sorted during initial emplacement of the deposit, both in the river plume and in the benthic boundary layer. During the 8 months following the flood, lateral transport, shallow burial, and bioturbation contributed to spatial changes in the amount and character of carbon in the flood deposit. Study of the deposit suggests that this and previous flood layers may be preserved in the shelf and upper slope stratigraphic record as clay-rich beds with relatively high carbon to nitrogen ratios and more negative δ13C values than background, non-flood sediment: Concentrations of vascular plant debris are locally characteristic of such layers, and may serve as distinctive stratigraphic markers. Investigation of organic carbon in the 1995 flood layer on the Eel River shelf provides insight into the fate of terrestrial particulate carbon on continental margins in general. Flooding of the Eel River, and of similar river systems draining mountainous terrains, introduces large quantities of terrestrial carbon to the marine environment and may favor the preservation of both terrestrial and marine carbon. The abundant woody vascular plant debris discharged during floods is especially likely to survive oxidation and sulfate reduction in the shallower zones of the seabed. This study reveals the dominant role that physical and biological processes may play in attenuating the terrestrial organic-carbon signal on shelves over monthly to yearly time scales.","Continental margin; Eel River; Flood deposit; Organic carbon","carbon cycle; continental shelf; flood; particulate organic carbon; river discharge; sedimentation; terrigenous deposit; Pacific Ocean; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033514359

This benefit may be offset by increased N2O emissions, which have been reported for soils under zero tillage (ZT) compared to those under more intensive tillage (IT). Comparisons of N2O emissions from the two systems have been restricted to the growing season, but substantial losses of N2O have been reported during spring thaw events in many regions. Inorganic and organic additions of nitrogen and following have also been shown to increase levels of soil-emitted N2O. The objectives for this study were: (i) to confirm that losses of N2O are higher under ZT than under IT in Alberta Parkland agroecosystems; (ii) to compare the relative influence of urea fertilizer (56 or 100 kg N ha-1), field pea residue (dry matter at 5 Mg ha-1), sheep manure (dry matter at 40 Mg ha-1) additions, and fallow on total N2O losses; and (iii) to investigate possible interactions between fertility and tillage treatments. Gas samples were collected using vented soil covers at three sites near Edmonton, Alberta during 1993, 1994, and 1995. Gas samples were analyzed using a gas chromatograph equipped with a 63Ni electron capture detector. Estimated annual N2O loss ranged from 0.1 to 4.0 kg N ha-1. Emissions during summer were slightly higher, similar, or lower on ZT compared to those under IT, but were consistently lower on ZT plots during spring thaw. Combined estimates (spring plus summer) of N2O loss under ZT were equal to or lower than those under IT. Highest overall losses were observed on fallow plots, followed by fertilizer, pea residue, and then either manure or control plots. We conclude that ZT management systems have potential for reducing agricultural greenhouse gas emissions in the Alberta Parkland region.","Fallow; Manure; Nitrogen fertilizer; Nitrous oxide; Thawing soil; Tillage","agricultural practice; carbon sequestration; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; soil emission; zero tillage; Alberta; Canada; Ovis aries; Pisum sativum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032979164

Recent work from the Ozone Transport Assessment Group has provided support for the association between slowly migrating anticyclones over the Eastern United States and widespread amounts of high ozone throughout much of the region. Case studies have yielded additional evidence of this connection, and, further, have shown that synoptic-scale transport in association with this anticyclone can be an important factor in elevating ozone levels in EWI. A case study approach however is limited since only a small number of events can be analyzed. To address this deficiency, our investigation employed a synoptic climatology, which is capable of linking patterns of atmospheric circulation with patterns of tropospheric ozone over an extended period of time. To classify the atmospheric circulation a correlation-based scheme was applied to 30 yr of gridded sea-level-pressure data. Our synoptic climatology showed that the highest ozone levels occurred when an anticyclone was present to the east of the Lake Michigan Air Quality Region (LMAQR); the same type of anticyclone identified by others as being responsible for the transport of regional-scale ozone and precursors to the LMAQR. Our synoptic climatology, therefore, supports the contention that the synoptic-scale transport of ozone from the Southern and Eastern US plays an important role in episodes of elevated ozone in EWI. Moreover, our results suggest that synoptic-scale systems (i.e. anticyclones situated over the Eastern US), which operate at much greater space and time scales than sub-regional scale circulations, are likely to transport sufficient ozone into Eastern WI to often exceed the new 8 h, 80 ppb health standard-unless steps are taken to reduce regional-scale emissions.","Map patterns; Synoptic climatology; Tropospheric ozone","air quality; anticyclone; atmospheric pollution; ozone; United States; Wisconsin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033544666

The recombinant protein was characterized by comparison with native P450scc purified from adrenal cortex mitochondria. To study the interaction of the electron transfer proteins during the functioning of the heme protein, recombinant P450scc was selectively modified with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). The present paper shows that modified P450scc, purified by affinity chromatography using adrenodoxin-Sepharose to remove non-covalently bound FITC, retains the functional activity of the unmodified enzyme, including its ability to bind adrenodoxin. Based on the efficiency of resonance fluorescence energy transfer in the donor-acceptor pair, FITC-heme, we calculated the distance between Lys338, selectively labeled with the dye, and the heme of P450scc. The intensity of fluorescence from the label dramatically changes during: (a) denaturation of P450scc; (b) changing the spin state or redox potential of the heme protein; (c) formation of the carbon monoxide complex of reduced P450scc; (d) as well as during reactions of intermolecular interactions, such as changes of the state of aggregation, complex formation with the substrate, binding to the electron transfer partner adrenodoxin, or insertion of the protein into an artificial phospholipid membrane. Selective chemical modification of P450scc with FITC proved to be a very useful method to study the dynamics of conformational changes of the recombinant heme protein. The data obtained indicate that functionally important conformational changes of P450scc are large-scale ones, i.e. they are not limited only to changes in the dynamics of the protein active center. The results of the present study also indicate that chemical modification of Lys338 of bovine adrenocortical P450scc does not dramatically alter the activity of the heme protein, but does result in a decrease of protein stability.","Conformational dynamics; Cytochrome P450scc; Fluorescence energy transfer; Heterologous expression; Molecular interaction reaction; Selective chemical modification","cholesterol monooxygenase (side chain cleaving); cytochrome p450 isoenzyme; affinity chromatography; article; cattle; chemical modification; conformational transition; electron transport; enzyme purification; enzyme structure; fluorescence; molecular interaction; nonhuman; priority journal; protein stability; reaction analysis; Adrenal Cortex; Animals; Cattle; Cholesterol Side-Chain Cleavage Enzyme; Energy Transfer; Escherichia coli; Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate; Fluorescent Dyes; Hemeproteins; Protein Conformation; Recombinant Proteins; Bos taurus; Bovinae; Escherichia coli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032737159

The six case study sites represent a range of geographic and hydrologic, as well as institutional and social settings. Large, multi-reservoir systems (Columbia River, Missouri River, Apalachicola-Chatahoochee-Flint (ACF) Rivers), small, one or two reservoir systems (Tacoma and Boston) and medium size systems (Savannah River) are represented. The river basins range from mountainous to low relief and semi-humid to semi-arid, and the system operational purposes range from predominantly municipal to broadly multi-purpose. The studies inferred, using a chain of climate downscaling, hydrologic and water resources systems models, the sensitivity of six water resources systems to changes in precipitation, temperature and solar radiation. The climate change scenarios used in this study are based on results from transient climate change experiments performed with coupled ocean-atmosphere General Circulation Models (GCMs) for the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) assessment. An earlier doubled-CO2 scenario from one of the GCMs was also used in the evaluation. The GCM scenarios were transferred to the local level using a simple downscaling approach that scales local weather variables by fixed monthly ratios (for precipitation) and fixed monthly shifts (for temperature). For those river basins where snow plays an important role in the current climate hydrology (Tacoma, Columbia, Missouri and, to a lesser extent, Boston) changes in temperature result in important changes in seasonal streamflow hydrographs. In these systems, spring snowmelt peaks are reduced and winter flows increase, on average. Changes in precipitation are generally reflected in the annual total runoff volumes more than in the seasonal shape of the hydrographs. In the Savannah and ACF systems, where snow plays a minor hydrological role, changes in hydrological response are linked more directly to temperature and precipitation changes. Effects on system performance varied from system to system, from GCM to GCM, and for each system operating objective (such as hydropower production, municipal and industrial supply, flood control, recreation, navigation and instream flow protection). Effects were generally smaller for the transient scenarios than for the doubled CO2 scenario. In terms of streamflow, one of the transient scenarios tended to have increases at most sites, while another tended to have decreases at most sites. The third showed no general consistency over the six sites. Generally, the water resource system performance effects were determined by the hydrologic changes and the amount of buffering provided by the system's storage capacity. The effects of demand growth and other plausible future operational considerations were evaluated as well. For most sites, the effects of these non-climatic effects on future system performance would about equal or exceed the effects of climate change over system planning horizons.",,"climate change; global warming; water resource; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032693131

The results indicated that the changes in the large-scale circulation exhibited strong seasonal variability. The reductions in snow cover of 50-90% were found in areas near the snow line of the control simulation. The analyses of the variations of the climate signals with surface elevation ranging from sea level to 4000 m over two mountain ranges in the Pacific Northwest showed that due to the changes in the altitude of the freezing level, strong elevation dependency was found in the surface temperature, rainfall, snowfall, snow cover, and runoff signals.Global climate change due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases has stimulated numerous studies and discussions about its possible impacts on water resources. Climate scenarios generated by climate models at spatial resolutions ranging from about 50 km to 400 km may not provide enough spatial specificity for use in impact assessment. In Parts I and II of this paper, the spatial specificity issue is addressed by examining what information on mesoscale and small-scale spatial features can be gained by using a regional climate model with a subgrid parameterization of orographic precipitation and land surface cover, driven by a general circulation model. Numerical experiments have been performed to simulate the present-day climatology and the climate conditions corresponding to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentration. This paper describes and contrasts the large-scale and mesoscale features of the greenhouse warming climate signals simulated by the general circulation model and regional climate model over the Pacific Northwest. Results indicate that changes in the large-scale circulation exhibit strong seasonal variability. There is an average warming of about 2°C, and precipitation generally increases over the Pacific Northwest and decreases over California. The precipitation signal over the Pacific Northwest is only statistically significant during spring, when both the change in the large-scale circulation and increase in water vapor enhance the moisture convergence toward the north Pacific coast. The combined effects of surface temperature and precipitation changes are such that snow cover is reduced by up to 50% on average, causing large changes in the seasonal runoff. This paper also describes the high spatial resolution (1.5 km) climate signals simulated by the regional climate model. Reductions in snow cover of 50%-90% are found in areas near the snow line of the control simulation. Analyses of the variations of the climate signals with surface elevation ranging from sea level to 4000 m over two mountain ranges in the Pacific Northwest show that because of changes in the alitude of the freezing level, strong elevation dependency is found in the surface temperature, rainfall, snowfall, snow cover, and runoff signals.",,"Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Computer simulation; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Mathematical models; Rain; Runoff; Sensitivity analysis; Snow; General circulation model (GCM); Regional climate model (RCM); Climatology; climate change; climate modeling; greenhouse gas; spatial resolution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032711390

This study examines the potential of using a model nesting approach to provide seasonal climate and streamflow forecasts suitable for water resources management. Two ensembles of perpetual January simulations were performed with a regional climate model driven by a general circulation model (GCM), using observed climatological sea surface temperature (SST) and the mean SST of the warm ENSO years between 1950 and 1994. The climate simulations were then used to drive a macroscale hydrology model to simulate streamflow. Trie differences between the two ensembles of simulations are defined as the warm ENSO signals. The simulated hydroclimate signals were compared with observations. The analyses focus on the Columbia River basin in the Pacific Northwest. Results show that the global and regional models simulated a warming over the Pacific Northwest that is quite close to the observations. The models also correctly captured the strong wet signal over California and the weak dry signal over the Pacific Northwest during warm ENSO years. The regional climate model consistently performed better than the GCM in simulating the spatial distribution of regional climate and climate signals. When the climate simulations were used to drive a macroscale hydrology model at the Columbia River basin, the simulated streamflow signal resembles that derived from hydrological simulations driven by observed climate. The streamflow simulations were considerably improved when a simple bias correction scheme was applied to the climate simulations. The coupled regional climate and macroscale hydrologic simulations demonstrate the prospect for generating and utilizing seasonal climate forecasts for managing reservoirs.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000250952

It is concluded that under the current scenarios, the contribution of mine stone to pollution of Dutch river systems is rather low in comparison with emissions from industrial, communal and diffuse sources. However, continued and widespread large-scale applications of mine stone will lead to increased leaching of pollutants to surface waters, and may require that further cuts be made from other sources in order to meet regional, national and international emission reduction targets.","Hydraulic engineering; Leaching models; Mine stone; River pollution","emission; heavy metal; mine drainage; PAH; river pollution; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033190413

Poly(styrene) (PS), poly(ethylene) (PE), poly(propylene) (PP), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) plastics were burned in powder form. Steady-flow dispersions (clouds) of the above types of polymer particles, 0.15-0.2 mm in diameter, were burned in a drop-tube, electrically-heated furnace at different bulk (global) equivalence ratios (mostly in the range of φbulk=0.5-1.5). The gas temperature and residence time in the furnace were 1150°C and 1s, respectively. Results showed that both the combustion behavior and, hence, the emissions varied widely among the burning plastics. PVC particles burned with bright individual flames, resisting the formation of group flames, even at high particle number densities. Poly(ethylene) particles in very dilute clouds burned individually, surrounded by low-sooting, faint envelope flames. When particles burned in close proximity to each other, they abruptly exhibited localized flash- vaporization and formed highly-luminous, large, group flames, ""puffs"". Disperse poly(styrene) particles burned mostly as discrete entities and gradually progressed to partial group flames at high mass loadings. PS particles consistently formed flames with long wakes, wherefrom strings of highly-agglomerated soot escaped. Flame temperatures were lower in group particle combustion than in individual particle combustion. The yields of PAH and soot emissions increased with the equivalence ratio. PVC particles oxidized effectively in air, as evidenced by minimal amounts of PAHs were at φbulk ≤ 1. Chlorinated organics were found at high φbulk. Combustion of PS yielded the highest amounts of soot, several times more than the rest of the polymers. Less than 35% mass was PM2. The soot emissions from PE and PP were remarkably similar to each other. These polymers produced very low emissions at φ ≤ 0.5, but emissions increased drastically with φ, and most of the soot was very fine (70-97% of the mass PM2 depending on φ). Soot emissions from the combustion of PMMA were comparatively low and were the least influenced by the bulk φ; 79-95% were PM2. Combustion of PVC yielded similarly low amounts of soot; moreover, only 13-34% of the mass was PM2. The following ranges of particulate yields were PM2: 19-75 mg/g from PS, 8-36 mg/g from PE, 1.5-47 mg/g from PP, 11-20 mg/g from PMMA and 2-8 mg/g from PVC, depending on φ. The same order was followed in PAH emissions. Burning these materials with excess oxygen drastically reduces the PAH/PM emissions of PE and PP, substantially reduces those of PS, and mildly reduces those of PMMA and PVC. NOx emissions from all fuels were very low and decreased from a high of 5 mg/g at low φ to &lt; 1 mg/g at high increasing φ. The opposite trend was observed for CO, which increased from a few to over 200 mg/g with φ. CO2 yields equaled to as much as one third of the fuel mass.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033488577

For the local Danish provenance, the average effect of elevated [CO2] during growth was to increase light-saturated net photosynthesis (A(n)) and instantaneous water-use efficiency or transpiration efficiency (ITE). These increases were strongly related to the temperature treatment. Stomatal conductance (g(s)) was reduced in seedlings in high [CO2], but there was no statistically significant effect of temperature treatment. Stomatal conductance was 13-26% lower at elevated [CO2] and ITE was 89-156% higher, depending on growth temperature. The effects of [CO2] on A(n) were considerably larger than those shown for many other woody species, but similar to those in other studies on European beech. The absolute value of A(n) for a Romanian provenance of beech was 5-18% lower than in the Danish provenance at low [CO2] and 14-26% lower at high [CO2]. There was no statistically significant interaction between the provenances and [CO2], or between provenance and temperature. A model of the response of A(n) to [CO2] at different temperatures gave predictions close to the measured results, except at the lowest temperature treatment where the model overpredicted the effect of elevated [CO2]. This and measurements of A(n) made at a common, low [CO2] indicated a down-regulation of photosynthesis in the lowest temperature treatment at high [CO2]. Root plus soil respiration on a whole-tree basis (R(tr)) was increased by elevated [CO2] at all but the lowest temperature, but no effect was seen of [CO2] on root respiration per unit root d. wt. Mean R(tr) on any given date was significantly correlated with A(n), except at the lowest temperature treatment. It is hypothesized that low temperature limited the ability of the roots to use photosynthates resulting in a feedback inhibition of A(n) when elevated [CO2] was combined with low temperature.","Acclimation; Elevated CO2; Fagus sylvatica; Leaf gas exchange; Provenance; Root plus soil respiration; Temperature","carbon dioxide; growth response; temperature effect; Fagus sylvatica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033504385

Here we maintain that this vegetation has not yet reached equilibrium with the present prevailing climate and that it is still in an initial stage of succession. We present results of eight upland sites sampled in the vicinity of Alexandra Fiord Lowland, Ellesmere Island, Canada, to demonstrate the slow colonization process that has been occurring within the last 100-150 years after the LIA termination. The widespread presence of the ""lichen-kill"" zones throughout the Canadian polar regions reflects the extent and destructive nature of even minor climatic cooling on vulnerable polar ecosystems.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0343133899

Heterotrophic dinoflagellates dominated the protozooplankton biomass. When diatoms formed subsurface blooms, heterotrophic dinoflagellates averaged 70% of the integrated protozooplankton biomass. After the diatoms declined, large heterotrophic dinoflagellates became less abundant. Ciliates followed the same vertical distribution as heterotrophic dinoflagellates. However, in contrast to heterotrophic dinoflagellates, maximum ciliate biomasses developed in surface water after the diatom blooms, when the large copepods (Calanus spp.) migrated to the deeper water. Mixotrophic oligotrich ciliates, mainly Laboea strobila, contributed on average 20% to the integrated ciliate biomass. Growth experiments revealed similar specific maximum growth rates for ciliates and heterotrophic dinoflagellates. Maximum growth rates were allometrically related to cell volume.

The scales found in point 1 above rarely agree with advective scales and are considered as the proper averaging scales for calibration of satellite spatially averaged observations against temporal averages. The flux underestimation due to unresolved directional variability in NASA scatterometer (NSCAT) data varies by region, wind regime, and local conditions. It is most important in the Atlantic due to larger subgrid variability and favorable thermodynamic conditions. It is slightly less important in the Gulf of Mexico locations that experience favorable thermodynamic conditions and more light wind cases but smaller subgrid variability for a given light wind value. Even when small, the flux underestimation of the 50-km NSCAT data represents a systematic error for which a simple correction exists. A general velocity-scale formulation for typical model scales is developed based on NSCAT observations. It is consistent with studies that used aircraft flux observations. For typical general circulation model scales of 250 km, the associated heat flux enhancement is as much as 10, 23, and 40 W m-2 for strong, midrange, and light wind regimes, respectively. By inserting a simple velocity-scale formulation into the bulk aerodynamic relationship, a modeler can effectively account for most of the flux underestimation.

Elevated CO2 did not modify relative growth rate or biomass at either irradiance. Foliar carbon-to-nitrogen ratios were decreased at elevated CO2 and plants had a greater number of shorter tillers, particularly at the lower growth irradiance. Both light-limited and light-saturated rates of photosynthesis were stimulated. The amount of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) protein was increased at elevated CO2, but maximum extractable Rubisco activities were not significantly increased. A pronounced decrease in the Rubisco activation state was found with CO2 enrichment, particularly at the higher growth irradiance. Elevated-CO2-induced changes in leaf carbohydrate composition were small in comparison to those caused by changes in irradiance. No CO2-dependent effects on fructan biosynthesis were observed. Leaf respiration rates were increased by 68% in plants grown with CO2 enrichment and low light. We conclude that high CO2 will only result in increased biomass if total light input favourably increases the photosynthesis-to-respiration ratio. At low irradiances, biomass is more limited by increased rates of respiration than by CO2-induced enhancement of photosynthesis.","Carbohydrate; CO2 enrichment; Lolium (CO2 enrichment); Photosynthesis; Respiration; Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase","biomass; biosynthesis; carbohydrate analysis; carbon dioxide; carbon; enzyme activity; growth rate; nitrogen; photoactivation; photosynthesis; plant development; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; Lolium temulentum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033435225

When an anode voltage is applied, a double-triangle barrier will be formed inside the thin film on the substrate, so that the electron emission process is similar to the tunneling in a double-barrier diode. In this paper, the electron-tunneling coefficient is calculated with a matrix approach, the emission current being integrated with the Simpson quadrature method. It is found that both the tunneling coefficient and the emission current are of resonant property. The resonant apex is sharp and the peak-to-peak value reaches six orders of magnitude (106). The resonant points that benefit the electron emission are not few. In practical situation, the applied fields may be greatly intensified by the agglomerations of the local impurities, defects and the interface states at the FEE surface; so the thickness may be well beyond the nanometer scale and the applied field intensity may be greatly reduced.

Since the 1970s, fluxless melt protection based upon sulfur hexafluoride as the effective reagent in a cover atmosphere has been a boon to those in the industry who process molten magnesium and/or its alloys. This technology has been a major contributor to the growth of the magnesium casting alloy market during the last two decades. Recent international concern about global warming has focused attention toward sulfur hexafluoride, the most potent global warming gas. This resulted in a call for voluntary reductions in its emission. The industry has responded to the environmental call by: 1) improving the current process and 2) proposing to replace sulfur hexafluoride with alternative chemicals. Air Liquide has developed a new technology that enables this industry to capture and re-use the sulfur hexafluoride from the process exhaust. Air Liquide's patented membrane-based sulfur hexafluoride recycle system is capable of capturing more than 95% of this gas from the process exhausts, and, at the same time, the system can concentrate sulfur hexafluoride from a few parts per million (PPM) to percentage level.

In most cases, the hydrocarbon thickness measurement data obtained from a well field and the volume estimate analysis based on these data show significant variations over time. In this paper we consider an important cause of this variation, which is neglected in most field applications, i.e., the unsteady ground-water table fluctuations and its effect on monitoring well measurements. The analytical solutions we present indicate that, under fluctuating ground-water table conditions, if the hydrocarbon volume estimates in the formation are based on monitoring well measurements made at one point in time, or if these estimates are based on a sequence of measurements made over a period of time, which then are evaluated independently, then the volume estimate results will be in significant error. The analysis discussed in this paper is based on the analytical solution of volumetric equilibrium equations for constant residual saturation levels. Thus, results discussed in this paper only may represent the best estimates of hydraulic equilibrium conditions at a contaminated site. For a complete analysis, in addition to the effect of ground-water table movement, the effect of entrapment on residual saturation, capillarity, hystereses, threshold pressures, and non-Darcian behavior should be included in the analysis. However, because of inherent nonlinearities introduced, such cases cannot be solved using analytical methods and the correlation between light nonaqueous phase liquid (LNAPL) thickness in the aquifer and the monitoring well cannot be determined easily.

This is because national inventories are now the basis of legally-binding commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention for Climate Change. The quality of inventories will also affect the effective implementation of the Kyoto Protocol through its flexible mechanisms, such as emissions trading. In 1997, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) brought together a group of experts to consider approaches for assessing the quality of inventory data. This meeting considered three key issues. First, how do we define inventory quality? Second, what approaches can we use to assure the quality of inventories? Third, given the policy needs of Climate Convention, what are the next steps for quality assurance? There are several approaches for assessing inventory quality. This paper summarises them for carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Many of these approaches are routinely performed by inventory experts, others are novel. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039613988

One interpolation procedure is the so-called ""traditional"" scheme, for which the daily surface boundary conditions are obtained by linearly interpolating between the observed monthly mean values, however the observed monthly means cannot be preserved after interpolation. The other one is the ""new"" scheme, for which the daily surface boundary conditions are obtained by linearly interpolating between the ""artificial"" monthly mean values which are based on, but are different from the observed ones, after interpolating with this new scheme, not only the observed monthly mean values are preserved, the time series of the new generated daily values is also more consistent with the observation. Comparison of the model results shows that the differences of the globally or zonally averaged fields between these two integrations are quite small, and this is due to the compensating effect between the different regions. However, the differences of the two patterns (the global or regional geographical distributions), are quite significant, for example, the magnitude of the difference in the JJA mean rainfall between these two integrations can exceed 2 mm/day over Asian monsoon regions, and the difference in DJF mean surface air temperature can also exceed 2°C over this region. The fact that the model climatology depends quite strongly on the method of prescribing the daily surface boundary conditions suggests that in order to validate the climate model or to predict the short-term climate anomalies, either the ""new"" interpolation scheme or the high frequency surface boundary conditions (e.g., daily or weekly data instead of the monthly data) should be introduced. Meanwhile, as for the coupled model, the daily coupling scheme between the different component climate models (e.g., atmospheric and oceanic general circulation models) is preferred in order to partly eliminate the ""climate drift"" problem which may appear during the course of direct coupling.","Atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM); Linear interpolation; Model climatology; Surface boundary condition",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346401028

A series of unanticipated convective rain cells impacted the site with the first rainfall in ∼90 days, and the initial 4-cm rainfall increased soil moisture from ∼0.01 to 0.06% (vol/vol). Several chambers were operating prior to the events, and two were deployed over wet soils following rainfall. Rainfall resulted in an immediate and steep rise in ambient air Hg concentrations and soil Hg emissions which persisted for 12-24 hours. Fluxes increased most quickly and to a greater degree over the wettest soils, and the rate of increase was related to chamber design and flushing rate. The flux response was also apparent in the micrometeorological data. In general, soil emissions increased by an order of magnitude following the rain, and reached levels ∼6 times above those at the same time the previous day. These fluxes were significantly correlated with temperature, radiation, humidity, wind speed, and soil moisture. After drying for ∼40 hours, selected soil plots were manually irrigated with low-Hg-distilled water. Mercury emissions responded similarly across the three treated sites, uniformly increasing from ∼60 ng m-2 h-1 pretreatment to ∼650 ng m-2 h-1 posttreatment, which was a factor of ∼6 higher than adjacent control soils. Possible causes of the increases in flux include soil gas displacement, desorption of Hg° by water molecules, and desorption of Hg(II) and subsequent reduction in solution. The kinetics of the flux response, combined with local soil and climatic conditions, suggest that Hg emissions were responding primarily to soil moisture and solar radiation. These data have interesting implications for the role of changing regional climates on biogeochemical cycling of Hg.

They include ozone (O3), particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), and lead. All except lead may interfere with oxygen delivery, and so may be of special concern to asthmatics. In controlled experiments, SO2 causes acute asthma symptoms and bronchoconstriction, preventable by beta-agonist medications. Ozone causes acute irritant symptoms, restrictive lung dysfunction, increased bronchial reactivity, and lower-airway inflammation in healthy people and asthmatics. Exposures to O3, and possibly to other pollutants, appear to exacerbate bronchoconstrictive or inflammatory responses to inhaled aeroallergens (bioaerosols); this may represent an important health risk to asthmatics. Exposure levels known to evoke acute responses to O3 or SO2 are uncommon in community air pollution; however, some asthmatics might be susceptible to lesser, more common exposures. Evidence concerning NO2 is equivocal, but it may have O3-like effects in some asthmatics. Epidemiology has often associated particulate pollution with asthma exacerbations and other cardiorespiratory illnesses, even in cities with relatively mild air pollution. Current laboratory research cannot fully explain this association. Advances in emission controls should further reduce ambient pollution levels, but probably will not reduce asthma morbidity. Better asthma management, with improved anti-inflammatory medications, more careful monitoring by patients and health care providers, and reasonable efforts to reduce pollutant and aeroallergen exposures, offers the best hope to reduce asthma morbidity in the new century.

This paper compiles our investigations in recent years on the mechanism of NO selective catalytic reduction (SCR) by hydrocarbon over Cu-ZSM-5. The studies were focused on the oxidation state and coordination chemistry of the exchanged Cu as the active site during the catalytic reaction using X-ray absorption spectroscopic (XAS) techniques, mainly XANES and EXAFS. Our experiment demonstrated the existence of a redox mechanism which involves cyclic switching of the oxidation states between Cu(II) and Cu(I) in an oxygen-rich gas mixture under elevated temperature. We also observed the coordination structural change of copper ion in ZSM-5 accompanying the change of oxidation state. A correlation between cuprous ion concentration and catalytic activity was found in NO SCR by propene. The impact of another two hydrocarbons, propane and methane, on the copper redox behavior also appears to correlate to catalytic activities in the respective mixtures.

Other possible sources, like paddy fields and water reservoirs, were selected for testing the hypothesis of the biological phosphine formation. Phosphine in the urban air of Beijing was measured in different seasons. In the summertime phosphine levels typically peak in the early morning and then decline towards noon. The maximum concentration at 6.00 am was 65 ng m-3 whilst that at noon was 11 ng m-3. In spring and in wintertime, the phosphine levels in the urban air of Beijing were lowest. A first screening revealed phosphine also in gas and in sediment samples from a paddy field near Beijing, the Beijing Shisanling water reservoir, and the refuse tips Changping of Beijing as well as in the ambient air adjacent to these sampling sites. The maximum phosphine concentrations in these gas samples were 41 (marsh gas, paddy field), 135 (marsh gas, reservoir), 1062 (landfillgas) ng m-3, and in the ambient air samples 146 (air, paddy field), 166 (air, reservoir), and 71 (air, refuse tips) ng m-3. In sediment samples, the highest matrix-bound phosphine levels were 13 (paddy field), and 3.9 (reservoir) ng kg-1. These comparatively high concentrations of the readily oxidizable phosphine in air indicate hitherto unknown but important phosphorus emission sources, which might reduce the biomass growth in Chinese fields and forests by a general phosphorus limitation. Phosphine is also a constituent of the air pollution in China. However, more work has to be done to evaluate the different sources of atmospheric phosphine.","Atmosphere; Environmental analysis; Paddy field; Phosphine; Refuse tips; Reservoir","Environmental analysis; Phosphine; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Climate change; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Land fill; Oxidation; Phosphorus compounds; Reservoirs (water); Sampling; Sediments; Water analysis; Air pollution; phosphine; air quality; phosphorus; pollutant source; urban atmosphere; air analysis; air pollution; air sampling; ambient air; article; atmospheric dispersion; China; concentration (parameters); seasonal variation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344604334

However, the CuO can be completely converted to Cu for the mixtures with higher carbon content. A tentative model in terms of solid-state reactions at the interfaces is proposed to explain the effect of carbon content. Additionally, the thermal responses of the premilled mixtures were investigated by thermogravity and differential thermal analysis followed by x-ray identification. Contrary to mechanical alloying, reduction of CuO during thermal treatment follows a transition sequence of CuO→Cu2O→Cu.

Air temperature and precipitation play the different roles in the mass balance formation, in which the mass-balance hypsometry follows the temperature variations by the means of rotation against the elevation axis and it shifts in parallel with precipitation change.

Appropriate rates of carbon acquisition by temperate and boreal forests are re-evaluated. Based on continental-scale forestry data it is suggested that the productivity of temperate and boreal forests has been overestimated previously. 2. Using these values, a model of the integrated response of ecosystems to carbon dioxide concentration and soil nitrogen availability is presented. The model does not assume constant C/N ratios in plant or soil and considers effects of increases in atmospheric CO2 concentrations and nitrogen deposition separately or together 3. For temperate-zone forests a co-occurrence of a CO2 increase and nitrogen deposition doubles the increase in net primary productivity and carbon sequestration that would be the case for nitrogen deposition occurring on its own. Considered separately, the effect of the atmospheric CO2 increase is less than even moderate rates of anthropogenic N deposition for temperate or boreal forests. By contrast, for tropical forests, the atmospheric CO2 increase is sufficient to induce large rates of carbon accumulation in plants and soil. 4. Application of the model at the global scale suggests large localized Sinks for CO2 in either tropical rain forests or in forested or grassland areas of Europe and North America where appreciable N deposition occurs. Overall, the model suggests a terrestrial sink owing to CO2 fertilization and N deposition of about 0.2 Pmol C per year. About half of this is in the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere and about half in the tropics.","Carbon sequestration; Carbon sink; Climate change; Global change; Net primary productivity; Plant productivity","carbon dioxide enrichment; carbon sink; ecological modeling; global perspective; nutrient availability; primary production",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032821723

Many experimental and theoretical studies have reported standard deformation density maps and molecular density minus spherical atoms densities, which show a depletion of electron density between formally covalently bonded atoms. For example, electron deficits are found in the theoretical map of the F-F bond in F2, in the experimental map of the N-N bond in carbonohydrazide, and in the experimental and theoretical maps of the O-O bond in 1,2,7,8-tetraaza-4,5,10,11-tetraoxatricyclo[6.4.1.1]tetradecane. Other partitioning schemes, such as subtraction of valence state atoms rather than spherical atoms from the total density, have been proposed to interpret these unexpected features. In the present work we examine these electronically depleted covalent bonds on the basis of the topological analysis of the electron localization function (ELF) of theoretically calculated electron densities. The attractors of ELF determine basins that are either core or valence basins. The valence basins are characterized by the number of core basins with which they share a common boundary, and this number is called the synaptic order. Disynaptic valence basins have been found for the F-F bond in F2, for the N-N bond in carbonohydrazide and for the O-O bond in 1,2,7,8-tetraaza-4,5,10,11-tetraoxatricyclo[6.4.1.1]tetradecane. In the case of F2, polarization functions increase the V(F, F′) basin population, whereas accounting for the Coulomb correlation lowers this basin population. The results calculated for F2 are compared with those obtained for other diatomic molecules, such as N2 and O2, and the ELF picture of the bond compared with the molecular orbital analysis. In the case of carbonohydrazyde, the V(N, N′) basin population is the lowest among all the populations of the disynaptic valence basins present in the molecule, in good agreement with the experimental observations. Analogous results are obtained for the V(O, O′) basin population in 1,2,7,8-tetraaza-4,5,10,11-teTraoxatricyclo[6.4.1.1]tetradecane. Population fluctuation analysis indicates a strong delocalization of the electron density toward lone pairs and adjacent bonds. © 1999 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.","1,2,7,8-tetraaza-4,5,10,11-tetraoxatricyclo[6.4.1.1]tetradecane; Carbonohydrazide; Depleted homopolar chemical bond; Electron localization function; Second row homonuclear diatomic molecules",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001073604

A gradual increase in the catalyst activity to a maximum followed by a gradual loss in activity was observed at lower operating pressure. The surface composition (XPS) for the used catalyst is mainly α-Fe, α-SiO2, and a great amount of surface carbon (mainly graphitic carbon). After hydrogen reduction treatment or Ar ion etching iron carbide species appears on the surface. Aliphatic and polyaromatic species were observed by fourier transform infrared. On increasing the operating pressure up to 20.4 bar, a dramatic increase in carbon monoxide conversion (four times higher) under steady state conditions was observed. The bulk composition of the catalyst as determined by Mössbauer spectroscopy is Fe3O4 (50.0%), α-Fe (31.1%) and χ-Fe5C2 (18.9%) in correspondence to a gas phase constituted mainly by alkanes. Thus, α-Fe and Fe3O4 appears to be correlated with the catalytic activity whereas the deactivation process appears to be caused mainly by the formation of graphitic carbon on the catalyst surface.

Forests immediately adjacent to the power plant have been subjected to power plant emissions since the power plant initiated operation in 1954. However, localised, ground-level fumigations have been gradually reduced over the years due to a series of construction projects resulting in increased stack heights. Comparisons of growth were made among the white oaks growing at three close-in sites, as well to the growth of white oak at three control sites located 10-50 km from the power plant, during periods of differing stack heights. White oak exhibited reduced growth at two of the close-in sites during the time period when historical ground-level air pollution exposures were assumed to be greatest due to low stack heights. White oak growth at the third close-in site was not substantially reduced during this time period. In 1976, taller stacks were implemented at the power plant to reduce local, ground-level concentrations of air-pollutants. The recovery of tree growth at the two close-in affected sites, and increased synchronous growth responses from 1976-85 among all three close-in sites, indicates that implementation of taller stacks in 1976 reduced ground-level pollutant levels to such dosages that growth was not impaired at any site. Also, growth rates after 1976 were comparable to the growth rates of the white oaks growing in the control sites.

Images are usually not corrected for attenuation since filtered backprojection (FBP) reconstruction methods require a 10 to 15-min transmission scan per bed position on most current PET devices equipped with germanium-68 rod transmission sources. Such an acquisition protocol would increase the total scanning time beyond acceptable limits. The aim of this work is to validate the use of iterative reconstruction methods, on both transmission and emission scans, in order to obtain a fully corrected whole-body study within a reasonable scanning time of 60 min. Five minute emission and 3-min transmission scans are acquired at each of the seven bed positions. The transmission data are reconstructed with OSEM (ordered subsets expectation maximization) and the last iteration is reprojected to obtain consistent attenuation correction factors (ACFs). The emission image is then also reconstructed with OSEM, using the emission scan corrected for normalization, scatter and decay together with the set of consistent ACFs as inputs. The total processing time is about 35 min, which is acceptable in a clinical environment. The image quality, readability and accuracy of uptake quantification were assessed in 38 patients scanned for various malignancies. The sensitivity for tumour detection was the same for the non-attenuation-corrected (NAC-FBP) and the attenuatisn-corrected (AC-OSEM) images. The AC-OSEM images were less noisy and easier to interpret. The interobserver reproducibility was significantly increased when compared with non-corrected images (96.1% vs 81.1%, P < 0.01). Standardized uptake values (SUVs) measured on images reconstructed with OSEM (AC-OSEM) and filtered backprojection (AC-FBP were similar in all body regions except in the pelvic area, where SUVs were higher on AC-FBP images (mean increase 7.74% P < 0.01). Our results show that, when statistical reconstruction is applied to both transmission and emission data, high quality quantitative whole-body images are obtained within a reasonable scanning (60 min) and processing time, making it applicable in clinical practice.","Attenuation correction; FDG; OSEM reconstruction; Tumour imaging","fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; germanium derivative; adult; aged; article; body regions; cancer staging; clinical article; clinical practice; clinical trial; female; human; image analysis; image quality; male; oncology; pelvis; positron emission tomography; radiation attenuation; statistical parameters; tumor diagnosis; tumor localization; whole body scintiscanning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033061341

Ssb, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp70 cytosolic molecular chaperone, is associated with the ribosome-nascent chain complex. To determine whether this chaperone is coregulated with ribosomal proteins, we studied the mRNA regulation of SSB under several environmental conditions. Ssb and the ribosomal protein rpL5 mRNAs were up-regulated upon carbon upshift and down-regulated upon amino acid limitation, unlike the mRNA of another cytosolic Hsp70, Ssa. Ribosomal protein and Ssb mRNAs, like many mRNAs, are down-regulated upon a rapid temperature upshift. The mRNA reduction of several ribosomal protein genes and Ssb was delayed by the presence of an allele, EXA3-1, of the gene encoding the heat shock factor (HSF). However, upon a heat shock the EXA3-1 mutation did not significantly alter the reduction in the mRNA levels of two genes encoding proteins unrelated to the translational apparatus. Analysis of gene fusions indicated that the transcribed region, but not the promoter of SSB, is sufficient for this HSF-dependent regulation. Our studies suggest that Ssb is regulated like a core component of the ribosome and that HSF is required for proper regulation of SSB and ribosomal mRNA after a temperature upshift.",,"chaperone; heat shock protein; ribosome protein; allele; article; gene control; gene fusion; genetic code; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein synthesis; RNA translation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; temperature dependence; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032962417

Along the equator and in the South Equatorial Current there was a drop in productivity during the early to mid-Holocene, a peak during the later stages of the glacial-interglacial transition, and full glacial values lower than those of the present. There was a decrease in biological productivity (new production) on the order of 25% along the equator during the last full glacial. The west to east productivity gradient in the east equatorial Pacific was maintained in glacial times, but was reduced compared to the present. In contrast, values to the south and north of the equatorial belt of high productivity may have increased modestly during the glacial. The equatorial decrease in surface ocean biological productivity during the Ice Age was tested using multispecies benthic foraminiferal carbon isotope data and carbonate preservation indices. These tests support the faunal interpretations. The paleoproductivity results presented here conflict with those based on the record of organic carbon in deep sea sediments. The nature of this conflict and reasons for it are examined. Finally, the results here may be compatible with geochemical reconstructions of surface water nutrient concentrations, nutrient utilization, paleo-pH estimates and CO2 efflux in the eastern equatorial Pacific. However, the nutrient reconstructions are not supported by planktonic foraminiferal multispecies carbon isotope values, and an alternative model of glacial age circulation and plankton communities may be needed to account for all the data.","Biological productivity; Equational Pacific; Paleoceanography; Pleistocene","paleoceanography; paleoproductivity; Quaternary; reconstruction; surface water; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033178571

Yet most companies overlook one major capital component--the value of the earth's ecosystem services. It is a staggering omission; recent calculations place the value of the earth's total ecosystem services--water storage, atmosphere regulation, climate control, and so on--at $33 trillion a year. Not accounting for those costs has led to waste on a grand scale. But now a few farsighted companies are finding powerful business opportunities in conserving resources on a similarly grand scale. They are embarking on a journey toward ""natural capitalism,"" a journey that comprises four major shifts in business practices. The first stage involves dramatically increasing the productivity of natural resources, stretching them as much as 100 times further than they do today. In the second stage, companies adopt closed-loop production systems that yield no waste or toxicity. The third stage requires a fundamental change of business model--from one of selling products to one of delivering services. For example, a manufacturer would sell lighting services rather than lightbulbs, thus benefitting the seller and customer for developing extremely efficient, durable lightbulbs. The last stage involves reinvesting in natural capital to restore, sustain, and expand the planet's ecosystem. Because natural capitalism is both necessary and profitable, it will sub-sume traditional industrialism, the authors argue, just as industrialism sub-sumed agrarianism.

It has been found that exploitation of existing technologies can meet these requirements in a new type of transport. This can be described as a personal automatic taxi system running on its own guideway network. It is shown that this can offer effective transportation at energy and emission costs which are reduced by an order of magnitude compared to the current car-road system.

The gas-phase reactions were monitored by mass spectroscopy (MS) and the catalyst surfaces were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at certain stages of the reactions. The compositions and oxidation states of the alloy surfaces are strongly dependent on the bulk composition and the oxygen pressure, and eventually influence the reaction kinetics, product distribution, as well as mechanism of NO reduction. On a Cu-Mn (atomic 8%) alloy surface, with a medium oxygen pressure (reducing conditions), the reaction of NO with partially oxidized products of i-C4H8 is suggested to be the main mechanism of NO reduction. However, too low or too high an oxygen pressure leads to direct decomposition of NO with the production of N2 or N2O, depending on reducing or oxidizing reaction conditions. On high-manganese-concentration alloy surfaces (55%, 92% atomic), under strong reducing conditions, the main path of NO reduction is via the reaction of adsorbed NO2 with i-C4H8, which gives rise to N2 production. When the reaction conditions pass from reducing to oxidizing, NO decomposition leads to the formation of N2O. © 1999 Academic Press.","Cu-Mn alloy; Hydrocarbon; NO reduction; Surface segregation; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001013376

In this paper we investigate in particular the influence of climate on the regional proneness or ""disposition"" towards one of the most important syndromes with respect to famines and malnutrition, the ""SAHEL SYNDROME"". It describes the closely interlinked natural and socioeconomic aspects of rural poverty driven degradation of soil and vegetation on marginal sites. Two strategies of global climate impact assessment on a spatial 0.5° × 0.5° grid were pursued: (a) As a measure for the climate sensitivity of the regional proneness, the absolute value of the gradient of the disposition with respect to the global field of 3 × 12 monthy normals of temperature, irradiation and precipitation is calculated. (b) The disposition was evaluated for two different climate forecasts under doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration. For both strategies two new quantitative global models were incorporated in a fuzzy-logic-based algorithm for determining the disposition towards the SAHEL SYNDROME: a neural-net-based model for plant productivity and a waterbalance model which calculates surface runoff considering vertical and lateral fluxes, both driven by the set of 36 monthly climatological normals and designed to allow very fast global numerical evaluation. Calculation (b) shows that the change in disposition towards the SAHEL SYNDROME crucially depends on the chosen climate forecast, indicating that the disagreement of climate forecasts is propagated to the impact assessment of the investigated socio-economic pattern.

First is the increasing concern for global warming, and second is the concern over particulate and oxides of nitrogen emissions, each of which affect the environment and human health because of the particles' toxicity and ground level ozone production, respectively. To address the global warming issue, in late 1997, various nations approved the Kyoto Protocol to reduce CO2 emissions because of its identified contribution to the greenhouse effect. The Diesel engine is the most efficient power plant for mobile and stationary purposes and, thus, Diesel engines are considered to be one alternative to gasoline engines to reduce fuel consumption and, thus, CO2 emissions. To address the emission concerns, the European Community and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed emissions standards prescribing substantial reductions of NOX and PM emissions [1,2]1. As a result of these proposed standards, reductions in particulate and NOX emissions have become major challenges in Diesel engine development. Unfortunately, in the paradigm of Diesel engine development, ultra low emissions and very low fuel consumption are two opposing objectives. Moreover, NOX reduction from lean exhaust is fundamentally difficult because of the excess oxygen present. Particulate mass emissions from modern Diesel engines are already on very low levels; however, recently particulate numbers rather than particulate mass have attracted much attention and, thus, further reductions are necessary. This paper describes new approaches to ultra low emission Diesel vehicles that comply with the proposed emission standards. Advanced exhaust gas aftertreatment technology, including Diesel particulate filters and NOX catalysts, have previously been subjected to detailed research. In this paper, some new approaches are described, and their potential to large-scale vehicle application is assessed.

One such practice is the use of organic amendments and cover crops which increase carbon availability to microorganisms. Another is irrigation which, in California's hot, rain-free growing season, can cause severe wet/dry cycles. We investigated (i) long-term differences in amounts of organic inputs using soils from organic, low input, and conventional farming systems, and (ii) differences in severity of soil drying following irrigation, using soil from two depths, 0-3 and 3-15 cm. All soils were air-dried and re-wetted, and we measured short-term changes in microbial biomass carbon (MBC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), respiration, and phospholipid ester-linked fatty acid (PLFA) composition before and for 27 h after re-wetting. Respiration rates were fit to a two-first-order-component model. Carbon respired from the more slowly utilized C pool of the two-component model, MBC, and DOC increased with increasing amounts of organic inputs, and PLFA composition of the organic and conventional soils clearly differed in their mole percentages of numerous fatty acids when analyzed by principal components analysis and redundancy analysis. Despite these differences, the response of microbial communities in the three farming systems to soil drying and re-wetting was similar. For example, the relative increase in MBC following soil re-wetting did not differ among the farming system soils. In contrast, the relative increase in MBC after re-wetting was greater, and the respiratory response to soil re-wetting was more rapid in the surface (0-3 cm) than deeper (3-15 cm) layer. Higher ratios of cyclopropyl fatty acids to their precursors suggested greater stress to bacteria in the deep than surface layer, and these ratios declined more rapidly after re-wetting in the deep than surface layer. This study suggested that adaptation to wet/dry cycles by surface microorganisms had occurred during the 3-month growing season, leading to changes in both microbial process rates and community composition.","Agroecology; Microbial ecology; PLFA; Wet/dry cycles","biomass; carbon; community structure; environmental impact assessment; fatty acid cyclopropyl ester; fatty acid phospholipid ester; nutrient cycling; soil; agricultural practice; soil microorganism; wetting-drying cycle; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032861481

To evaluate the progress of research in leaf photosynthesis, plant respiration, root nutrient uptake, and carbon partitioning, we divided scientific activities into four phases: (I) initial assessments derived from our existing knowledge base to provide frameworks for experimental studies; (II) experimental tests of the initial assessments; (III) in cases where assessments were invalidated, synthesis of experimental results to stimulate alternative hypotheses and further experimentation; and (IV) formation of new knowledge. This paper suggests that photosynthetic research may have gone through all four phases, considering that (a) variable responses of photosynthesis to [CO2] are generally explainable, (b) extrapolation of leaf-level studies to the global scale has been examined, and (c) molecular studies are under way. Investigation of plant respiratory responses to [CO2] has reached the third phase: experimental results have been accumulated, and mechanistic approaches are being developed to examine alternative hypotheses in search for new concepts and/or new quantitative frameworks to understand respiratory responses to elevated [CO2]. The study of nutrient uptake kinetics is still in the second phase: experimental evidence has contradicted some of the initial assessments, and more experimental studies need to be designed before generalizations can be made. It is quite unfortunate that we have not made much progress in understanding mechanisms of carbon partitioning during the past two decades. This is due in part to the fact that some of the holistic theories, such as functional balance and optimality, have not evolved into testable hypotheses to guide experimental studies. This paper urges modelers to play an increasing role in plant-CO2 research by disassembling these existing theories into hypotheses and urges experimentalists to design experiments to examine these holistic concepts.","Acclimation; Carbon dioxide; Carbon partitioning; Global change; Nutrient uptake; Photosynthesis; Respiration; Science philosophy","carbon dioxide enrichment; nutrient uptake; photosynthesis; physiological response; respiration; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032992154

In addition, the influence of TMLR on healthy myocardium was analyzed. Methods: The prolonged short-term effectiveness of TMLR was evaluated in 44 open-chest anesthetized pigs with (n = 21) or without (n = 23) the setting of acute myocardial ischemia (observation period 6 h): seven pigs served as controls (thoracotomy only). An additional seven pigs had left anterior descending artery (LAD) occlusion only (ischemia group). A subsequent 14 pigs were treated by TMLR (CO2) prior to LAD occlusion: Seven pigs received one laser channel/cm2 (group 1) and in seven pigs two channels/cm2 in the LAD territory (group 2) were performed. In addition, 16 pigs underwent TMLR without ischemia: Eight pigs received one channel/cm2 (group 3) and eight pigs two channels/cm2 (group 4). Clinical chemistry, histo-chemical assessment and histology were performed. Results: TMLR limits the expansion of the myocardial infarction zone: laser group 2 indicated a significant smaller area of necrosis in the area at risk (ischemic group (31%) vs. laser group 1 (19%), P = ns; laser group 2 (7%) vs. ischemic group, P &lt; 0.01; laser group 1 vs. 2, P &lt; 0.01). The amount of the area of necrosis and ischemia of laser groups 3 and 4 compared with control did not differ significantly (P = ns). Preventive creation of microchannels before ischemia did not diminish ischemic parameters (P = ns). The myocardial water content-measurements (MWC) in the ischemia, laser 1 and 2 groups did not show any difference at the end of the experiment, except higher values of laser group 2 (P &lt; 0.05). Laser groups 3 and 4 revealed significantly higher MWC values compared with control (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: This prolonged acute study demonstrates that CO2- TMLR significantly reduces the amount of necrosis in the area at risk, but does not reduce cardiac ischemic markers. In healthy myocardium, TMLR significantly increases myocardial water content and ischemic parameters and induces small ischemic and very small necrotic areas surrounding open laser channels. Generally, the elevated cardiac enzymes and proteins are mainly attributed to the expected rise caused by vaporization of myocardial tissue in all laser groups.","Clinical chemistry; Histology; Ischemic markers; Myocardial protein; Transmyocardial laser revascularization","animal experiment; article; clinical chemistry; controlled study; coronary artery blood flow; heart muscle injury; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle necrosis; heart muscle perfusion; heart muscle revascularization; histochemistry; histology; nonhuman; priority journal; swine; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Body Water; Creatine Kinase; Disease Models, Animal; Evaluation Studies; Immunohistochemistry; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Laser Surgery; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardial Revascularization; Myocardium; Myoglobin; Reference Values; Survival Rate; Swine; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033013172

Kazbegi Av. 2a, Tbilisi, 380060, Georgia","A theory of pulsar radio emission generation, in which the observed waves are produced directly by maser-type plasma instabilities operating at the anomalous cyclotron-Cherenkov resonance ω - k∥v∥ + ωB/γres = 0 and the Cherenkov drift resonance ω - k∥v∥ - k⊥ ud = 0, is capable of explaining the main observational characteristics of pulsar radio emission. The instabilities are due to the interaction of the fast particles from the primary beam and the tail of the distribution with the normal modes of a strongly magnetized one-dimensional electron-positron plasma. The waves emitted at these resonances are vacuum-like, electromagnetic waves that may leave the magnetosphere directly. In this model, the cyclotron-Cherenkov instability is responsible for the core-emission pattern and the Cherenkov drift instability produces conal emission. The conditions for the development of the cyclotron-Cherenkov instability are satisfied for both typical and millisecond pulsars provided that the streaming energy of the bulk plasma is not very high γp ≈ 10. In a typical pulsar the cyclotron-Cherenkov and Cherenkov drift resonances occur in the outer parts of the magnetosphere at rres ≈ 109 cm. This theory can account for various aspects of pulsar phenomenology, including the morphology of the pulses, their polarization properties and their spectral behaviour. We propose several observational tests for the theory. The most prominent prediction is the high altitudes of the emission region and the linear polarization of conal emission in the plane orthogonal to the local osculating plane of the magnetic field.","Plasmas; Radiative transfer; Waves pulsars: general",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0012736252

The method of estimating climatic noise is based on the idea of Yamamoto et al. (1985) and the potential predictability is expressed by the ratio of the estimated inter-annual variation to the estimated natural variation (or climatic noise). Generally the climatic noise of monthly mean temperature increases with latitude and altitude and varies with season. The continental air from Siberia and Mongolia plays a significant role and the ocean acts as an adjustor and a reductor in the climatic noise except for the tropical Pacific ocean in transitional season. The potential predictability is diversified from month to month and one station to another, but generally the monthly mean temperature over China is potentially predictable at statistical significance level 0.10. The results suggest that we could not ask a climate model to predict the climate with satisfactory results worldwide in all seasons and that the regional model could be a hopeful way to predict the climate.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033239714

In Cameroon the flux of CH4 ranged from a net emission of 40.7 ng m-2 s-1 to a net CH4 oxidation of -53.0 ng m-2 s-1. Soil-inhabiting termite biomass was significantly correlated with CH4 flux. Termite mounds emitted up to 2000 ng s-1 mound-1. Termite-derived CH4 emission reduced the soil sink strength by up to 28%. Disturbance also had a strong effect on the soil sink strength, with the average rate of CH4 oxidation, at -17.5 ng m-2 s-1, being significantly smaller (~36%) at the secondary forest site than the -27.2 ng m-2 s-1, observed at the primary forest site. CH4 budgets calculated for each site indicated that both forests were net sinks for CH4 at -6.1 kg ha-1y-1 in the near-primary forest and -3.1 kg ha-1 y-1 in the secondary forest. In Borneo, three forest sites representing a disturbance gradient were examined. CH4 oxidation rates ranged from 0 to -32.1 ng m-2 s-1 and a significant correlation between the net flux and termite biomass was observed only in an undisturbed primary forest, although the biomass was insufficient to cause net emission of CH4. Rates of CH4 oxidation were not significantly different across the disturbance gradient but were, however, larger in the primary forest (averaging -15.4 ng m-2 s-1) than in an old-growth secondary forest (-13.9 ng m-2 s-1) and a young secondary re-growth (-10.8 ng m-2 s-1). CH4 flux from termite mounds ranged from net oxidation in an abandoned mound to a maximum emission of 468 ng s-1 mound-1. CH4 budgets calculated for each site indicated that CH4 flux from termite mounds had an insignificant effect on the budget of CH4 at the regional scale at all three forest sites.

The principal obstacle to long-term operation in this environment is changes in detector effective doping concentration (Neff). We present a model of defect evolution during gamma and hadron irradiation which has been combined with Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) statistics to predict Neff and dark current in irradiated devices. These predictions are compared with experimental results from detectors with various oxygen and carbon concentrations. In the case of gamma irradiation, the electrical characteristics are described satisfactorily by the production of divacancy-oxygen (V2O) defects. In the case of hadron irradiation, however, the experimental data cannot be explained in the conventional SRH picture. We propose a model whereby states in the terminal defect clusters exchange charge directly. This mechanism leads to a marked increase in carrier generation rate and an enhancement in the acceptor-like contribution to Neff. We conclude that only limited improvements in radiation hardness to hadrons can be achieved by altering detector impurity levels, since the changes in Neff are dominated by intrinsic defects within the terminal clusters.",,"Colliding beam accelerators; Crystal defects; Mathematical models; Radiation hardening; Silicon sensors; Defect engineering; Silicon detectors; Particle detectors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033330156

The interest in protecting the natural environment from pollution gained increased importance in the 1990s with a push by world communities for sustainable development. Developing countries as well as the industrialized nations are expected to cut down on pollution and control the use of non-renewable natural resources. Although the concept of sustainable development sounds plausible, it is difficult to implement in many countries due to their conflicting goals. The world-wide targets on emissions, use of fossil fuels, reduction in water and atmospheric pollution require the participation of every nation. These goals are not easily achievable by some of the poorer developing countries partly because of their economic dependence on natural resources and partly because of their inability to afford more modern and efficient technologies. Thus, environmental planning goals are often in conflict with the development, social and economic needs of a country. In this paper, we develop a decision support framework that utilizes multicriteria and optimization models to address environmental planning problems. This framework is based on identifying the priorities of conflicting goals by working through and reducing the conflicts. A strategic planning framework is introduced into the decision support system since national planning is a strategic issue and these goals can only be achieved by adopting a systemic view.",,"decision support system; environmental planning; methodology; planning method",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032798823

Its complex regulation involves pH, carbon, nitrogen and peptones. Two previously identified upstream activating sequence (UAS) regions were analysed in a reporter system, outside the XPR2 context. Fragments from the UAS regions were inserted upstream of a minimal LEU2 promoter directing the expression of a reporter gene. The activity of the hybrid promoters was assessed following integration into the Y. lipolytica genome. This study confirmed the presence of two UASs composed of several interacting elements. Within the distal UAS (UAS1), a TUF/RAP1 binding site exhibited a UAS activity, which was enhanced by the presence of two adjacent repeats, overlapping sites similar to the CAR1 upstream repressing sequence from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Within the proximal UAS (UAS2), the UAS activity required the interaction of both an ABF1-like binding site and a decameric repeat, containing Aspergillus nidulans PacC site consensus sequences. This decameric repeat was able to mediate repression due to carbon and/or nitrogen sources as well as pH-dependent activation. A study in the context of trans-regulatory mutations in the Y. lipolytica RIM101 gene showed that the PacC-like sites, potential binding sites for YIRim101p, were implicated in the derepression of UAS2-driven expression at neutral-alkaline pH. The in vivo response of the PacC-like decamers to external pH was dependent on the status of the pH-regulated activator YIRim101p, which is homologous to the A. nidulans PacC regulator. The carbon/nitrogen regulation imposed on the decamers was shown to be independent of YIRim101p and to override its effects.","Promoter; Regulation; UAS; XPR2; Yarrowia","article; Aspergillus nidulans; consensus sequence; fungal genetics; gene mutation; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; reporter gene; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Yarrowia lipolytica; Aspergillus; Emericella nidulans; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Yarrowia; Yarrowia lipolytica; Yarrowia lipolytica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032898514

This general approach has been applied in the case of carbon monoxide on 35 traffic monitoring stations in the Lombardy Region. The implemented model has been called FOREPOLL (Forecast Pollution). The model structure, consisting in three basic modules (the deterministic, the stochastic and the Bayesian one), has been thought to be adjustable to different stations of an air quality network and to various pollutants. Forepoll uses the last biennium data set of the station in exam (pollutants and micrometeorological parameters) as a moving learning time and also needs the forecasted synoptic weather type. In the first module the daily maxima of the hourly measured pollutant concentrations are checked in order to eliminate some known physical dependencies, such as the temperature dependence of the emissions. Then the data are divided into subgroups depending on the weather type and in each group fitted by a different Weibull distribution. To provide a first a priori exceedance probability, this distribution is daily rebuilt by taking into account the forecasted parameters. In the last module this probability is enhanced or reduced using simple, experience based, bayesian rules providing the a posteriori exceedance probability. Model validation trials have been carried out on a year of CO forecasted concentrations in different air quality stations; the first results are quite good particularly for the metropolitan areas, because the model seems to work better in case of stronger and more diffuse pollution.","Air pollution forecasting; Bayesian theory; Peak episodes; Pollutant distribution; Stochastic models","Air pollution forecasting; Bayesian theory; Air pollution; Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Gas emissions; Mathematical models; Probability; Random processes; Weibull distribution; Atmospheric composition; carbon monoxide; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; prediction; traffic emission; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; article; forecasting; prediction; priority journal; probability; stochastic model; temperature dependence; weather; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033213798

Here several idealized models for stochastic climate modeling are introduced and analyzed through unambiguous mathematical theory. This analysis demonstrates the potential need for more sophisticated models beyond stable linear Langevin equations. The new phenomena include the emergence of both unstable linear Langevin stochastic models for the climate mean and the need to incorporate both suitable nonlinear effects and multiplicative noise in stochastic models under appropriate circumstances. The strategy for stochastic climate modeling that emerges from this analysis is illustrated on an idealized example involving truncated barotropic flow on a beta-plane with topography and a mean flow. In this example, the effect of the original 57 degrees of freedom is well represented by a theoretically predicted stochastic model with only 3 degrees of freedom.",,"article; atmosphere; climate; oscillation; prediction; priority journal; sea; simulation; stochastic model; weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033592942

This core, taken in September 1994, had a record of stratigraphic changes in chrysophyte assemblages remarkably similar to those in 210Pb-dated sediment cores taken in 1983 and 1988. Abrupt changes in chrysophyte stratigraphy were used to date the newest sediment core by stratigraphic correlation. We observed relatively constant composition of chrysophyte species and inferred-pH values in post-1970 sediments, which suggests that there has been little change in lakewater pH values despite the reductions in sulfate deposition since 1970 in the Adirondacks. These results are consistent with recent monitoring measurements in the Adirondacks. Further research is necessary to ascertain the applicability of these findings to other lakes in the Adirondacks and to determine the reasons for the lack of recovery.","Acidic deposition; Acidification; Adirondack Park; Big Moose Lake; Chrysophytes; New York; Paleolimnology","acid deposition; environmental change; lake pollution; paleolimnology; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032922844

Dermis: repair zone thickness, vascular and inflammatory pattern, collagen deposition, and elastic fiber changes. Results: The epidermis regenerated within 7 to 10 days. By 3 months, the epidermis revealed flattening of the rete peg pattern with restoration of polarity, keratinocytes, and melanocytes. The 3-month dermis demonstrated a fibrotic repair zone (500-700 μm), new elastic fibers, and telangiectatic capillaries.

In 1998, emission controls in the US required the reduction of NOx by 20% from the 1994 limit. Hino Motors has developed new J-series medium-duty diesel engines for trucks that meet the US 1998 emissions regulations. The engines comprise turbocharged and aftercooled 4- and 6-cylinder engines of the same cylinder bore and stroke. The engines feature a 4-valve system, OHC valve train design, centered nozzle arrangement, and an optimum combustion chamber design, which achieved uniform combustion. With these features, the maximum combustion temperature was decreased, and hence reduced the NOx, smoke, and PM emissions. A muffler integrated with a catalytic converter (catalytic muffler) was adopted to reduce PM emissions further. The engines with the catalytic muffler have successfully met the US 1998 emissions regulations. Not only to meet the emissions regulations, but also to satisfy market requirements, significant efforts were made to reduce total administration cost. Initial, running, and maintenance costs were reduced by using low cost local parts, reduced fuel and oil consumptions, and improved long term durability, respectively. Fuel consumption was reduced by achieving uniform combustion, and low frictional and pumping losses. Oil consumption was reduced by lowering piston temperature with a new innovative cooling channel piston and by the optimized piston profile and piston ring design. To secure durability in the US market, the engines were optimized for US fuel, oil, and coolant. The US local parts such as oil and fuel filter elements were positively adopted. A catalytic muffler was developed by conducting both filed tests in the US and extensive durability tests that were specifically designed for the US market. Results from 35,000 hours of various durability tests convinced the authors that the J-series engines had sufficient durability and reliability.

Vacuum action through a narrow (0.0625 in. i.d.) stainless steel tube allows the introduction of discrete samples of NIST SRM 1648 urban particulate matter (UPM) and caffeine in powder form. Introduction of 'ambient' airborne particulate matter is also possible. Particles passing through the aerodynamic momentum separator impinge on the heated (~200-250 °C) inner surface of the glow discharge plasma volume and are flash-vaporized. The resultant atoms/molecules are subjected to excitation/ionization collisions within the low-pressure (0.5-5 Torr of He or Ar) plasma, producing characteristic photon emission and/or signature ionic species. In this way, atomic emission and mass spectrometry identification of particle constituents is possible. Basic design aspects of the apparatus are presented, and demonstrations of atomic emission detection of the constituents in the NIST SRM illustrate the general characteristics of the approach. Transient atomic emission signals are captured for the introduction of preweighed, discrete samples, with the integrated areas used to construct analytical response curves. Limits of detection using this relatively simple atomic emission system are on the order of tens of nanograms for sample masses of ~50 μg. Mass spectrometric monitoring of introduced caffeine particles and a mixture of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) illustrates the ability of the glow discharge plasma to produce high-quality, library (electron impact) searchable mass spectra of molecular species while also yielding isotopic identification of elemental components of the UPM. Limits of detection for Fe in the NIST SRM are on the order of 175 ng of material, equivalent to ~7 ng of analyte Fe. It is believed that the small size, low power consumption, ease of operation, and multimode sampling capabilities (AES/MS) of the particle beam-glow discharge (PB-GD) apparatus hold promise for applications in continuous monitoring and discrete particle sampling.",,"caffeine; iron; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; airborne particle; analytic method; article; atomic emission spectrometry; excitation; ionization; mass spectrometry; particulate matter; sampling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032599784

This may influence the activity, the biomass, and the structure of soil and rhizosphere microbial communities and therefore the nutrient cycling rates and the plant growth. The present paper focuses on bacterial numbers and on community structure. The rhizospheres of two grassland plants, Lolium perenne (ryegrass) and Trifolium repens (white clover), were divided into three fractions: the bulk soil, the rhizospheric soil, and the rhizoplane-endorhizosphere. The elevated atmospheric CO2 content increased the most probable numbers of heterotrophic bacteria in the rhizosphere of L. perenne. However, this effect lasted only at the beginning of the vegetation period for T. repens. Community structure was assessed after isolation of DNA, PCR amplification, and construction of cloned 16S rDNA libraries. Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) and colony hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe designed to detect Pseudomonas spp. showed under elevated atmospheric CO2 content an increased dominance of pseudomonads in the rhizosphere of L. perenne and a decreased dominance in the rhizosphere of T. repens. This work provides evidence for a CO2-induced alteration in the structure of the rhizosphere bacterial populations, suggesting a possible alteration of the plant-growth-promoting-rhizobacterial (PGPR) effect.",,"amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis; biomass; carbon dioxide; community structure; nutrient cycling; oligonucleotide probe; photosynthesis; plant microorganism interaction; polymerase chain reaction; Pseudomonas; ribosomal DNA; symbiosis; abundance; bacterium; carbon dioxide enrichment; community structure; rhizosphere; soil microorganism; Lolium perenne; Trifolium repens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032811694

The plastics industry has been researching a variety of mechanical recycling, feedstock recycling, energy/fuel recovery, and reuse options for post-use automotive plastics. This paper reports on recent commercial experience and test programs using automotive shredder residue (ASR) containing post-use automotive plastics as an environmentally sound energy source in modern waste-to-energy plants. Commercial experience in Europe, especially Germany and Switzerland, is highlighted. A major test program cosponsored by the Association of Plastics Manufacturers in Europe (APME) and the American Plastics Council (APC) has recently demonstrated that co-firing ASR with municipal solid waste (MSW) can be carried out in compliance with strict German air emissions and ash management regulations. Residues were tested with excellent results meeting different European and United States standards. Co-combustion with MSW is presently the recovery option of choice for ASR in some areas of Germany, France, Sweden, and Switzerland, and experience over the past year has shown the technology to be both economically and environmentally sound.

The experiments were performed at 800 °C by applying a methane to oxygen ratio of 2:1. The contact times in the draft tube (&lt;&lt;0.1 g · s · mL-1) were sufficient to obtain nearly thermodynamic equilibrium values for the methane conversion (X(CH4,eq) = 92%) and selectivities to hydrogen (S(H2,eq) = 97%) and carbon dioxide (S(CO,eq) = 97%). The achieved results indicate the general suitability of an ICFB reactor for the partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas. However, stable and controllable reactor operation with sufficient solids circulation through the draft tube was possible only over a narrow range of gas velocities (0.75-1.50 m · s-1). Furthermore, the conversion and selectivities were strongly influenced by the temperature distribution in the ICFB reactor. Especially, the decrease of temperature in the top of the draft tube and in the fountain region promoted backreactions reducing the conversion of methane. Furthermore, catalyst deactivation due to carbon depositions occurred in the ICFB reactor. This effect caused for the 1 Wt % Ni catalyst a significant drop of the activity during 150 h of time on stream. The methane conversion decreased in the range of 12% for a catalyst particle fraction of 71-160 μm. It was shown by TEM that two different types of carbon (encapsulating and whisker carbon) were deposited on the surface. The first species resulted in a reversible deactivation (activation of the catalyst by carbon dioxide in the reverse Boudouard reaction was partially possible), whereas the second species resulted in an irreversible deactivation due to a Ni loss by removing the carbon fibers which had Ni sites on top of the filament.An internally circulating fluidized bed (ICFB) reactor was used to investigate the catalytic partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas over Ni/α-Al2O3.

One of the enzymes, isopenicillin N synthase has been crystallyzed and its active center identified. The three genes pcbAB, pcbC and penDE involved in penicillin biosynthesis are clustered in Penicillium chrysogenum, Aspergillus nidulans and Penicillium nalgiovense. Carbon catabolite regulation of penicillin biosynthesis is exerted by glucose and other easily utilizable carbon sources but not by lactose. The glucose effect is enhanced by high phosphate concentrations. Glucose represses the biosynthesis of penicillin by preventing the formation of the penicillin biosynthesis enzymes. Transcription of the pcbAB, pcbC and penDE genes of P. chrysogenum is strongly repressed by glucose and the repression is not reversed by alkaline pHs. Carbon catabolite repression of penicillin biosynthesis in A. nidulans is not mediated by CreA and the same appears to be true in P. chrysogenum. The first two genes of the penicillin pathway (pcbAB and pcbC) are expressed from a bidirectional promoter region. Analysis of different DNA fragments of this bidirectional promoter region revealed two important DNA sequences (boxes A and B) for expression and glucose catabolite regulation of the pcbAB gene. Using protein extracts from mycelia grown under carbon catabolite repressing or derepressing conditions DNA-binding proteins that interact with the bidirectional promoter region were purified to near homogeneity.","CreA; Glucose repression; Penicillin genes; Promoters; Regulatory proteins; Signal transduction","carbon; cephalosporin; DNA binding protein; glucose; isopenicillin N synthetase; penicillin G; phosphate; tripeptide; alkalinity; antibiotic biosynthesis; article; Aspergillus nidulans; catabolism; DNA sequence; gene repression; genetic transcription; mycelium; nonhuman; Penicillium chrysogenum; priority journal; promoter region; Aspergillus; Aspergillus nidulans; Emericella nidulans; Penicillium chrysogenum; Penicillium chrysogenum; Penicillium nalgiovense; Penicillium nalgiovense",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033057423

The analysis was performed on solutions of unstrained adiabatic premixed flames with detailed chemical kinetics described by GRI 2.11 for methane and a 71-reaction mechanism for hydrogen including NO(x) formation. A 10-step reduced mechanism for methane has been constructed which reproduces accurately laminar burning velocities, flame temperatures and mass fraction distributions of major species for the whole flammability range. Many steady-state species are also predicted satisfactorily. This mechanism is an improvement over the seven-step set of Massias et al, especially for rich flames, because the use of HCNO, HCN and C2H2 as major species results in a better calculation of prompt NO. The present 10-step mechanism may thus also be applicable to diffusion flames. A five-step mechanism for lean and hydrogen-rich combustion has also been constructed based on a detailed mechanism including thermal NO. This mechanism is accurate for a wide range of the equivalence ratio and for pressures as high as 40 bar. For both fuels, the CSP algorithm automatically pointed to the same steady-state species as those identified by laborious analysis or intuition in the literature and the global reactions were similar to well established previous methane-reduced mechanisms. This implies that the method is very well suited for the study of complex mechanisms for heavy hydrocarbon combustion.",,"combustion; flame; hydrogen; mathematical method; methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033150837

Stands of S. olneyi responded to eight years of elevated CO2, by increased rates of net ecosystem gas exchange and a large stimulation of net ecosystem production. We conducted our study in the summer of 1994 and 1995 when soil cores were collected and aboveground biomass was estimated. Nitrogen concentration in elevated CO2 treatments was reduced 15% in stems of S. olneyi and 8% in the upper 10 cm of the soil profile. While total plant nitrogen per unit of land area remained the same between treatments, total soil nitrogen showed a non-significant tendency to decrease in the upper 10 cm of the soil profile in elevated CO2 both years of study. A significant decrease in soil bulk density largely contributed to the observed decrease in soil nitrogen. Exchangeable nitrogen and potential denitrification rates were also reduced in elevated CO2, but net nitrogen mineralization was unchanged by elevated CO2 treatment in S. olneyi both years. Plants and soils in a pure stand of the C4 grass, S. patens, showed none of these effects of elevated CO2 treatment. Our data provides evidence of changes in nitrogen dynamics of an ecosystem exposed to elevated CO2 for eight years; however due to the variability in these data, we cannot say if or how these changes are likely to impact the effect of rising CO2 on primary production or carbon accumulation in this ecosystem in the future.","Denitrification; Elevated CO2; Exchangeable N (NH4/+); Potential net N mineralization; Scirpus olneyi","atmosphere; biomass; carbon dioxide; denitrification; environment; environmental impact assessment; gas exchange; mineralization; nitrogen; nutrient cycling; soil; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon dioxide enrichment; nitrogen; soil-vegetation interaction; wetland; United States; Scirpus olneyi; Spartina patens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032859185

Four soils were selected to represent the major parent material and climatic factors responsible for the formation of important agricultural soils in the central eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Acid-washed sand was used as control. Seedlings were grown for 21 days and nutrient element content in both plant material and soil were determined. Soils derived from dolerite rocks had significantly (P&lt;0.05) higher calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), sodium (Na), and phosphorus (P) than those derived from sedimentary rocks. However, iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and copper (Cu) were higher in soils derived from sedimentary rocks compared to those from dolerite rocks. The differences are attributed to elemental composition of minerals in the two parent rock materials. Within each rock group, soils derived from sites with higher temperature and low rainfall (semi-arid climate) had significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher nutrient element content than those from sites with lower temperatures and higher rainfall (humid climate). As far as plant growth is concerned, all the soils were well supplied with Ca, Mg, K, Na, and zinc (Zn), but were deficient in P, Fe, and Mn. The trend in uptake of soil nutrient elements by wheat seedlings mirrored their concentration in the soils. Estimates of plant-available nutrient elements as determined by soil tests and their uptake as determined by tissue concentration were highly correlated for some nutrient elements (r2=0.83, 0.79, 0.94, 0.54, 0.69, and 0.61 for Ca, Mg, K, P, Na, and Zn, respectively) and weak for others (r2=0.47, 0.35, and 0.37 for Fe, Mn, and Cu, respectively). Notwithstanding the shortcomings of extrapolating pot derived results to field conditions, it is concluded that the Neubauer technique may offer a rapid and relatively inexpensive way of relating extractable nutrient elements with plant uptake and growth. Further in country correlation studies are, however, recommended.",,"agriculture; article; nonhuman; plant growth; plant seed; soil; South Africa; wheat; Triticum aestivum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032704856

This latter is basically a regenerative gas cycle operating on CO2 as the working fluid and using O2 as the fuel oxidizer in the combustion chambers. The cycle uses the highest temperatures and pressures compatible with the most advanced materials in the steam and gas turbines and in the heat exchangers. In addition, a reheat and a staged compression and with intercooling are used. Therefore the optimized cycle efficiency is around 45% when operating on natural gas. A big asset of the system is its ability to remove the CO2 produced in the combustion process in liquid or supercritical state and at high pressure, without any costly and energy consuming system like 'end-of-pipe' MEA scrubbers or membranes. CO2 is then ready for transportation, for reuse or for final storage. In this respect, there is a possible integration of the CO2 storage with the MATIANT power generation plant, unlike conventional CO2 capture, providing gaseous CO2 at atmospheric pressure. In the same way, other contaminants like NOx remain under control and are not released to the atmosphere. In this study, the cycle performances are calculated and a sensitivity analysis of the cycle is performed when the free parameters are varied. The optimal design point is then obtained for given internal constrains and boundary conditions.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cogeneration plants; Combustion; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; High pressure effects; High temperature operations; Oxides; Reheat cycle; Sensitivity analysis; Carbon dioxide cycles; Carbon dioxide removal; Oxide combustion; Zero carbon dioxide release; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033357515

The quality of these waters has been monitored since 1987. Among 12 main ground water aquifers in Slovenia the amount of nitrate exceeds the allowable level (50 mg/l) for drinking water in areas with more intensive agricultural production with higher concentrations of animals (two livestock unit - LU/ha) and where drainage of sewage water is not excellently arranged or where quality of river water that effluent ground water is not well. The identification of nitrogen surpluses has been done on regional and farm level (using normative approach). This method is taking into account nitrogen input from mineral fertiliser, animal wastes and the deposition from the atmosphere minus nitrogen uptake of harvested crops and ammonia losses to the atmosphere. On an average nitrogen input from mineral fertiliser is low, while input from organic manure is rather high - 90 kg/ha. Average net-balance surplus for Slovenia is about 56 kg N/ha. The differences between regions are relatively high. In the most intensive arable region with high intensity of animal husbandry (2 LU/ha) nitrogen surplus is about 90 kg/ha. This region can be identified as vulnerable for nitrogen leaching into ground water. In regions with limited growing conditions for agriculture plants (climate, soil depth) just small increase of livestock density can cause high nitrogen Surpluses. Our Slovenian legislation, which almost entirely corresponds to EC Nitrate Directive and Code of Good Agricultural Practice intends to reduce mineral surpluses in agriculture and meet the standards of nitrate in drinking water.","Ground water; Nitrate; Pollution; Standards; Strategy","agriculture; groundwater; legislation; water quality; Slovenia; Animalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032933096

We examined the effect of elevated CO2 (590 μl 1-1) at two nutrient (NPK) levels on the interactions of the facultative root hemiparasite Rhinanthus alectorolophus with two of its hosts, the grass Lolium perenne and the legume Medicago sativa. To study possible effects on parasite mediation of competition between hosts, the parasite was grown with each host separately and with both hosts simultaneously. In addition, all combinations of hosts were grown without the parasite. Both the parasite and the host plants responded to elevated CO2 with increased growth, but only at high nutrient levels. The CO2 response of the hemiparasite was stronger than that of the hosts, but depended on the host species available. With L. perenne and M. sativa simultaneously available as hosts, the biomass of the parasite grown at elevated CO2 was 5.7 times that of parasites grown at ambient CO2. Nitrogen concentration in the parasites was not influenced by the treatments and was not related to parasite biomass. The presence of the parasite strongly reduced both the biomass of the hosts and total productivity of the system. This effect was much stronger at low than at high nutrient levels, but was not influenced by CO2 level. Elevated CO2 did not influence the competitive balance between the two different hosts grown in mixture. The results of this study support the hypothesis that hemiparasites may influence community structure and suggest that these effects are robust to changes in CO2 concentration.","Competition; Lolium; Medicago; Rhinanthus; Root hemiparasites","carbon dioxide enrichment; hemiparasite; host-parasite interaction; parasitic plant; soil nutrient; Lolium perenne; Medicago sativa; Rhinanthus alectorolophus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032841601

These must be curtailed to comply with the new Swiss clean air act LRV 98. The Swiss environmental protection agency (BUWAL) investigated the state of the technology. The aim was a cleaner agricultural walk behind mower with a 10kW 4-stroke SI-engine. Two engine designs were compared: side-valve and OHV. A commercially available 3-way catalytic converter system substantially curtailed emissions: In the ISO 8178 G test-cycle-average, HC was minimized to 8% and CO to 5% of raw emissions. At part load points, the residual emission was < 1%. Simultaneously, fuel consumption improved 10%. Using a special gasoline (Swiss standard SN 181 163), the aromatic hydrocarbons were curtailed, e.g. Benzene < 1%, and fuel consumption further improved. Those results were confirmed in field tests. The engine is approved for retrofitting. Disquieting are the high emissions of ultrafine particulates: the catalytic converter only minimizes the volatile but not the solid particulates.

Two cases are explored: a relatively reduced methane-rich ocean and a relatively oxidized sulfate- and bicarbonate-rich ocean. In the case of a methane-rich ocean, a source of CO2 for methanogenesis is provided by conversion of dissolved methane to CO2 during reaction of ocean water with igneous rocks at high temperatures in the subsurface. Fluid-rock reactions also provide a source of dissolved H2 in the hydrothermal fluid. When this fluid circulates back to the ocean floor and mixes with seawater, conversion of the dissolved CO2 and H2 to methane provides a potential source of chemical energy that can be used to drive metabolic processes. For the case of a sulfate- and carbonate-rich ocean, reaction with reduced igneous rocks at high temperatures will also produce hydrothermal fluids with high H2 concentrations (as occurs in hydrothermal systems on Earth). Mixing of the resulting hydrothermal fluid with seawater in a relatively oxidized ocean could supply energy from either methanogenesis or sulfate reduction. For plausible compositions of a Europan ocean, methanogenesis can supply similar amounts of energy to that which supports the prolific ecosystems surrounding submarine hydrothermal vents on Earth. Even in the most optimistic case, however, the total amount of biomass that could be supported globally by lithoautotrophic microbes on Europa is extremely small compared to the biomass produced photosynthetically on Earth. Nevertheless, sufficient metabolic energy could apparently be available at hydrothermal systems on Europa to support an origin of life and localized ecosystems.

A 7,917-bp fragment of DNA was cloned and shown to carry a 4,104-bp cluster of 5 pha genes, phaP, -Q, -R, -B, and -C. The phaP and -Q genes were shown to be transcribed in one orientation, each from a separate promoter, while immediately upstream, phaR, -B, and -C were divergently transcribed as a tricistronic operon. Transfer of this gene cluster to Escherichia coli and to a PhaC- mutant of Pseudomonas putida gave a Pha+ phenotype in both strains. Translational fusions to the green fluorescent protein localized PhaP and PhaC to the PHA inclusion bodies in living cells.

Laser resurfacing of facial rhytids has become a popular treatment option for many patients with wrinkles, photoaging, and acne scarring. Laser wavelength options and optimization of techniques continue to evolve in an attempt to shorten the healing phase associated with laser skin resurfacing. OBJECTIVE. TO prospectively study the clinical effects of pulsed carbon dioxide (CO2) laser resurfacing of facial rhytids used alone, compared with a combination of CO2 and the pulsed Erbium:YAG (Er:YAG) laser. METHODS. Forty treatment sites on 20 patients were randomized and evaluated following treatment of the upper lip region with a combination of CO2 laser resurfacing alone or with the same CO2 laser treatment followed by 3 passes with the Er: YAG laser. Patient diaries were maintained to assess erythema, crusting, pain, itching, swelling, pigmentary changes, and the day of first make-up application. Blinded objective grading of improvement was independently assessed by 4 blinded observers at time intervals 3, 6, and 10 days, and 1, 2, and 4 months. Chromometer measurements of erythema were also analyzed and percentage moisture recorded. RESULTS. Subjectively, all patients reported, on average, 10 days of redness and 2.4 days of pain, with no significant difference noted between the two procedures. On average, patients were able to apply make-up 5.5 days postoperatively, regardless of which procedure used. However, the combined CO2/Er:YAG laser treatment patients experienced reduced duration of crusting, compared to the patients treated with CO2 alone. The duration of crusting was reduced on average from 7.4 to 6.5 days, and also the duration of itching was reduced in patients receiving combined treatment from 5.5 to 4.8 days. Chromometer measurements noted no significant difference between techniques in the rate of resolution of erythema. Blinded objective grading revealed that crusting was reduced on average from 7.2 to 6.0 days, and swelling was reduced from 6.3 to 6.0 days in patients receiving the combined procedure. No cases of permanent hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, or scarring occurred in any patients. CONCLUSION. The addition of the Er:YAG laser following CO2 laser resurfacing reduces the duration of crusting, swelling, and itching postoperatively. Medium to deep (Grade III) facial rhytids were improved by 70% with both procedures with no significant difference noted between techniques.",,"retinoic acid; carbon dioxide; erbium; adult; aged; aging; article; carbon dioxide laser; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; erbium YAG laser; face surgery; female; human; human tissue; intermethod comparison; laser surgery; priority journal; pruritus; randomized controlled trial; topical drug administration; treatment outcome; upper lip; wound healing; comparative study; lip; methodology; middle aged; prospective study; rhytidoplasty; single blind procedure; wound healing; Adult; Aged; Carbon Dioxide; Erbium; Female; Humans; Laser Surgery; Lip; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Rhytidoplasty; Single-Blind Method; Treatment Outcome; Wound Healing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032586323

Reducing carbon intensity can be achieved through both supply and end-use energy strategies, though improvements in end-use efficiency are said to offer the best opportunities both in terms of effective investment and producing results in the short to medium term. UK policy makers have stressed that energy use in the home is a pressing area to be addressed. This paper reviews the myriad of efficiency options available, assessing the effectiveness of national and supra-national strategies in encouraging technical efficiency and stimulating beneficial behaviourial changes. Findings indicate that the range of (and commitment to) current efficiency measures, reinforced by a lack of policy coherence, ensures that future prospects remain ambiguous. Initiatives, though conceived at a variety of spatial scales, tend to be implemented at a localized level and it is the actions (and interactions) of local actors that may well determine the shape and success of sustainability measures.",,"carbon emission; efficiency measurement; energy conservation; residential energy; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032772566

We evaluated environmental monitoring data and developed estimates of airborne concentrations and their uncertainties and calculated lifetime cancer risks and risks of chronic beryllium disease to hypothetical receptors. This article discusses exposure-response relationships for lung cancer and chronic beryllium disease. We assigned a distribution to cancer slope factor values based on the relative risk estimates from an occupational epidemiologic study used by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to determine the slope factors. We used the regional atmospheric transport code for Hanford emission tracking atmospheric transport model for exposure calculations because it is particularly well suited for long-term annual-average dispersion estimates and it incorporates spatially varying meteorologic and environmental parameters. We accounted for model prediction uncertainty by using several multiplicative stochastic correction factors that accounted for uncertainty in the dispersion estimate, the meteorology, deposition, and plume depletion. We used Monte Carlo techniques to propagate model prediction uncertainty through to the final risk calculations. We developed nine exposure scenarios of hypothetical but typical residents of the RFP area to consider the lifestyle, time spent outdoors, location, age, and sex of people who may have been exposed. We determined geometric mean incremental lifetime cancer incidence risk estimates for beryllium inhalation for each scenario. The risk estimates were &lt; 10-6. Predicted air concentrations were well below the current reference concentration derived by the EPA for beryllium sensitization.","Atmospheric transport modeling; Beryllium; Chronic beryllium disease; Exposure assessment; Lung cancer; Uncertainty","beryllium; age; article; atmospheric transport; berylliosis; cancer risk; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; female; fire; gender; human; lifestyle; lung cancer; male; meteorology; occupational exposure; plant; plume; prediction; priority journal; statistical analysis; system analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032833057

With the advent of ever stricter EPA regulations on pollutant emissions, industrial combustion equipment manufacturers started exploring CFD as a possible tool enabling the optimisation of designs capable of satisfying the new regulations. Much research has been devoted to the field of turbulent reactive flows since the late 1960's, and many models of varying complexity were developed. However, due to limited resources, most of the computational effort was devoted to the validation of these various models on small scale experimental geometries. Furthermore, most of these models were only available within the framework of research codes. In order to be able to easily handle very large problems of complex geometry, it was deemed necessary to couple the capabilities of a state-of-the-art commercial CFD code to advanced combustion models. This paper will show that such efforts by CERCA and Adapco enabled the interfacing of a commercial CFD package (Star-CD) with a research combustion model library (CMBLIB). As a result, we were able to successfully simulate several different types of industrial boilers fired with different types of fuels (gas, oil, wood). Though precise measurements inside industrial boilers are difficult to obtain, comparisons with measurements taken at the various outlets show good agreement with the predicted values. In this paper we will also endeavour to demonstrate how furnace geometry affects flame aerodynamics almost as much as the burner geometry itself. This will be done by comparing flames from similar NATCOM burners in different enclosures (A-Type and D-Type boilers). This demonstration will show the reader that efficient and clean operation of industrial boilers is highly dependant on the proper selection, setting and capabilities of the burners and that CFD simulations are a quick and cost effective way of designing and optimizing the operating performance of the unit prior to construction.",,"Combustion; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer simulation; Fuel burners; Software package Star-CD; Boiler firing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0343061081

Where soils are enriched in these elements, it is usually through the agricultural, industrial or urban activities of man, except for Se where high concentrations in soil are often derived from high-Se parent rock materials. The propensity for plants to accumulate and translocate these contaminants to edible and harvested parts depends largely on soil and climatic factors, plant genotype and agronomic management. Elevated As intake, especially of inorganic As, is most likely to arise from high-As drinking water than from ingestion of food. Cadmium and Se are of the greatest concern in terms of terrestrial food-chain contamination, with the former element receiving most attention. Worldwide, the probability of insufficient Se in the human diet exceeds that of toxicity, with deficiency usually associated with monotonous vegetarian diets in areas with Se-deficient soils. Excessive human intake of Cd is of concern as this element accumulates over a lifetime in the body, with impairment of kidney function being the main adverse effect. Cadmium inputs to soil in fertilizer, biosolids, soil amendments and atmospheric deposition often exceed outputs in crops and drainage waters, so that Cd concentrations in many agricultural soils are slowly increasing. However, evidence for increases in Cd concentrations in crops over time is contentious, as is the evidence for human health problems due to low-level Cd contamination of the food chain. Adverse health effects due to Cd intake have been manifest only in situations of gross soil contamination, with a predominantly rice-based diet, where soil-plant and plant-human transfer of Cd would have been enhanced. Human feeding studies have indicated that food Cd bioavailability is dependent on Fe nutrition, and animal studies have indicated that Zn, Ca, P and other elements and food constituents (e.g. fiber, phytate) affect Cd bioavailability. While plant breeding and agronomic management can minimize soil-plant transfer of Cd, and maximize concentrations of antagonists to Cd assimilation in humans, it remains important that inputs of this metal to soil be minimized.","Arsenic; Bioavailability; Cadmium; Contaminant; Lead; Mercury; Selenium",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033061611

Box 21, Derbyshire S44 6AB, Chesterfield, United Kingdom","The 13C/12C isotopic ratios for coal-derived polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from a number of processes encompassing low and high temperature carbonisation, gasification and combustion have been determined using gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (δ13C GC-IRMS). The results, in conjunction with those for PAHs released under controlled laboratory pyrolysis conditions, indicate that the primary control on the isotopic values of coal-derived PAHs is likely to be the extent of ring growth required to form PAHs during processing. Thus, for relatively mild conversion processes such as low temperature carbonisation where the major aromatics are alkyl substituted 2-3 ring PAHs, the isotopic signatures are similar to those of the parent coals (-24 to -25‰ for UK bituminous coals). However, the δ13C values for the PAHs become lighter in going to high temperature carbonisation (-25 to -27‰), gasification (-27 to -29‰ for old Town gas plants in the UK) and combustion (-29 to -31‰) as the extent of ring condensation increases and confirming that the PAHs are not released as primary volatiles. To demonstrate the potential of applying these differences to source apportion environmental PAHs where major inputs from coals can be expected, soil and vegetation samples taken close to a low temperature carbonisation plant (Bolsover, North Derbyshire) have been analysed. In addition to low temperature coal tar, significant inputs of PAHs from transport fuels, high temperature carbonisation and possibly combustion (coal/biomass) have been inferred from the isotopic ratios, taken in conjunction with the differences in alkyl substitution patterns.","Combustion; Gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry, Coal, Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, Carbonisation, Gasification","coal; PAH; provenance; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Carbon; Coal; Coal combustion; Condensation; Gas chromatography; Gasification; Low temperature coal carbonization; Mass spectrometry; Pyrolysis; High temperature carbonisation; Isotopic ratios; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Source apportionment; Analytical geochemistry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032589548

Since a facility is responsible for all PM emissions originating from that property, an increased emphasis will be placed on the regulation of fugitive PM sources, as well. Dispersion modeling is often used by State Air Pollution Regulatory Agencies (SAPRA's) in determining whether the contribution of particulate matter from a facility meets the NAAQS. As such, a facility may be granted or denied an operating permit based on the results obtained from a dispersion model. However, the model currently approved by EPA over-predicts downwind concentrations of PM by as much as ten fold. This results in the possibility that a facility is denied a permit when, in fact, its emissions are well within the NAAQS. Dispersion models that provide accurate estimations of downwind concentrations of pollutant from these fugitive sources are needed to ensure reliable and fair regulation of pollutant sources. The presently accepted Gaussian-based models use dispersion profiles that do not accurately describe dispersion of pollutants from ground-level sources and inaccurately apply time averages to calculated concentrations. A new model, the Fritz-Meister Model, is being developed that contains a dispersion profile in the vertical plane that more accurately reflects dispersion from ground-level releases. The new model also applies a new area integration algorithm and uses a shorter time increment to allow for variation in wind direction and velocity. The result is a model that more accurately predicts concentrations downwind of ground-level sources and gives the modeler a greater degree of flexibility when modeling different pollutant types.",,"air conditioning; conference (Beltwide Cotton); cotton; pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033394842

One method for estimating such emissions involves the use of the Landfill Air Emissions Estimation Model (LAEEM), which was developed and calibrated specifically for municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. There is concern about the applicability of LAEEM because the materials placed in industry landfills are considered to be different from those in MSW landfills; as a result, emissions will likely be lower than model predictions. This study examined the basis of LAEEM and its calibration, and explored alternative predictive approaches. The authors concluded that LAEEM, when defined in terms of the default AP-42 factors, does not accurately represent uncontrolled methane and HAP emissions from industry landfills. It does not account for the attenuating effects of biodegradation and adsorption, nor does it account for the potentially slower migration of landfill gas through a fully saturated landfill zone or the oxidation of methane migrating through landfill covers. With adjusted calibration factors that are based on field observations, LAEEM may provide more realistic estimates of methane and HAP emissions from industry landfills. Application: This paper examines the suitability of applying the LAEEM model and the AP-42 emission factors to the prediction of bulk gas and HAPs from pulp and paper landfills. This research will be of interest to those who wish to estimate pulp and paper industry landfill or greenhouse gas emissions.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347715164

Two distinct particle populations with significantly different spectral properties are found to be present in three of the six flares studied; the first population is trapped in the corona, where it encounters a ""thick-thin"" target, while the second population precipitates directly to the footpoints. In the remaining three events, a single population of energetic particles appear to be responsible for the observed hard X-ray emission, either via thermal bremsstrahlung (one case) or nonthermal thin-target emission (two cases). For the three events in which a trapped population is observed, the spectroscopic observations imply first that there is likely to be a single acceleration mechanism for both the trapped and the precipitating populations and second that the magnetic field geometry in these flares is conducive to trapping in a confined region high in the corona, above the soft X-ray loops. Both conditions are consistent with magnetic reconnection models of flares in which energetic particles are trapped between MHD slow-mode shocks attached to the reconnection region and a fast-mode shock formed by the reconnection outflow jet.","Acceleration of particles; Sun: corona; Sun: flares; Sun: X-rays, gamma rays",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033543340

Results of the parameterization compared to those of SCAPE are briefly presented, showing that it accurately represents the relevant processes with an almost three orders of magnitude reduction of CPU-time, depending on atmospheric conditions and aerosol composition.

In the present study Ech hydrogenase was purified to apparent homogeneity in a high yield. The enzyme preparation obtained only contained the six polypeptides which had previously been shown to be encoded by the ech operon. The purified enzyme was found to contain 0.9 mol of Ni, 11.3 of nonheme-iron and 10.8 mol of acid-labile sulfur per mol of enzyme. Using the purified enzyme the kinetic parameters were determined. The enzyme catalyzed the H2 dependent reduction of a M. barkeri 2[4Fe-4S] ferredoxin with a specific activity of 50 U·mg protein-1 at pH 7.0 and exhibited an apparent K(m) for the ferredoxin of 1 μM. The enzyme also catalyzed hydrogen formation with the reduced ferredoxin as electron donor at a rate of 90 U·mg protein-1 at pH 7.0. The apparent K(m) for the reduced ferredoxin was 7.5 μM. Reduction or oxidation of the ferredoxin proceeded at similar rates as the reduction or oxidation of oxidized or reduced methylviologen, respectively. The apparent K(m) for H2 was 5 μM. The kinetic data strongly indicate that the ferrodoxin is the physiological electron donor or acceptor of Ech hydrogenase. Ech hydrogenase amounts to about 3% of the total cell protein in acetate-grown, methanol-grown or H2/CO2-grown cells of M. barkeri, as calculated from quantitative Western blot experiments. The function of Ech hydrogenase is ascribed to ferredoxin-linked H2 production coupled to the oxidation of the carbonyl-group of acetyl-CoA to CO2 during growth on acetate, and to ferredoxin-linked H2 uptake coupled to the reduction of CO2 to the redox state of CO during growth on H2/CO2 or methanol.","Complex I; Energy conservation; Ferredoxin; Hydrogenase; Iron- sulfur protein; Methanosarcina barkeri","bacterial enzyme; ferredoxin; article; catalysis; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; enzyme kinetics; enzyme purification; methanosarcina barkeri; priority journal; reduction; Acetate-CoA Ligase; Acetates; Aldehyde Oxidoreductases; Archaeal Proteins; Carbon Dioxide; Dithionite; Ferredoxins; Hydrogen; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Iron; Metalloproteins; Methanol; Methanosarcina; Methanosarcina barkeri; Metronidazole; Models, Chemical; Multienzyme Complexes; Nickel; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidoreductases; Paraquat; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Methanosarcina barkeri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033214609

We explore the High-Resolution Terrestrial Biosphere Model as implemented in the Community Terrestrial Biosphere Model (HRBM/CTBM), the Frankfurt Biosphere Model (FBM), and the box-type biosphere of the Bern model. Storage by CO2 fertilization is described by combining analytical representations of (1) net primary productivity (NPP) as a function of atmospheric CO2 and (2) a decay impulse response function to characterize the timescales of biospheric carbon turnover. Storage in response to global warming is investigated for the HRBM/CTBM. The relation between the evolution of radiative forcing and climate change is expressed by a combination of impulse response functions and empirical orthogonal functions extracted from results of the European Center/Hamburg (ECHAM3) coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model. A box-type, differential-analogue substitute model is developed to represent global carbon storage of the HRBM/CTBM in response to regional changes in Temperature, Precepitation and cloud cover. The substitute models represent the spatially resolved models accurately and cost-efficiently for carbon sequestration in response to changes in CO2 or in CO2 and climate and for simulations of the global isotopic signals.

The steady-state and maximal rates of electron transport under a transient high CO2 concentration were monitored using chlorophyll fluorescence imaging. The decrease in electron transport rate induced by dehydration and ABA treatment almost reverted to the control rate under transient high CO2 availability. Therefore, inhibition of photosynthesis was mainly mediated through stomatal closure. However, since reversion was not complete, a metabolic inhibition was also identified as a decrease in the maximal electron transport rate driven by carboxylation. Under dehydration or ABA feeding, as under low ambient CO2 treatment, in 21% or 0.4% O2, the lower the steady-state electron transport was, the lower was the maximal electron transport rate during transient high CO2 availability. We conclude that low CO2 availability reduced the capacity of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) to drive electron transport. The potential contribution of Rubisco deactivation mediated by stomatal closure is discussed.","Abscisic acid; Electron transport; Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase; Rosa (photosynthesis, stress); Stomatal and metabolic inhibition; Water stress","Abscisic acid; carbon dioxide; carboxylation; chlorophyll; drought resistance; electron transfer; fluorescence; photosynthesis; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; steady state; Rosa rubiginosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033428832

Carbonic anhydrase II, catalysing the synthesis of bicarbonate within spermatozoa, must play a significant role in these mechanisms. We report here the expression of carbonic anhydrase II during mouse spermatogenesis and the primary structure of testicular transcripts coding for carbonic anhydrase II isolated from adult mouse and human testes. The mouse carbonic anhydrase II (Car2) mRNA displays a 5' untranslated region (UTR) larger than the corresponding somatic sequence. The additional 5' sequence contains the 'TATA box' used in somatic tissues and other promoter sequences, suggesting the use of testis-specific promoters further upstream with read-through of downstream promoters. The 3'UTR of the Car2 mRNA is shorter in mature testicular cells than in somatic cells. Polysomal gradient analysis of carbonic anhydrase II transcripts isolated from adult mouse testis and kidney revealed different translation potential: most of the testicular transcripts were present in the non-polysomal fractions, whereas a considerable fraction of kidney transcripts were polysome-associated. These results suggest that specific transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms regulate the expression of carbonic anhydrase II during mammalian spermatogenesis.","5' untranslated mRNA; Polysomes; Spermatogenesis; TATA box","bicarbonate; carbonate dehydratase II; acrosome reaction; animal cell; animal experiment; article; catalysis; enzyme activity; gene sequence; gene structure; male; mouse; nonhuman; polysome; priority journal; promoter region; spermatogenesis; spermatozoon motility; TATA box; Animalia; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033005240

Two warm, dry periods of 150- and 200-yr duration occurred during AD 900-1350, which were followed by anomalously cold climates, known as the Little Ice Age, that lasted from AD 1400 to 1900. Climate in the last century has been significantly warmer. Regional biotic and physical response to these climatic periods occurred. Climate variability presents challenges when interpreting historical variability, including the need to accommodate climate effects when comparing current ecosystems to historical conditions, especially if comparisons are done to evaluate causes (e.g., human impacts) of differences, or to develop models for restoration of current ecosystems. Many historical studies focus on 'presettlement' periods, which usually fall within the Little Ice Age. Thus, it should be assumed that ecosystems inferred for these historical periods responded to different climates than those at present, and management implications should be adjusted accordingly. The warmer centuries before the Little Ice Age may be a more appropriate analogue to the present, although no historic period is likely to be better as a model than an understanding of what conditions would be at present without intervention. Understanding the climate context of historical reconstruction studies, and adjusting implications to the present, should strengthen the value of historical variability research to management.","Climate change; Forest management; Historical variation; Natural variability; Paleoecology; Use in ecosystem management","climate change; historical ecology; paleoclimate; temporal variation; Nevada; Sierra Nevada; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032742352

This hypothesis has, however, limited quantitative support. There are few studies of fire history in the sagebrush steppe and none that examine the chronosequence of changes in mean fire intervals, introduction of livestock, and coincident climatic conditions with the initiation of postsettlement juniper expansion. This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the postsettlement expansion of juniper was synchronous with the introduction of domestic livestock, reduction in fire frequency, and optimal climate conditions for plant growth. We documented the fire history and western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis Hook.) woodland chronology for a sagebrush steppe in a 5,000 ha watershed in south central Oregon. Regional tree ring data were used as proxy data for presettlement climatic conditions. Western juniper age distribution was determined by coring trees across the study area. Fire history was constructed from several small clusters of presettlement ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) scattered across the study area. Samples were crossdated to determine fire occurrence to the calendar year. Mean fire intervals were computed for each cluster based on cumulative fire history of each tree sampled within the cluster. Fire events in low sagebrush (Artemisia arbuscula Nutt.) were documented by determining death dates of firekilled western juniper trees. Records dating the introduction and buildup of livestock during the late 1800s and dates of initial fire suppression were summarized. Western juniper expansion began between 1875 and 1885, with peak expansion rates occurring between 1905 and 1925. The fire record spans 1601 to 1996. Before 1897, mean fire intervals within individual clusters ranged from 12 to 15 years with years between fires varying between 3 to 28. Nearly one third of the fires in the basin were large and usually proceeded by one year of above-average tree ring growth. Two fire events were recorded in the sparsely vegetated low sagebrush site, 1717 and 1855. The last large fire occurred in the study area in 1870 and the last small fire in 1897. The time sequence of wet climatic conditions between 1870 and 1915, introduction of livestock, and the reduced role of fire support the hypothesis that these factors contributed to the postsettlement expansion of western juniper.","Artemisia; Juniperus occidentalis; Succession; Woodland","fire history; historical ecology; livestock farming; steppe; succession; Oregon; United States; Artemisia; Artemisia arbuscula; Artemisia arbuscula; Artemisia tridentata; Juniperus; Juniperus occidentalis; Juniperus occidentalis; Pinus ponderosa; Pinus ponderosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032728967

Other threats include beach erosion, saltwater intrusion, and impacts on the infrastructure and coastal society.

It is shown, that small differences in measured C(T) and A(T) (found between our data and those measured during GEOSECS) and different calculation approaches to the CO2 system (different dissociation constants for species involved and taking into account phosphate and silicate concentrations) can produce pronounced differences in the calculated saturation depths. However, C(T) and A(T) data suggest substantial dissolution of biogenic carbonate in the water column even above the calcite lysocline, irrespective of the procedures followed to calculate this horizon.","Calcite solution; Carbon dioxide; Denitrification; Indian Ocean; Monsoon","carbon cycle; carbonic acid; denitrification; Indian Ocean; marine environment; oxygen consumption; phosphate; silicate; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; monsoon; Indian Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344097291

These vehicles are being developed by the Partnership for a New Generation of Vehicles (PNGV). Eleven fuels were considered: reformulated gasoline (RFG), reformulated diesel (RFD), methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), biodiesel, Fischer-Tropsch diesel and hydrogen. RFG, methanol, ethanol, LPG, CNG and LNG were assumed to be burned in spark-ignition, direct-injection (SIDI) engines. RFD, Fischer-Tropsch diesel, biodiesel and dimethyl ether were assumed to be burned in compression-ignition, direct-injection (CIDI) engines. Hydrogen, RFG and methanol were assumed to be used in fuel-cell vehicles. Impacts were analyzed under alternative scenarios of potential 3X vehicle market penetration. Profiles of 3X and conventional vehicle stocks were then used to estimate fuel supply requirements and emissions produced by all light-duty vehicles (both 3X and conventional) expected to be on the road in each year of the analysis. Energy consumption, and emissions of criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases were estimated for upstream fuel processing/production as well as for vehicle operation. Emissions of criteria pollutants were further disaggregated into urban and nonurban components. Results show that the fuel efficiency gain by 3X vehicles translates directly into reductions in total energy demand, fossil energy demand, and greenhouse gas (primarily CO2) emissions. The combination of fuel substitution and fuel efficiency results in substantial petroleum displacement and large reductions in urban emissions of volatile organic compounds and sulfur oxide for all propulsion system/fuel alternatives considered. Although urban emissions of particulate matter smaller than 10 μ m increase for CIDI engines operating on RFD, biodiesel, and Fischer-Tropsch diesel, such increases do not occur for CIDI engines operating on dimethyl ether. Fuel-cell vehicles produce large reductions in urban emissions of nitrogen oxide and carbon moNOxide; compression-ignition engines operating on RFD, dimethyl ether, Fischer-Tropsch diesel or biodiesel also yield ubstantial reductions in urban emissions of carbon moNOxide.

Methods: The study was conducted on 50 periodontally involved single rooted human teeth with poor prognosis. Immediately after extraction the teeth were scaled and root planed with Gracey curets; 50 specimens were obtained from the proximal side of each tooth which were assigned randomly to 1 of the 4 groups. Group A (35 specimens) was divided into 7 subgroups of 5 specimens each and irradiated with CO2 laser using a defocused mode at 3-watt power for 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, or 1.4 seconds, respectively. Groups B, C, and D (5 specimens each) were treated with 6% hydrogen peroxide, EDTA solution (pH 7.4), or saturated citric acid solution (pH 1), respectively for 3 minutes. The specimens were then fixed and scanned using SEM. Results: It was observed that surface smear layer was present on root surfaces of teeth that were root planed; the CO2 laser was not able to remove the smear layer on the sites that were irradiated for 0.2, 0.4 or 0.6 seconds at 3W power. Irradiation time of 0.8 seconds at 3W power was able to remove the smear layer, but the dentinal tubules were partially exposed. The surface irradiated for 1 second showed a flat appearance with many clear orifice of dentinal tubules. No change in diameter of exposed dentinal tubules was observed and their diameter was nearly equal that of normal dentinal tubules. Irradiation time of 1.2 and 1.4 seconds produced surface charring and carbonization and was totally ineffective in exposing the dentinal tubules; 6% hydrogen peroxide did not remove the smear layer completely and the exposed dentinal tubules orifice was not clear. EDTA (pH 7.4) and citric acid (pH 1) were found to be effective in removing the smear layer and exposing the dentinal tubules, which showed funnel shaped widening. Conclusions: Surface smear layer was present on root surfaces of teeth that were root planed. Laser irradiation of 1 second at 3W completely removed the smear layer with minimal change in the diameter of the dentinal tubules. EDTA and citric acid were also effective in removing smear layer, but the exposed dentinal tubules showed funnel-shaped widening.","Citric acid/therapeutic use; Comparison studies; EDTA/therapeutic use; Lasers/therapeutic use; Smear layer; Tooth root","carbon dioxide; chelating agent; citric acid; edetic acid; hydrogen peroxide; topical antiinfective agent; article; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; dental surgery; dentin; drug effect; human; instrumentation; laser; pathology; periodontal disease; periodontics; preventive dentistry; radiation exposure; randomized controlled trial; scanning electron microscopy; time; tooth root; ultrastructure; Anti-Infective Agents, Local; Carbon Dioxide; Chelating Agents; Citric Acid; Dental Scaling; Dentin; Edetic Acid; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Lasers; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Periodontal Diseases; Root Planing; Smear Layer; Subgingival Curettage; Time Factors; Tooth Root",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033192753

Four alternative fuel injector geometries were explored, three of which have lobed shapes. These lobed injectors mix fuel and air and strain species interfaces to differing extents due to streamwise vorticity generation, thus creating different local or core equivalence ratios within flow regions upstream of flame ignition and stabilization. Prior experimental studies of two of these lobed injector flowflelds focused on non-reactive mixing characteristics (Smith, et al.) and emissions measurements (Mitchell, et al.) for the case where air speeds were matched above and below the fuel injector, effectively generating stronger streamwise vorticity than spanwise vorticity. The present studies examine the effects of airstream mismatch (and hence additional spanwise vorticity generation), effects of confinement of the crossflow to reduce the local equivalence ratio, and the effects of altering the geometry and position of the flameholders.

Changes in the near-surface ocean are essentially coincident with the Bølling-Allerød and Younger-Dryas climate oscillations observed in Greenland ice cores and North Atlantic sediments. This finding supports the concept of atmospheric transmission of climate signals between oceans within the Northern Hemisphere. Abrupt cooling of North Pacific surface waters occurred in mid-Holocene time, indicating that the warm events of the early Holocene and deglaciation are anomalous relative to modern climate. Higher export productivity is associated with warm events in the North Pacific. These biotic changes may have contributed to variations in the shallow (˜400 m depth) oxygen minimum zone off California, and may in part explain the apparent coincidence of local anoxia with warming in Greenland. Benthic foraminiferal δ13C and14C data from lower intermediate waters (980 m depth) suggests that higher ventilation (either faster formation or greater gas exchange) occurred during the Bølling-Allerød and early Holocene warm events. Synchronicity with surface ocean changes points to North Pacific source waters, and ventilation during warming leads to a hypothesis that salinity rather than temperature controls intermediate water formation at these times. In the deep North Pacific (2700 m depth) benthic foraminiferal δ18O changes imply early warming roughly synchronous with warming of the Southern Ocean. Both δ13C and14C suggest an abyssal ventilation event (either faster formation or greater gas exchange) during deglaciation at the same time as short-term cooling in Antarctica, pointing to a Southern Ocean source of variability in the deep Pacific. Thus, climate changes that characterize both northern and southern sources appear to propagate through the Pacific Ocean. © 1999 by the American Geophysical Union.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0008399046

High-density plasmas of 1012-1013cm-3 were produced even in pure N2 by using a helical antenna with an azimuthal mode number of m=0. The helicon-wave-excited plasmas have been investigated by wave-magnetic-field measurements and optical emission spectroscopy. The plasma density achieved in 0.26Pa nitrogen was 4×1012cm-3 at a radio frequency (RF) power of ~3kW and a static magnetic field strength of ~1000Gauss. The wave-magnetic-field measurements confirmed excitation of the m=0 mode helicon wave to propagate in the plasmas at the onset of attaining the high-density mode. Significant enhancement of line emissions of atomic nitrogen (NI) and nitrogen ions (NII) was observed in the helicon-wave-excited plasma, whereas the optical emission spectra in the induction mode were dominated by those from the molecular bands of nitrogen. Carbon nitride films have been deposited on a Si(100) substrate by using reactive sputtering of a cylindrical carbon target with the wave-excited high-density plasmas in N2 and N2+Ar mixtures at around 0.1Pa. Compositional and structural characterization of the CN films was performed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS), showing that the N/C ratio in the CN films could be controlled up to 1.3. Chemical and structural analysis by XPS has been performed. The XPS analysis showed the existence of peaks indicating a C-C bond and two C-N bonds where nitrogen is bonded to carbon atoms in sp2- and sp3-hybridized states.

The observations were taken by the AANDERA Automatic Weather Station (AWS) at Baruunkharaa (48°55′N, 106°4′E) in northern Mongolia. This location is the center of the source region of the Siberian high, which is a major center of action for the winter climate and atmospheric circulation over the Eurasian Continent. Abrupt changes of air temperature and specific humidity were detected during the course of seasonal change from October 1993 to September 1994. The annual cycle was divided into four seasons, based on the timing of these abrupt changes: i.e., winter (mid-November to early March:), spring (mid-March to early June), summer (mid-June to later August) and autumn (early September to early November). Over several days in mid-November the air temperature decreased about 20°C, concurrent with an increase in the albedo from 0.5 to 0.9. A coreless winter was characterized by a near constant air temperature of about -15°C or less, along with a high albedo of more than 0.5: i.e., continuous snow cover except for the period from mid-February to early March. Winter ended with a sudden increase of air temperature of about 20°C during several days in mid-March. Spring was characterized by the development of the daytime mixed layer, as suggested from the afternoon decrease of specific humidity. An abrupt increase of specific humidity of about 5 gkg-1 - which occurred in mid-J une - coincided with the onset of the summer season. During summer, the daytime increase of specific humidity attained its annual maximum, this is likely due to strong evaporation from the surface. In early September, the specific humidity dropped by about, 5 gkg-1 over a period of several days. The characteristics of the autumn onset, were nearly the same as spring, except for the absence of afternoon decrease in specific humidity, which implied that the diurnal growth of the mixed layer was not strong enough to create a strong entrainment.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033114383

Transgenic flies were generated by microinjection and subsequent mobilization of a P element construct containing the genomic glutathione reductase gene of Drosophila, with 4 kb upstream and 1.5 kb downstream of the coding region. Transgenic animals stably overexpressed glutathione reductase by up to 100% throughout adult life and under continuous exposure to 100% oxygen or air. Under hyperoxic conditions, overexpressors had increased longevity, decreased accrual of protein carbonyls, and dramatically increased survival rates after recovery from a semi-lethal dose of 100% oxygen. Under normoxic conditions, overexpression of glutathione reductase had no effect on longevity, protein carbonyl content, reduced glutathione, or glutathione disulfide content, although the total consumption of oxygen was slightly decreased.

These platinum group elements (PGE) are the main active components of catalytic converters and they are mainly released as a result of surface abrasion of the catalyst during car operation. The present work reports the procedure employed for sampling, mineralization and determination of PGE by quadrupole ICP-MS in three different types of catalysts. Whole raw exhaust fumes were collected directly from the end of the exhaust pipe following the 91441 extra urban drive cycle (EUDC) using a newly developed sampling device. The sampling procedure allows the further differentiation between a soluble and particulate (insoluble) sample fraction. The release of pollutants such as Hf, Cu, Y, Rb, Sr and Pb present in the catalyst washcoat or in the fuel was also monitored since these elements cause spectral interferences in the determination of PGE. These spectral interferences, 179Hf16O+ on 195Pt, 40Ar65Cu+ and 89Y16O+ on 105Pd and 40Ar63Cu+, 87Rb16O+, 87Sr16O+ and 206Pb2+ on 103Rh, were considered and mathematically corrected. The sampling procedure was applied to quantify the PGE released from two different types of fresh gasoline catalyst (Pt/Pd/Rh and Pd/Rh), a diesel catalyst (Pt only) and a 18 000 km aged Pt/Pd/Rh gasoline catalyst. Most of the released PGE is in particulate form (Pt&gt;95%, Pd&gt;85% and Rh&gt;90%). Release was found to vary from catalyst to catalyst and between samples of the same catalyst. The determination of PGE in the exhaust fumes shows that they are released at the ng km-1 level.",,"Catalysts; Gasoline; Mass spectrometry; Palladium; Plasma applications; Platinum; Rhodium; Inductively-coupled plasmas (ICP); Exhaust gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345580660

To better understand why U.S. environmental managers yield to incremental approaches, the article examines the experience of European Union (EU) with experimental initiatives, such as voluntary agreements and mandatory integrated permits. In contrast to the American experience, some European countries are not only setting long-term sustainability goals, but also are taking steps to attain them.

In the U.S.A. alone from 1970 to 1992 the CO 2 emissions have increased from 5.5 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide to 6.6 bmt. The transportation industry contributes currently (1991 figures) 24.7% of the total emissions from the United States. Transportation utilization has grown faster, however, but more efficient vehicles allow for more travel without increasing the CO2 proportionally. The advancements made in the 1980s have reduced emissions by 21 million tons of CO2 per year on average. Electric Vehicles have been a proposed method of reducing the CO2 emissions due to transportation. Electric vehicles produce no emissions while driving, making them ideal candidates for heavily polluted and concentrated areas such as urban locations. However, it is debatable if electric vehicles are feasible on the global scale of CO 2 reduction. This study compares the amount of emissions produced charging the electric vehicles with the amount of emissions produced by operating a conventional vehicle for equivalent usage. Conclusions are drawn about the advantages and the emissions reductions (if any) that are found by electric vehicle usage.

We focused on the valine 103 residue located in front of the cavity. Nine mutants, in which valine 103 was substituted with alanine, 2-aminobutyric acid, norvaline, norleucine, leucine, isoleucine, allo-isoleucine, cyclohexylglycine, and cyclohexylalanine, were chemically synthesized and analyzed. These mutants provided a wide distribution of sizes which ranged from forming additional cavity space to filling and overflowing the cavity space. Temperature-scanning circular dichroism measurements and differential scanning calorimetry revealed a linear relationship between the van't Hoff enthalpy and the thermal transition temperature for the cavity-filling mutations. On the other hand, the mutants with side-chains larger than the side-chain of leucine resulted in a relatively low transition enthalpy and temperature, most likely due to the exposure of the side-chain to solvent and the increase in the entropy of the folded states. Branching at the β-carbon atom reduced the unfolding free energy due to the steric constraint in the cavity. In particular, the mutational elongation of the side-chain from β-carbon to the trans-to-CO direction proved to be more hindered than that from β-carbon to the trans-to-NH. The unfolding free energy versus side-chain volume formed a bell-shaped plot with a maximum free energy for the leucine mutant. The difference in the transition free energy for cavity-filling mutants with β-unbranched side-chains were two to four times larger than the difference in the transfer energy from organic solvent to water. Therefore, the increase in unfolding free energy would most likely be attributed to van der Waals interactions in the cavity wall, which would be a origin of stabilization by the sliding of tryptophan 95 into the cavity upon DNA binding.","c-Myb DNA-binding domain; Cavity; Mutation; Non-natural amino acid; Thermodynamics","2 aminobutyric acid; alanine; alanine derivative; DNA binding protein; glycine derivative; isoleucine; leucine; mutant protein; norleucine; norvaline; oncoprotein; valine; amino acid substitution; article; binding site; circular dichroism; differential scanning calorimetry; enthalpy; priority journal; protein denaturation; spectroscopy; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033214183

For the lowest band, the ratio of the maximum to the minimum of the LDOS is shown to diverge as (ωc - ω)-1 as ω approaches the band edge.

The evaluation was conducted using a matrix of a single base fuel combined with two inlet system detergent additives; one prepared using a synthetic fluidiser base and one a mineral oil fluidiser base. In addition a mineral and a synthetic based crank case lubricant were evaluated with clear base fuel only. Engine inlet and exhaust valve deposits and combustion chamber deposits were measured along with regulated emissions, fuel economy and injector fouling. Methods of measuring and evaluating deposit build up in the inlet and exhaust system and combustion chamber were constructed by developing existing Coordinating European Council (CEC) test methods and in house derived test methods and protocols. The findings of this single car road trial are generally out of line with existing and established evidence of the behaviour of these products when tested in existing carburettor and port fuel injected engine technologies. The deposit mass accumulation within the inlet system and on the inlet valves was not reduced by the inclusion of an inlet system detergent additive into the base fuel. Also data suggests that inlet valve, combustion chamber and exhaust valve deposits can be increased with the use of a gasoline detergent package, whereas the synthetic inlet system detergent additive did not contribute to adverse piston crown deposits. The use of a synthetic lubricant did provide a reduction in deposit growth with reduced piston crown, bore ring reversal and piston bowl deposits, whereas combustion chamber squish face deposits were increased. Inlet valve deposits, although of similar weight to the synthetic fuel additive phase, were wet and fluid in nature and exhibited poor structural integrity. This study has highlighted that the fuel and lubricant requirements of the Mitsubishi G-DI gasoline engine, with respect to control of inlet system, exhaust system and combustion chamber deposits are significantly different to those that are typically used in port fuel injection (PFI) and carburettor spark ignition engines. Test methods are therefore required to evaluate fuel and lubricant performance in this emerging technology.

Mass-spectrometer detection of radicals is then essentially impossible because the mass-spectrometric signature of a radical is nearly identical to that of the parent. A new method for overcoming this difficulty has been demonstrated. This scheme is based upon the means by which radicals were first detected and involves the propensity for radicals to react with tellurium to produce volatile tellurides. A mass spectrometer can detect the tellurides thus produced in a region of the mass spectrum far removed from that of the radical's precursor. This technique has been used in analyses for CH3, CF3, CF2H, CFH3, C2F5, and F at partial pressures as low as 2 X 10-8 Torr in the presence of the parent hydrofluorocarbons at five orders of magnitude greater pressures. Possible interferences by the neutral precursor, by ions, and by the products of reactions on the tellurium surface have been investigated.",,"fluorine; free radical; methane; organofluorine derivative; tellurium; analytic method; article; mass spectrometer; mass spectrometry; pressure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032772001

It was found that none of the T1←S0 bands in the CRD spectrum appears in the excitation spectrum, indicating that the T1 thiophosgene decays almost exclusively by the nonradiative T1 →S0 intersystem crossing (ISC). An estimation of the T1 nonradiative lifetime was made using the T1-S0 spin-orbit coupling and the Franck-Condon factors for the T1→S0 ISC based on the ab initio equilibrium structures and vibrational frequencies for the T1 and S0 states, computed at the MP2/6-31G(d,p) and MP4/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. The nonradiative life, calculated as the 1/e of the survival probability, is approximately 20 ps for barrier heights of 770-845 cm-1 and out-of-plane angles of 32.07°-32.69°. (The thiophosgene adopts a pyramidal conformation with the C=S bond bent from the ClCCl plane by about 32°.) The computed lifetime is comparable to the lower-limit lifetime of ∼50 ps obtained from the quantum yields ΦP≤10-3ΦF with ΦF≈1.0 and the measured S1 fluorescence lifetime of 4 μs. The short T1 nonradiative lifetime of thiophosgene can be attributed to the large matrix elements of the T1-S0 spin-orbit coupling (V=150cm-1) and the strong out-of-plane deformation of the T1 state relative to the planar S0 state, that provides the large Franck-Condon factors for the T1→S0 ISC. It is proposed that a similar pyramidal deformation is also responsible for the absence of phosphorescence from T1 thiocyclobutanone. Consistent with this supposition, T1 cyclopentanone, which is nearly planar at the thiocarbonyl carbon center, exhibits strong phosphorescence under similar experimental conditions. © 1999 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001217819

H3A 2A7, Canada","The Upper Devonian Rimbey-Meadowbrook reef trend is an extensive subsurface carbonate aquifer system in the southern part of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin and is compared with Swan Hills, Leduc and Wabamun carbonates of west-central Alberta. These Devonian levels are part of a structural homocline that crops out near its northeastern end and stretches for several hundred kilometers southwestward into the deepest part of the basin. Most Devonian carbonates are pervasively dolomitized into grey matrix dolomite, which commonly comprises about 85-90 vol % of the rocks. Despite its large regional extent and subsurface depths (0 to 6500 m), the Rimbey-Meadowbrook reef trend displays little if any systematic variations in petrography or geochemistry. Stratigraphie, petrographic and geochemical evidence suggest that the grey matrix dolomite formed at depths of about 500-1500 m from marine pore waters with relatively minor modification by water-rock interaction. Volumetrically minor amounts of calcite and dolomite cements, replacive and cement anhydrite, and elemental sulfur and hydrocarbons fill some of the remaining porosity. The volumetrically minor intermediate burial (&gt;600-1500 m) dolomite cements and deep burial saddle dolomite and calcite cements occur as coarse-crystalline spars in secondary porosity. Intermediate burial dolomite cements display a slight decrease down the reef trend in δ18O values (-4 to -7 ‰ PDB) with increasing depth that correspond to slightly elevated 87Sr/86Sr ratios. Fluid inclusions of these dolomite cements are highly saline and have relatively uniform homogenization temperatures (122 to 131 °C), suggesting that they formed from relatively hot fluids before significant basin tilting. Deep burial (&gt;2000-3000 m) saddle dolomites are rare in the Rimbey-Meadowbrook reef trend and the available fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures increase with burial, suggesting that they precipitated under normal geothermal gradients after significant tectonic tilting. The calcites fall into two groups, a relatively early and a relatively late group. The relatively early calcites follow a 30 °C/km geothermal gradient when corrected for pressure, whereas the later calcites that formed as a by-product of thermochemical sulfate reduction follow a 20 to 25 °C/km gradient and may reflect cooler post-Laramide conditions. The deep basin of west-central Alberta includes the Obed, Kaybob South, Fox Creek, Pine Creek and Simonette fields from the Swan Hills, Leduc and Wabamun stratigraphic levels. Replacement matrix dolomites in all three stratigraphic levels are similar in terms of textures, trace elements and C, O and Sr isotopes, and to those of the Rimbey-Meadowbrook reef trend. In addition, fault-controlled, late-stage burial dolomitization is evident in the Swan Hills, Kaybob South and Simonette buildups, and in the Wabamun Pine Creek Field. Homogenization temperatures from fluid inclusions in saddle dolomites range from about 127 to 167 °C and late calcites have similar Th ranges from 124 to 164 °C. Temperatures for anhydrite are cooler, ranging from 104 to 116 °C, and suggest secondary alteration of inclusions at present reservoir temperatures and/or that some anhydrite was remobilized at somewhat cooler conditions after maximum burial. Downdip to the southwest in the Obed buildup, deep burial calcite cements in fractures and vugs have highly radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr ratios (0.7252) and highly depleted δ13C values (minimum -27.1 ‰ PDB), indicating incorporation of oxidized carbon from Thermochemical Sulphate Reduction (TSR). In other buildups, δ13C values of late calcite cements are not as depleted in their carbon isotopic values (0.9 to -10 ‰ PDB). Radiogenic Sr occurs updip to the northeast in saddle dolomite and calcite cements (Swan Hills, Kaybob South 0.7221, 0.7310; Simonette 0.7370, 0.7369; Leduc Pine Creek 0.7140, 0.7195; Wabamun Pine Creek 0.7150, 0.7188). The radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr signal appears to be derived from fluids that had interacted with the crystalline basement and/or overlying Proterozoic/Lower Cambrian elastics. It is possible that at least some radiogenic Sr was injected into the Devonian section by tectonic loading during the Laramide Orogeny. The Rimbey-Meadowbrook reef trend and the Devonian carbonates in the west-central Alberta deep basin are similar in terms of overall diagenetic phases and their characteristics. The late-stage cements exhibit somewhat higher temperatures in the deep basin of west-central Alberta. The regions differ mainly in radiogenic Sr with all west-central Alberta late-stage dolomite and calcite cements being more radiogenic, especially along established or inferred faults as in Kaybob South, Swan Hills Simonette and Wabamun Pine Creek fields. The west-central Alberta calcites also contain lighter δ13C (-3.5 to -10.0 ‰ PDB) and even lower (0 to -27 ‰) in some high sour gas fields like Obed.",,"burial (geology); carbonate; cement; Devonian; dolomite; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040964909

Acute sediment toxicity was measured by performing the Microtox® bioassay 100% Test on elutriates from wet sediment samples collected from experimental plots in the study area. Samples were collected over a seven-month period following the spill. Toxic responses were examined for spatial and temporal relationships within the cove and compared to total extractable materials (TEM), total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH), and GC-MS quantified total saturates and aromatics and target polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Sediment toxicity was elevated near the mouth of the study cove and decreased rapidly with time. Acute toxicity was correlated with TPH and GC-MS quantified saturate concentrations.

The rapid decrease in sediment toxicity corresponded with a rapid decrease in oil levels suggesting that the intrinsic recovery of the site was due to acclimated populations of hydrocarbon-degrading microrganisms. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Intrinsic recovery; Microtox; Petroleum; Sediment toxicity; Wetland","Aromatization; Crude oil; Floods; Gasoline; Sediments; Toxicity; Wetlands; Estuarine wetlands; Experimental plots; Houston , Texas; Microtox; Sediment toxicity; Temporal relationships; Total petroleum hydrocarbons; Toxic response; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; fresh water; petroleum; petroleum derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; estuarine sediment; petroleum; sediment pollution; toxicity; acute toxicity; article; oil spill; pipeline; sediment; time; United States; water pollution; Houston; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033172664

Pre-radiotherapy SPECT (n=104) and PET (n=35) images were available to the clinician to assist in radiation field design for patients with bronchogenic cancer. The SPECT and PET scans were registered with anatomic information derived from CT. The information from SPECT and PET provides the treatment planner with functional data not seen with CT. SPECT yields three-dimensional (3D) lung perfusion maps. PET provides 3D metabolic images that assist in tumor localization. The impact of the nuclear medicine images on the treatment planning process was assessed by determining the frequency, type, and extent of changes to plans. Pre-radiotherapy SPECT scans were used to modify 11 (11%) treatment plans; primarily altering beam angles to avoid highly functioning tissue. Fifty (48%) SPECT datasets were judged to be 'potentially useful' due to the detection of hypoperfused regions of the lungs, but were not used during treatment planning. PET data influenced 34% (12 of 35) of the treatment plans examined, and resulted in enlarging portions of the beam aperture (margins) up to 15 mm. Challenges associated with image quality and registration arise when utilizing nuclear medicine data in the treatment planning process. Initial implementation of advanced SPECT image reconstruction techniques that are not typically used in the clinic suggests that the reconstruction method may influence dose response data derived from the SPECT images and improve image registration with CT. The use of nuclear medicine transmission computed tomography (TCT) for both SPECT and PET is presented as a possible tool to reconstruct more accurate emission images and to aid in the registration of emission data with the planning CT. Nuclear medicine imaging techniques appear to be a potentially valuable tool during radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with lung cancer. The utilization of accurate nuclear medicine image reconstruction techniques and TCT may improve the treatment planning process.

This paper examines the influence of eleven previously proposed models for the environment on the absolute values of the exergy and on the exergetic efficiencies, associated with the operation of three different power plants: a methane cogeneration plant, a coal-fired plant, and a dual-flash geothermal power plant. It is observed that although there are some common characteristics in most of the values obtained from all the models, the absolute exergies and exergetic efficiencies calculated using some of these models deviate substantially from those obtained with the others.

An agricultural production model is combined with an analysis of motor-vehicle emissions and air quality to estimate the impacts of emissions from six different motor-vehicle classes, at both the regional and national level.

Gas exchange, fluorescence characteristics, and leaf biochemistry of ambient CO2 (control) needles and ambient + 20 Pa CO2 (elevated) needles were examined five times during the year. The enhancement of photosynthesis by elevated CO2 in mature loblolly pine trees varied across the season and was influenced by abiotic and biotic factors. Photosynthetic enhancement by elevated CO2 was strongly correlated with leaf temperature. The magnitude of photosynthetic enhancement was zero in March but was as great as 52% later in the season. In March, reduced sink demand and lower temperatures resulted in lower net photosynthesis, lower carboxylation rates and higher excess energy dissipation from the elevated CO2 needles than from control needles. The greatest photosynthetic enhancement by CO2 enrichment was observed in July during a period of high temperature and low precipitation, and in September during recovery from this period of low precipitation. In July, loblolly pine trees in the control rings exhibited lower net photosynthetic rates, lower maximum rates of photosynthesis at saturating CO2 and light, lower values of carboxylation and electron transport rates (modelled from A-C(i) curves), lower total Rubisco activity, and lower photochemical quenching of fluorescence in comparison to other measurement periods.

This reduction is a key branch point that determines the metabolite flow into the separate alkaloid groups, each with different stereospecific configurations. In this study, a specific antibody was prepared for each of the TRs by immunizing mice with recombinant TR protein and subsequent immuno-affinity purification of the antiserum. Immuno-blot analyses revealed that accumulation of both TRs was highest in the lateral roots of Hyoscyamus niger throughout its development. In cultured roots, TR proteins were accumulated in a basal region but not in root apex. These patterns were similar to that of hyoscyamine 6β-hydroxylase (H6H), an enzyme that catalyzes a downstream step in the same biosynthetic pathway. However, an immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the two TRs and H6H were accumulated with different cell-specific patterns in the cultured root, suggesting transportation of the alkaloid intermediate(s) across the different cell layers.","Hyoscyamus niger; Immunohistochemistry; Stereospecificity; Tropane alkaloids; Tropinone reductases (EC 1.1.1.206 and EC 1.1.1.236)","antibody specificity; biochemical pathway; catalysis; enzyme localization; enzymic reduction; hyoscyamus niger; hyoscymine 6beta hydroxylase; immunization; immunoaffinity chromatography; immunoanalysis; protein purification; protein transport; recombinant protein; rooting; stereospecificity; tropinone; tropinone reductase; Western blotting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033227533

Petrographic observations prior to noble-gas analyses showed that the two meteorite slices are entirely composed of chondrules, PCPs (poorly characterized phases) and other chondritic components that are rimmed by layers of fine-grained dust. Based on an existing classification scheme for texture of CM chondrites, the two samples are classified as primary accretionary rocks (PARs). The noble gas analyses showed that primordial noble gases are rich in the fine-grained rims around chondrules in the two meteorite slices. This suggests that large amounts of carrier phases of the primordial noble gases in CM chondrites are located in these rims which seem to have accreted on the surfaces of chondrules prior to the formation of the meteorite parent bodies. Rims on different chondrules within a given meteoric showed similar concentrations of heavy primordial noble gases, suggesting that phase Q is distributed homogeneously in the rims and possibly in the nebular region where the chondrules had acquired their dust rims. (20Ne)(diamond)/(20Ne)(Q) ratios are relatively constant among rims in a given meteorite, indicative of homogeneous mixing of interstellar diamonds and phase Q on a 10 μg scale. One location in a rim around a chondrule in the Murchison sample showed an enrichment of 22Ne, which suggests presence of carrier phases of Ne-E in the rim. A stepped heating analysis of a chip of Y-791198 was carried out to characterize the noble gases of bulk PAR. Abundances of primordial noble gases are only ~50% of those of rims around chondrules, consistent with the relative abundances of gas-rich fine-grained material and gas-poor chondrules and inclusions in PAR. Solar gases were not detected, which implies that PARs, the primitive CM bodies, had grown to at least centimeter size in a dense solar nebula which shielded these objects from direct exposure to solar wind.",,"carbonaceous chondrite; chondrite; meteorite; noble gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032790531

In monoculture pots of a C3 or a C4 plant species, spore δ13C values were ca. 3.5‰ lower than those of host roots. In coculture pots of a C3 and a C4 plant species, spore δ13C values varied between those of the roots of C3 and C4 plants, and increased linearly from the C3 to the proximity of the C4 plant (P&lt;0.01). This reflects the higher δ13C values in C4 plants than in C3 plants. Thus the carbon origin of G. margarita spores changed with growth state and combination of host plants. In the presence of fresh plant residue instead of living host plants, spore δ13C values did not vary with distance from the residue.

The purified enzyme was very unstable but was stabilized by low concentrations of various detergents such as Tween 40. The enzyme was a monomeric protein with the native molecular weight of 41,000 ± 1,600. The enzyme showed a single absorption peak at 280 nm (E(1%) = 10.0). PL and 2- nitrobenzaldehyde were excellent substrates, and no measurable activity was observed with short chain aliphatic aldehydes; substrate specificity of PL reductase was obviously different from those of yeast aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) so far purified. The peptide sequences of PL reductase were identical with those in a hypothetical 333-amino acid protein from S. pombe (the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank(TM) accession number D89205). The gene corresponding to this protein was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified protein was found to have PL reductase activity. The recombinant PL reductase showed the same properties as those of native PL reductase. PL reductase showed only low sequence identities with members of AKR superfamily established to date; it shows the highest identity (18.5%) with human Shaker-related voltage-gated K+ channel β2 subunit. The elements of secondary structure of PL reductase, however, distributed similarly to those demonstrated in the three-dimensional structure of human aldose reductase except that loop A region is lost, and loop B region is extended.

The hydraulic phase effects preservative impregnation into the wood while CCA fixation occurs during the pneumatic phase. A final vacuum is drawn at the end of the pneumatic phase. Kickback solutions collected at the end of pneumatic and final vacuum stages are kept-separated from the working solution and are processed to reduce organic carbon and/or metallic ion contaminants to levels that allow safe disposal or recycling. In pilot plant trials, 24 consecutive charges of radiata pine roundwood or sawn lumber were treated to the range of retentions specified by the New Zealand Timber Preservation Council for Hazard Classes H3 to H5.1 The principal objectives of the trials were to: 1) ""stress"" CCA solution by repetitive heating, treating, and cooling to determine its stability in the process; 2) determine any effects of pre-drying regimes on the standard of treatment; and 3) determine the extent of fixation influenced by various treatment charge charac-teristics (wood size, wood pre-conditioning, preservative retention). At the finish of the trials, the working solution was clear with no propensity to sludging. Preservative element ratios remained constant throughout the trials. Fixation achieved for all charges was between 95 and 98 percent of maximum possible. Wood moisture content (MC) at the time of treatment had the most effect on the degree of fixation achieved. Kickback liquid contamination with residual CCA and organic carbon was greater when wood MCs were high. © Forest Products Society 1999.",,"Organic carbon; Pilot plants; Pneumatics; Wood preservation; Chromated copper arsenate; Degree of fixation; Element ratios; Pneumatic pressure; Pre-conditioning; Safe disposals; Timber preservation; Wood moisture content; Wood; Pneumatic Equipment; Pollution; Pressure; Sludging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84969951367

The analysis has been carried out by means of data derived from the urban and suburban air quality monitoring networks, of meteorological data (wind velocity, temperature and relative humidity) from the same network and from other networks in the region, and of the output of the numerical model LAMBO (operatively used by the Regional Meteorological Service of Emilia Romagna). The analysis of meteorological data appears to be in good correlation with the distribution of the air pollutant concentrations; in particular, the high concentrations observed in the late afternoon are due to a strong thin inversion layer near the ground, developing immediately after the sudden end of the foehn episode.",,"Air quality; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon monoxide; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Wind; Air pollution concentration; Cold front; Foehn; Air pollution; Emilia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032624044

Plants were grown for 60 d in sand, using nutrient solutions (six nitrate concentrations from 0.25 to 16 mM NO3), at ambient (c. 357 μl l-1) or elevated CO2 (c. 712 μl l-1).

Responses of species in mixtures to CO2 were related to their responses in monocultures but not to those of isolated plants. Species biomass proportions in mixtures under ambient CO2 determined the outcome of mixture responses to CO2 more than of individual species responses to CO2. These results emphasize the influence of plant-plant interactions on community responses to CO2, since mixture behaviour under elevated CO2 could not be scaled-up from responses by isolated plants in this experiment.","Community structure; Competition; Density; Elevated CO2; Functional groups; Grasses; Legumes; N availability","carbon dioxide enrichment; competition; environmental gradient; grass; legume; nitrogen; vegetation cover; Danthonia richardsonii; Lotus pedunculatus; Phalaris aquatica; Trifolium repens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032813407

We also evaluate the effects of measurement error in exposure assessment on the accuracy of estimated health effects. The bidirectional case-crossover design is a variant of a method proposed by Maclure (1991). Our version of the method takes advantage of the fact that in epidemiologic studies involving environmental exposure, accurate information about past exposure is more readily available, and that levels of exposure are generally unaffected by the response of the subject. It differs from other case-crossover methods in that control information is assessed both before and after failure, thus avoiding confounding due to time trends in exposure. The multilevel analytic design provides a method of combining estimates of health effects made on the individual level with those made at the group level. It has great potential value in situations where variations in exposure within groups may not be great enough to provide adequate power to detect health effects, as is often the case in air pollution studies where exposure levels are similar within a geographic community. Measurement errors in exposure assessment can have substantial impact on the accuracy of estimated health effects. When the microenvironmental approach is used to estimate exposure, a standard error of 30% in estimating indoor/outdoor ratios can increase the standard error of a relative risk estimate by 50%, and introduce bias as well. Similar results hold when exposure is estimated with personal samplers. When the microenvironmental approach is used, errors in estimating indoor/outdoor ratios have more influence on the accuracy of risk estimation than do errors in estimating the time spent in microenvironments.",,"absenteeism; air pollution; article; case control study; child; child welfare; crossover procedure; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; epidemiology; health status; human; longitudinal study; methodology; mortality; reproducibility; risk assessment; statistical analysis; statistical model; United States; Absenteeism; Air Pollution; Bias (Epidemiology); California; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child Welfare; Confounding Factors (Epidemiology); Cross-Over Studies; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Epidemiologic Methods; Epidemiologic Research Design; Epidemiologic Studies; Health Status; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Models, Statistical; Mortality; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033127191

This has prompted researchers to investigate hybrid vehicles as one possible solution to this challenge. At Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), a unique parallel hybrid drivetrain was designed and prototyped. This hybrid drivetrain alleviates the disadvantages of series hybrid drivetrains by directly coupling the driving wheels to two power sources, namely an engine and an electric motor. At the same time, the design allows the engine speed to be decoupled from the vehicle speed, allowing the engine to operate at its most efficient state. This paper describes the drivetrain, its components, and the test stand that was assembled to test the parallel hybrid drivetrain. The different modes of operation, the overall control strategy, and hardware data is presented for several driving profiles, including the city, highway, and EPA urban driving profile. Validation results between the hardware and the computer model of the drivetrain are also discussed. Results show a very satisfactory match between computer model and hardware. We have achieved a 60 mpg (28.05 km/liter) fuel economy using the most inefficient operating mode (assist mode) for a mid-sized vehicle. Concepts to further improve this fuel economy are also presented.

Winter die-back caused a 50% reduction in biomass and shoot density in control plots between September and February/March. A further reduction in total and non-photosynthetic biomass of 50% compared to control occurred as a result of treatment effect regardless of the amount of light reduction. However, reduction in photosynthetic biomass was related to the amount of light reduction (r2=0.89). There was an inverse relationship between light reduction and shoot number (r2=0.98). Leaves on shoots within the 43% light reduction plots were longer than leaves on shoots in either control or other light reduction treatment plots after the second month of the experiment. This is probably a morphological response to light reduction, as reported for other species. Respiration and PE responses (alpha, PMAX, IC, and IK) and leaf chlorophyll content in H. wrightii were variable and did not exhibit trends related to light reduction. The ICPLANT values ranged from 30 to 100 µEm-2s-1, and averaged 39 to 62 µEm-2 s-1. This corresponds to approximately 4.5?7% of surface irradiance (SI) in September and February/March, respectively, in Tampa Bay. Carbon budget calculations, using the H SAT model and accounting for water column attenuation and shade in the treatments, indicate net areal productivity by H. wrightii in control plots was 0.25 g C m-2 d-1, and in 43% light reduction plots was 0.025 g C m-2 d-1, in September. Other light reduction treatments were at a carbon deficit in September, and all treatments and controls were at a carbon deficit in February/March. These deficits explain the loss of biomass as a result of winter die-back and with a &gt; 60% reduction in light. The discrepancy between the morphological changes that occurred in H. wrightii as a result of a 43% light reduction and a calculated positive carbon budget suggest that other sources of light attenuation (epiphytes, surface scattering, etc.) must be accounted for, or it may reflect carbon budget precision or assumptions. © 2000 by CRC Press LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857296529

The dust emission disk is much thinner than the warped HI disk, and new structures emerge. In particular, a giant arc has been found that is linked to anomalies in the kinematical structure of the atomic gas. Most of the extraplanar dust is closely associated with HI spurs that have been found earlier [Weliachew, L., Sancisi, R. and Guelin, M. (1978) Astron. Astrophys. 65, 37-45; Rand, R. J. (1994) Astron. Astrophys. 285, 833-856]. These spurs obviously are traces of the interaction [Combes, F. (1978) Astron. Astrophys. 65, 47-55]. The dust emission within the plane reaches the border of the optical disk. The activity of the disk of NGC 4631 is moderately enhanced by the interaction, but no gas moving in the z-direction could be found [Rand, R. J., Kulkarni, S. R. and Hester, J. J. (1992) Astrophys. J. 396, 97-103; Golla, G., Dettmar, R.-J. and Domgorgen, H. (1996) Astron. Astrophys. 313, 439-447]. Hence, it seems unlikely that strong winds have deposited the high- z dust. Instead, the coincidence with the HI features suggests that we see a track left behind by the interaction. In addition, the HI shows a supershell formed by an impact [Rand, R. J. and Stone, J. M. (1996) Astron. J. 111, 190- 196] in the zone where the dust trail crosses the disk. This region is also characterized by disturbances in the distribution of the Hα light.

For a new class of molecular materials (metal-phthalocyanines) an increased XUV output is observed due to effective laser radiation coupling into molecular targets.

The species that activate and reduce CO2 are the Fe0P and Co0P formed by reduction of the starting materials. Reduction of the metalloporphyrins (MP) is achieved by photolysis in dimethylformamide or acetonitrile solutions containing triethylamine (TEA) as a reductive quencher. The photoreduction is efficient for the MIIIP → MIIP stage and probably occurs by an intramolecular electron transfer from an axially bound TEA. However, TEA does not bind to the reduced metal complexes, and the quantum efficiency is much lower for the subsequent reduction steps. Considerably higher quantum yields are obtained by adding p-terphenyl (TP) as a sensitizer. TP is very effectively photoreduced by TEA to form the radical anion, TP-, which has a sufficiently negative reduction potential to reduce CoIP and FeIP rapidly to their M0P state. The rate constants for these reactions, determined by pulse radiolysis, are found to be nearly diffusion-controlled. The quantum yield for the reduction of MIIP to MIP and for reduction of CO2 to CO are increased by more than an order of magnitude in the presence of TP. Side reactions involve hydrogenation of the porphyrin ring and production of H2. The hydrogenated porphyrins also catalyze reduction of CO2, but the photochemical production of CO eventually stops. This limit on catalytic activity is due to destruction of the porphyrin macrocycle and accumulation of CO. CO can bind strongly to FeIIP and to FeIP but not to Fe0P, as demonstrated by electrochemical measurements and by optical spectra of the species produced by sodium reduction in tetrahydrofuran in the presence and absence of CO. Although binding of CO to FeIIP and FeIP should not interfere with the formation of Fe0P, the active catalyst, the potential for reduction of FeIP to Fe0P becomes more negative. However, CO probably binds to the hydrogenated products thereby inhibiting the catalytic process. © 1999 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28944444525

For Ne2-N2O, these are 20Ne20Ne-14N14N16O, 20Ne22Ne-14N14N16O, 22Ne22Ne-14N14N16O, 20Ne20Ne-15N14N16O, 20Ne22Ne-15N14N16O, 22Ne22Ne-15N14N16O, 20Ne20Ne-14N15N16O, 20Ne22Ne-14N15N16O, and 22Ne22Ne-14N15N16O. Those for Ar2-N2O are 40Ar40Ar-14N14N16O, 40Ar40Ar-15N14N16O, and 40Ar40Ar-14N15N16O. The spectra were measured in the frequency range between 3 and 18 GHz. Both a- and c-type transitions were measured for all Ne2-N2O isotopomers. In the case of the mixed, 20Ne22Ne containing, isotopomers a small b-dipole moment occurs and two b-type transitions were measured. In the spectra of Ar2-N2O only b- and c-type transitions were measured. Rotational and centrifugal distortion constants were determined for all the isotopomers of each complex. The spectral analyses show that Ne2-N2O is a highly asymmetric prolate rotor (κ = -0.158 for 20Ne20Ne-14N14N16O) while Ar2-N2O is a highly asymmetric oblate rotor (κ = 0.285 for 40Ar40Ar-14N14N16O). Both trimers were found to have distorted tetrahedral structures with the rare gases tilted towards the O atom of the N2O subunit. Nuclear quadrupole hyperfine structures due to both terminal and central 14N nuclei were observed and analyzed to give the nuclear quadrupole coupling constants, χaa(1), χbb(1) and χaa(2), χbb(2). The resulting spectroscopic constants were utilized to derive ground state effective structures, ground state average structures, and partial substitution structures. Harmonic force field analyses were performed for each complex using the obtained quartic centrifugal distortion constants.

Any rise in sea level promotes land loss, increased flooding and salinisation. The impacts of and possible responses to sea-level rise vary at the local and regional scale due to variation in local and regional factors. Policy responses to the human-enhanced greenhouse effect need to address these different dimensions of climate change, including the regional scale. Based on global reviews and analyses of relative vulnerability, 4 contrasting regions are selected and examined in more detail using local and national assessments. These regions are (1) Europe, (2) West Africa, (3) South, South-East and East Asia and (4) the Pacific Small Islands. Some potential impacts of sea-level rise are found to have strong regional dimensions and regional cooperation to foster mitigation approaches (to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and, hence, the magnitude of climate change) and adaptive solutions to climate change impacts would be beneficial. For instance, in South, South-East and East Asia subsiding megacities and questions about long-term deltaic management are common and challenging issues. The debate on mitigation and stabilisation of greenhouse forcing also requires information on regional impacts of different emission pathways. These results will be provided by integrated models, calibrated against national assessments. © Inter-Research 1998.","Climate change; Policy; Regions; Sea-level rise; Vulnerability assessment","environmental policy; policy strategy; regional pattern; sea level change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033579666

(1993) is extended to a dynamic analysis. It considers the effects of several simultaneously changing factors, including: (1) global sea-level rise and subsidence; (2) increasing coastal population; and (3) improving standards of flood defence (using GNP/capita as an 'ability-to-pay' parameter). The global sea-level rise scenarios are derived from two General Circulation Model (GCM) experiments of the Hadley Centre: (1) the HadCM2 greenhouse gas only ensemble experiment and (2) the more recent HadCM3 greenhouse gas only experiment. In all cases there is a global rise in sea level of about 38 cm from 1990 to the 2080s. No other climate change is considered. Relative to an evolving reference scenario without sea-level rise, this analysis suggests that the number of people flooded by storm surge in a typical year will be more than five times higher due to sea-level rise by the 2080s. Many of these people will experience annual or more frequent flooding, suggesting that the increase in flood frequency will be more than nuisance level and some response (increased protection, migration, etc.) will be required. In absolute terms, the areas most vulnerable to flooding are the southern Mediterranean, Africa, and most particularly, South and South-east Asia where there is a concentration of low-lying populated deltas. However, the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean islands and the Pacific Ocean small islands may experience the largest relative increase in flood risk. By the 2080s, sea-level rise could cause the loss of up to 22% of the world's coastal wetlands. When combined with other losSeS due to direct human action, up to 70% of the world's coastal wetlands could be lost by the 2080s, although there is considerable uncertainty. Therefore, sea-level rise would reinforce other adverse trends of wetland loss. The largest losses due to sea-level rise will be around the Mediterranean and Baltic and to a lesser extent on the Atlantic coast of Central and North America and the smaller islands of the Caribbean. Collectively, these results show that a relatively small global rise in sea level could have significant adverse impacts if there is no adaptive response. Given the 'commitment to sea-level rise' irrespective of any realistic future emissions policy, there is a need to start strategic planning of appropriate responses now. Given that coastal flooding and wetland loss are already important problems, such planning could have immediate benefits.","Adaption; Climate change; Costs; Impacts","coastal zone management; flood; habitat loss; sea level change; wetland",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032719143

As a result of these constraints, relatively few detailed data sets have been reported in the literature over the past two decades. However, empirical data from a wide range of locations are required to improve our understanding of the dust emission potential of various surface types under changing environmental conditions and to aid in the calibration and development of dust transport models. In this paper initial results from a 3 year dust emission monitoring programme carried out in the Channel Country of western Queensland, Australia are presented. During dust events suspended sediment samples were collected at 4 elevations to 10m which wind speed, direction and temperature using a newly developed automated sampling system. This system can be left unattended at remote locations for considerable periods of time, and is activated automatically during a dust event based on a wind speed threshold criterion. Analysis of 12 dust events during 1995 indicate that suspended sediment concentration profiles tend to follow a power function decay (slopes -1.89 to -0.53) with concentrations ranging from 20 to 4761 μg m-3. In general, lower gradients seem to be associated with regional dust storms where the locally derived dust appears to make up a smaller proportion of the suspended sediment concentration. Computed vertical aerosol fluxes range from 5 to 560 μg m-2s-1 and increased with the amount of sand-sized sediment moving in saltation.",,"dust; emission inventory; eolian process; suspended sediment; Australia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033374661

Sampling with high temporal and vertical resolution was conducted at a 250 m deep station from mid-July to mid-September. The water column was strongly stratified and the phytoplankton community in the surface layer was nitrate and silicate depleted. A prominent feature was the occurrence of enhanced phytoplankton biomass in association with the pycnocline where nitrate became detectable. Three distinct blooms (chl a &gt; 8 μg l-1) were observed in the pycnocline, the first dominated by haptophyte flagellates and subsequently by diatoms. Bacterial biomass mirrored the vertical and temporal distribution pattern of the phytoplankton. Comparison between primary production and bacterial production showed that pelagic bacterioplankton were important in this high latitude ecosystem, as documented for low latitude ecosystems. The most important bacterivores, the heterotrophic nanoflagellates, had the potential of clearing the daily bacterial production.

A recent theoretical enhancement proposed refining the temporal and spatial resolutions of travel demand model predictions using observed count data. This method provides a technique for disaggregating the period-based travel demand model assignments (e.g., AM peak, PM peak) into the hourly summaries required by most photochemical model (Lin and Niemeier, 1997). In this study we present a methodological framework for applying the new theory and discuss the results of a large-scale application empirical comparison between the standard and proposed methods for estimating regional mobile emissions in Sacramento, California. The standard method produced slightly higher estimates of daily emissions (about 1%) when compared to the emissions estimated using observed count data.

Testing these two variables as functions of fraction size, sampling site and sampling season showed a good separation between fine and coarse sediment fractions. Additionally, the Winyah Bay sampling stations had more positive carbon isotope ratios compared to Pee Dee and Sampit River stations and were lower in bulk organic carbon content.

On this basis, we recently developed a new method, termed cutaneous field stimulation (CFS), for localized stimulation of Aδ and C fibers in the superficial part of the skin. In the present study, we have evaluated the effects of CFS on non-nociceptive and nociceptive skin senses. We compared the effects of CFS with those of conventional transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), known to preferentially activate coarse myelinated fibers. A battery of sensory tests were made on the right volar forearm of 20 healthy subjects. CFS (16 electrodes, 4 Hz per electrode, 1 ms, up to 0.8 mA) and TENS (100 Hz, 0.2 ms, up to 26 mA) applied either on the right volar forearm (homotopically), or on the lower right leg (heterotopically) were used as conditioning stimulation for 25 min. The tactile threshold was not affected by either homo- or heterotopical CFS or TENS. The mean thresholds for detecting warming or cooling of the skin were increased by 0.4-0.9°C after homo- but not heterotopical CFS and TENS. Regarding nociceptive skin senses, homo- but not heterotopical CFS, markedly reduced CO2-laser evoked Aδ- and C fiber mediated heat pain to 75 and 48% of control, respectively, and mechanically evoked pain to 73% of control. Fabric evoked prickle, was not affected by CFS. Neither homo- nor heterotopical TENS induced any marked analgesic effects. It is concluded that different qualities of nociception can be differentially controlled by CFS. Copyright (C) 1999 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Box 117340, Gainesville, FL  32611, United States","A select set of high deposition rate deep sea sedimentary sequences from the Subantarctic Atlantic and Pacific allows both a detailed description of the global thermohaline circulation changes over the entire last glacial cycle and a simultaneous evaluation of the possible climatic effects of this deep ocean variability. From the benthic foraminiferal carbon isotope records we infer that significant and abrupt fluctuations in the strength of the North Atlantic thermohaline circulation occurred throughout the course of the last glacial cycle—including during the peak of the last interglacial period (120 ka). The new observations from interglacial Stage 5 suggest that the mechanisms of thermohaline instability need not involve glacial meltwater into the North Atlantic as a necessary feedback. From the planktonic foraminiferal isotopic records, we outline the specific upper ocean changes that accompanied the deep ocean changes. The sense of the deep/surface comparison is that indications of greater poleward extent of warmer surface waters usually (but not always) occur in conjunction with indications of reduced North Atlantic Deep Water production. Carbon isotopes of planktonic foraminifera suggest that this relationship cannot simply be a measure of changes in surface heat transport, but rather must involve changes in the actual southward mixing of subtropical waters, ultimately a product of variable wind stress. The phase relationship between thermohaline circulation changes and Southern Hemisphere climate varies over different regions of the climate spectrum, and, as a result, it is not straightforward to assess whether the millennial scale climate transitions in the high latitudes of both hemispheres were strictly in antiphase. In all, the specific physical effects inferred from these deep sea sediment records may be quite distinct from those formulated in climate model experiments featuring thermohaline instability. © 1999 by the American Geophysica Union.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017276907

Substrates examined were: dry olive cake (C), cattle manure (M), 8:1 and 2:1 mixtures of dry olive cake and cattle manure (C: M 8:1, C: M 2:1), 16:1 and 8:1 mixtures of dry olive cake and biosolids (C:B 16:1, C:B 8:1) and a 16:1:1 mixture of dry olive cake, manure and biosolids (C: M: B). Where biosolids were added, a pre-incubation was required to remove substances toxic to earthworms. All substrates supported earthworm growth and reproduction, with growth occurring for 4-8 weeks. Earthworm growth was considerably greater in the manure only substrate than in the dry olive cake only substrate. The addition of manure or biosolids to the dry olive cake enabled similar earthworm growth to that in the manure only. After 17 weeks, the earthworms inoculated at the beginning of the experiment had similar biomasses, in all substrates. Larger weights of newly-hatched earthworms were obtained in the substrates containing dry olive cake. For a range of reproductive parameters including, among others, cocoon production and hatching success, all substrates were satisfactory; with the 8:1 and 2:1 C: M and C: M: B substrates being the most favourable for reproduction. For all substrates with dry olive cake, vermicomposting reduced the organic carbon content, appreciably reduced the C:N and reduced the pH. A bioassay indicated that the final products were not phytotoxic. The C:M 8.1, C:M 2:1 and C:M:B were considered to be the best substrates for vermicomposting dry olive cake.","Cattle manure; Chemical analysis; Dry olive cake; Eisenia andrei; Municipal biosolids; Vermicomposting","Bos taurus; Eisenia andrei; Eisenia andrei; Pheretima sieboldi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033398189

We show explicitly the coexistence of photobleaching and dye diffusion through the nematic host as two mechanisms influencing the magnitude of the fluorescence signal. In addition, we exhibit clear evidence of the presence of a torque at low input laser powers that twist the dye molecules with respect to the director orientation of the liquid crystal, if the dyes are resonantly excited. The fluorescence emission in this latter case is able to perceive the birefringence of the nematic liquid crystal host, and this is shown as clear oscillations in the polarized fluorescence as a function of temperature.

Atlantic Ocean. At least six depths (0-90 m) were sampled with modified Go-Flo samplers from a rubber zodiac. In the study area, the first 25 m were well mixed and stratification occurred below this depth. The local bloom of Emiliania huxleyi hardly affected the trace metals concentration, except for some removal of Cd as seen from its correlation with nitrate. The mean dissolved concentrations were for Ni (3.66 nM), Cu (1.61 nM), Zn (4.5 nM), Cd (48 pM) and Pb (108 pM). These concentrations are among the lowest reported for the North Sea and are of similar magnitude to those found in the eastern North Atlantic at the same latitude. Zn was the only exception with values 10 times higher compared to those in the Atlantic Ocean, suggesting external inputs, mainly atmospheric and possibly from surrounding land masses. The observed ratio Zn:Cd in the North Sea and estuaries is in between the high ratio 600-900 for continental sources and the low ratio 5-10 for oceanic waters. Latter low ratio is consistent with the 21-fold stronger inorganic complexation of Cd in seawater which, in combination with the preferential biological uptake of Zn, may lead to the observed about hundredfold fractionation of Zn versus Cd in the marine system. Other processes may play a role but would need further investigation. The dissolved Pb values tend to be lower than found before in the North Sea, indicating decreasing inventories due to reduced anthropogenic emissions.","Cu; Fractionation Zn and Cd; Ni; North Sea; Pb","cadmium; fractionation; seawater; trace metal; water chemistry; zinc; North Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032757777

Experiments using open-top chambers have been established at many sites to test whether the short-term responses of tree seedlings described in controlled environments would be sustained over several growing seasons under field conditions. Here we review the results of those experiments, using the framework of the interacting cycles of carbon, water and nutrients, because that is the framework of the ecosystem models that are being used to address the decades-long response of forests. Our analysis suggests that most of what was learned in seedling studies was qualitatively correct. The evidence from field-grown trees suggests a continued and consistent stimulation of photosynthesis of about 60% for a 300 p.p.m, increase in [CO2], and there is little evidence of the long-term loss of sensitivity to CO2 that was suggested by earlier experiments with tree seedlings in pots. Despite the importance of respiration to a tree's carbon budget, no strong scientific consensus has yet emerged concerning the potential direct or acclimation response of woody plant respiration to CO2 enrichment. The relative effect of CO2 on above-ground dry mass was highly variable and greater than that indicated by most syntheses of seedling studies. Effects of CO2 concentration on static measures of response are confounded with the acceleration of ontogeny observed in elevated CO2. The trees in these open-top chamber experiments were in an exponential growth phase, and the large growth responses to elevated CO2 resulted from the compound interest associated with an increasing leaf area. This effect cannot be expected to persist in a closed-canopy forest where growth potential is constrained by a steady-state leaf area index. A more robust and informative measure of tree growth in these experiments is the annual increment in wood mass per unit leaf area, which increased 27% in elevated CO2. There is no support for the conclusion from many studies of seedlings that root-to-shoot ratio is increased by elevated CO2; the production of fine roots may be enhanced, but it is not clear that this response would persist in a forest. Foliar nitrogen concentrations were lower in CO2-enriched trees, but to a lesser extent than was indicated in seedling studies and only when expressed on a leaf mass basis. The prediction that leaf litter C/N ratio would increase was not supported in field experiments. Also contrasting with seedling studies, there is little evidence from the field studies that stomatal conductance is consistently affected by CO2; however, this is a topic that demands more study. Experiments with trees in open-top chambers under field conditions have provided data on longer-term, larger-scale responses of trees to elevated CO2 under field conditions, confirmed some of the conclusions from previous seedling studies, and challenged other conclusions. There remain important obstacles to using these experimental results to predict forest responses to rising CO2, but the studies are valuable nonetheless for guiding ecosystem model development and revealing the critical questions that must be addressed in new, larger-scale CO2 experiments.","Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Forests; Global change; Open-top chambers; Trees","carbon dioxide enrichment; forest ecosystem; growth response",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032996282

A solution has been sought through legislation that mandates significant reductions in anthropogenic emissions of oxides of sulfur and nitrogen, precursors of sulfates and nitrates. This paper looks at the changes in sulfate deposition in the middle eastern United States from 1975 to 1990 and 2010 due to SO2 emission reductions brought about by 1970, 1977, and 1990 clean-air legislation. Recently developed emission inventories, together with a statistical, long-range transport model, were used to construct the estimates. The results show that sulfate deposition decreased over the middle eastern United States by about 25% between 1975 and 1990 and will decrease another 45% between 1990 and 2010—reductions commensurate with the overall decreases in SO2 emissions. The results further indicate that about half of the sulfur deposited in the environmentally sensitive southern Appalachian Mountains comes from states not a part of the southern Appalachian region. These estimates contain a measure of uncertainty due to uncertainty in emission estimates, the interannual variability of meteorology, and uncertainty arising from model assumptions and choices of oxidation and deposition rates. The model was able to reproduce about 10% of the variability in observations of wet sulfate deposition at over 100 sites over a 12-year period. © 1999 Air and Waste Management Association.",,"hydrocarbon; nitrate; nitrogen; sulfate; sulfur; acid rain; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality standard; aquatic fauna; article; atmospheric dispersion; chemistry; combustion; ecotoxicity; electric power plant; forest; law; meteorology; priority journal; topography; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033025574

Evolutionary responses to climate change will depend on the presence of heritable variation within species populations for traits that increase fitness under the changing conditions. Patterns of ecotypic differentiation in relation to latitude in some species suggest that such variation exists in relation to temperature responses. Response to elevated CO2, whether heritable or not, is not expected to be related to latitudinal or climatic differences within temperate regions. 2. To test these ideas, seeds were collected from 10 populations of the outbreeding perennial grass Agrostis curtisii across its range in Europe from south Wales to Portugal. Plants were grown under ambient and elevated temperature and CO2 conditions, in a factorial design, in solardomes; two half sibs from each population were planted in separate pots in each of the two replicate domes with each combination of treatments. One half sib was harvested at the end of the first summer, the second at the end of the second summer. 3. Survival was uniformly high and flowering uniformly low across treatments and populations. 4. Responses to temperature and CO2 treatments varied over time for almost all populations. Treatment effects were not significant on plants harvested in year 1, although there was a trend towards higher shoot biomass under the elevated temperature and CO2 treatment. In year 2 shoot biomass was significantly higher under the elevated temperature treatment across all populations and there was a strong trend towards decreased biomass under elevated CO2. 5. There were no significant correlations of plant response to either CO2 or temperature with climate at origin. 6. These results warn of the dangers of extrapolating evolutionary plant responses to CO2 from short-term experiments.","Ecotypic differentiation; Global environmental change; Latitudinal gradient; Solardome","carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; grass; growth response; interpopulation variation; survival; temperature effect; Agrostis curtisii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032804732

Synthetic diesel fuels can have very low sulfur and aromatic content, and excellent autoignition characteristics. Moreover, synthetic diesel fuels may also be economically competitive with California diesel fuel if produced in large volumes. Previous engine laboratory and field tests using a heavy-duty chassis dynamometer indicate that synthetic diesel fuel made using the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) catalytic conversion process is a promising alternative fuel because it can be used in unmodified diesel engines, and can reduce exhaust emissions substantially. The objective of this study was a preliminary assessment of the emissions from older model transit operated on Mossgas synthetic diesel fuel. The study compared emissions from transit buses operating on Federal no. 2 Diesel fuel, Mossgas synthetic diesel (MGSD), and a 50/50 blend of the two fuels. The buses were equipped with unmodified Detroit Diesel 6V92 2-stroke diesel engines. Six 40-foot buses were tested. Three of the buses had recently rebuilt engines and were equipped with an oxidation catalytic converter. Vehicle emissions measurements were performed using West Virginia University's unique transportable chassis dynamometer. The emissions were measured over the Central Business District (CBD) driving cycle. The buses performed well on both neat and blended MGSD fuel. Three buses without catalytic converters were tested. Compared to their emissions when operating on Federal no. 2 diesel fuel, these buses emitted an average of 5% lower oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and 20% lower particulate matter (PM) when operating on neat MGSD fuel. Catalyst equipped buses emitted an average of 8% lower NOx and 31% lower PM when operating on MGSD than when operating on Federal no. 2 diesel fuel.

Non-equilibrium electrons are injected into the quantum well via tunnelling from the n-layer. In order to preserve the charge neutrality in the depletion region, the junction undergoes a self-induced internal biasing.

Implications of these findings include support for efforts to move away from surface water, for clear communication of climate change information, and for the hiring and retention of full-time professional CWS managers.","Climate variation and change; Community water systems; Decision-making and uncertainty; Sensitivity, vulnerability, and adaptability; Water management; Water resources planning","Climatology; Decision making; Risk management; Rivers; Strategic planning; Community water systems; Vulnerability; Climate change; climate change; vulnerability; water planning; weather; Pennsylvania; Susquehanna River Basin; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033388340

Therefore, we interpret the CDAD pattern as photoelectron-hologram. The real space distribution of atoms can be reconstructed by an inverse integral transformation of the CDAD pattern, which carries the full phase-information.

Although the actual extent and magnitude of producible gas from Alaska's remote coal basins are unknown, the Alaska Department of Natural Resources postulates that if only 10% of the estimated 1,000-trillion cubic feet of methane gas is recoverable, this coalbed methane resource would triple the State's current proven conventional gas reserves Exploratory drilling is the key to assessing the potential of the coalbed gas resources from Alaska's vast coal reserves.

The paper presents detailed analysis of the costs of drilling exploratory wells, including logistics and transportation, geological and hydrologic testing at three sites in rural Alaska. The results of the study show that the cost of drilling and testing two exploratory test wells is about $1.8 million at each site.

Three Eustoma species naturally occur in the United States of America. Of the three E. grandiflorum (Raf.) Shinners has the largest flower. This species has become very popular in Japan, and numerous cultivars have been developed. The annual increase in production is remarkable and this popularity can be attributed to progress in breeding with new flower colors, diverse forms, excellent vase life and availability of flowers all year round. Recently, nursery companies use F1 cultivars and distribute plug seedlings only. Pink-or purple-edged white cultivars are most popular. Eustoma cultivation started in the cool climate zones in order to supply flowers during summer, now cultivation has also spread to warmer region in Japan. Production from spring to autumn account for 80% of annual output. New cultural techniques that prevent rosette-formation and advance or retard growth have resulted in a rapid expansion in production in the winter. Thus Eustoma is now readily availability all year round by using selected cultivars growing in appropriate climatic locations. In cool areas, seed sowing is done from March to April with flowering from September to October in unheated greenhouse. By heating and lighting, harvest period can be extended to November. On the other hand, in warm areas, due to high summer temperatures, seedlings remain in rosettes without bolting. To overcome this problem, various methods have been used to prevent seedlings from rosetting or, as is currently preferred, to cool artificially the rosetted seedlings. With the latter method and with suitable cultivars, this precise technique guaranteed success and uniformity of flowering and so ensure its rapid commercial adoption.","Artificial cooling; Rosette; Seedling","Eustoma; Eustoma grandiflorum; Gentiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242311135

However, knowledge of pollen mineral composition and its relationship to environmental and genetic factors is very limited. We studied the concentrations of macro- and micronutrients in pollen and needles for seven European Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) populations grown in two 15-yr-old provenance plantations with contrasting pollution levels. One site was located near a phosphate fertilizer factory, and the other in an area free of acute air pollution. We also tested the relationship between tree age and pollen nutrient composition by sampling 60-yr-old trees of local origin in both sites. No population differences were found in nutrient concentrations in pollen. However, there were significant differences among populations in needle concentrations of K, Mg and Zn, as well as significant site x population interaction for Mn concentration. In pollen, populations at the polluted site had significantly higher concentrations of S, Mn, Al, Na, Cu, Ni and Cd, and lower Zn. Average concentrations of S, P, Mn and Cd was lower in pollen of 60-yr-old than 15-yr-old Scots pine trees. Pollen concentrations of P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe and B were similar between sites and not related to the concentration of these elements in needles.

We determined carbon allocation patterns of undefoliated and recently defoliated (75% clipping level) plants of the invasive leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula L.) growing with alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), or Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis Elmer). Plants were labeled with 13CO2 24 h after clipping to determine allocation patterns; all plants had equal access to the 13CO2. Based on relative distribution of 13C, defoliation did not affect the amount of carbon allocated to roots of E. esula. The amount of carbon allocated to shoots of E. esula was higher when growing with P. pratensis than when growing with the other species. Based on relative enrichment of 13C, defoliation increased sink strength of remaining shoots on defoliated E. esula plants. Conversely, roots of unclipped E. esula plants were stronger sinks for carbon than roots of clipped plants. Even though defoliation increased 'sink strength' of remaining shoots of E. esula, the amount of carbon allocated to the root system was unaffected by defoliation, suggesting that uninterrupted allocation of carbon to its extensive root system, not increased allocation to its shoot system, confers grazing tolerance.","Carbon allocation; Euphorbia esula; Festuca idahoensis; Grazing tolerance; Medicago sativa; Poa pratensis; Weeds","carbon allocation; carbon sink; defoliation; grazing; herbivory; Medicago sativa; plant growth; rooting; tissue distribution; Animalia; Euphorbia esula; Euphorbia esula; Euphorbiaceae; Festuca idahoensis; Festuca idahoensis; Medicago sativa; Poa pratensis; Poa pratensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033509133

The soil (seen through the gaps) is assumed to be at uniform temperature and warmer than the plants. Different canopy architectures are constructed by varying the ratio kappa of the projection of the vertical elements (thin cylinders, or blades with a uniform distribution in azimuth) to the area of the horizontal facets, while specifying that the gap function (the probability of non-interception, that is, of seeing the soil through the canopy) remains constant (at about 0.5) when viewing the surface at a zenith angle theta v of 50. Assuming initially that the temperature is uniform throughout the canopy, we note that the observed emission (the measured surface temperature) decreases with increasing zenith angle of observation, as more canopy and less soil is seen in the field of view. The pattern of the change is commonly applied to infer both canopy and soil temperatures. When the architecture tends to be more vertical (as quantified by a higher kappa), the pattern is modified: the emission becomes appreciably higher in the nadir region (more soil is seen) but lower towards the limb, that is, at larger theta v (more plants are seen). Thus, when interpreting the pattern of the emission for a range of theta v to estimate the temperature difference between the soil and the canopy, an overestimate results if the tendency to the vertical is underestimated. The analysis of the radiance as a function of the view zenith angle is extended to a canopy with plant-element temperature increasing with the optical depth in the canopy (where the rate specifying the increase of the emission from the plants with the optical depth is adjusted to maintain the continuity of the temperature at the canopy bottom (canopy/soil interface)). The pattern with theta v of the emitted radiance is, in these cases, closely similar to that for a warm soil/uniform-temperature canopy, especially if the canopy optical depth is large. This analysis indicates that information about the properties of the canopy (optical (radiative transfer) depth, and characterization of the architecture) should be available for an appropriate interpretation of the longwave radiances in terms of the canopy temperature, and through this interpretation, assessment of the evapotranspiration rate. Inversion of the solar bidirectional reflectances measured simultaneously with the longwave measurements is likely to be the best source of this information. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",,"Electromagnetic wave emission; Evapotranspiration; Interfaces (materials); Plants (botany); Soil mechanics; Vegetation; Canopy; Longwave emission; Remote sensing; boundary layer; canopy; emission; longwave radiation; radiance; soil; surface temperature; zenith angle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033587780

Ground measurements of average volumetric surface soil moisture in the top ten cm were made several times per month at 19 locations throughout the state of Illinois. Nighttime microwave brightness temperatures were observed at a frequency of 6.6 GHz, by the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), onboard the Nimbus 7 satellite. At 6.6 GHz, the instrument provides a spatial resolution of approximately 150 km, and a temporal frequency over the test area of about 3 nighttime orbits per week. Vegetation radiative transfer characteristics, such as the canopy transmissivity, were estimated from vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the 37 GHz Microwave Polarization Difference Index (MPDI). Because the time of satellite coverage does not always coincide with the ground measurements of soil moisture, the existing ground data were used to calibrate a water balance for the top 10 cm surface layer in order to interpolate daily surface moisture values. Such a climate-based approach is often more appropriate for estimating large-area average soil moisture because meteorological data are generally more spatially representative than isolated point measurements of soil moisture. Passive microwave remote sensing presents the greatest potential for providing regular spatially representative estimates of surface soil moisture at global scales. Real time estimates should improve weather and climate modelling efforts, while the development of historical data sets will provide necessary information for simulation and validation of long-term climate and global change studies.",,"Heat radiation; Moisture; Radiometers; Soil cement; Vegetation; Microwave polarization difference index (MPDI); Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); Scanning multichannel microwave radiometers (SMMR); Remote sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033330235

Plots in open-top chambers (4.5 m diameter) were exposed continuously (24 h) to ambient and elevated CO2 from early April to late October each year. Unchambered plots were monitored also. Aboveground peak biomass was determined by clipping each year in early August, and root growth was estimated by harvesting roots from root ingrowth bags. Plant community composition was censused each year in early June. In the last 2 years of the study, subplots were clipped on 1 June or 1 July, and regrowth was harvested on 1 October. Volumetric soil water content of the 0-100 cm soil layer was determined using neutron scattering, and was generally higher in elevated CO2 plots than ambient. Peak aboveground biomass was greater on elevated CO2 plots than ambient CO2 plots with or without chambers during years with significant plant water stress. Above-ground regrowth biomass was greater under elevated CO2 than under ambient CO2 in a year with late-season water stress, but did not differ in a wetter year. Root ingrowth biomass was also greater in elevated CO2 plots than ambient CO2 plots when water stress occurred during the growing season. The basal cover and relative amount of warm-season perennial grasses (C4) in the stand changed little during the 8-year period, but basal cover and relative amount of cool-season perennial grasses (C3) in the stand declined in the elevated CO2 plots and in ambient CO2 plots with chambers. Forbs (C3) and members of the Cyperaceae (C3) increased in basal cover and relative amount in the stand at elevated compared to ambient CO2. Greater biomass production under elevated CO2 in C4-dominated grasslands may lead to a greater carbon sequestration by those ecosystems and reduce peak atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the future.","Above-ground biomass; Botanical composition; Carbon dioxide; Elevated CO2; Global climate change; Root biomass; Tallgrass prairie; Water-use efficiency","biological production; biomass; carbon dioxide enrichment; community composition; global change; prairie; Cyperaceae; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032844026

Neither X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy nor X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed any marked change between the first two states. However, a complete transformation of zirconia into well-crystallized tetragonal modification with a marked redispersion of Pt was observed after total deactivation. Ion scattering spectroscopy showed that a large fraction of these small Pt particles has been buried deep under support layers. The surface fraction of Pt could be reduced approaching Pt0 state by in-situ H2 treatment in all cases. The amount of carbon increased with progressing deactivation, however, no significant differences were observed in its chemical state showing graphite and aliphatic polymers as the main component, along with oxygenated carbon components, including carboxyl groups. The predominant sulfur component was S+6 with no S-2 present in any of the cases. However, small amounts of S+4 appeared in the 'deact.' sample, its amount being enhanced by in-situ hydrogenation. Accumulated carbon may have caused the decrease of activity and isomer selectivity in the 'used' catalyst as compared with the 'calc.' sample. These were more conspicuous at higher temperatures and lower hydrogen pressures. The main effect of surface C in the 'used' state may have been the hindering of 'hydrogen transfer' between metal and acid sites, necessary for high isomerization selectivity. Final deactivation, in turn, can be due to structural rearrangement, involving recrystallization and 'burying' most Pt under zirconia layers, both effects leading to the disruption of the most active metal-acid ensembles. As a consequence, an oxidative starting of the reaction became more significant, leading to a partial reduction of S+6 to S+4 to a detectable extent. This reduction was analogous to that observed with a Pt-free sulfated zirconia which underwent a much shorter and less severe exposure to n-hexane. By dissociating H2 and promoting hydride transfer to adjacent acidic sites Pt ensures thus an acidic start of isomerization, preventing an extensive S+6 → S+4 reaction.

Indeed, they have diameters in such a range (approximately 0.1-5 μm) that they can penetrate our respiratory system, but cannot be expelled during exhalation. Therefore, it is extremely important to detect them and characterize their size distribution. In this paper we propose the use of a novel instrument recently developed by the authors for the monitoring of airborne particulate at concentration levels so to comply with the current European Economic Community (EEC) regulations. The instrument is based on spectral extinction measurements over long optical paths and is able to recover, almost in real time, both concentration and size distribution of particles with diameters in the range of interest. The sensitivity and accuracy of the instrument were estimated by means of measurements in a clean room and by using calibrated particles dispersed in water. Our results show that, by carrying out measurements over optical paths of approximately □100 m, the instrument is able to detect concentration levels well below the ECC limit imposed for the atmospheric pollution. Scaled over shorter optical paths (approximately 10 m), the limit imposed for particle emissions by industrial plants can also be detected very accurately.",,"Atmospheric aerosols; Industrial emissions; Laws and legislation; Light extinction; Light measurement; Particle size analysis; Particulate emissions; Regulatory compliance; Detection limits; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033345069

At times this may require additional or different measures than if local and national considerations were the only ones involved.

The study implements and tests a new lateral boundary condition closure approach enabling regional climate modeling sensitivity studies to account for anomalies external to the simulated domain. Thirty-day regional simulations of the continental United States using the MM5 regional model successfully reproduced the anomalous drought and flood conditions. In an additional set of simulations the observed large-scale quasi-stationary wave anomalies in the dynamic and thermodynamic fields were filtered out through adjustment of the observationally based lateral boundary conditions. In these filtered simulations the simulated meteorological fields over the drought/flood areas for both years tended toward those for normal years, suggesting that the proposed filtering technique can be used as a tool to test the regional response to external forcing. Comparisons of the control and filtered simulations illustrated the significant influence of large-scale anomalies on the strength and geographical distribution of the low-level jet and related impacts on rainfall in the central United States.",,"Atmospheric thermodynamics; Computer simulation; Drought; Floods; Rain; Lateral boundary condition; Regional climate modeling; Climatology; atmospheric wave; climate modeling; regional climate; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032835389

In 16 normal subjects, ABP was measured non-invasively (Finapres), CBFV was estimated with Doppler ultrasound in the middle cerebral artery, and end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) was measured with an infrared capnograph. Recordings were made before, during and after breathing a mixture of 5% CO2 in air. The coherence function, amplitude and phase frequency responses, and impulse and step responses for the effects of ABP on CBFV were calculated by spectral analysis of beat-to- beat changes in mean ABP and CBFV before (mean CO2 5.55 ± 0.38 kPa), during (6.43 ± 0.31 kPa) and after 5% CO2 (5.43 ± 0.26 kPa). During 5% CO2, the coherence function and the amplitude frequency response were significantly increased for frequencies below 0.05 Hz and the phase was reduced for the frequency range 0.02-0.1 Hz. The impulse and step responses indicated that 5% CO2 reduces the efficiency of the autoregulatory mechanism. A 20.7% average increase in CBFV induced by a 14.4% increase in EtCO2 was found to be mediated by a 25.9% reduction in critical closing pressure, while the change in resistance-area product was non-significant.","Cerebral autoregulation; Cerebral blood flow; Cerebral haemodynamics; End- tidal CO2; Transcranial Doppler","carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; arterial carbon dioxide tension; article; autoregulation; blood flow velocity; brain blood flow; Doppler echography; hemodynamics; human; mean arterial pressure; middle cerebral artery; normal human; priority journal; adult; blood; blood flow; blood pressure; brain; brain artery; breathing; drug effect; echography; heart rate; homeostasis; middle aged; vascularization; Adult; Blood Flow Velocity; Blood Pressure; Brain; Carbon Dioxide; Cerebral Arteries; Heart Rate; Homeostasis; Humans; Middle Aged; Regional Blood Flow; Respiration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032586935

Since mutations in yeast proteins involved in cell cycle regulation can often be rescued by the mammalian homolog and since significant conservation exists between PKC-signalling pathways in yeast and mammalian cells, cell cycle regulation by mammalian PKC isoforms may be effectively studied in a simpler genetically-accessible model system such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. With this objective in mind, we transfected S. cerevisiae cells with a plasmid (pYECε) coding for the expression of murine protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε) under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter. Unlike mock-transfected cells, yeast cells transformed with pYECε expressed, in a galactose-dependent manner, an 89 kDa protein that was recognized by a human PKCε antibody. Extracts from these pYECε-transfected cells could phosphorylate a PKCε substrate peptide in a phospholipid/phorbol ester-dependent manner. Moreover, this catalytic activity could be inhibited by a fusion protein in which the regulatory domain of murine PKCε was fused in frame with GST (GST-Rε), further confirming the successful expression of murine PKCε. Induction of PKCε expression by galactose in cells transformed with pYECε increased Ca++ uptake by the cells approximately 5-fold and resulted in a dramatic inhibition of cell growth in glycerol. However, when glucose was used as the carbon source, PKCε expression had no effect on cell growth. This was in contrast to what was observed upon bovine PKCα or PKCβ-1 expression in yeast, where expression of these PKC isoforms strongly and moderately inhibited growth in glucose, respectively. Visualization of the cells by phase contrast microscopy indicated that murine PKCε expression in the presence of glycerol resulted in a significant increase in the number of yeast cells exhibiting very small buds. Since overall growth of the cells was dramatically decreased, the data suggests that PKCε expression potently inhibits the progression of yeast cells through the cell cycle after the initiation of budding. In addition, a small amount of the PKCε-expressing yeast cells (1-2%) exhibited gross alterations in cell morphology and defects in both chromosome segregation and septum formation. This suggests that for those cells which do complete DNA synthesis, murine PKCε expression may nevertheless inhibit yeast cell growth by retarding and/or imparing cell division. Taken together, the data suggests murine PKCε expression potently reduces the growth of yeast cells in a carbon source-dependent fashion by affecting progression through multiple points within the cell cycle. This murine PKCε-expressing yeast strain may serve as a very useful tool in the elucidation of mechanism(s) by which external environmental signals (possibly through specific PKC isoforms) regulate cell cycle progression in both yeast and mammalian cells.",,"glycerol; hybrid protein; phorbol ester; phospholipid; protein kinase c; article; calcium transport; cell cycle; cell division; cell growth; cell structure; chromosome segregation; DNA synthesis; genetic transfection; immunoblotting; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; saccharomyces cerevisiae; Animals; Base Sequence; Calcium; Cattle; Cell Division; Galactose; Gene Expression; Glucose; Glycerol; Humans; Ion Transport; Isoenzymes; Mice; Plasmids; Protein Kinase C; Protein Kinase C-epsilon; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Transfection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032898724

Eight monitoring stations, ranging from urban-industrial to rural-background, were operated across three east-central U.S. states. Annual average PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 12.6 to 21.3 micrograms per cubic meter (μg/m3), with an overall mean of 15.7 μg/m3. Likewise, annual average PM10 concentrations ranged from 17.8 to 33.7 μg/m3, with an overall mean of 23.7 μg/m3. High summer-low winter seasonality was evident, particularly for PM2.5, with the highest monthly PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in August (26.4 and 37.5 μg/m3, respectively) and the lowest in February (9.9 and 15.3 μg/m3, respectively). A strong association (r2 = 0.84) was found between PM and PM mass with PM mass contributing, on average, 67% of PM10 mass. Applying TVA's PM2 5/PM10 ratio to recent (1993-1995) regional high-volume PM10 Aerometric Information Retrieval System (AIRS) data for the east-central United States suggests that as many as 80% of monitored counties would have equaled or exceeded the level of the new annual PM2.5 metric of 15 μg/m3. A decline in average PM2.5 mass on the order of 3-5 μg/m3 from 1982 through 1991 is also suggested. Daily PM2 5 mass appears to be reasonably well associated (r = 0.47) with maximum hourly ozone during the warmer months (spring through fall). Sulfate compounds comprise a major portion of the measured PM2 5 mass, with that fraction being highest in the summer months. Viewed collectively, these data suggest that although compliance with the annual and 24-hr PM and 24-hr PM metrics should prove readily attainable, the annual PM2.5 metric will present a major regulatory management challenge for much of the east-central United States. © 1999 Air and Waste Management Association.",,"air monitoring; air quality control; article; environmental management; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; seasonal variation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032849950

Above 1 keV the spectrum is consistent with a power-law of photon index 1.47 ± 0.10 and normalization 11.0 ± 0.8 photon cm-2 s-1 keV-1 sr-1 at 1 keV. The overall spectrum can be modeled by a power-law with 2 thermal components, or by a broken power-law and a single thermal component. In both cases the softer thermal emission dominates ≲0.3 keV and is seen through a column, NH, of a few 1019 atom cm-2. The other components have NH consistent with the mean line of sight value. The metal abundances for the thermal components are poorly constrained, but consistent with cosmic values. The power-law together with 2 thermal components model has been used to fit recent combined ASCA and ROSAT CXB measurements. Here, the soft thermal component is interpreted as emission from the local hot bubble and the hard thermal component as emission from a more distant absorbed region. While such a 2 component thermal model is consistent with the LECS spectrum, it is not required, and the hard thermal component may result from inadequate modeling of the extragalactic contribution. The observed low-energy spectral complexity may therefore originate primarily in the local hot bubble. There is no evidence for the presence of a very soft CXB component with a temperature ≲0.1 keV.

Terms like 'respirable', 'thoracic', and 'inhalable' are used to describe the concentration limits defined by the regulations or standards. More recently, EPA has promulgated new National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) using terms such as 'fine' (PM2.5) and 'coarse' (PM10-2.5) for PM. Concentration limits defined by the OSHA and EPA standards and regulations are specified in terms of mass per 'standard volume' rather than mass per 'actual volume'. Specially designed samplers are used to measure the concentrations to determine compliance. These samplers generally consist of two stages. The first stage separates the PM larger than the size specified by the regulation or standard allowing the PM of interest to be measured on a filter in the second stage. The separating efficiency of the first stage is not 100%. As a consequence, a fraction of the PM larger than the particle size being regulated penetrates to the filter and a fraction of the PM smaller than the size being regulated is deposited in the first stage. When describing particle size, the term 'aerodynamic equivalent diameter' (AED) is used.

The results demonstrate a significant to large 14C depletion in many of the plants due to assimilation of 14C-free endogenous CO2 during photosynthesis and leading to artificial radiocarbon ageing of up to 4400 years. The extent of 14C ageing broadly correlates with the intensity of gas manifestations at the sampling sites, as inferred from field observations and measurements of excess CO2 concentrations in the volcanic ground. It also provides a time-integrated measure of the amount of volcanic CO2 locally admixed to the ambient air; at several sites this accounts for 15 to 40% of total CO2 (420 to 600 ppm) in enriched air. In some of the plant species (Azalea, Camellia and fern) 14C depletion is correlated with an enrichment of 13C due to assimilation of magma-derived CO2 with a 4‰ higher δ13C than normal atmosphere. The rate of 13C enrichment averages ca. 0.18‰ by percent of volcanic carbon fixed in the plant and includes enhanced 13C discrimination during photosynthesis as a consequence of increased ambient pCO2 (inferred at -0.0306‰ per added ppm of volcanic CO2). Furnas is one of the few volcanoes where clear 13C enrichment in plants due to endogenous degassing has been evidenced. Our results can be used to estimate the local intensity of volcanic soil gas fluxes in the emanating areas of Furnas caldera. They also have implications for radiocarbon dating of past eruptive events in the caldera, since plants artificially aged by previous degassing could be trapped in volcanic deposits.","Fumarolic emanation; Furnas caldera; Magma-derived CO2 emissions","carbon dioxide; fumarole; isotopic composition; volcano; Azores",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033384926

Concentrating on the Southern Mallee region, a benefit-cost analysis of current clearing and cultivation proposals and their impact on the financial viability of the individual landholder has been conducted. While the development proposals all had the potential to return much higher levels of expected net income to farmers than the existing extensive grazing strategy, market and climatic uncertainty meant that the probability of the extensive grazing activity returning more than cropping was as high as 50% for some proposals. This means that farmers have to weigh up higher incomes on average from cropping against the more certain income from grazing. Clearly, this is a personal choice with the more risk averse decision makers favouring the extensive grazing option. However, we found that for levels of risk aversion that research suggests typifies Australian farmers, the development proposals were dominant over the extensive grazing option except where there was a higher proportion of land devoted to conservation at a discount rate of 12%. No attempt has been made in the present study to evaluate the public benefits and costs, in the form of changes in environmental resources, associated with such development proposals.","Clearing and cultivation; Conservation; Economics; Stochastic dominance; Western division",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745167020

Although a few authors have provided general comments about plant assemblages within the uppermost vegetation belts, no detailed account on vegetation patterns in relation to environmental gradients and factors has been published so far. Such an account, however, is needed to understand the impact of climate change on alpine vegetation. This paper deals with the characteristic vascular plant assemblages and species distributions within the subnival and nival belts. The analysis is based on almost 1000 vegetation samples from Schrankogel (3497 m, Stubaier Alpen, Tyrol), a typical nival peak of the Eastern Alps dominated by a characteristic siliceous vegetation. All samples were taken from permanently marked 1x1 m quadrats established for long-term monitoring of climate-related vegetation changes. The quadrats - arranged along transects - were distributed over the south-west to south-east exposed slope-system, beyond the more closed upper alpine swards, in order to cover the full variety of the subnival and nival plant assemblages. The vegetation classification revealed 14 vascular plant assemblages belonging to two alliances: Caricion curvulae and Androsacion alpinae. Only three of the 14 units could be assigned to well-documented associations: the uppermost alpine Caricetum curvulae, the subnival-centred Androsacetum alpinae, and a subnival variant of the mostly upper alpine Sieversio-Oxyrietum digynae. The other 11 assemblages are characteristic of the successive impoverishment and disaggregation of upper alpine swards and of well-developed subnival Androsacion alpinae-communities. Despite the low species and community diversity, well-differentiated ecological distribution patterns could be indicated. The habitat characteristics 'solid rock' and particularly 'scree' proved to differentiate the habitat preferences of the diagnostic species of subnival plant assemblages. The 'scree-avoiding' sward-forming graminoids, but also the pioneer species of swards grow preferably in rocky habitats; character species of the Androsacion alpinae prefer mixed rock and scree habitats, whereas the chionophilous Sieversio-Oxyrietum-species mostly occur in habitats with high scree-cover. The rock-preferring plants seem to be sensitive to disturbance (from debris fall and substrate movements) as well as to long-lasting snow cover. Therefore, possible climate-induced plant migrations will be highly dependent on topographically determined gradients. The potential pathway of upward-migrating alpine grassland species will be stable rocky ridges. On the other hand, chionophilous plants at the scree sites may be affected severely by reduced snow cover, induced by climate warming.","Androsacion alpinae; Caricion curvulae; Climate change; Eastern Alps; Species-environment relations; Standardised sampling quadrats; Subnival and nival belts","alpine environment; environmental gradient; plant community; spatial distribution; temperature effect; vascular plant; Austria; Mount Schrankogel; Tyrol; Caricion; Oxyrietum; Oxyrietum digynae; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033397903

Furthermore, expression increased 30-fold upon shifting from a high-glucose to a low-glucose medium. This carbon source regulation requires Snf1p and possibly Ssn6p. It appears, however, to be artefactually mediated by plasmid sequences located upstream from the multicloning site. This emerged from the following observations: (a) the derepressive effect disappears if any extra piece of DNA is inserted upstream from the ARG2 promoter; and (b) similar derepression on low glucose is observed with another yeast promoter (ARG11), provided that the flanking 5' region is short. We determined that the cis-elements responsible for this physiologically irrelevant glucose regulation are located between positions 636 and 879 of the pUC18 DNA sequence.","Glucose repression; lacZ fusion reporter plasmid; YEp356","alcohol; carbon; galactose; glucose; plasmid vector; article; culture medium; DNA sequence; gene expression; priority journal; promoter region; Artifacts; Carbon; Carrier Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Genes, Fungal; Genes, Reporter; Genetic Vectors; Glucose; Growth Substances; Membrane Proteins; Membrane Transport Proteins; Mutation; Plant Proteins; Plasmids; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Response Elements; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033568251

We collected samples of water, plants and carbonate deposited on aquatic plants, and obtained 13C values and 14C concentrations. We also investigated a group of the youngest calcium carbonates from caves where deposition is still being observed or ceased no more than a few hundred years ago. The determination of a 14C dilution factor (q) in these carbonates allows us to determine the 'true' radiocarbon ages of old speleothems from caves in the area under investigation and enables the use of old speleothems as suitable material for extending the 14C calibration time scale, the 'Absolute' age having been determined by U/Th or amino acid racemization (AAR) dating methods. Measurements of δ13C and 14C concentrations were made on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) extracted from water samples. Calculated values of q range from 0.55 to 0.68 and δ13C values range from -10‰ to -13‰ versus VPDB with mean values equal to 0.65 and -12‰, respectively. Results indicate that the dissolution process of limestone bedrock is a closed system with the dominating contributor being biogenic carbon dioxide. Isotopic composition of carbon in contemporary plants collected at the karstic springs at 3 localities is highly diverse, with different species distinctly varying in both q and δ13C values. Extremely light values of 13C (under -40‰), observed in Algae and Hyloconium splendens, are correlated with 14C concentrations that are much lower than 100 pMC. Small systematic changes of isotopic composition were found in plants of the same species collected along streams at various distances from the spring. The youngest calcium carbonates from different caves show a relatively high scatter of both δ13C values and 14C concentration. The lower reservoir effect for 14C is observed in samples with higher value of δ13C, indicating equilibrium conditions in the sedimentation of carbonate. Pazdur et al. (1996b) presented 14C dating results and paleoclimatic interpretation of 170 14C analyses of 89 speleothems from 41 caves obtained through 1994. Investigations continued until early 1997, during which time a speleothem, JWi2, was dated by 14C, U/Th and AAR dating methods, and its stable isotope composition (δ13C and δ18O) analyzed in detail (reported here). Carbon isotope analyses indicate very large differences among results obtained by U/Th, AAR, and 14C dating methods.",,"carbon isotope; dissolution; isotopic composition; karst; limestone; Poland; Tatras",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032879843

Simulated NPP was tested against observed NPP data from northern sites near Thompson (Manitoba) and southern sites near Prince Albert (Saskatcheuan) and shown to be consistent with the data. The temporal dynamics of NPP were very different for the southern, central and northern sites, consistent with the hypothesis that different climate-driven processes regulate forest growth in the various regions of the boreal forest transect case study (BFTCS). The simulations suggest that climate change would result in increased NPP for most sites across the transect. According to the model results, increases in atmospheric CO2 also show increased NPP. The combined influence of climate change and elevated CO2 appear to interact in a positive, but non-linear manner. Statistical analysis of the simulation results indicate that changes in NPP are also positively correlated with changes in net N mineralization (R2= 0.89). This supports the conclusion that feedback via N cycling - a coupling of aboveground production with changes in belowground decomposition - is very important for understanding the NPP dynamics of the boreal forest under a changing climate. It was also found that NPP increases with greater fire frequency under current climate conditions, at least over the range of fire return intervals considered (50-200 years). The influence of other changes in disturbance regimes (e.g. altered fire severity and concurrent changes in climate or CO2 fertilization), however, were not considered.","Boreal forests; CENTURY 4.0; Climate change; Ecosystem model; Fire disturbance; Net primary productivity","boreal forest; climate effect; ecological modeling; fire; primary production; Canada",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033589332

HSDs belong to either the Short-chain Dehydrogenase/Reductases (SDRs) or the Aldo-Keto Reductases (AKRs). The AKRs include virtually all mammalian 3α-HSDs, Type 5 17β-HSD, ovarian 20α-HSDs as well as the steroid 5β-reductases. Selective inhibitors of 3α-HSD isoforms could control occupancy of the androgen and GABA(A) receptors, while broader based AKR inhibitors targeting 3α-HSD, 20α-HSD and prostaglandin F(2α) synthase could maintain pregnancy. We have determined three X-ray crystal structures of rat liver 3α-HSD, a representative AKR. These structures are of the apoenzyme (E), the binary-complex (E.NADP+), and the ternary complex (E.NADP+.testosterone). These structures are being used with site-directed mutagenesis to define the molecular determinants of steroid recognition and catalysis as a first step in rational inhibitor design. A conserved catalytic tetrad (Tyr55, Lys84, His117 and Asp50) participates in a 'proton-relay' in which Tyr55 acts as general acid/base catalyst. Its bifunctionality relies on contributions from His117 and Lys84 which alter the pK(b) and pK(a), respectively of this residue. Point mutation of the tetrad results in different enzymatic activities. H117E mutants display 5β- reductase activity while Y55F and Y55S mutants retain quinone reductase activity. Our results suggest that different transition states are involved in these reaction mechanisms. The ternary complex structure shows that the mature steroid binding pocket is comprised of ten residues recruited from five loops, and that there is significant movement of a C-terminal loop on binding ligand. Mutagenesis of pocket tryptophans shows that steroid substrates and classes of nonsteroidal inhibitors exhibit different binding modes which may reflect ligand-induced loop movement. Exploitation of these findings using steroidal and nonsteroidal mechanism based inactivators may lead to selective and broad based AKR inhibitors.",,"20alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; 3alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; steroid 5beta reductase; tryptophan; carboxy terminal sequence; catalysis; cluster analysis; conference paper; enzyme activity; human; ligand binding; molecular recognition; mutagenesis; nonhuman; site directed mutagenesis; 3-alpha-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase (B-Specific); 3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Animals; Catalysis; Humans; Multigene Family; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Steroids; Substrate Specificity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033051603

Preliminary results have shown the widest known electrochemical window before water decomposition, allowing new possibilities for both anodic and cathodic reactions. Studies of the oxidation of organic compounds has been performed with alcohols such as isopropanol, phenol and organic acids. Cyclic voltammetry demonstrates no activity in the potential range where water is stable. In the potential region of oxygen evolution, the organic compounds are mainly oxidized to CO2. No deactivation or reduction in the thickness of the electrode has been observed. In addition, no fouling of the diamond surface has been detected. Furthermore, no hydrodynamic effects have been observed. Concentrated (1 M) and diluted (3×10-4 M) cyanide solutions have been oxidized on diamond electrodes both in the presence and in the absence of chloride ions. The results show a direct oxidation with a current efficiency of about 40% for concentrated solutions. At low cyanide concentrations, the current efficiency is strongly increased by the presence of Cl-. Electrochemical reduction of cadmium and copper has been carried out on diamond electrodes. Non-adherent deposits have been obtained on diamond cathodes.","Cyanide; Diamond; Electrodes; Oxidation","Cadmium; Carbon dioxide; Copper; Cyanides; Cyclic voltammetry; Diamond films; Electrochemical electrodes; Oxidation; Thin films; Synthetic diamond thin film electrodes; Synthetic diamonds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032607397

Results are presented for treatability studies conducted as worst-case and representative soils from Aberdeen Proving Ground's J-Field for extraction of copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn). The particle size distribution characteristics of the soils determined from hydrometer tests are approximately 60% sand, 30% silt, and 10% clay. Sequential extractions were performed on the 'as-received' soils (worst case and representative) to determine the speciation of the metal forms. The technique speciates the heavy metal distribution into an easily extractable (exchangeable) form, carbonates, reducible oxides, organically-bound, and residual forms. The results indicated that most of the metals are in forms that are amenable to soil washing (i.e. exchangeable+carbonate+reducible oxides). The metals Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cr have greater than 70% of their distribution in forms amenable to soil washing techniques, while Cd, Mn, and Fe are somewhat less amenable to soil washing using chelant extraction. However, the concentrations of Cd and Mn are low in the contaminated soil. From the batch chelant extraction studies, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), citric acid, and nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) were all effective in removing copper, lead, and zinc from the J-Field soils. Due to NTA being a Class II carcinogen, it is not recommended for use in remediating contaminated soils. EDTA and citric acid appear to offer the greatest potential as chelating agents to use in soil washing the Aberdeen Proving Ground soils. The other chelating agents studied (gluconate, oxalate, Citranox, ammonium acetate, and phosphoric acid, along with pH-adjusted water) were generally ineffective in mobilizing the heavy metals from the soils. The chelant solution removes the heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, Fe, Cr, As, and Hg) simultaneously. Using a multiple-stage batch extraction, the soil was successfully treated passing both the Toxicity Characteristics Leaching Procedure (TCLP) and EPA Total Extractable Metal Limit. The final residual Pb concentration was about 300 mg/kg, with a corresponding TCLP of 1.5 mg/l. Removal of the exchangeable and carbonate fractions for Cu and Zn was achieved during the first extraction stage, whereas it required two extraction stages for the same fractions for Pb. Removal of Pb, Cu, and Zn present as exchangeable, carbonates, and reducible oxides occurred between the fourth- and fifth-stage extractions. The overall removal of copper, lead, and zinc from the multiple-stage washing were 98.9%, 98.9%, and 97.2%, respectively. The concentration and operating conditions for the soil washing extractions were not necessarily optimized. If the conditions had been optimized and using a more representative Pb concentration (~12 000 mg/kg), it is likely that the TCLP and residual heavy metal soil concentrations could be achieved within two to three extractions. The results indicate that the J-Field contaminated soils can be successfully treated using a soil washing technique.

Large numbers of indicators have therefore been established to quantify emissions, concentrations and environmental and human health impacts of each of these groups of substances. To simplify the data for management, several indicators have been grouped together to form urban air quality indices but the weightings of individual variables is contentious. In industrialising and developing countries, data may be limited and traditional air pollutant indicators cannot often be constructed. The emphasis therefore has to be placed on the development of policy-relevant indicators, such as Response Indicators that reflect different policy principles for regulating air pollutant emissions. Indices that quantify the air quality management capabilities and capacities at the city level provide further useful decision-relevant tools. Four sets of indices, namely, 1. air quality measurement capacity, 2. data assessment and availability, 3. emissions estimates, and 4. management enabling capabilities, and a composite index to evaluate air quality management capability, were constructed and applied to 80 cities. The indices revealed that management capability varied widely between the cities. In some of the cities, existing national knowledge on urban air quality could have been more effectively used for management. It was concluded that for effective urban air quality management, a greater emphasis should be given, not just to monitoring and data capture programmes, but to the development of indicators and indices that empower decision-makers to initiate management response strategies. Over-reliance on restricted, predetermined sets of traditional air quality indicators should be avoided.","Air quality; Cities; Environmental management; Europe; Indicators; Indices; Urban management","air quality; monitoring; pollution control; urban pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032742991

The TW approach is based on the specification of a set of guardrails for climate evolution which refer to various climate-related attributes. These constraints, which define what we call tolerable windows, can be purely systemic in nature - like critical thresholds for the North Atlantic Deep Water formation or of a normative type - like minimum standards for per-capita food production worldwide. Starting from this catalogue of knock-out criteria and using appropriate modeling techniques, those policy strategies which are compatible with all the constraints specified are sought to be identified. In additional to the discussion of the basic elements and the general theory of the TW approach, a modeling exercise is carried out, based on simple models and assumptions adopted from the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU). The analysis shows that if the global mean temperature is restricted to 2 °C beyond the preindustrial level, the cumulative emissions of CO2 are asymptotically limited to about 1550 Gt C. Yet the temporal distribution of these emissions is also determined by the climate anti socio-economic constraints: using, for example, a maximal tolerable rate of temperature change of 0.2 °C/dec and a smoothly varying emissions profile, we obtain the maximal cumulative emissions, amounting to 370 Gt C in 2050 and 585 Gt C in 2100.",,"assessment method; climate change; climate modeling; methodology; theoretical study",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032994240

While originally attractive as hunting grounds, they were later cultivated and modified from sinks into sources. Today, great efforts are being made to restore disturbed or destroyed wetland areas. Different models and goals for wetland restoration exist. From a global point of view, reduction of climatically relevant trace gas emissions is relevant, especially in the case of fens. Regionally and locally, the creation of retention basins for water and compounds or the establishment of characteristic fen species and communities may have high priority. In order to avoid goal conflicts, nature development plans are required which consider not just the wetland to be restored, but the entire catchment area. Such plans should include spatially and temporally differentiated recommendations for implementation of restoration measures and a proper land use system. When it comes to defining concrete aims, the participation of local people should be encouraged. Rewetting and oligotrophication are the most common approaches to boost biodiversity in fen ecosystems in Central and Western Europe. Rewetting includes both quantitative and qualitative aspects, requiring quantitative hydrological models and chemical analyses of the groundwater in the region. In addition, re-introduction of species is often necessary, at least in heavily fragmented cultural landscapes. Transfer of hay from donor areas to severely damaged, seed-depleted peatland to restore fen meadows, was successful. However, despite short-term successes, complete restoration of wetland areas requires a long period of time.","Mire; Rewetting; Species introduction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032809277

The study was conducted in open-top ozone exposure chambers in Corvallis, OR, using two cultivars of spring wheat (Twin and Yecora Rojo). Twin was grown at two densities. Two levels of ozone and three levels of disease were applied in all combinations, for a total of six treatments. The treatments were replicated twice and repeated over 2 years. Disease severity readings were taken three or four times during each growing season. At the completion of grain-fill, the plants were removed from the chambers and harvested. Wheat height and above-ground biomass generally decreased with ozone exposure and with increasing disease severity in both years, while total grain weight decreased significantly only with disease in 1997. There was no interaction between ozone and disease, regardless of cultivar, density, or the plant response variable measured. There was little evidence that ozone exposure affected the severity of wheat leaf rust.","Ozone; Puccinia recondita; Triticum aestivum; Wheat; Wheat leaf rust","biomass; cultivar; ozone; plant height; plant pathology; United States; weight gain; wheat; biomass; disease; ozone; pathogen; wheat; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032971394

Governments can use this information in designing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prioritizing energy savings options. International comparisons of energy efficiency can provide a benchmark against which a country's performance can be measured and policies can be evaluated. A methodology for international comparisons of industrial energy efficiency was developed by the International Network on Energy Demand analysis in the Industrial Sector. In this paper this methodology is used to analyze the energy efficiency of two energy-intensive industries in major developing countries. Energy consumption trends are shown for the steel and cement industry and an analysis is made of technologies used. In light of the Byrd-Hagel resolution, which states that the U.S. will not ratify any climate treaty unless it also mandates commitments to limit greenhouse gas emissions for developing countries, the energy efficiency in the two sectors is compared to that of the U.S. The analysis shows that in the iron and steel sector South Korea and Brazil are more energy-efficient than the U.S, while Mexico has achieved a comparable energy efficiency level in recent years. For Cement, South Korea, Brazil and Mexico are the most efficient countries analyzed.

Lower emissions have resulted from tighter federal tailpipe emission standards for new cars and from federally-mandated changes in gasoline formulation. Declines in automobiles' emissions during on-road driving, however, have not kept pace with reductions in federal emissions standards for new cars; on-road emissions average four to ten times those of new cars under test conditions. The main causes of this difference are normal deterioration in new automobiles' emissions control systems as they age, differences between the carefully-controlled conditions used to measure new automobiles' emissions and those encountered in `real-world driving', malfunctioning emissions control systems in a small fraction of cars, and evaporation of gasoline during refueling and from parked cars. Although most of the current debate over strategies to further reduce motor vehicle emissions remains focused on technologies to make new cars cleaner under test conditions, measures that reduce the gap between test and on-road emissions promise to be more effective. Pollution control efforts should be broadened to focus on other sources that have not been as extensively regulated as automobiles.Concentrations of most commonplace air pollutants recorded in US urban areas have declined sharply in the past two decades, resulting in dramatic reductions in violations of national air quality standards.

These tests revealed the complexity of the ballasting phenomenon; both the sludge and the mineral material affected the ballasting performance. Differences between the materials could be localized using the Tukey test, but no correlation between the ballasting performance and the density or the particle size distribution was found. It was assumed that the interaction mechanism between the activated sludge and the mineral material, and hence the surface characteristics, are crucial for the ballasting action. A set of settling tests was done with activated sludges and mineral materials with known surface characteristics. The linear regression analysis produced a model (r2 = 0.85) for ballasted settling where the important variables were sludge volatile fraction; mineral material dosage, density, specific surface area, cation exchange capacity; sludge suspended solids, mineral material particle size, and hydrophobicity. A batch pilot study was performed with calcium carbonate and the simulation program EFOR 2.2 was used to simulate the effect of the ballasting agent on sludge settling in connection with a higher inflow and higher sludge concentration than was possible to achieve in the pilot plant.

A kinetic model is developed based on the steady-state solutions to the homogeneous electron Boltzmann equation coupled to a system of rate balance equations for the most populated neutral and ionic species produced, either from active nitrogen and CH4 dissociation or as a result of reactions between radicals from N2 and CH4. It is observed that CH4 is very efficiently decomposed through a sequence of reactions in which at the end HCN and H2 appear as the most abundant products in the discharge. A brown deposition on the tube walls has been detected which is attributed to HCN, in agreement with other investigations of Titan's atmosphere, since this species is poorly destroyed in volume.

Since its cellular localization and regulation are incompletely clarified, Cyp1B1 expression and inducibility by 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene (DMBA) and inflammatory cytokines were investigated in different rat liver cell populations in vitro and in the liver during hepatocellular injury. Expression of Cyp1B1 was studied by Northern blot analysis in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), myofibroblasts (MFs), Kupffer cells (KCs), and hepatocytes at various time points of primary cultures and in acutely damaged rat liver (carbon tetrachloride model). Enzyme inducibility was assessed by incubation of cells with DMBA as well as, in the case of HSCs, with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and transforming growth factorβ1 (TGFβ1). Cyp1B1 messengers were expressed at high levels by HSCs and MFs, whereas constitutive expression was not detectable in KCs or in hepatocytes. Cyp1B1-specific mRNA were expressed at highest levels in HSCs at an early stage of activation (2 days after plating) and were diminished upon further activation. DMBA strongly enhanced Cyp1B1 gene expression in HSCs, MFs, and in hepatocytes at day 3 of primary cultures, but not in hepatocytes at day 1, or in KCs. The inflammatory cytokine TNF-α enhanced the Cyp1B1 gene expression in HSCs, either when administered alone or in addition to DMBA, while TGFβ1 did not affect Cyp1B1 expression, even after DMBA induction. We conclude that HSCs and MFs seem to be the major cellular sources of hepatic Cyp1B1 expression and that the constitutive expression of the Cyp1B1 gene and the responsiveness to DMBA stimulation differ between mesenchymal and parenchymal liver cells, indicating a cell-specific regulation of Cyp1B1 gene expression. Interestingly, TNF-α is a potent stimulator of the Cyp1B1 gene in HSCs and acts in concert with DMBA.

KNO3 solutions. NaOH titration showed that the quantity of acidic surface functions increased with the extent of electrochemical oxidation up to oxidation levels of 6360 C g-1. Fibers with over 1.1 mmol gMIN1 of total acidic functional groups per gram were achieved by electrochemical oxidation. The lower limit values of the surface area, based on a model in which every carbon of a lateral plane surface is oxidized to a titratable acidic function, were in fair agreement with the specific surface area measurements from DR/CO2 adsorption at 273 K. BET/N2 measurements of the surface area vs. extent of oxidation were very low, did not increase substantially on increased oxidation and failed to match the surface areas calculated from NaOH uptake values or measured by DR/CO2. Aqueous NaOH is able to access a far larger area than 'dry surface' nitrogen gas adsorption at 77 K. This confirms that a complex micropore structure has formed below the outer fiber surface upon electrooxidation. The pore distribution is mostly comprised of ultramicroscopes which require higher temperature thermal activation for gaseous molecules like N2 or CO2 to penetrate. Capillary forces augmented by ionization of acidic sites and exothermic solvation assist NaOH-H2O transport into pores where acidic functions on the pore surfaces can be neutralized. Some swelling of the porous surface region, when submerged in aqueous base, leads to greater internal surface-NaOH contact. The depth of this layer is deeper than that deleted by XPS. Electrochemical oxidation of the carbon fiber with 1% wt. KNO3 solution penetrates deep inside the carbon fibers with increasing current flow. Ag+, methylene blue (MB+) and I2 were absorbed on the oxidized fibers. The extent of adsorption increased with the extent of electrochemical oxidation. The adsorption capacity of Ag+ was much higher than that of MB+ or I2. The quantity of Ag+ adsorption from aqueous solution by the oxidized fibers depends strongly on pH and maximizes at pH = 10.5, suggesting solvation-ionization can effectively aid transport into the micropores. X-ray diffraction patterns confirmed that some adsorbed Ag+ was reduced to Ag0. The amount of NH3 (and/or NH3-H2O), CH3CH2OH, CH6H5CH3, CCl4 adsorbed onto fibers under these adsorbates' vapor pressure at 25°C, respectively, depended on adsorbate polarity.

A number of approximations about the longwave radiative transfer in the atmosphere was assumed in the conception of both simplified codes. The first one was developed at the Instituto Astronômico e Geofísico da Universidade de São Paulo (Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics, University of São Paulo (IAG-USP; São Paulo, SP); it provides irradiances throughout the atmosphere from radiances integrated over the whole terrestrial spectrum and previously computed by running the version 7 of the Low Resolution Transmittance radiative transfer code (LOWTRAN-7). The second simplified code under consideration is included in the general circulation model developed at the Center for Ocean-Land-Atmosphere Studies (COLA; USA), which runs at the Centro de Previsão do Tempo e Estudos Climáticos (CPTEC; Cachoeira Paulista, SP) for numerical weather forecasting and climate studies. Benchmark calculations employed in this study were obtained by other groups through careful line-by-line spectral integration under hypothetical atmospheric conditions, prescribed in the scope of the program Intercomparison of Radiative Codes used in Climate Models (ICRCCM). Only the effects due to the emission / absorption by water vapor, carbon dioxide and ozone are analyzed. The effects due to the carbon dioxide are well reproduced by the code CPTEC/COLA and, excepting relatively cold atmospheric conditions, by the code developed at IAG-USP. The effects due to the ozone arc underestimated by both simplified codes but mainly by the CPTEC/COLA, once the ozone bands situated outside the region 980-1100 cm-1 were neglected in its development. Sensitivity tests concerning the water vapor continuum absorption indicate that its both components (""self"", related to the water vapor partial pressure, and ""foreign"", related to the dry air pressure) must be considered in order to obtain reliable water vapor absorption estimates. Under hypothetical atmospheric conditions and assuming the occurrence of the three main molecular absorbers, downward longwave irradiances at the surface can be systematically underestimated by the code CPTEC/COLA. Future studies must include not only comparisons between results provided by simplified radiation codes and the respective benchmark calculations under many atmospheric profiles obtained from soundings, but also comparisons between these results and measurements obtained with pyrgeometers near the sounding site.","Atmospheric; Radiation processes in general circulation models; Radiative transfer","longwave radiation; radiative transfer; solar radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033505526

This makes the light-duty vehicle fleet an appealing target for carbon emissions reductions undertaken in pursuit of satisfying the United States' potential obligations under the Kyoto protocol. Furthermore, the current light-duty vehicle fleet is essentially fully dependent on petroleum for its energy supply, so reductions in greenhouse gases will yield similar reductions in U.S. oil use, an attractive proposition to those concerned about U.S. dependence on petroleum imports. Reducing light-duty greenhouse gas emissions and petroleum use can be accomplished by increasing vehicle energy efficiency, shifting travel to more efficient modes, reducing travel overall (by increasing the price of travel, changing development patterns, or other means), changing fuels, and increasing vehicle occupancy.

The results presented in this paper demonstrate that the flexibility to carry out emission abatement in low cost regions, as conferred by emission trading, leads to a significant reduction in the economic cost of implementing the Kyoto protocol for Annex B regions. This underlines the importance of incorporating as much flexibility as possible in the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. The other flexibility mechanisms - joint implementation and the clean development mechanism - and a comprehensive coverage of abatement sources and sinks will provide further avenues for reducing the economic cost of responding to the threat of climate change. In an Australian context, an examination of the sectoral impacts for Australia reveal the potential ramifications of implementing the Kyoto Protocol. The results reported in this paper demonstrate, on the whole, that emission trading can lessen the impacts on key Australian industries of meeting the Kyoto Protocol commitments. This is particularly important for fossil fuel and emission intensive industries such as coal and aluminium. An emission trading scheme would reduce the need to undertake the costly restructuring of the economy that occurs through early retirement of capital stock. The analysis shows that negative impacts on mining (coal) and emission intensive production (aluminium, iron and steel, livestock, meat and milk products) would be reduced considerably by the adoption of an international emission trading scheme. However, for less emission intensive industries such as grains and other manufacturing, emission trading dampens the production increases associated with improved export competitiveness.",,"economic impact; environmental economics; industrial regulation; Kyoto Protocol; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033376761

Insights gained from Mossbauer studies of M-[4Fe-4S]2+ cluster assemblies (M is a paramagnetic center) in sulfite reductase and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase have suggested that the H cluster contains a [4Fe-4S]2+ cluster covalently linked to a smaller Fe-containing cluster. Recent X-ray studies of two [Fe]-hydrogenases, combined with the results of FTIR studies, have revealed that the H cluster contains a novel binuclear Fe cluster, [2Fe](H), that is linked by a cysteinyl sulfur to a [4Fe-4S] cluster; [2Fe](H) was found to have CO, CN-, and thiolate ligands. The analysis of the Mossbauer spectra of Hydrogenase II in the oxidized, reduced, and the CO-inhibited states has enabled us to assign the 57Fe magnetic hyperfine tensors observed by ENDOR and Mossbauer spectroscopy to the two subclusters. Thus, A(I) = +25.3 MHz and A(II) = -28.4 MHz of H(ox)-CO can be assigned to the two delocalized pairs of [4Fe - 4S](H)2+. In our coupling model these A-values result for j ≃ 100 cm-1 where j describes the exchange interaction between [4Fe - 4S]2+(H) and [2Fe](H). The 18 MHz A- value of H(ox) obtained by ENDOR must result from one Fe site of [2Fe](H), while the 7.5 MHz ENDOR A-value seems to be associated with [4Fe-4S](H). Analysis of the Mossbauer spectra of H(red) shows that the 4Fe cluster is in the 2+ state and that [2Fe](H) contains presumably two low-spin Fe(II) sites with ΔE(Q) ≃ 0.85 mm/s and δ ≃ 0.08 mm/s. The observation that the [4Fe- 4S] cluster is in the 2+ state in H(ox), H(ox)-CO, and H(red) suggests that the [2Fe](H) subcluster is in the mixed-valent Fe(III)Fe(II) state in H(ox) and H(ox)-CO. Given the environment of strong-field ligands in [2Fe](H). The Fe(III) site must have low-spin configuration. While such an assignment is compatible with the EPR g-values, low-spin Fe(III) sites with g ≃ 2 commonly exhibit very anisotropic 57Fe A-tensors (due to spin-dipolar interactions) and thus the isotropic A-values of H(ox) and H(ox)-CO observed by ENDOR are difficult to explain.

A large-scale atmospheric phenomenon, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), is a strong determinant of both interannual variation and decadal trends in temperatures and precipitation during winter in northern latitudes, and its recent persistence in one extreme phase may be a substantial component of increases in global temperatures. Hence, we investigated the influences of large-scale climatic variability on plant phenology and ungulate population ecology by incorporating the NAO in statistical analyses of previously published data on: (1) the timing of flowering by plants in Norway, and (2) phenotypic and demographic variation in populations of northern ungulates. We analyzed 137 time series on plant phenology for 13 species of plants in Norway spanning up to 50 yr (44 ± 0.5 yr, mean ± 1 SE) and 39 time series on phenotypic and demographic traits of 7 species of northern ungulates from 16 populations in North America and northern Europe spanning up to 30 yr (18 ± 2.0 yr). Plant phenology was significantly related to the NAO in 97 time series (71% of the total), in which dynamics of the NAO explained, on average, between 9% and 28% of the interannual variation in flowering dates. Following increasingly warm, wet winters, most plant species (9 of 13 species) bloomed earlier by an average of 13.0 ± 0.8 d to 26.4 ± 1.8 d, (mean ± 1 SE), one-third (4 of 11 species) bloomed longer by 13.4 ± 1.1 d to 18.8 ± 1.7 d, and there was an increase in spatial variability in timing of flowering across landscapes by five of six species. Woody plants displayed less sensitivity to climatic variability than did herbaceous species, and early-blooming plants were more strongly influenced by the NAO than were late-blooming plants. Ungulate phenotypic and demographic variables were significantly related to the NAO in 28 time series (72% of the total). Large-scale climatic variability influenced growth, development, fecundity, and demographic trends of all seven species of ungulates studied, and in some populations, the NAO acted together with density dependence. Individuals within mainland populations responded to winter warming with reduced body size and increased fecundity, whereas winter warming in maritime regions led to increased body size but reduced fecundity. Across sex and age classes, between 43% and 70% of the observed range in body mass among years was attributable to the dynamics of the NAO, and within cohorts of female red deer and reindeer, 47-70% of the observed range in fecundity was related to the NAO during the winter preceding cohort birth years. All but two populations of northern ungulates declined following increasingly warmer winters, and the NAO operated, in most instances, in concert with direct density dependence to limit populations. In comparison to the original analyses of these ungulate time series, in 10 of 19 series the NAO explained an equal or greater percentage of variation than that explained by local weather. These observations indicate that large-scale climatic variability has a detectable influence on the ecology of plants and animals in a variety of terrestrial ecosystems, and that the responses of plants to winter warming may, surprisingly, be more subtle than the responses of large herbivores.","Climate change; Density dependence; Ecosystem function; Flowering dates; Herbivores, large; North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO); Plant phenology; Plant-herbivore interactions; Population dynamics; Ungulates","climate change; flowering; North Atlantic Oscillation; phenology; population ecology; ungulate; North America; Scandinavia; Animalia; Cervidae; Cervus elaphus; Rangifer tarandus; Ungulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033045072

Many farmers are now pumping groundwater faster than nature is replenishing it, causing a steady drop in water tables. Just as a bank account dwindles if withdrawals routinely exceed deposits, so will an underground water reserve decline if pumping exceeds recharge. Groundwater overdrafting is now widespread in the crop-producing regions of central and northern China, northwest and southern India, parts of Pakistan, much of the western United States, North Africa, the Middle East, and the Arabian Peninsula. An important first step in developing a realistic groundwater policy is for governments to commission credible and unbiased assessments of the long-term rate of recharge for every groundwater basin or aquifer. This would establish the limit of sustainable use. The second step is for all concerned parties-including scientists, farmer and community groups, and government agencies-to devise a plan for balancing pumping with recharge. If current pumping exceeds the sustainable limit, achieving this goal will involve some mix of pumping reductions and artificial recharge-the process of channeling rainfall or surplus river water into the underground aquifer, where this is possible.Over the past 3 decades, the depletion of underground water reserves (known as aquifers) has spread from isolated pockets of the agricultural landscape to large portions of the world's irrigated land. Groundwater drafting and groundwater exploiting are now rampant in the crop-producing regions all over the world, as is exemplified by the cases of India, the western US, and parts of Pakistan. Globally, it is in agriculture that the greatest social risks lie. Irrigated land is disproportionately important to world food production. Along with groundwater depletion, there is the problem of the build-up of salts in the soil, the silting up of reservoirs and canals, the mounting competition for water between cities and farms and between countries sharing rivers, the rapid population growth in regions that are already water-stressed, and the uncertainties of climate change. Few governments are taking adequate steps to address any of these threats. It is only in recent times that groundwater issues have begun to appear in some countries' national agendas. Although workable plans will vary from place to place, clear policies should be made for sustainable groundwater use because the future of agriculture and of humanity itself will depend on how well water is managed.",,"future prospect; irrigation system; water supply; article; Critique; environment; environmental degradation; environmental protection; evaluation; Natural Resources; water supply; World; Critique; Environment; Environmental Degradation; Natural Resources; Water Supply; World; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environment; Evaluation Studies; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032748037

In this paper, we investigated the response of net CO2 exchange in terrestrial ecosystems to interannual climate variability (1983 to 1988) using global satellite observations as drivers for the NASA-CASA (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) simulation model. This computer model of net ecosystem production (NEP) is calibrated for interannual simulations driven by monthly satellite vegetation index data (NDVI) from the NOAA Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) at 1 degree spatial resolution. Major results from NASA-CASA simulations suggest that from 1985 to 1988, the northern middle-latitude zone (between 30 and 60°N) was the principal region driving progressive annual increases in global net primary production (NPP; i.e., the terrestrial biosphere sink for carbon). The average annual increase in NPP over this predominantly northern forest zone was on the order of +0.4 Pg (1015 g) C per year. This increase resulted mainly from notable expansion of the growing season for plant carbon fixation toward the zonal latitude extremes, a pattern uniquely demonstrated in our regional visualization results. A net biosphere source flux of CO2 in 1983-1984, coinciding with an El Nino event, was followed by a major recovery of global NEP in 1985 which lasted through 1987 as a net carbon sink of between 0.4 and 2.6 Pg C per year. Analysis of model controls on NPP and soil heterotrophic CO2 fluxes (R(h)) suggests that regional warming in northern forests can enhance ecosystem production significantly. In seasonally dry tropical zones, periodic drought and temperature drying effects may carry over with at least a two-year lag time to adversely impact ecosystem production. These yearly patterns in our model-predicted NEP are consistent in magnitude with the estimated exchange of CO2 by the terrestrial biosphere with the atmosphere, as determined by previous isotopic (δ13C) deconvolution analysis. Ecosystem simulation results can help further target locations where net carbon sink fluxes have occurred in the past or may be verified in subsequent field studies.",,"biogeochemistry; carbon dioxide; carbon sink; remote sensing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032841541

This ecosystem model has been calibrated for simulations driven by satellite vegetation index data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) over the mid-1980s. Relatively large net source fluxes of carbon were estimated from terrestrial vegetation about 6 months to 1 year following El Nino events of 1983 and 1987, whereas the years 1984 and 1988 showed a drop in net primary production (NPP) of 1-2 Pg (1015 g) C from their respective previous years. Zonal discrimination of model results implies that the northern hemisphere low latitudes could account for almost the entire 2 Pg C decrease in global terrestrial NPP predicted from 1983 to 1984. Model estimates further suggest that from 1985 to 1988, the northern middle-latitude zone (between 30°and 60°N) was the principal region driving progressive increases in NPP, mainly by an expanded growing season moving toward the zonal latitude extremes. Comparative regional analysis of model controls on NPP reveals that although Normalized Difference Vegetation Index 'greenness' can alone account for 30%-90% of the variation in NPP interannual anomalies, temperature or radiation loading can have a fairly significant 1-year lag effect on annual NPP at middle- to high-latitude zones, whereas rainfall amount and temperature drying effects may carry over with at least a 2-year lag time to influence NPP in semiarid tropical zones.","Interannual variation; Net primary production; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); Remote sensing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033044821

Plasma selenium and alpha-tocopherol are reduced in myopathic alcoholics compared to alcoholic patients without myopathy. Plasma carnosinase is also reduced in myopathic alcoholics, implicating a mechanism related to reduced intramuscular carnosine, an imidazole dipeptide with putative antioxidant properties. Together with the observation that alcoholic patients have increased indices of lipid peroxidation, there is evidence suggestive of free radical (i.e., unpaired electrons or reactive oxygen species) mediated damage in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced muscle disease. Protein synthesis is a multi-step process that encompasses amino acid transport, signal transduction, translation and transcription. Any defect in one or more of the innumerable components of each process will have an impact on protein synthesis, as determined by radiolabelling of constituent proteins. Both acute and chronic alcohol exposure are associated with a reduction in skeletal muscle protein synthesis. Paradoxically, alcohol-feeding studies in rats have shown that the imidazole dipeptide concentrations are increased in myopathic muscles though alpha-tocopherol contents are not significantly altered. In acutely dosed rats, where protein synthesis is reduced, protein carbonyl concentrations (an index of oxidative damage to muscle) also decline slightly or are unaltered, contrary to the expected increase. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy can ensue from heavy consumption of alcohol over a long period of time. The clinical features include poor myocardial contractility with reduced left ventricular ejection volume, raised tissue enzymes, dilation of the left ventricle, raised auto- antibodies and defects in mitochondrial function. Whilst oxidant damage occurs in experimental models, however this issues remains to be confirmed in the clinical setting. In the rat, circulating troponin-T release increases in the presence of ethanol, a mechanism ascribed to free radical mediated damage, as it is prevented with the xanthine oxidase inhibitor and beta-blocker, propranolol. However, whilst propranolol prevents the release of troponin-T, it does not prevent the fall in whole cardiac protein synthesis, suggestive of localized ischemic damage due to ethanol.",,"alcohol; antioxidant; propranolol; reactive oxygen metabolite; troponin T; animal; cardiomyopathy; chemically induced disorder; drug effect; heart muscle ischemia; human; metabolism; musculoskeletal disease; pathology; physiology; protein synthesis; review; skeletal muscle; Animals; Antioxidants; Cardiomyopathies; Ethanol; Humans; Muscle, Skeletal; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Myocardial Ischemia; Propranolol; Protein Biosynthesis; Reactive Oxygen Species; Troponin T; MLCS; MLOWN",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033172861

The objective of the program is to improve the performance of stationary gas turbines in cogeneration through the selective replacement of cooled metallic hot section components with uncooled ceramic parts. This review summarizes the progress on Phase III of the program which involves field testing of the ceramic components eta cogeneration end user site and characterization of the ceramic components following the field test exposure. The Solar Centaur 50S engine, which operates a turbine rotor inlet temperature (TRIT) of 1010°C (1850°F), was selected for the developmental program. The program goals include an increase in the TRIT to 1121°C (2050°F), accompanied by increases in thermal efficiency and output power. This will be accomplished by the incorporation of =cooled ceramic first stage blades and nozzles, and a ""hot wall"" ceramic combustor liner. The performance improvements are attributable to the increase in TRIT and the reduction in cooling air requirements for the ceramic parts. The ""hot wall"" ceramic liners also enable a reduction in gas turbine emissions of NOx and CO. The component design and material selection have been definitized for the ceramic blades, nozzles and combustor liners. Each of these ceramic component designs were successfully tested in short term engine tests in the Centaur 50S engine test cell facility at Solar. Based on the results of the engine testing of the ceramic components, minor redesigns of the ceramic/metallic attachments were conducted where necessary. Based on their performance in a 100 how cyclic in-house engine test, the ceramic components are approved for field testing. To date, four field installations of the CSGT Centaur 50S engine totaling over 4000 hours of operation have been initiated under the program at an industrial cogeneration site.

Politecnica de Valencia-CSIC, 46022 Valencia, Spain","The yeast ENA1/PMR2A gene encodes a cation extrusion ATPase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae which is essential for survival under salt stress conditions. One important mechanism of ENA1 transcriptional regulation is based on repression under normal growth conditions, which is relieved by either osmotic induction or glucose starvation. Analysis of the ENA1 promoter revealed a Mig1p-binding motif (-533 to -544) which was characterized as an upstream repressing sequence (URS(MIG-ENA1)) regulated by carbon source. Its function was abolished in a mig1 mig2 double-deletion strain as well as in either ssn6 or tup1 single mutants. A second URS at -502 to -513 is responsible for transcriptional repression regulated by osmotic stress and is similar to mammalian cyclic AMP response elements (CREs) that are recognized by CREB proteins. This URS(CRE-ENA1) element requires for its repression function the yeast CREB homolog Sko1p (Acr1p) as well as the integrity of the Ssn6p-Tup1p corepressor complex. When targeted to the GALl promoter by fusing with the Gal4p DNA-binding domain, Sko1p acts as an Ssn6/Tup1p-dependent repressor regulated by osmotic stress. A glutathione S-transferase-Sko1 fusion protein binds specifically to the URS(CRE-ENA1) element. Furthermore, a hog1 mitogen-activated protein kinase deletion strain could not counteract repression on URS(CRE-ENA1) during osmotic shock. The loss of SKO1 completely restored ENA1 expression in a hog1 mutant and partially suppressed the osmotic stress sensitivity, qualifying Sko1p as a downstream effector of the HOG pathway. Our results indicate that different signalling pathways (HOG osmotic pathway and glucose repression pathway) use distinct promoter elements of ENA1 (URS(CRE-ENA1) and URS(MIG-ENA1)) via specific transcriptional repressors (Sko1p and Mig1/2p) and via the general Ssn6p- Tup1p complex. The physiological importance of the relief from repression during salt stress was also demonstrated by the increased tolerance of sko1 or ssn6 mutants to Na+ or Li+ stress.",,"adenosine triphosphatase; article; fungus growth; gene deletion; gene expression regulation; gene sequence; growth regulation; nonhuman; osmoregulation; osmotic stress; priority journal; promoter region; repressor gene; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; strain difference; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032933350

Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate phosphatase (FBAse) was used as a marker enzyme to reveal the reduction state of the ferredoxin pool, which possibly could be a link in the signal transduction chain. Photosynthesis in the presence of NaHCO3 or inhibition of the Calvin cycle by DL-glyceraldehyde resulted in high activity of FBAse as well as NR. However, other treatments, i.e. illumination in the absence of NaHCO3, activated FBAse only; therefore, a reduced ferredoxin pool was not sufficient for triggering the activation of NR. Inhibitors known to induce an oxidized or reduced plastoquinone pool, respectively, both induced a low NR activity state, showing that different redox states of the plastoquinone pool did not alter the NR activity state. Infiltration of sucrose or glucose into the leaf slices resulted in activation of NR in the dark, indicating that sugars or sugar derivatives could be a link between photosynthesis and NR activation. This was also supported by testing a maize (Zea mays) mutant lacking Calvin cycle activity. In this mutant, light activation of NR was absent. On the other hand high Calvin cycle activity was not always necessary for light activation, because in the presence of DL-glyceraldhyde CO2-fixation was reduced by 97%; however, NR was still activated. Side effects of DL-glyceraldehyde may mask the effect of Calvin cycle inhibition. The ambivalent evidence for involvement of the Calvin cycle in NR activation points to the complexity of the activating system and likely existence of multiple signal transduction pathways influencing the NR activity state.","Barley fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase; Hordeum vulgare; Maize; Nitrate reductase; Photosynthesis; Redox regulation; Zea mays","Hordeum vulgare; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032868010

They can bring moderate to heavy rainfall over large areas and as such are extremely important to the Australian agricultural industry. There are two components of this study. First, a statistical analysis is carried out on 14 years of archived data (1983-1996) to produce a climatology. The emphasis in the climatology is on the frequency, duration and tracks (location and movement) of cut-off lows in southern Australia. Second is a case study of the cut-off low of late August 1997, in which the distinctive features of cut-off lows are highlighted. The results from the climatology reveal the following: there is a maximum in the frequency of cut-off lows in southern Australia during May-October; the most active area for the genesis of cut-off lows in southern Australia is the southwestern region; and the vast majority of cut-off lows move either eastward or southeastward. The case study is aimed at revealing details of the formation and structure of one particular 'classical' example of a cut-off low. It is found that there is strong baroclinicity in the mid-upper troposphere, favourable for the intensification of the low. The synoptic analysis also shows that the moisture supply for the precipitation was transported from the tropical ocean (the Coral Sea) to higher latitude regions by a low level jet (LLJ), forming a narrow moist tongue which interacted with the cut-off low and its associated cold front. The cut-off low was located at the right-front quadrant of an upper level jet (ULJ), which is a favourable position for low system development.","Case study; Climatology; Cut-off low; Southern Australia","climatology; low pressure system; synoptic meteorology; (South); Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033389666

The composition of the cryptogams was related to forest communities (described by vegetation units using forest floor cryptogams and vascular plants) and regional climates (described by biogeoclimatic zones). The study is based on a total of 247 sample plots, each of 0.04 ha in size. The plots were located in three different biogeoclimatic zones and were classified into 12 alliances and four orders in a previous study. We used indicator species analysis to determine cryptogam indicator species for each vegetation unit and biogeoclimatic zone, and used similarity analysis and multivariate analyses (discriminant analysis and detrended correspondence analysis) to detect differences in the floristic composition of the cryptogams among sample plots, vegetation units, and biogeoclimatic zones. Most of the cryptogams in this study had a narrow distribution, and only < 5% of the species were present across all the vegetation units and biogeoclimatic zones. The overall means of Jaccard coefficients between two sample plots from the same vegetation unit (alliance or order) or biogeoclimatic zone were significantly higher (P < 0.05) than those from different vegetation units or biogeoclimatic zones. The difference in the mean Jaccard coefficients within- and between-units was highest for zones. The results of detrended correspondence analysis and discriminant analysis suggest that the composition of lignicolous cryptogams changes with the change in the floristic composition of forest floor vegetation. When the first axes of detrended correspondence analysis were compared, the Pearson's correlation coefficients between the first axes of lignicolous cryptogams and forest floor vascular plants and between the first axes of lignicolous cryptogams and forest floor cryptogams were 0.78 and 0.87, respectively. The degree of correspondence in the composition of lignicolous cryptogams and forest floor vegetation increased from alliance to order to biogeoclimatic zone. This trend suggests that the floristic composition of lignicolous cryptogams is influenced at the community level mainly by edaphic conditions and at the regional level by climatic conditions.","Biogeoclimatic zone; Bryophyte; Decaying log; Forest community; Lichen; Liverwort; Moss; Understory vegetation","bryophyte; climate; floristics; forest floor; lichen; old-growth forest; substrate; British Columbia; Canada",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033394203

This region is characterized by its semiarid desert climate with a winter rainy season dominated by frontal storms, and a summer monsoon season dominated by highly localized convective storms, yielding most of the annual precipitation. Essentially all irrigation needs must be met by surface water stored in various reservoirs. Precipitation is, therefore, the most important limiting factor in Mexico's agricultural production. Traditionally, long-time averages of statistical climate data from few and widely-spaced weather stations were used to determine frequency and amount of water applied, and the algorithms employed usually did not consider the effects of great spatial climate variability and plant physiology. In the past five years, great parts of Mexico, especially in the North, have been affected by severe water shortages resulting from insufficient precipitation (perhaps related to the 'El Nino' phenomenon), combined with inefficient water resources management. Irrigation districts increasingly have to deal with the considerable uncertainty in water resources availability as a limiting factor in the decision making process. In order to address these irrigation water shortages, the Mexican National Water Commission and the Mexican Water Resources Institute are introducing new technologies using agrometeorological networks for more efficient, real-time irrigation scheduling in the main irrigation districts of Mexico. Validation plots established in one particular irrigation district (Carrizo Valley, Sinaloa), demonstrate water savings in the order of at least 20% without any appreciable decrease in crop yields.","Agrometeorological networks; Irrigation efficiency; Irrigation scheduling; Technology transfer","agricultural production; irrigation; semiarid region; technology transfer; Mexico",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344223293

The zinc cluster protein encoded by CAT8 is necessary for transcriptional derepression mediated by a CSRE. Expression of CAT8 as well as transcriptional activation by Cat8p is regulated by the carbon source, requiring a functional Cat1p (= Snf1p) protein kinase. The importance of both regulatory levels was investigated by construction of CAT8 variants with a constitutive transcriptional activation domain (INO2(TAD)) and/or a carbon source-independent promoter (MET25). Whereas a reporter gene driven by a CSRE-dependent synthetic minimal promoter showed a 40-fold derepression with wild-type CAT8, an almost constitutive expression was found with a MET25-CAT8-INO2(TAD) fusion construct due to a dramatically increased gene activation under conditions of glucose repression. Similar results were obtained with the mRNA of the isocitrate lyase gene ICL1 and at the level of ICL enzyme activity. Taking advantage of a Cat8p size variant, we demonstrate its binding to the CSRE.

The logarithm of the thermodynamic equilibrium constants for the NpO2(am) dissolution reactions involving these species [(NpO2(am) + 5 CO32- + 4 H+ ⇄ Np(CO3)56- + 2 H2O) and (NpO2(am) + 2 HCO3- ⇄ Np(OH)2(CO3)22-] were found to be 34.85 and -4.44, respectively. These values, when combined with the solubility product of NpO2(am) [log KSp = -54.9 [1, and recent unpublished data from Rai et al.]], provided logarithm of the equilibrium constants of 33.79 and 43.17, respectively for (Np4+ + 5 CO32- ⇄ Np(CO3)56- and (Np4+ + 2 CO32- + 2 OH- ⇄ Np(OH)2(CO3)22-). © by Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, München.","Carbonate complexes; Np(CO3)56-; Np(IV) hydrous oxide; NpO2(am); Solubility; Thermodynamics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000477408

Emissions data have also been obtained from vehicle inspection testing for approximately 90 000 cars from 3 regions of New Zealand. The testing methodology is described and key findings are presented. Results show significantly lower idle emissions performance for Japanese used import vehicles compared to New Zealand new cars; and significantly better idle performance for fuel injected vehicles compared to carburettor cars. An extensive emissions factor database covering typical New Zealand cars and driving conditions has been generated, which includes over 3000 factors.

In the case of BC I, emission arising from two different environments for the dye is observed. Results of the steady-state fluorescence anisotropy experiments also support the presence of two different environments. At low W0 (=[water]/[AOT]) values (0 &lt; W0 &lt; 10), the excited-state properties of the molecule in the interfacial region are found to be sensitive to the polarity of the surrounding microenvironment. The decrease in the fluorescence quantum yield at higher W0 (≥10) values can be attributed to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the cyano (-CN) group of the dye and water molecules present in the micellar interface. These observations are explained on the basis of the comparable size of the probe dye molecule and the molecular dimensions of the interfacial region in the microemulsions. The large molecular size of BC II is also found to be the reason for the sensitivity of the dye to the microenvironment of n-heptane/AOT/water microemulsions. However, the effects are much smaller than those observed in BC I. A similar photophysical study involving C 35 is found to show no such effects. The smaller molecular size, charge neutrality, hydrophobic nature, and a preferential solvation in heptane are essentially the reasons for the results observed in C 35. © 1999 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001560308

It is shown that the period has witnessed a gradual transformation from rail-dominated transport to road-dominated transport. Infrastructure bottlenecks such as lack of roads and railways network and aircraft are the limiting factors. Emission of local pollutants and carbon dioxide (CO2) because of fuel consumption in transport were estimated. Future transport performance is projected using cointegrating econometric models. The models project that passenger traffic in India is likely to grow at more than 8% per year and freight traffic at more than 5% per year during the period 1990-2021. This will increase the energy consumption and CO2 emissions at equivalent rates. The effects of various policy options aimed at reducing energy consumption and CO2 emission were analysed using a scenario approach. The scenario analysis shows that efficiency improvements can reduce future energy consumption and CO2 emissions by 26%. If the model split is promoted in favour of public transport modes (rail and public road transport), about 45% reduction in energy requirements and CO2 emissions is expected.","CO2 emission; Econometric models; Energy consumption; Indian transport sector","energy use; sustainable development; transportation planning; transportation system; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032721034

Behavioral and steady state evoked potential thresholds were established in each case. Where possible, otoacoustic emission and speech perception results (unaided and aided) also were obtained. Results: One in 433 (0.23%) of the children in our series had evidence of auditory neuropathy. The audiometric findings for these subjects varied significantly, with behavioral thresholds ranging from normal to profound levels. Discrimination skills were also variable. Approximately half of the subjects showed little understanding, or even awareness, of speech inputs in both the unaided and aided conditions. There were, however, a number of children who could score at significant levels on speech discrimination tasks and who benefited from the provision of amplification. Conclusion: The results suggest that auditory neuropathy is more common in the infant population than previously suspected.

The regional availability and transport of water and mineral carbonate appear to be the primary determinants of the strategy's cost and applicability. The bicarbonate-rich waste effluent would be released into rivers or coastal waters, ultimately adding a small amount to the existing, very large bicarbonate reservoir in the ocean.

Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) production in this region may benefit from improvements in water-use efficiency (WUE), the amount of forage and root biomass produced per unit of water transpired. If benefits from improved WUE are to be realized, correlations between important agronomic traits and key physiological traits associated with WUE must be determined under water-limited conditions. This study characterized genetic correlations among C isotope discrimination (Δ), canopy temperature, ash concentration, dry-matter yield, forage maturity, and leaf-to-stem ratio (LSR) in alfalfa grown under water-stressed field conditions. Heritabilities of the traits on a progeny mean basis were also determined. Thirty semidormant half-sib families were evaluated in seeded plots that were irrigated every 30 d during 2 yr near Las Cruces, NM. Carbon isotope discrimination was negatively correlated with canopy temperature and ash content. An increase in dry-matter yield was associated with higher Δ, lower canopy temperatures, low ash concentration, taller shoots, earlier maturity, and reduced LSR. Carbon isotope discrimination, ash concentration, and yield were moderately heritable (h2 = 0.40-.56) indicating that these traits could be altered through breeding and selection. The positive relationship between Δ and shoot yield suggests that germplasms should be evaluated for both Δ and yield when characterizing alfalfa for high WUE to minimize potential yield reductions that may result from selection based only on Δ. Moderate correlations between Δ and canopy temperature or ash content indicated that neither trait provided highly reliable estimates of Δ in water-stressed alfalfa.",,"drought resistance; heritability; plant breeding; United States; water use; Medicago sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032962196

Deforestation is a major land use change in the tropics, with forest resources undergoing degradation through the influence of logging and conversion to other uses. Land use change is a product of varied local and regional resource use policies. Management of forest resources is one such major temporal factor, influencing resource stability and the carbon pool. Under a given management policy, both the long period of forest growth, and the slow turnover and decay of the carbon pool, enhance the relevance of stand level management policies as cost-effective mechanisms mitigating climate change. Apart from regional level uncertainties like the nature of land use and the estimation of carbon storage in vegetation and soil, the carbon flux of tropical forests is greatly influenced by uncertainty in regenerative capacity of forests and in harvest and management policies.

Accordingly, gene expression is induced by ethanol and repressed by glucose. Here, we investigated three carbon source response elements present in its promoter region. Specific deletions as well as functional analysis of the elements in a heterologous promoter confirmed their role in transcriptional regulation. Protein binding to carbon source response elements of the ICL1 promoter was competed by all three elements to various extents by the respective ACR1 sequences. In addition, two putative stress response promoter elements present in the ACR1 promoter were investigated in deletion analyses and shown to contribute to gene expression.

The decrease in the rate of light saturated net photosynthesis (A(sat)) was shown to be the major effect of ozone in leaves with negative consequences for plant growth and the development of plant communities. The reasons for the ozone-induced decrease in A(sat) are still under investigation. Possible mechanisms are an increasing stomatal limitation, an increase in mesophyll limitation including a reduction of the CO2 fixation in the Calvin cycle and an impairment of the photochemical reactions in the grana membranes of chloroplasts. We conclude from the reviewed literature and from our own experiments that a decrease in carboxylation efficiency (CE) seems to be an early event caused by ozone leading to a decrease in A(sat). The loss in current photochemical capacity (F(v)/F(m)) appears with a lag phase of many days and therefore the loss is thought to be a secondary effect due to a decreased demand of 'assimilatory power'.","Current Photochemical Capacity (F(v)/F(m)); Light Saturated Net Photosynthesis (A(sat)); Oxygen Radicals; Ozone","carboxylation; ozone; photosynthesis; phytotoxicity; toxicity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344500795

We hypothesize that the neonatal immaturity of both the acute febrile response and hypothalamus promote neonatal protection from SIDS. Vagal afferents modify the febrile response. Vagotomized rodents displayed a loss of febrile responsiveness in a 'non-sensing' brain. The failure of a 'non-sensing' brain to react to elevated blood pyrogens leads to failure of the febrile response and to a shock-like state. SIDS infants may appear well yet, within hours of this observation, may be found dead. There is a mismatch between the acute febrile response and hypothalamic hypoactivation. The discrepancy increases with development. There is an elevated cytokine response in endothelial cells which induces nitric oxide (NO) production and retarded development of the hypothalamus. Cigarette smoke also induces NO production and retards hypothalamic development by augmented apoptosis. Zinc inhibits this effect in mouse thymocytes. Fetal haemoglobin (HbF) induces hypoxia, which is a stimulator of the immune response while vasodilator gases (carbon monoxide (CO), NO) reduce hypothalamic function.

Nitrate removal is needed to protect human health and to reduce eutrophication and algal clogging in deep groundwater recharge ponds. The source water was the effluent-dominated Santa Ana River and up to 1.5 m3 s-1 (33 x 106 gallon day-1) was treated prior to groundwater recharge. The influent was mostly highly treated, nitrified municipal wastewater containing 3.1-10.9 mg 1-1 NO3-N and was applied to 170 ha (425 acres) of shallow, open water and vegetated marsh in the Prado Basin. Nitrate removal rates as high as 1,000 mg NO3-N m-2 d-1 were observed in some portions of the marsh and exiting nitrate concentrations sometimes fell to as low as 0.1 mg 1-1 NO3-N with residence times of less than 10 days. High nitrate removal rates were observed at loading rates higher than comparable systems; hydraulic surface areas ranged from 0.04 to 0.55 ha per m3 s-1 (2-33 acres per 106 gal d-1) and hydraulic detention times ranged from 0.3 to 9.6 days. Average nitrate removal was 522 mg NO3-N m-2 d-1 (range 4-1071), average efficiency for the entire wetland was 79% (range 14-100). Nitrate loading rates averaged 1458 mg NO3-N m-2 d-1. Calculated nitrate removal by plant growth or groundwater seepage was too small to account for the measured losses, so we conclude that bacterial denitrification was the primary nitrate loss mechanism. Denitrification was probably regulated by available carbon since nitrate removal efficiencies dropped substantially when floods removed most of the vegetation and detritus. This study demonstrates the effectiveness and reliability of constructed wetlands for large-scale treatment of low BOD, high nitrate, low ammonia, effluent-dominated streams in urbanized, semi-arid regions like southern and central California and similar regions throughout the world. Unlike many wetlands, the Prado system was able to remove large amounts of nitrate in a short period, reducing the amount of land needed and making large-scale nitrate removal from rivers a feasible proposition for nitrate-polluted rivers worldwide.","Denitrification; Groundwater recharge; Nitrate removal; Polluted rivers; Wastewater treatment; Wetlands","biological treatment; constructed wetland; denitrification; effluent; environment; eutrophication; nitrate; plant growth; river; United States; water treatment; drinking water; groundwater; removal; wetland; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344809975

Res., 1208 W., Knoxville, TN 37922-6031, United States","Efforts to control cyathostome nematodes in temperate climates have not been uniformly successful, as evidenced by contemporary reports of clinical disease and widespread anthelmintic failure. Indeed, effective control is confounded by numerous factors, including ignorance of local transmission patterns, confusing or conflicting control recommendations, and use of ineffective anthelmintics or regimens. Most of these problems are universal rather than being climatically unique, and it is important to recognize that they are mere symptoms of larger and more comprehensive problems. The most basic problem in managing cyathostomes is inadequate knowledge of biological factors that influence control recommendations. These include population dynamics, arrested development, host resistance, and regional bionomics. Another hindrance is the absence of objective criteria to define effective control. Target fecal egg counts are arbitrary and subjective, and parameters to measure the subclinical impact of cyathostome infection in well-managed horses have not been identified. The final general challenge to effective parasite control is motivation and education of equine practitioners and horse owners, who currently receive much of their parasite control information in the form of biased advertising. Ultimately, more effective equine parasite control will result from collaborative efforts of basic research, clinical application, and improved information transfer.

This type of pollution from the agricultural sector is an important policy issue because it may cause serious environmental and health risks to society. There have been studies that examined the different effects of nitrogen timing and rate practices, but none has yet compared the economic and environmental effects of these practices to site-specific management (SSM) precision technology. This paper examines the economic and environmental impacts of alternative nitrogen management practices, including SSM, within the Lake Decatur watershed of central Illinois. Thus, this study provides evidence on how different nitrogen management practices perform in terms of their effect on water quality and profitability. Data for the analysis were derived from the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agronomic simulation model due to unavailability of actual on-site data. The analysis revealed that SSM of nitrogen fertilizer has great potential in reducing the mean and variability of nitrate pollution in the watershed while improving profitability of producers, relative to the current practice in the watershed. The management practice where fertilizer is applied during the spring at 140 kg ha-1 provides reduction in mean and variability of nitrate pollution comparable to that of SSM. However, SSM technology substantially reduces the variability of net returns compared to the other management practices analyzed. Hence, SSM of nitrogen fertilizer has the potential to reduce nitrate pollution while reducing economic variability and maintaining profitability.","Nitrate pollution; Nitrogen management practices; Precision farming; Site-specific management","economic analysis; environmental economics; management practice; nitrogen; pollution control; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032775736

TCDD- induced 7-ethoxycoumarin-O-deethylase activity was reduced 75% in cultured human endometrial ECC-1 cells exposed to various concentrations of 17β- estradiol for up to 72 h, with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 0.9 nM. Reduced enzyme activity was correlated with decreased CYP1A1 mRNA levels, and transcription. Exposure to TCDD plus 17β-estradiol also reduced CYP1A1 activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells but not in Hep-3B human liver cells or HuE primary human keratinocytes, suggesting that the effect was specific to estrogen-regulated cells. Estrogen receptor antagonists 4-hydroxytamoxifen and 7γ-[9-(4,4,5,5,5-pentafluoro- pentylsulfinyl)nonyl]estra-1,3,5(10)-triene3, 17β-diol restored TCDD- induced CYP1A1 transcription, steady-state mRNA levels, and enzymatic activity in ECC-1 cells. Gel mobility shift assay showed that 17β-estradiol had little effect on Ah receptor binding to its DNA-responsive element. 17β- Estradiol did not alter the induction of another Ah receptor-regulated gene, CYP1B1, suggesting that altered Ah receptor binding to DNA does not mediate reduced CYP1A1 transcription. Transfecting ECC-1 cells with a general transcription factor involved in CYP1A1 induction, nuclear factor-1, reversed 17β-estradiol antagonism of dioxin induced-CYP1A1.

Using a coupled ocean-atmosphere box model that incorporates carbon chemistry and a nutrient budget, we investigate the effect on atmospheric CO2 levels of changes to ocean export productivity in different regions. The primary discovery is the role of water column stratification in controlling the extent to which atmospheric CO2 is affected by regional changes in the biological pump. Stratification manifests itself in two competing ways. On the one hand, increasing stratification causes an increase in atmospheric CO2 sensitivity to export bioproductivity. This results in modeled CO2 being almost an order of magnitude more sensitive to low-latitude bioproductivity changes than it is to high-latitude changes. On the other hand, increasing stratification decreases the rate at which nutrients mix up into the surface layer, thereby setting a limit on the overall magnitude of bioproductivity increase and atmosphere CO2 decrease that is possible in stratified ocean regions. One of the implications of this work is to point to the potential importance of changes in the strength of low-latitude ocean bioproductivity as a cause of the glacial-interglacial atmospheric CO2 change. © Copyright 1998 by the American Geophysical Union.",,"atmosphere-ocean coupling; biological pump; carbon dioxide; glacial-interglacial cycle; productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032732164

A meridional transect crosses parts of High Asia between 43 and 34°N, including the Turgen Valley in the Sailijskij Alatan (Northern Tian Shan), Kuilju Valley in the Kuiljutau (Arpatakyr Plateau between Southern and Central Tian Shan), Oytagh Valley at Kara-Bahtiyar (Western Kunlun), Chaprot Valley in the Western Karakoram and Kaghan Valley located at the southern slopes of North-Western Himalaya. This sequence corresponds with the continental-oceanic change with summer precipitation in the north and central areas and winter and summer precipitation in the south. A brief summary of the results of this investigation follows: The comparison of differences in exposure and altitudinal belts in the study area improves knowledge mainly in the less known Oytagh, Arpatakyr and Sailijskij Alatau. No major floristic relationship between the different mountain ranges was found. There is a distinct border between Karakoram and Western Kunlun that differentiates the Tibet-Himalaya complex from the Tian Shan complex. A distinct transmission of maximum exposure contrasts is present in all five mountain ranges. It shows the semi-arid transition, found in the medium altitudes of the 'dry' mountains and in the lower altitudes of the 'moist' mountains. The application of the similarity analysis is a new approach of plant geography to enable climatological interpretation in semi-arid to semi-humid mountains. The climatic-ecological view leads to estimations concerning the genesis of regional air streams and of humidity patterns. The latter can be used to explain the lack or presence of certain altitudinal belts, e.g. of dark forests in the western Kunlun. The Karakoram and parts of the Western Kunlun, the mountains with the driest foothills, are defined by a high precipitation gradient. The equalization of humidity in the high belts leads to a floristic similarity between the alpine belts of all mountain ranges. The altitudinal differentiation indicates a distinct change of humidity from the arid centre with its elevated position of vegetation-belts, as well as of solifluidal forms to the more humid borders with its depression of corresponding belts. However, some mountain areas in the arid centre show remarkable small-scaled differences in precipitation.",,"altitude; climate classification; mountain region; periglacial environment; Asia; Himalayas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032883080

Among them, iontophoresis (IP), electroporation (EP) and electrolncorporation (El) are purely physical methods involving electrical parameters. EP is a well-established physical method which allows introduction of marker molecules, drugs, genes, and proteins intracellulatly.'3 EP is a nonthermal phenomenon which involves the formation of transient aqueous pathways (pores) in membranes containing lipid bilayers by the application of a brief voltage pulse. This study was performed to compare topical delivery of lidocaine between EP and IP in healthy volunteers. METHODS: After approval by the Institutional Review Board, 10 healthy volunteers (5 women and 5 men) were studied using a double blind, crossover study. Volunteers were randomized to one of 4 EP treatments: 4%, 10%, or 20% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine or placebo normal saline with 1:100,000 epinephrine. An open label study was performed with volunteers randomized to IP (2% lidocaine + 1:100,000 epinephrine) and El (4% lidocaine + 1:100,000 epinephrine and 3 cc of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate) treatment. The order of the treatments were randomized and each treatment was separated by one week. Efficacy measures were performed at baseline, 3,10,20, and 30 minutes and included the following: 1) warm, cool, and hot pain thresholds using a Marstock Thermostat (Somedic AB, Stockholm); 2) the depth of needle insertion for sensory threshold (first perceptible sensation of touch or pressure) and pain threshold (first pain sensation) was measured by inserting a sterile 27 gauge short bevel needle mounted perpendicular to the skin in a modified Starrett Digital Height Gage; and 3) the pain of each treatment was determined using a visual analog scale. RESULTS: All treatments showed a significant elevation of cool thresholds over baseline. The placebo elevated the cool thresholds at 3 minutes only and the electroporation with 10% lidocaine at 30 minutes only; all other times were not significantly elevated in these two groups. All other treatments significantly elevated cool thresholds over baseline at all time points. Warm thresholds were significantly elevated with all treatments except placebo. The electroporation with 4% lidocaine produced the largest elevation in warm thresholds. Hot pain thresholds were significantly elevated with the electroporation with 4% and 20% lidocaine and the electroincorporation with 2% lidocaine. Again the electroporation with 4% lidocaine produced the largest elevation in hot pain thresholds. Iontophoresis, electroporation with 10% lidocaine and placebo showed no significant effect on hot pain thresholds. Iontophoresis, electroporation with 4% lidocaine, and electroincorporation with lidocaine showed a significant increase in depth of anesthesia over baseline. Iontophoresis had the greatest effect. Electroporation with 10% and 20% lidocaine and placebo had no effect on depth of anesthesia. There was no significant difference on the pain produced by each procedure nor did any of the procedures show any detectable plasma levels of lidocaine. DISCUSSION: Electroporation and electroincorporation appear to be superior to iontophoresis in elevating thermal thresholds in normal skin. Electroporation and electroincorporation may deliver a larger amount of local anesthetic into the superficial dermis; however, iontophoresis moves more of the drug deeper into the dermis. This may simply be a duration of treatment effect as the iontophoresis treatment is ten minutes and the other two methods are two 10 second pulses. Further improvements in EP and El delivery will be tested.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747768949

The aims of the study were to compare the relative importance of individual and combined effects of CC, 2 x CO2, and photosynthetic acclimation, and to assess the importance of local site conditions. The model was driven by hourly means for temperature (T), precipitation (P), global radiation (G), vapour pressure (VP), and wind speed (U). Local climate scenarios were derived by statistical downscaling techniques from a 2 x CO2 simulation with the General Circulation Model of the Canadian Climate Centre (CCC-GCMII). Simulations over 14 growing seasons to account for year-to-year variability of climate were carried out for a low, relatively dry site, and a high, more humid site. At both sites, shoot dry matter responded positively to 2 x CO2 with the site at low elevation being more sensitive than the higher site. The effect of assumed changes in climate was negative at the lower, but positive at the higher site. Shoot dry matter was more sensitive to the effects of 2 x CO2 than to CC. Both effects combined increased shoot dry matter by up to 20%. This was attributed to direct effects of 2 x CO2 and increased T, and indirect stimulation via increased soil N availability. Biomass partitioning to roots increased with 2 x CO2 but decreased with CC, while an intermediate response resulted from the combination. Leaf area index (LAI) increased under 2 x CO2, but not enough to compensate fully for a decrease in leaf conductance. Under the 2 x CO2 scenario evapotranspiration (ET) decreased, but increased under CC. Photosynthetic acclimation reduced the effect of 2 x CO2 on shoot growth, but had little effect on ET. The seasonal water use efficiency (WUE) was improved under 2 x CO2, and reduced under CC. With the combination of both factors, the change was small but still positive, especially at the high elevation site with more favourable soil water conditions. This reflects the stronger positive yield response in combination with a smaller increase in ET under cooler, more humid conditions. The results for the combination of factors suggest that except for shoot growth, effects of 2 x CO2 and CC tend to offset each other. While CC determines the sign of the ET response, the sign of the biomass response is determined by 2 x CO2. The results highlight the importance of a site-specific analysis of ecosystem responses by using a flexible approach based on a combination of state-of-the-art downscaling, spatially resolved data sets, and a mechanistic model to obtain quantitative and reproducible assessments of climate change impacts at the ecosystem level.","Climate change; Downscaling; Elevated CO2; Grassland model; Productivity; Water use","carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; general circulation model; grassland; productivity; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032998696

We include the following levels: plant host, plant population, plant community, functional group and ecosystem. Measurements of the contributions of AM fungi at the various levels require the use of different response variables. For example, hyphal nutrient translocation rates or percent AM root infection may be important measures at the individual plant level, but hyphal biomass or glomalin production and turnover are more relevant at the ecosystem level. There is a discrepancy between our knowledge of the multifaceted role of AM fungi in plant and ecosystem ecology and most of the current research aimed at elucidating the importance of this symbiosis in global-change scenarios. Our framework for more integrated and multifactorial research on mycorrhizal involvement in regulating CO2 responses may also serve to enhance communication between researchers working at different scales on large global-change ecosystem projects.","Arbuscular mycorrhiza; Elevated CO2; Global change; Microorganisms; Rhizosphere; Soil Fungi","arbuscular mycorrhiza; atmosphere; biomass; carbon dioxide; environment; arbuscular mycorrhiza; carbon dioxide enrichment; ecosystem response; host-symbiont interaction",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032831427

In order to test if any effects on the symbiosis can persist after long-term treatment, we examined root colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and other fungi of several plant species from two grassland communities after continuous exposure to elevated atmospheric CO2 for six growing seasons in the field. For plant species from both a sandstone and a serpentine annual grassland there was evidence for changes in fungal root colonization, with changes occurring as a function of plant host species. We documented decreases in percentage nonmycorrhizal fungal root colonization in elevated CO2 for several plant species. Total AM root colonization {%) only increased significantly for one out of the five plant species in each grassland. However, when dividing AM fungal hyphae into two groups of hyphae (fine endophyte and coarse endophyte), we could document significant responses of AM fungi that were hidden when only total percentage colonization was measured. We also documented changes in elevated CO2 in the percentage of root colonized by both AM hyphal types simultaneously. Our results demonstrate that changes in fungal root colonization can occur after long-term CO2 enrichment and that the level of resolution of the study of AM fungal responses may have to be increased to uncover significant changes to the CO2 treatment. This study is also one of the first to document compositional changes in the AM fungi colonizing roots of plants grown in elevated CO2. Although it is difficult to relate the structural data directly to functional changes, possible implications of the observed changes for plant communities are discussed. 1999 BîackweJl Science Ltd.","Arbuscular mycorrhiza; elevated coz; Fine endophyte; Glomales; Grassland; Rootcolonizing fungi","arbuscular mycorrhiza; carbon dioxide enrichment; fungus; grassland; root colonization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032840051

The automotive industry and governments in the United States, Europe, and Japan have formed strategic initiatives with the aim of cooperating in the development of new vehicle technologies. Efforts to meet fuel economy and exhaust emission targets have initiated major advances in hybrid drivetrain system components, including: high-efficiency high-specific power electric motors and controllers; load-leveling devices such as ultracapacitors and flywheels; hydrogen and direct-methanol fuel cells; direct injection Diesel and Otto cycle engines; and advanced batteries. The design of hybrid electric vehicles is an excellent example of the need for mechatronic system analysis and design methods. If one is to fully realize the potential of using these technologies, a complete vehicle system approach for component selection and optimization over typical driving situations is required. The control problems that arise in connection with hybrid power trains are significant and pose additional challenges to power-train control engineers. The principal aim of this paper is to propose a framework for the analysis, design, and control of optimum hybrid vehicles within the context of energy and power flow analysis.

In vitro growth of strain A-11 was reduced or deficient on most carbohydrates that supported growth of strain 501R3 but was unaffected on fructose, glycerol, and all amino acids and organic acids tested. Colonization by strain A-11 was significantly reduced (P ≤ 0.05) for cucumber and radish seeds compared to that of strain 501R3, but colonization of pea, soybean, sunflower, and sweet corn seeds was not reduced. Pea seeds released several orders of magnitude more total carbohydrates and amino acids than cucumber and radish seeds and approximately 4,000-fold more fructose. Fructose was the only carbohydrate detected in the seed exudates which supported wild-type levels of in vitro growth of strain A-11. Soybean, sunflower, and sweet corn seeds also released significantly greater amounts of fructose and total carbohydrates and amino acids than cucumber or radish seeds. The exogenous addition of fructose to cucumber and radish seeds at quantities similar to the total quantity of carbohydrates released from pea seeds over 96 h increased the populations of strain A-11 to levels comparable to those of strain 501R3 in sterile sand. Molecular characterization of strain A-11 indicated that the mini-Tn5 kanamycin transposon was inserted in a region of the genome with significant homology to pfkA, which encodes phosphofructo kinase. A comparison of strain A-11 with Escherichia coli DF456, a known pfkA mutant, indicated that the nutritional loss phenotypes were identical. Furthermore, the pried homolog cloned from E. cloacae 501R3 complemented the nutritional loss phenotypes of both E. coli DF456 and E. cloacae A-11 and restored colonization by strain A-11 to near wild-type levels.

Most suggest that resource competition among interconnected plants should be less important than previously thought. If true, that would profoundly alter our perception of how plants interact among themselves and with their environment. However, there are difficulties in quantifying the amounts of resource transferred via CMNs, ensuring that transfer is genuinely through hyphae, not soil, and understanding its control. Carbon movement has not been quantified in many of the published studies. Where it has, its likely functional role has not been clarified. Some recent, well-publicized research suggests that carbon transferred to trees via an ectomycorrhizal (EcM) network may be physiologically and ecologically important. Our view, however, is that the evidence for this remains equivocal. Appropriate controls for the possibility of carbon transfer via soil were not used under field conditions. In laboratory experiments, controls failed to clarify the role of EcM links in carbon transfer. To resolve some areas of uncertainty, abundances of 13C have been measured to estimate carbon transfers via an arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) network connecting grasses and forbs of the same of different species. Permeable barriers to roots and hyphae allowed any direct carbon transfer via soil to be detected. Large amounts of carbon (typically 10% of that roots) were transferred between linked plants via the CMN. Transferred carbon was never transported into shoots of 'receiver' plants. It remained in roots, probably inside fungal structures and, therefore, unavailable to the plants into which it was apparently transferred. Carbon transfer via an AM network does not allow 'resource sharing' among linked plants. It is probably irrelevant to the botanical components of a community, but it may be fundamental for fungal members. The 'mycocentric' view is that fungal structures within roots are parts of extended mycelia through which fungi move carbon according to their own carbon demands, not those of their autotrophic hosts.","Arbuscular mycorrhiza; Carbon; Common mycorrhizal network; Ectomycorrhiza","Arbuscular mycorrhizae; Fungi; Mycorrhizae; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032921388

To assess the relative contributions of carbon dioxide and oxygen to this response and the tumour oxygenation state, the response of GH3 prolactinomas to 5% CO2/95% air, carbogen and 100% O2 was monitored by FLOOD MRI and pO2 histography. A 10-30% image intensity increase was observed during 5% CO2/95% air breathing, consistent with an increase in tumour blood flow, as a result of CO2-induced vasodilation, reducing the concentration of deoxyhaemoglobin in the blood. Carbogen caused a further 4050% signal enhancement, suggesting an additional improvement due to increase blood oxygenation. A small 5-10% increase was observed in response to 100% O2, highlighting the dominance of CO2-induced vasodilation in the carbogen response. Despite the large FLOOD response, non-significant increases in tumour pO2 were observed in response to the three gases. Tissue pO2 is determined by the balance of oxygen supply and demand, hence increased blood flow/oxygenation may not necessarily produce a large increase in tissue pO2. The FLOOD response is determined by the level of deoxygenation of blood, the size of this response relating to vascular density and the potential of high-oxygen content gases to improve the oxygen supply to tumour tissue.","Blood flow; Carbogen; MRI; Oxygenation; Radiotherapy","animal tissue; arterial oxygen tension; article; breathing; cancer radiotherapy; cell hypoxia; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic value; female; hypercapnia; hyperoxia; image analysis; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oxygenation; priority journal; prolactinoma; rat; tumor blood flow; tumor volume; vasodilatation; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Cell Hypoxia; Female; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hypercapnia; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Monitoring, Physiologic; Oxygen; Partial Pressure; Pituitary Neoplasms; Prolactinoma; Radiation-Sensitizing Agents; Rats; Rats, Inbred WF; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032930139

Rochelle). Anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) have been linked to increasing levels in the atmosphere and to potential global climate change. The capture of CO 2 from large point sources, followed by its sequestration as a supercritical fluid into the deep geosphere, is one potential method for reducing such emissions without a drastic change in our energy-producing technologies. Once emplaced underground, geochemical and hydrogeological processes will act to 'trap' the CO 2 as dissolved species and in carbonate minerals. Although dry supercritical CO 2 appears to cause little reaction with the host rocks, once dissolved in water mineral dissolution and precipitation reactions can result. From a geochemical standpoint, sandstones appear to be preferable to carbonates for sequestration operations because fluid-mineral reactions within them have a better capacity for pH buffering. However, individual host lithologies will vary in structure, mineralogy and hydrogeology, and individual sequestration operations will have to take account of local geological, fluid chemical and hydrogeological conditions. This paper summarizes some of the recent laboratory experimental, natural analogue and computer modelling approaches directed at understanding reactions involved in the chemical containment of CO 2.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; supercritical flow; underground storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033372053

But direct fuel losses are high and therefore induce a high fuel consumption and an unacceptable pollution level. We have developed a simple device (named Delayed-Charging) which is able to largely reduce fuel losses by almost separating the scavenging and fuel-charging functions and, consequently, retaining the major part of delivered fuel in the cylinder. Recent improvements, by use of an air-assisted injection combined with an air curtain to deviate the fuel spray trajectory throughout the cylinder, lead to a further reduction of hydrocarbon emission level from 4% (FIDHC methane equivalent) in a standard carbureted engine down to a 1% level associated to a fuel consumption reduction within a larger speed range in our newly modified 50 cc engine. To better understand the behavior of the fuel flow, a local instantaneous fuel-concentration measurement in the exhaust duct by a continuous Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) process (with a Argon Laser beam) is associated to the continuous mean measurement of HC emission, giving information on the fuel transport and utilization throughout the engine.

The study indicated that the basic attributes of the SCTE are higher specific power, hp/pps inlet flow, a flat specific fuel consumption (SFC) characteristic, and potentially reduced exhaust emissions, at the expense of slightly higher SFC, lower power to weight ratio, and increased cost $/hp relative to the ICR. The combustor is paramount to the successful operation of the SCTE in that the feedback (recirculated) flow,must be clean and devoid of particulates that could deposit on the heat transfer surfaces and turbomachinery. Additionally if high specific power is the primary design constraint high reciculation flow ratio combustor technology must be researched. A conservative cycle analysis was conducted with current small gas turbine state-of-art component efficiencies and temperature limits for metallic hot-end components. The analysis was simplified by using existing gas properties for hydrocarbon air mixtures without oxygen depletion, or exhaust products in compression. Although the assumption that the intercooler and recuperator effectiveness and pressure drops remained constant provided a common datum, the part load performance analysis could benefit from the supplementation of improved heat exchanger algorithms.

Car use is also an important factor in other problems including traffic congestion, road accidents, noise pollution, community severance, and loss of countryside from road building. Forecasts of further increases in car ownership and use have prompted calls for policy-makers to encourage car users to switch to other forms of transport, particularly the bus. The effects of substituting bus for car travel in urban areas are simulated by specifying a spreadsheet model incorporating two types of car (petrol and diesel engine) and three types of bus (mini-, midi- and large bus). Six types of exhaust emission are considered for each vehicle type for the years 1992, 1995 and 1999: carbon monoxide, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, (small) particulate matter and carbon dioxide. The paper provides a synthesis of monetary estimates of these exhaust emission and other costs. The other costs considered are traffic congestion, fuel consumption, noise pollution, road accidents and road damage. The exhaust emission monetary cost estimates, mainly from the United States and the United Kingdom, are discussed within the context of a sensitivity analysis which allows for changes in parameters such as load factors, emission factors and the individual exhaust emission cost estimates. The simulation results show that substitution of bus for car travel generally decreases the overall costs, particularly the costs of congestion, but increases exhaust emission costs if bus load factors are insufficiently high. In order to reduce exhaust emission costs from car to bus transfer at given load factors, the most effective policy option is to encourage the reduction of particulate emissions from bus engines. In terms of the overall costs, increasing bus load factors by relatively modest amounts can lead to substantial reductions in these overall costs. These results should be regarded as illustrative rather than definitive, given the uncertainties in a number of parameter estimates and the need for further research in areas not covered by the paper.The effects of substituting bus for car travel in urban areas are simulated by specifying a spreadsheet model incorporating two types of cars and three types of buses.

MTBE groundwater data were correlated wilh the parameters of benzene and total petroleum hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg) concentrations in groundwater and the depth to groundwater. The correlation coefficient shows a poor correlation between MTBE and those three parameters. This article also investigated MTBE plume length and concentration changes over the distance of the plume length and over a period of monitoring time. The data show that MTBE concentration decreases over distance and increases over time at the downgradient well.

High metals solubility also did not necessarily mean high coupon corrosivity. One plant having very high metals solubility was found to have very low corrosion upon a thorough plant inspection.

Tradable allowances have been widely discussed and partially implemented in ocean fisheries, where they appear as individual fishing quotas (IFQs) for some fish stocks. Similarly, tradable allowances are a key issue in the current worldwide debate over the reduction of greenhouse gases. Even the resistant industrialists of the United States seem to be more willing to go along with global greenhouse gas reduction schemes if these schemes permit emissions trading. This article focuses in part on these hybrid property schemes, or 'tradable environmental allowance' (TEA) systems, not only because they are currently a matter of considerable interest in global environmentalism, but also because they offer especially interesting contrasts and comparisons with CPRs. First, TEAs are like CPRs in that they depart from the Hardin/Ophuls dyadic commons solution. Instead of choosing between Leviathan and individual property, TEAs combine the two: Even though they allocate individual quotas of the resource in question, TEAs are created and policed by governments to a degree far surpassing conventional property rights. Second, and more interestingly, each TEA regime confronts exactly the same problem that a CPR does-the problem of managing a large renewable resource stock in a unitary fashion.",,"air pollution control; energy resource; environmental management; pollution monitoring; renewable energy; United States; common property resource; emissions trading; environmental economics; property rights",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033292458

About 20 km3 (16.6 million acre-feet) of water are withdrawn annually from this aquifer. In general, recharge has not compensated for withdrawals since major irrigation development began in this region in the 1940s. The mining of the Ogallala has been pictured as an analogue to climate change in that many GCMs predict a warmer and drier future for this region. In this paper we attempt to anticipate the possible impacts of climate change on the sustainability of the aquifer as a source of water for irrigation and other purposes in the region. We have applied HUMUS, the Hydrologic Unit Model of the U.S. to the Missouri and Arkansas-White-Red water resource regions that overlie the Ogallala. We have imposed three general circulation model (GISS, UKTR and BMRC) projections of future climate change on this region and simulated the changes that may be induced in water yields (runoff plus lateral flow) and ground water recharge. Each GCM was applied to HUMUS at three levels of global mean temperature (GMT) to represent increasing severity of climate change (a surrogate for time). HUMUS was also run at three levels of atmospheric CO2 concentration (hereafter denoted by [CO2]) in order to estimate the impacts of direct CO2 effects on photosynthesis and evapotranspiration. Since the UKTR and GISS GCMs project increased precipitation in the Missouri basin, water yields increase there. The BMRC GCM predicts sharply decreased precipitation and, hence, reduced water yields. Precipitation reductions are even greater in the Arkansas basin under BMRC as are the consequent water yield losses, GISS and UKTR climates lead to only moderate yield losses in the Arkansas. CO2-fertilization reverses these losses and yields increase slightly. CO2 fertilization increases recharge in the base (no climate change) case in both basins. Recharge is reduced under all three GCMs and severities of climate change.",,"global warming; hydrological cycle; precipitation assessment; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032855367

Striving for self-sufficiency and autonomous operation, future life support systems will integrate physical and chemical processes with biological processes, resulting in hybrid systems. A program is being conducted to demonstrate the synthesis of ethylene and other useful products, e.g., polyethylene and ethanol, from metabolic wastes, i.e., carbon dioxide and water, as an adjunct to the Life Support Systems required in manned spacecraft, e.g., Space Station Freedom, and planetary bases, e.g., on the Moon and Mars. These products will be synthesized using inorganic processes based on chemical engineering principles, making use of the major components of metabolic waste, carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. This same technology can be used on Mars by converting carbon dioxide (atmosphere) and water (atmosphere and soils, et.) to ethylene and other useful products for the manufacture of foodstuffs for the life support and plastics for the fabrication of structures and spare parts for Martian bases. In addition, this technology can be used for the production of oxygen and methane for use as propellants in local and space propulsion systems. The program is focused on two synthetic paths to produce ethylene, (1) direct catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen and (2) catalytic reforming of methane produced by the reduction of carbon dioxide with hydrogen, as shown in the following equations. The benefits to be derived from this program are: (1) conversion of metabolic wastes to useful products for use on manned spacecraft and planetary bases, (2) use of indigenous Martian resources for production of useful products for life support, base construction, and propulsion system fueling/refueling, 93) weight savings which result form reduced on-board supply requirements: (4) production of useful products based on efficient engineering principles, i.e., mass, volume, and energy, and (5) reduced resupply form Earth which enables economic exploration and colonization of space. The chemistry and chemical engineering processes which were demonstrated on the program are presented and discussed, e.g., (a) the direct synthesis of ethylene from carbon dioxide and (b) the indirect two-step synthesis of ethylene using water electrolysis and modified Fischer-Tropsch processes. They are directly applicable to the development of closed life support systems for manned spacecraft, lunar and Martian bases, and, ultimately, lunar and Martian colonies, e.g., the conversion of the Martian atmosphere to methane, ethylene, ethanol, and a variety of polymers for construction and other uses. This may be followed by-other interesting syntheses, e.g., polyethylene, a plastic with many varied uses, and ethanol, a potential nutrient for astrobiological research, a foodstuff supplement for astronauts, and a precursor to polyesters, another very useful plastic. © 1999 by Sanders D Rosenberg.

Bate and V.S. Clure). Post-stack reprocessing of the PROBE seimsic data set has resulted in a refined tectonic model of the continental margin between Cameroon and southern Gabon. The margin is divided into the North Douala and Gabon Basins by the Kribi Fracture Zone, a 75-km wide transform fault zone that trends northeast-southwest and intersects the coastline between 2 and 3°N. North of the Kribi Fracture Zone, oceanic crust extends essentially to the coastline and floors the narrow margin off Cameroon. Little or no offshore rift margin exists in the northern Douala Basin. Reflection Moho beneath oceanic crust is relatively weak but continuous throughout the northern Douala Basin. Oceanic crustal thickness is extremely uniform in the North Douala Basin, averaging c.1.75 s in two-way travel time. A distinct northeast-southwest trending structural grain at both basement and reflection Moho levels occurs within the Kribi Fracture Zone. Much of the margin off Equatorial Guinea is influenced or controlled by fracture zone tectonics. South of the Kribi Fracture Zone, oceanic crust is offset c.350 km to the southwest, resulting in a broad rift margin off Gabon that is unaffected by major-offset fracture zones. This margin seems to have evolved by a form of imperfect pure shear, involving brittle, upper continental crustal sheets overlying a series of ductile lower sheets that generally dip easterly to southeasterly. The ductile sheets may unroof at outer highs which mark the boundary between oceanic and continental lithosphere. Dominant reflection events are often associated with the ductile shear zones that define the lower sheets, but a regionally coherent event representing reflection Moho cannot be delineated. The concept of reflection Moho beneath rifted continental crust may be invalid. The tectonic and rheological models presented here can be used to frame hydrocarbon exploration tactics and strategies along this passive margin. In a broader context, elucidation of margin architecture may be a cost-effective way to approach frontier passive margins in the next century.",,"continental margin; crustal structure; seismic survey; Atlantic Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033385022

No significant mortality of embryos occurred before hatching; however, survival of larvae was significantly reduced at the highest concentration for both species. Few deformities were observed, but the incidence of edema was significantly higher in tadpoles exposed to 50 μg/L. Swimming speed and growth of tadpoles was also significantly reduced in this treatment. The percent of tadpoles that reached metamorphosis was significantly lower in green frogs at the highest concentration, and no leopard frogs survived past day 47 of the experiment in this treatment.

The embayment acted as a CO2 source to the atmosphere during the upwelling season (average CO2 flux across the seawater-air interface, P(CO2) = +16 mg C m-2 d-1), despite the elevated net community production (NCP) rates (average NCP = 0.84 g C m-2 d-1). The high pCO2 levels in source Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW) and the reduced residence times within the Ria (~6 d) seem to be the reasons for the observed F(CO2). The CO2 increase associated with CaCO3 fixation by the intensive culture of mussels on hanging ropes did not affect F(CO2) significantly. High F(CO2) values were observed during strong upwelling, which was 3 times larger than the average during the upwelling season. Under these conditions the CO2-rich source ENACW reached the surface and this coincided with low phytoplankton production (NCP = -0.01 g C m-2 d-1). Source ENACW was enriched within the Ria with carbon released from the sediments. F(CO2) was reduced to 1/3 of its value compared to the average upwelling season under conditions of moderate upwelling. Phytoplankton grew rapidly (average NCP = 1.49 g C m-2 d-1) at the expense of the gentle injection of flew nutrients at the base of the pycnocline. Negligible F(CO2) values were observed during upwelling relaxations, when ENACW into the Ria was replaced by the warm and CO2-equilibrated shelf surface waters, F(CO2) reached a maximum during a strong autumn downwelling event because of the concurrence of warm shelf surface water flow into the Ria with strong carbon release from the sediments. CO2 fluxes per unit area always increased coastwards, because of the progressive CO2 enrichment of the source ENACW as it enters the embayment and the decrease of residence times.","Biogeochemical cycling; Carbon fluxes; Downwelling; Rias Baixas (NW Spain); Upwelling stress-relaxation","carbon; carbon cycle; coastal waters; upwelling; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033580058

T2L 2A7, Canada","Paleogeography is the subdiscipline within the geosciences that studies the physical and biological geography of the geologic past, including the configuration and latitudinal distribution of continental landmasses, their topographic relief, climate and biota. In recent years, the study of paleogeography has evolved from simple continental reconstructions to more sophisticated paleocontinental maps that form the basis of paleoclimactic modeling by incorporating elements of oceanic and atmospheric circulation and their interactive relationship with landmasses. A broad range of geologic elements can be reconstructed through paleogeographic studies, such as mountain belts, climate zones, emergent land and continental configurations, many of which impact directly on understanding the driving forces behind geochemical signals contained in the rock record which are used as a proxy for biogeochemical processes in Earth history. Paleogeography is thus an essential component of an earth systems approach to interpreting the geologic past. Paleoconfigurations of continents and ocean basins are determined by a variety of techniques. Paleomagnetic studies are the most common, but additional constraints are provided by faunal provincialism (biogeography) and abiotic continental linkages such as pre-break-up magmatism.

Sediments were incubated at 0°C, 8°C and 24°C for 13 days. Community dynamics were measured by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), and sequencing of 16S rDNA PCR products. Metabolic changes were followed by the analysis of total carbon mineralisation, sulfate reduction, and ammonium production rates. The addition of organic material resulted in significant changes in the composition of the microbial community at all temperatures tested. Sulfate reduction was the main mineralisation process detected. However, not sulfate-reducers but rather members of the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium phylogenetic cluster showed the highest increase in the bacterial cells as detected by FISH. We conclude that these organisms play an important role in the anaerobic decomposition of complex organic material perhaps because they are the main catalysts of macromolecule hydrolysis and fermentation. The molecular methods also indicated a stimulation of ribosome synthesis. The detection of a large number of rRNA-rich cells belonging to the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium phylogenetic cluster further supports the importance of their role in the degradation of complex organic material in anaerobic marine sediments. Their detection in high numbers in the field may indicate recent deposition events.","Cytophaga; DGGE; FISH; Flavobacterium; Marine sediments; Microbial community dynamics; Organic carbon input","ammonia; carbon; organic matter; ribosome DNA; ribosome RNA; sulfate; alga; anaerobic metabolism; article; biomass; catalyst; Cyanobacterium; decomposition; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; DNA sequence; fermentation; Flavobacterium; Flexibacteraceae; fluorescence in situ hybridization; hydrolysis; macromolecule; microorganism; mineralization; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; ribosome; sediment; synthesis; temperature; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cyanobacteria; Cytophaga; Flavobacterium; Flexibacteraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344483898

By late 1999 all datasets will be available for the period from July 1983 through December 1997. The most significant changes in the new D-series cloud datasets are 1) revised radiance calibrations to remove spurious changes in the long-term record, 2) increased cirrus detection sensitivity over land, 3) increased low-level cloud detection sensitivity in polar regions, 4) reduced biases in cirrus cloud properties using an ice crystal microphysics model in place of a liquid droplet microphysics model, and 5) increased detail about the variations of cloud properties. The ISCCP calibrations are now the most complete and self-consistent set of calibrations available for all the weather satellite imaging radiometers: total relative uncertainties in the radiance calibrations are estimated to be ≲ 5% for visible and ≲ 2% for infrared; absolute uncertainties are < 10% and < 3%, respectively. Biases in (detectable) cloud amounts have been reduced to ≲ 0.05, except in the summertime polar regions where the bias may still be ∼ 0.10. Biases in cloud-top temperatures have been reduced to ≲ 2 K for lower-level clouds and ≲ 4 K for optically thin, upper-level clouds, except when they occur over lower-level clouds. Using liquid and ice microphysics models reduces the biases in cloud optical thicknesses to ≲ 10%, except in cases of mistaken phase identification; most of the remaining bias is caused by differences between actual and assumed cloud particle sizes and the small effects of cloud variations at scales < 5 km. Global mean cloud properties averaged over the period July 1983-June 1994 are the following: cloud amount = 0.675 ± 0.012; cloud-top temperature = 261.5 ± 2.8 K; and cloud optical thickness = 3.7 ± 0.3, where the plus-minus values are the rms deviations of global monthly mean values from their long-term average. Long-term, seasonal, synoptic, and diurnal cloud variations are illustrated. The ISCCP dataset quantifies the variations of cloud properties at mesoscale resolution (3 h, 30 km) covering the whole globe for more than a decade, making it possible to study cloud system evolution over whole life cycles, watching interactions with the atmospheric general circulation. Plans for the next decade of the World Climate Research Programme require continuing global observations of clouds and the most practical way to fulfill this requirement is to continue ISCCP until it can be replaced by a more capable system with similar time resolutions and global coverage.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042323504

The critical nature of the various components of the RHC (model, estimator of unmeasured states and parameters, optimisation algorithm) has also been assessed. Moreover, the differences in performance of the algorithms in both simulations and experimental studies has been explored. Results showed that both the linear and nonlinear optimal control algorithms performed extremely well in simulation studies and were able to achieve excellent control while minimising the overall cost.

Greatly varying levels of resources have been available to support modeling, from relatively comprehensive databases and evaluation of performance to a paucity of aerometric data for developing model inputs. Where data are sparse, many alternative outcomes are consistent with the knowledge at hand. Where performance evaluation is inadequately supported, the probability of error may be high. In each instance, uncertainties may be large when compared with the signal of interest, and thus confidence in the reliability of the model as an estimator of future air quality may come into question. This paper proposes a qualitative procedure for assessing whether a particular application of a modeling system is likely to be potentially unreliable, suggesting that either (1) modification and further evaluation is needed, if supportable, prior to adoption for regulatory application; or (2) the model should not be used if improvement is not supportable. The procedure is proposed for use by policy-makers, staffs of public agencies, air quality managers, environmental staffs of industrial organizations, and other interested parties. The proposed use of the procedure is (1) to assess, a priori, whether a proposed application is likely to be judged questionable or unacceptably uncertain in outcome; and (2) to provide, a posteriori, a basis for judging quickly the likely quality of model performance. The procedure is presented with tropospheric ozone as the pollutant of concern. With adjustments, however, the procedure should be applicable for particu-late matter and other pollutants of interest. © 1999 Air and Waste Management Association.",,"air monitoring; air quality control; article; computer model; computer simulation; particulate matter; photochemistry; pollution control; priority journal; reliability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032881599

The Seine river drains a typical Mesozoic-Cenozoic sedimentary basin: the Paris basin, constituted of limestones mixed or interbedded with terrigenous sediments derived from the paleoreliefs bordering the Mesozoic and Cenozoic seas. In the context of quantifying the global influence of carbonate and silicate weathering on atmospheric CO2 consumption, the Seine river offers the possibility of examining weathering rates in a flat sedimentary environment, under temperate climatic conditions. One of the major problems associated with the Seine river, as with many temperate rivers, is pollution. We propose, in this paper, 2 approaches in order to correct the dissolved load of the Seine river for anthropogenic inputs and to calculate weathering rates of carbonates and silicates. The first uses the dissolved load of rivers and tries to allocate the different solutes to different sources. A mixing model, based on elemental ratios, is established and solved by an inversion technique. The second approach consists in using the suspended load geochemistry. Under steady state conditions, we show that the geochemistry of suspended sediments makes it possible to estimate the amount of solutes released during the chemical weathering of silicates, and thus to calculate weathering rates of silicates. The total dissolved load of the Seine river at Paris can be decomposed into 2% of solutes derived from natural atmospheric sources, 7% derived from anthropogenic atmospheric sources, 6% derived from agriculture, 3% derived from communal inputs, and 82% of solutes derived from rock weathering. During high floods, the contribution of atmospheric and agriculture inputs predominates. The weathering rate of carbonates is estimated to be 48 t/km2/yr (25 mm/1000 yr). Only 10% of carbonates are transported in a solid form, the rest being transported in solution. CO2 consumption by carbonate weathering approaches 400 X 103 mol/km2/yr. In the Seine river at Paris, about 2-3 mg/l of dissolved cations are found to originate from the chemical wheathering of silicates. By taking dissolved silica into accounts, the total dissolved load derived from silicate weathering is about 6-7 mg/l. This value is minimal because biological uptake of silica probably occur in the Seine river. The chemical weathering rate of aluminosilicates is estimated to be 2 t/km2/yr. The ratio of physical over chemical weathering of silicates range between 1 and 3 and the total (chemical and physical) erosion rates of sedimentary silicates are about 2-3 mm/kyr. The CO2 consumption by silicate weathering 15-24 X 103 mol/km2/yr and is independent of dissolved silica concentration. Silicate consumption is thus 20 times less than carbonate consumption in the Paris basin. Compared to the neighboring granitic areas, the sedimentary region drained by the Seine river has 2 to 3 times lower CO2 consumption rates. We attribute this difference to the cation-depleted nature of the Seine basin aluminosilicates, which are of sedimentary origin. At a world scale, the chemical denudation rates found for the Seine basin are very low and comparable to those given for tropical lowland rivers draining silicates. such as the rivers of the Congo and Amazon basins, in spite of huge climatic differences. We attribute this similarity to the low mechanical denudation that characterizes these two types of regions.",,"dissolved load; geochemistry; river water; suspended load; water chemistry; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032702635

It is demonstrated that, for high pressures of the working gas and buffer He and Xe species, the inelastic channel provides a dominant contribution to the collisional relaxation of polarization moments. For a low-pressure SF6 gas, the decay rate of the echo signal decreases with the growth in the delay time between pumping pulses, which is associated with the increase in the contribution of molecules with small radial velocity projections to the coherent response. The existence of this effect gives grounds to believe that long-lived states with lifetimes limited by the radiative lifetime can be detected.

The three-dimensional Newtonian hydrodynamics equations are integrated by a Eulerian PPM code on four nested Cartesian grids. The code includes the emission and backreaction of gravitational waves as well as a physical nuclear equation-of-state [Lattimer &amp; Swesty 1991] and the neutrino emission from the hot matter. Lepton number and energy losses of the gas due to neutrino emission are treated by an elaborate neutrino leakage scheme which takes into account neutrinos and antineutrinos of all flavors. Neutrino-antineutrino annihilation in the vicinity of the merger is evaluated in a post-processing step. The gravity of the black hole is described with a Newtonian or, alternatively, with a Paczyński-Wiita potential. The hydrodynamic effect of the black hole is simulated by extracting all matter that flows into a sphere with radius equal to the Schwarzschild radius of the black hole or, in accretion simulations, twice the Schwarzschild radius. The NS/NS and BH/NS merging models yield information about gravitational wave and neutrino emission. Also, they allow us to determine the physical properties (masses, densities, temperatures, estimated life times) of the remnants of the mergers: a black hole surrounded by an accretion torus. In the NS/NS case, a thick disk with a mass around 0.1 M⊙ forms after the massive and very compact central object that contains most of the mass of the merged neutron stars, has collapsed to a black hole, presumably on a dynamical time scale. The dynamics of BH/NS mergers is very sensitive to the neutron star to black hole mass ratio. For low ratios the neutron star transfers mass to the black hole during a few cycles of orbital decay and subsequent widening before finally being disrupted, whereas for ratios near unity the neutron star is already destroyed during its first approach. A gas mass of about 0.5 M⊙ is left in an accretion torus around the black hole. The accretion tori radiate neutrinos at luminosities of up to several 1053 erg/s. Higher luminosities are found for larger disk masses and smaller black holes. The emitted neutrinos and antineutrinos annihilate into e± pairs with efficiencies of a few percent and rates of up to ̃ 2 × 1052 erg/s, releasing an estimated energy of up to ̃ 1051 erg in a pair-plasma fireball. The torus geometry favors relativistic expansion of the pair plasma along the baryon depleted system axis. The occurrence of moderately beamed jets with opening angles of several ten degrees is therefore likely. The jet energies and short accretion times of the tori of about 0.1 s are in the right range to account for the subclass of short and less energetic gamma-ray bursts.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033450981

The lignite content of the forest floor, Ai (0-5 cm) and Cv horizons (1 m depth) was determined by 14C activity measurements and the structural composition of the organic matter was characterised by 13C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy. To obtain a characterisation of the degree of humification, the soil samples were analysed for the content of polysaccharides, proteins, lignin and lipids by wet chemical methods. 14C activity measurements indicate that at the oldest site, comparable amounts of carbon accumulated in the first few centimetres of the soil profile than in natural forest soils. 13C CPMAS NMR spectra of the organic matter in the Ai horizons of the three soil profiles were dominated by aromatic and alkyl carbon species characteristic for lignite, but indicated as well an increasing contribution of carbon species from decomposing plant litter with soil age. When the results from wet chemical analyses were normalised to the total carbon content no changes with age could be noticed. After normalisation of the amount of litter compounds to the recent carbon content, the carbon identified by plant litter compound analysis decreased with increasing depth and increasing age of the soils. After 32 years the values are comparable to those of natural forest soils. These observations were confirmed by increasing degree of lignin alteration with stand age and soil depth. The data of wet chemical analyses complement data obtained by 14C activity measurements and 13C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy and lead to the conclusion that 32 years after reforestation the degree of humification of the soil organic matter is in the same range as those of natural sites.","13C CPMAS NMR spectroscopy; 14C activity; Lignite; Mine soils; Soil organic matter; Wet chemical analyses","Germany; humification; lignite; mining; chronosequence; coniferous forest; humification; mine waste; organic matter; soil remediation; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345440063

Steady-state cold fluids testing was performed to better understand the causes of the cycle-to-cycle variations. Detailed analysis of individual cycles was performed to help gain an understanding of the causes of cyclic variations. The important results were: The primary cause of cyclic variations in IMEP is variations in the combustion phasing (location of 50% mass fraction burned). The expansion ratio decreases rapidly during combustion for retarded spark timing and therefore the phasing determines individual cycle thermal efficiency and IMEP. Variations in the late burn have little impact on the IMEP as this combustion occurs close to EVO and does little expansion work. A combustion diagram analysis indicates that flame quench and misfire at ignition do not contribute to the increase in cyclic IMEP fluctuations as is the case at the lean limit with standard spark timing. Prior cycle effects which occur at the lean limit with standard spark timing also were not found at cold, retarded spark conditions. Improved in-cylinder motion (swirl and tumble) decreased cyclic variations which enabled additional spark retard (relative to MBT timing) and produced lower HC emissions, presumably due to improved mixing. Dual spark plugs further improved stability. This was thought to be due to more repeatable combustion phasing as inhomogeneities in the chamber were ""averaged out"" by the two spark locations.

Nevertheless, strategic management within some nature conservation agencies appears relatively unprepared for the possible consequences of climate change. National level planning of reserve design networks has also tended to skirt the issue, possibly owing to insufficient analysis. This paper provides a first assessment of the possible effects of climate change on plant diversity within the protected area network of South Africa. A climate change scenario of increased temperature but no change in precipitation resulted in derived optimum growth days increasing in some reserves through increased temperature extending the growing season. In some other reserves optimum growth days declined through greater evapotranspiration. We concentrated on the larger reserves of the latter group for which conditions that are more limiting were predicted. Plant species were evaluated in terms of their critical limits in growth days and minimum temperature. Over a third of the species analysed for one reserve (Augrabies Falls National Park and Melkbosrand) was indicated to become locally extinct with climate change. Another reserve in the region showed fewer than 1% local extinctions. It is clear that although a certain magnitude of climate change is a prerequisite for these extinctions, the rate and number of extinctions depend strongly on the different environmental tolerances of the specific biotic components of the conserved area. Potential immigration of other species to Augrabies Falls/Melkbosrand required to balance the projected extinctions with climate change would need migration abilities and conditions that are unlikely to be met. A net decrease in plant diversity may thus be expected. The results confirm that with the climate change scenario used, the concept of sustaining species through fixed protected areas may be fundamentally flawed, at least in certain areas.","Bioclimatic; Extinction; Immigration; National parks; Protected area network; Response surfaces","climate change; community composition; nature reserve; species diversity; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033364412

Radiative association kinetics measurements were carried out in the Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer. Reaction in most cases resulted in adduct formation often followed by sequential addition of a second neutral molecule to the ion. The association kinetics were analyzed to yield binding energy values either by using a variational transition state theory-based approach, incorporating quantum-chemical calculations of vibrational frequencies and infrared intensities, or by using the semiquantitative standard hydrocarbon approach. The competitive collision-induced dissociation (CID) technique was used to confirm the order of relative binding energies for several complexes. Calculations of the structures and energies of a number of complexes were performed, by means of the B3LYP-density functional approach, both to complement and compare with the experimental binding energies and also to address the question of π versus heteroatom bonding. With phenol, the two binding sites are close in energy for nontransition metals, but the π-site is relatively more favorable for Fe+ and probably Cr+. Experimental, literature, and calculated values were combined to give best-estimate binding energies for a variety of metal ions. For the nontransition-metal ions characterized, phenol binding is similar to benzene binding, whereas for Cr+ and especially Fe+ phenol binding is stronger than benzene binding. With indole, binding is always enhanced by ∼5-10 kcal mol-1 relative to benzene. Formation of dimer ML2+ complexes followed patterns similar to those of previous benzene results, except that phenol dimer complexes with Mg+ and Al+ were unexpectedly observed, suggesting involvement of an oxygen binding site in these cases.",,"indole; metal ion; phenol; tryptophan; tyrosine; article; binding site; chemical reaction; chemical reaction kinetics; dissociation; fourier analysis; quantum chemistry; reaction analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033577271

Net loss of carbon from ecosystems would form a positive feedback enhancing anthropogenic global warming. We tested the effect of increased heat input, one of the most certain impacts of global warming, on net ecosystem carbon exchange in a Rocky Mountain montane meadow. Overhead heaters were used to increase the radiative heat flux into plots spanning a moisture and vegetation gradient. We measured net whole-ecosystem CO2 fluxes using a closed-path chamber system, relatively nondisturbing bases, and a simple model to compensate for both slow chamber leaks and the CO2 concentration-dependence of photosynthetic uptake, in 1993 and 1994. In 1994, we also measured soil respiration separately. The heating treatment altered the timing and magnitude of net carbon fluxes into the dry zone of the plots in 1993 (reducing uptake by ~100 g carbon m-2), but had an undetectable effect on carbon fluxes into the moist zone. During a strong drought year (1994), heating altered the timing, but did not significantly alter the cumulative magnitude, of net carbon uptake in the dry zone. Soil respiration measurements showed that when differences were detected in dry zone carbon fluxes, they were caused by changes in carbon input from photosynthesis, not by temperature-driven changes in carbon output from soil respiration. When differences were detected in dry-zone carbon fluxes, they were caused by changes in carbon input from photosynthesis, not by a temperature-driven changes in carbon output from soil respiration. Regression analysis suggested that the reduction in carbon inputs from plants was due to a combination of two soil moisture effects: a direct physiological response to decreased soil moisture, and a shift in plant community composition from high-productivity species to low-productivity species that are more drought tolerant. These results partially support predictions that warming may cause net carbon losses from some terrestrial ecosystems. They also suggest, however, that changes in soil moisture caused by global warming may be as important in driving ecosystem response as the direct effects of increased soil temperature.","Carbon flux; Climate change; CO2; Feedback; Greenhouse gas; Montane meadow; Soil respiration","carbon dioxide; carbon flux; climate change; mountain environment; soil respiration; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032999740

In the past, the Cr3+ centers in LiNbO3 have been the subject of intense debate, which was partly caused by the intrinsic Li+ deficit present in the available congruent samples, which leads to highly complex emission spectra. Recently, stoichiometric samples have become available which show a greatly reduced number of emission lines of defect-related high-field sites in the so-called R-line region. We have carried out extensive absorption, emission, resonant photoexcitation, and time-resolved measurements between 2 K and room temperature to unravel the nature of the dominant Cr3+ sites in LiNbO3. From these studies we conclude that the dominant luminescent center is a Cr3+ ion at a low-field site in both stoichiometric and congruent samples. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

It was shown that the Trichoderma pdi1 cDNA is able to complement a yeast mutant with a disrupted PDI1 gene. The putative T. reesei PD1I protein has a predicted 20-amino acid N-terminal signal sequence and the C-terminal fungal consensus ER retention signal HDEL. The mature protein shows strong conservation relative to other fungal protein disulphide isomerases. The T. reesei pdi1 promoter has two possible unfolded protein response (UPR) elements and it was shown by treatments with dithiothreitol and tunicamycin that the gene is under the control of the UPR pathway. Expression of a heterologous protein, an IgG antibody Fab fragment, in Trichoderma increases pdi1 expression, probably by inducing the UPR. The level of T. reesei pdi1 mRNA is also regulated by the carbon source, being lowest in glucose-containing media and highest on carbon sources that induce the genes encoding extracellular enzymes. The mechanism of this regulation was studied by examining psi1 mRNA levels under conditions where the extracellular enzymes are induced by sophorose, as well as in the strain RutC-30, which is mutant for the glucose repressor gene cre1. The results suggest that neither sophorose induction nor glucose repression by the CREI protein affect the pdi1 promoter directly.","ER stress; Filamentous fungi; Gene regulation; Protein folding; Secretion","carbon; dithiothreitol; glucose; immunoglobulin f(ab) fragment; immunoglobulin g antibody; messenger RNA; protein disulfide isomerase; sophorose; tunicamycin; article; endoplasmic reticulum; gene control; gene induction; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; promoter region; protein folding; repressor gene; stress; trichoderma reesei; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Carrier Proteins; Cellobiose; Cellulose; Chromosomes, Fungal; Culture Media; DNA, Complementary; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Enzyme Induction; Fungal Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Genes, Fungal; Glucose; Heat-Shock Proteins; HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins; Molecular Chaperones; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Disulfide-Isomerase; Protein Folding; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Sorbitol; Trichoderma; Fungi; Hypocrea jecorina; Trichoderma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032884910

Applications to the remediation of other compounds, such as MTBE and perchlorate, that are anaerobically degradable by other reductive mechanisms, are in progress. HRC should be viewed as a tool for the acceleration of natural attenuation at sites that would otherwise require high levels of capital investment and operating expense. HRC is a proprietary, food-quality, polylactate ester that, upon being deposited into the subsurface, slowly degrades to lactic acid. Lactic acid is then metabolized to hydrogen, which in turn drives the reductive dechlorination of CHs. This has been demonstrated effectively in the laboratory and in the field. HRC can be manufactured as a moderately flowable, injectable material, or as a thicker, implantable hard gel, to facilitate localized treatment and passive barrier designs. HRC is best utilized for the remediation of dissolved phase plumes and the associated hydrophobically sorbed contaminant. The use of HRC is not appropriate for use on free-phase DNAPL unless the total mass to be remediated is within the scope of economic feasibility in comparison to alternative treatments. Evidence suggests there is competition between reductive dehalogenators and methanogens in which the methanogens compete for the use of hydrogen in the conversion of carbon dioxide to methane. Some researchers believe that a low concentration of hydrogen favors the reductive dehalogenators and starves out the methanogens. The objective, therefore, is to keep hydrogen concentrations low. The time-release feature of HRC, which is based on the hydrolysis rate of lactic acid from the ester and the subsequent lag time to hydrogen conversion, facilitates this objective. HRC, therefore, becomes a passive form of accelerated natural attenuation, in contrast to the more capital-and management-intensive alternatives now available. Laboratory and field results are presented, the latter expanding on the first uses of HRC by various members of the engineering and consulting firm community. © 1999 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543140507

Submerged macrophytes strongly modify water flow in small lowland streams. The present study investigated turbulence and vertical velocity gradients using small hot-wire anemometers in the vicinity and within the canopies of four macrophyte species with the objective of evaluating: (a) how plant canopies influence velocity gradients and shear force on the surfaces of the plants and the stream bed; and (b) how the presence and morphology of plants influence the intensity of turbulence. 2. Water velocity was often relatively constant with water depth both outside and inside the plant canopies, but the velocity declined steeply immediately above the unvegetated stream bed. Steep vertical velocity profiles were also observed in the transition to the surface of the macrophyte canopy of three of the plant species forming a dense shielding structure of high biomass. Less steep vertical profiles were observed at the open canopy surface of the fourth plant species, growing from a basal meristem and having the biomass more homogeneously distributed with depth. The complex distribution of hydraulic roughness between the stream bed, the banks and the plants resulted in velocity profiles which often fitted better to a linear than to a logarithmic function of distance above the sediment and canopy surfaces. 3. Turbulence increased in proportion to the mean flow velocity, but the slope of the relationships differed in a predictable manner among positions outside and inside the canopies of the different species, suggesting that their morphology and movements influenced the intensity of turbulence. Turbulence was maintained in the attenuated flow inside the plant canopies, despite estimates of low Reynolds numbers, demonstrating that reliable evaluation of flow patterns requires direct measurements. The mean velocity inside plant canopies mostly exceeded 2 cm s-1 and turbulence intensity remained above 0.2 cm s-1, which should be sufficient to prevent carbon limitation of photosynthesis in CO2-rich streams, while plant growth may benefit from the reduced physical disturbance and the retention of nutrient-rich sediment particles. 4. Flow patterns were highly reproducible within canopies of the individual species despite differences in stand size and location among streams. We propose that individual plant stands are suitable functional units for analysing the influence of submerged macrophytes on flow patterns, retention of particles and biological communities in lowland streams.","Flow velocity; Macrophyte patches; Stream macrophytes; Turbulence","flow around object; turbulence; vegetation; velocity gradient; flow around object; streamflow; submerged vegetation; turbulence; velocity profile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032851289

Further enhancement of this polarisation pinning has been achieved by post-annealing after etching. Initial studies have been carried out using photoluminescence and Raman measurements of the VCSEL wafer before and after etching as well as after annealing. Modelling the observed shift in the optical cavity (longitudinal) mode has indicated that etching introduces strain perpendicular to the etch in the active region of the VCSEL of 4 × 108 dyn/cm2. The strain causes the cavity mode to shift to longer wavelength and reduces the spontaneous emission in the direction perpendicular to the etched trenches. The strain introduced by etching is believed to be the origin of this polarisation pinning effect. Measurements of the spontaneous emission profile across the VCSEL facet after etching give valuable information on the mechanisms involved.",,"Annealing; Etching; Light emission; Light polarization; Mathematical models; Photoluminescence; Semiconducting gallium arsenide; Silicon wafers; Spontaneous emission; Strain; Polarization pinning effect; Transverse electric polarization; Vertical cavity surface emitting laser; Semiconductor lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032596948

Interest is, in part, driven by international agreements wherein governments are required to establish emission inventories and to develop means to stabilize or reduce national emissions. Although techniques and models for quantifying gas fluxes have improved considerably for some gases and sources, the uncertainties in the national, regional, and global budgets for a number of atmospheric compounds remain. In this paper, we review estimates of the emission of methane from rice fields both on a global scale and on a country scale, using China as an example. Several reported methods of obtaining an annual methane emission value for China are reviewed. A comparison among them yields a suggested emission value of 13.0 ± 3.3 Tg yr-1 and a range from 9.7 to 16.2 Tg yr-1. Several strategies are suggested for future requirements to obtain greater accuracy in regional and country emission values.

Aviation accounts for up to 180 Tg/year of fuel or 2.2% of global anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Higher surface temperatures and a sea level rise are linked to the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Global air traffic emits about 1.9 Tg of nitrogen oxides per year; that is far less than emitted by other sources. Small as they are they nonetheless have notable effects on the NOx concentration near the tropopause and influence the ozone concentration. It seems that aviation induced ozone is particularly effective in heating the troposphere. Computational studies have shown that ozone changes cause regional surface temperature changes large enough to be discernible from climatic noise at the time scale of a few decades. Aircraft also emit water vapor, a greenhouse gas, which increases the relative humidity and hence the tendency to form clouds. On a regional scale that may lead to the formation of long-lived condensation trails which in turn may trigger an increase in cirrus cloud cover. Computations with the global climate model ECHAM show that in regions with heavy air traffic and a typical mean cirrus cloudiness of 20% a 5% increase to 25% causes a noticeable regional temperature change of about 1K. At present and on a global scale, surface temperature changes due to the combined effects of aviation emissions are small but they are distinguishable regionally. However, the increase in aviation fuel consumption is substantially larger than the increase in consumption of all fossil fuels, and future growth is expected to continue to surpass all improvements in fuel efficiency. Model calculations were made to evaluate the long time impact of aviation emissions of CO2 and NOx on the atmospheric composition and the climate. The calculations were based on different scenarios reaching from 1992 to 2050 and beyond. Past fuel consumption was estimated according to aviation production values provided for 1960 to 1995 by the International Energy Agency, and extrapolated backwards to 1940. Over the past decades, aviation fuel consumption grew on an average by 4% annually. The integral fuel consumption was estimated to have reached 4.6 Pg (4 Pg of carbon) in 1995. During the same time frame CO2 emissions from air traffic added about 1.4 ppmv to the atmospheric CO2 concentration or 1.7% of the total CO2 increase since 1800. Calculations indicate that, by 1995, the global mean surface temperature increased by about 0.004 K and the sea level rose by 0.024 cm due to CO2 emissions, whereas the transient responses to ozone change amounted to 0.03 K in surface temperature and 0.15 cm in sea level in 1995. Future emissions of subsonic air traffic were based on an aviation fuel consumption of 309 and 488 Tg/yr in 2015 and 2050, respectively, and an annual increase rate of I% until 2100. The emission index of NOx was assumed either to stay constant or to vary according to different scenarios. The model then predicts a CO2 concentration change of 13 ppmv by 2100, causing temperature increases of 0.01, 0.02, 0.05 K, and sea level increases of 0.06, 0.15, 0.34 cm in the years 2015, 2050, 2100, respectively, due to CO2 emissions. Including the radiative forcing due to the ozone effects linearly with fuel consumption additionally raises temperatures and sea levels to 0. 11 (0.22) K and 0.71 (1.53) cm by 2050 (2100). The aviation share in anthropogenic CO2 loading of the atmosphere increases from 1.7% at present to 3.3% by 2100 in this scenario. The estimated effects on the climate of ozone change due to aircraft NOx emissions amount to up to 5 times that of C02. Therefore ozone changes dominate the climate effects. Accordingly, the reduction of Nox emissions through the introduction of low NOx combustor technology will have a strong impact on mitigating adverse climatic effects. © 1999 American Institute of Aeronautics & Astronautics.",,"Air pollution; Aircraft; Atmospheric composition; Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric radiation; Aviation; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Clouds; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Sea level; Surface properties; Transient analysis; Anthropogenic activity; Computational studies; Global climate model; Global mean surface temperature; International energy agency; Regional surface temperature; Surface temperature changes; Surface temperatures; Atmospheric temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983169951

The decomposition of methane and carbon dioxide molecules is caused by direct electron collision via excitation of the unstable electronic state. Mechanisms of dissociation of methane and carbon dioxide by electron impact were proposed and the conversions of each gas were derived from the proposed mechanisms. As a result, the conversion of each gas only depended on the specific energy of the molecules. The energy costs for the decomposition of methane and carbon dioxide could be determined through the experimental data. The major gaseous products of the decomposition of methane were hydrogen and C2 and/or C3 compounds. In the case of methane, some different reaction mechanisms were observed on the range of input power, and a small amount of film deposition inside the reactor by polymerization was observed at high input power. Carbon monoxide was mainly produced from the decomposition of carbon dioxide. © 1999 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Dissociation; Electron energy levels; Methane; Molecules; Plasmas; Polymerization; Electron collision; Radio frequency discharge; Decomposition; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; methane; article; decomposition; dissociation constant; electron transport; pressure; radiofrequency radiation; reaction analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032793659

According to model results, the recently promulgated 8 h NAAQS at a level of 0.08 ppmv will require larger emission reductions to comply with the standard than those-that are necessary to comply with the previous 1 h/0.12 ppmv NAAQS. Regardless of the form of the NAAQS or the magnitude of the concentrations of O3 and its precursors at the model domain boundary, UAM-IV simulations for Atlanta predict that NO(x) (NO + NO2) emission reductions are more effective than volatile organic compound reductions in mitigating O3 pollution. Moreover, the simulations indicate that NO(x) emission reductions greater than 60-75% would be required to demonstrate attainment under either form of the standard, even if boundary concentrations of O3 and its precursors were substantially reduced. Further research is necessary to determine if this weak response to emission controls is truly representative of the real atmosphere, or is a result of the meteorological conditions specific to this episode, or is an artifact of the UAM-IV model or its inputs.","8 h average, Regulatory standard; Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Ozone","Emission reductions; Air pollution control; Air quality; Computer simulation; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Regulatory compliance; Standards; Atmospheric chemistry; ozone; air quality; boundary conditions; emission control; model; nitrogen oxides; ozone; pollution policy; urban area; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; article; ozone layer; priority journal; simulation; United States; urban area; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033103785

Archived meteorological data for September and October, 1984, were obtained from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting and used to drive the offline chemical transport model simulations. Base-case CO emissions were generated by applying emission factors to compiled inventories for related or co-emitted trace species. Simulation results from September and October have been compared with a recent re-release of the 1984 MAPS data and with in situ correlative data taken during the MAPS mission. Because of unrealistically large spatial variability in N2O mixing ratios measured concurrently by MAPS, model results were also compared with an adjusted CO data set generated by assuming that errors in N2O measured mixing ratios were correlated with errors in the MAPS CO data. These comparisons, in conjunction with simulations probing model sensitivities, led to the conclusion that biomass burning CO emissions from central and southern Africa may have been larger during September and October, 1984, than our initial best estimate based on the CO2 emissions data of Hao et al. (1990. Fire in the Tropical Biota; Ecosystem Processes and Global Challenges. Springer, Berlin, pp. 440-462; 1994. Global Biogeochemical Cycles 8, 495-503). This result is in disagreement with recent estimates of biomass burning emissions from Africa (Scholes et al., 1996, Journal of Geophysical Research 101, 23677-23682) which are smaller than previously thought for emissions from this region. Although unknown model deficiencies cannot be conclusively ruled out, model sensitivity studies indicate that increased CO emissions from central and southern Africa offer the best explanation for reducing observed differences between model results and MAPS data for this time period. Our results, in combination with a disparity in recent CO emission estimates from this region (Scholes et al., 1996; Hao et al., 1996, Journal of Geophysical Research 101, 23577-23584), and in light of recent indications of highly variable biomass burning activities from the tropical western Pacific (Folkins et al., 1997, Journal of Geophysical Research 102, 13291-13299), seem to suggest that biomass burning emissions exhibit significant year-to-year variability. This large variability of emissions sources makes the accurate simulation of specific time periods very difficult and suggests that biomass burning trace species inventories may have to be developed specifically for each simulated time period, employing satellite-derived information on fire coverage and flame intensity.

The photochemical CO source strength from standing dead plant material and litter in various grassland ecosystems and deciduous forests ranges from 20 to 65 Tg CO per year (1 Tg 1012 g). Accounting for potentially CO emitting ecosystems not included in the data set, we estimate that 60 ± 30 Tg of CO are annually emitted by photochemical degradation of decaying plant matter, mostly in the tropics. We further estimate thermal CO production from the global topsoil non-woody litter pool on the basis of global climate data and measured Arrhenius parameters to add another 40 Tg CO per year, much depending on the chosen parameters, and probably uncertain by a factor of 2. The total global source of CO by these mechanisms may thus be in the range 100-50+70 Tg CO per year. Although the estimated CO source strength is a relatively small contribution to the global CO budget (2-8%), CO emissions may significantly compensate for CO deposition on soils in the tropics during certain times of the year. Currently, modeling studies mostly impose a constant CO deposition velocity from the atmosphere to the soil surface, based generally on measurements on bare soil. Future modeling efforts may need to include geographical and photochemical factors which play a role in CO exchange in tropical ecosystems.",,"carbon emission; decomposition; degradation; plant; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033384241

Selective etching of SiO2-to-Si3N4 in various inductively coupled fluorocarbon plasmas (CHF3, C2F6/C3F6, and C3F6/H2) was performed, and the results compared to selective SiO2-to-Si etching. A fluorocarbon film is present on the surfaces of all investigated substrate materials during steady state etching conditions. A general trend is that the substrate etch rate is inversely proportional to the thickness of this fluorocarbon film. Oxide substrates are covered with a thin fluorocarbon film (&lt;1.5 nm) during steady-state etching and at sufficiently high self-bias voltages, the oxide etch rates are found to be roughly independent of the feedgas chemistry. The fluorocarbon film thicknesses on silicon, on the other hand, are strongly dependent on the feedgas chemistry and range from ∼2 to ∼7 nm in the investigated process regime. The fluorocarbon film thickness on nitride is found to be intermediate between the oxide and silicon cases. The fluorocarbon film thicknesses on nitride range from ∼1 to ∼4 nm and the etch rates appear to be dependent on the feedgas chemistry only for specific conditions. The differences in etching behavior of SiO2, Si3N4, and Si are suggested to be related to a substrate-specific ability to consume carbon during etching reactions. Carbon consumption affects the balance between fluorocarbon deposition and fluorocarbon etching, which controls the fluorocarbon steady-state thickness and ultimately the substrate etching. © 1999 American Vacuum Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033479880

To apply dispersion models to odour emissions, the odour concentration and the volume flow of the outlet air must be known. In this paper, the odour concentration of the outlet air is determined by combining a steady-state balance model to calculate the outlet air temperature and the volume flow with a simple model for the odour release inside the livestock building. The results show a distinct diurnal and annual variation of the odour concentration due to the variability of the volume flow. The mean odour concentration during daytime in the summer months lies in a very narrow range close to the overall minimum. Odour concentration derived from odour emission and the maximum volume flow of the animal house is useful for model calculations. During a clear-sky summer period, the model predicts a nighttime odour concentration of about 4.6 times the daytime concentration due to the reduced volume flow at night. To improve the calculation of odour concentrations by dispersion models, the annual and diurnal variation of the odour release has to be taken into account. The model suggests that long-term measurements of the odour emissions of animal houses are necessary for regulatory and legal purposes. © 1999 Silsoe Research Institute.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001722522

Basel, S., Basel, Switzerland","Planning processes are strongly influenced by an increased awareness of environmental issues concerned by projected land-use transformations. A research project was carried out to produce climate maps for the region of Basel/Switzerland to enable planning authorities taking care of the urban climate and its interrelations with urban structures. Main focus was given to develop and implement a methodology meeting not only the regional requirements of Basel. The new approach is not depending on subjective criteria or manual interventions and ensures its applicability for other regions. Three basic concepts were developed or improved in this study. A new definition of 'climatopes' was introduced, and methods were developed for their digital determination by objective criteria. This definition of climatopes requires adequate information on land-use, which is provided by introducing the concept of 'areal types'. In contrast to 'traditional' land-use classes directly derived from satellite images, areal types are complex aggregates reflecting not only different physical surface properties, but also socioeconomic aspects of land-use. 'Ventilation classes' are the second component required to delineate climatopes. They summarize the combined influencing factors of terrain features and land-use structures on wind field and urban ventilation. Their determination is based on topographic information and surface properties derived from a digital terrain model and from land-use data. The spatial distribution of climatopes was computed for Basel. Various quality assessment procedures and the application of climatopes for an automated generation of planning guidelines demonstrate the applicability of the concepts. Climate maps containing the results of the analysis and evaluation of the urban climate of Basel were estimated by the involved planners to be a valuable tool meeting their practical requirements to a high degree.

To find the optimal engine set up, the variation of a large number of engine and injection system parameters, i.e. injection system, number of nozzle holes and sizes, injection rate profiles, etc. is required. To speed up the design process, modern optical engine diagnostics and 3D-numerical simulation can help to analyse the highly transient in-cylinder processes in detail. These methods provide essential insight to understand the complicated physical and chemical interactions and acting mechanisms during mixture formation, combustion and pollutant formation as well as the function of components of the system. In this paper most useful state-of-the-art optical diagnostic tools, i.e. transparent engine with high speed combustion photography, 0D and 2D soot -temperature and - relative concentration analysis, as well as 3D-numerical combustion simulation are presented and discussed. The application of these modern techniques in addition to conventional engine bench tests is demonstrated in a comparison of the performances of a Pump Line Nozzle (PLN) and a Common Rail (CR) Injection system. This analysis shows that a CR system with the current design does not provide advantages for HD truck engines when compared with a modern PLN system.

The Air Management Information System is an information- exchange system in the scheme of the Global Air Quality Partnership providing information on all issues of air quality management between its participants: municipalities, countries' environmental protection agencies, international organizations, World Bank and international development banks, and nongovernmental organizations. Public health studies of air pollution-induced health effects are an important ingredient for decisions with respect to the management of air quality. First, they are to be used to derive air quality standards from air quality guidelines. Secondly, they serve to assess the causal link between observed health effects in the population and the causative agents in the air. Thirdly, they can be used to estimate ideal (in the sense of not being expressed in monetary terms) or economic damage functions that are necessary to assess the magnitude of the ideal or economic damages to human health. The latter are necessary for a sensible cost-benefit analysis in which the costs of control measures to reduce air pollution are compared with the costs of health effects.","Air pollution; Air quality management; Risk assessment; Risk management","air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality standard; conference paper; cost benefit analysis; data base; environmental management; health program; health promotion; information system; priority journal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032812310

One of these sensors, the TIROS-N Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS), observes earth-emitted radiation in 27 wavelength bands within the infrared and microwave portions of the spectrum, thereby creating a valuable resource for studying the climate of our planet. The NOAA-NASA Pathfinder program was conceived to make these data more readily accessible to the community in the form of processed geophysical variables. The Atmospheric Radiation Analysis group at the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique of France was selected to process TOVS data into climate products (PathB). The Improved Initialization Inversion (3I) retrieval algorithm is used to compute these products from the satellite-observed radiances. The processing technique ensures internal coherence and minimizes both observational and computational biases. Products are at a 1° × 1° latitude-longitude grid and include atmospheric temperature profiles (up to 10 hPa); total precipitable water vapor and content above four levels up to 300 hPa; surface skin temperature; and cloud properties (amount, type, and cloud-top pressure and temperature). The information is archived as 1-day, 5-day, and monthly means on the entire globe; A.M. and P.M. products for each satellite are stored separately.

Excitation spectra, with undispersed detection of the fluorescence, have been recorded at the Daresbury UK source with a resolution of 0.1 nm, corresponding to an average energy resolution of ca. 0.015 eV. Dispersed emission spectra in the range 200-700 nm have been recorded at the BESSY 1 Germany source with an optical resolution of 8 nm, following photoexcitation at the energies of the peaks in the excitation spectra. Action spectra, in which the vacuum-UV energy is scanned with detection of the fluorescence at a specific wavelength, have also been recorded at BESSY 1 with a resolution of 0.3 nm; thresholds for production of a particular excited state of a fragment are then obtained. Using single-bunch mode, lifetimes of all the emitting states that fall in the range ca. 3-100 ns have been measured. For photon energies in the range 8-12 eV, emission is due to both CCl2 A 1B1-X 1A1 and CXCl 1A-X 1A'. These products form by photodissociation of low-lying Rydberg states of CCl3X, and the thresholds for their production therefore relate to energies of the Rydberg states of the parent molecule. It is not possible to say whether the other products form as two halogen atoms or a diatomic molecule. For energies in the range 13-17 eV, emission is due to diatomic fragments; CCl A 2Δ, CF B 2A, CH B 2Σ- and A 2A, CBr A 2Δ, and Cl2 D' 2 3Π(g). From their threshold energies, there is now accumulated evidence that the excited state of CCl or CX forms in association with three isolated atoms. Our results yield no information on whether the three bonds in CCl3X* break simultaneously or sequentially. In the range 13-17 eV, Cl*/2 almost certainly forms in conjunction with ground-state CX + Cl. This ion- pair state of Cl2 also forms at higher excitation energies around 20 eV, probably with atomic products C + X + Cl. In no cases is emission observed from excited states of either the CCl3 radical or the parent molecular ion, CCl3X+.",,"bromine derivative; carbon; chloride; fluoride; article; chemical bond; enthalpy; fluorescence spectroscopy; optical resolution; photolysis; photon; spectral sensitivity; stereospecificity; ultraviolet spectroscopy; vacuum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033105194

We mainly used a technical polymer (Makrolon 2808, Bayer) made by injection-moulding, as well as spin coated bisphenol A carbonate (n = 1) and polycarbonate (PC) (n = 115). The mass spectroscopy during the etching process shows the degradation of the PC in the form of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and methyl groups. The photoelectron spectroscopy shows in detail the surface modification after Ar plasma treatment and metallisation. The plasma induces a reduction of the carboxylic carbon (C 1s), a strong reduction of singly bonded oxygen (O 1s) and also a slight reduction of doubly bonded oxygen. After Al metallisation, a reaction of Al with the oxygen groups and an interaction with the aromatic system is documented. Ar plasma etching increases the chemical interaction of Al mainly with the aromatic carbon. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy of metallised PC under different initial conditions shows a strong influence of incorporated water in the PC bulk that cannot be seen by XPS on uncoated PC. The O 1s signal increases during metallisation and results in an oxidation of Al probably caused by the fact that the hydrophobic surfaces becomes hydrophillic. Temperature-dependent XPS was done on technical PC samples and on spin coated samples (n = 1, n = 115) and supports the influence of the bulk state for the Al-PC interface. For n = 1 carbonate, a diffusion of Al into the PC volume was observed. The SFM measurements showed a roughening effect on the nanometer scale even after short treatment times. Al can be seen as a weakly bound cluster on the virgin PC, and if a pre-etching is done, Al seems to grow as a good wetting film. The adhesion force of Al films on PC without any influence of the volume can be explained by the chemical bonding of Al to the carboxylic and aromatic systems.

The empirical materials used were documents underlying decisions and personal observations at seven CLRTAP POPs meetings. In order to describe and analyze the role of environmental science and politics in identifying an initial list of regulated substances, we have chronologically recapitulated the CLRTAP POPs process leading up to the adoption of the POPs Protocol. Our work was guided by two research questions: What was the strength of the interplay and were there any key events of interplay? Our analysis revealed a strong interplay between environmental science and policy-making throughout the process, mutually (but not always equally) affecting each other. We have identified four events of interplay that were of significance for the final outcome: the initial problem identification, the selection of CLRTAP as a forum for cooperative actions, the screening of possible protocol POPs, and finally, the concluding protocol negotiations.","Convention on long-range transboundary air pollution; Negotiations; Persistent organic pollutants; Risk assessment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345778536

The survey is based largely on the responses of 19 climate modellers to several questions and a discussion document circulated in 1995. We interpret the responses in terms of the following factors: the implicit assumptions which scientists hold about how the environmental policy process deals with scientific uncertainty over human-related global warming; the different scientific styles that exist in climate research; and the influence of organisations, institutions, and policy upon research agendas. We find evidence that scientists' perceptions of the policy process do play a role in shaping their scientific practices. In particular, many of our respondents expressed a preference for keeping discussion of the issue of flux adjustments within the climate modeling community, apparently fearing that climate contrarians would exploit the issue in the public domain. While this may be true, we point to the risk that such an approach may backfire. We also identify assumptions and cultural commitments lying at a deeper level which play at least as important a role as perceptions of the policy process in shaping scientific practices. This leads us to identify two groups of scientists, 'pragmatists' and 'purists', who have different implicit standards for model adequacy, and correspondingly are or are not willing to use flux adjustments.",,"climate change; climate modeling; general circulation model; policy analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032842592

The aim of this study was to examine a contributory role for caveolin-1, a putative negative regulator of endothelial NO synthase, in mediating deficient intrahepatic NO production in the intact cirrhotic liver. Methods: Cirrhosis was induced by carbon tetrachloride inhalation. Flow regulation of NO production and perfusion pressure was examined in the perfused rat liver. Protein expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), caveolin, and calmodulin was examined by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. NOS activity and NO production were assessed by citrulline generation and chemiluminescence, respectively. Protein-protein interactions were examined using whole tissue protein immunoprecipitation. Results: In response to incremental increases in flow, cirrhotic animals produced significantly less NO(x) than control animals. NOS activity was significantly reduced in liver tissue from cirrhotic animals compared with control animals in the presence of similar eNOS protein levels. Deficient eNOS activity was associated with a several-fold increase in binding of eNOS with caveolin. Protein levels of caveolin-1 were markedly increased in the cirrhotic liver. Conclusions: These studies provide evidence that enhanced expression and interaction of caveolin with eNOS contribute to impaired NO production, reduced NOS activity, and vasoconstriction in the intact cirrhotic liver.",,"calmodulin; carbon tetrachloride; caveolin; isoenzyme; isoprotein; nitric oxide; nitric oxide synthase; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cellular distribution; concentration response; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme localization; enzyme repression; experimental liver cirrhosis; liver histology; liver level; liver perfusion; male; nonhuman; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein binding; protein determination; protein expression; protein protein interaction; rat; vasoconstriction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032738990

Similar to findings of past studies, a statistically significant correlation exists between minorities (particularly Hispanics and Native Americans) and the location of new stationary sources of air pollution in the Denver Metropolitan area. This correlation between minority status and pollution may be due to the fact there exists a correlation between race and socioeconomic factors such as high unemployment rates, high percentage of housing being rental units and low incomes. Therefore, a causal multiple regression model was developed to isolate these socioeconomic factors at the time of the siting decision from minority status of the population. Several of these socioeconomic factors appear to be the determining factors in the location of new stationary sources of air pollution in the Denver, Colorado Metropolitan area. We hypothesize that firms find that certain demographic factors make it less costly in time and effort to site major air pollution point sources.

This approach provides a single estimation of the permeability tensor for the complete heterogeneous rock volume where the seismic emission was recorded. The approach is an extension of the method proposed by Shapiro et al. (1997) for the isotropic case. It is based on the hypothesis that the triggering front of the hydraulic-induced microseismicity propagates like a low-frequency second-type compressional Biot wave (corresponding to the process of pore-pressure relaxation) in an effective homogeneous anisotropic poroelastic fluid-saturated medium. The permeability tensor of this effective medium is the permeability tensor of the heterogeneous rock volume upscaled to the characteristic size of the seismically active region. We demonstrate the method using the microseismic data collected during the Hot Dry Rock Soultz-sous-Forets experiment (Dyer et al. 1994). These data show that the corresponding rock volume is characterized by a significant permeability anisotropy caused by oriented crack systems. The maximal principal component of the permeability tensor has a subvertical orientation. It is about seven times larger than the minimal subhorizontal principal component.","Fluid dynamics; Hydrofracturing; Microseismicity; Permeability tensor; Poroelasticity","hydraulic fracture; in situ test; induced seismicity; permeability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033005453

Especially susceptible to dust coating are the resinous, evergreen leaves of the dominant creosote bush (Larrea tridentata) wherever these shrubs grow along unpaved roads and trails and at the margins of dry playas. A year-long field study was conducted, begun during summer drought, to investigate effects of summer irrigation on heavily dusted plants of L. tridentata. Plant water relations, quantitative phenology, and gas exchange were monitored for sets of five plants under three conditions: dusted nonirrigated, dusted irrigated, and undusted nonirrigated (control). Following watering, dusted irrigated plants experienced rapid shoot growth and had significantly higher predawn shoot water potentials (ψ = -2.5 MPa) than dusted nonirrigated plants (-5.5 MPa), and midday values were -3.1 to -4.1 MPa versus -5.5 to -6.4 MPa, respectively. For dusted plants, irrigation resulted in marked increases of assimilation (14.0 versus 1.24 μmol m-2 s-1), stomatal conductance (0.19 versus 0.03 mol m-2 s-1), and linear growth, and accompanying new growth the old, dusted leaves were mostly abscised. All measures of water-use efficiency (WUE) were higher in controls than in dusted plants, and during the summer, dust was associated with a 40-90% reduction in shoot growth. Nonirrigated controls showed much greater water stress than dusted irrigated plants, but when irrigation was discontinued, the formerly irrigated plants rapidly converged on the physiological and phenological characteristics of not watered control plants. Dust deposition may reduce plant carbon gain by decreasing WUE and impairing tolerance of water stress. This experiment demonstrated that creosote bushes can recover rapidly from acute heavy dust deposition if irrigation, simulating heavy summer rainfall, is provided, and these results may be useful in measures to minimize the ecological impact of human activities in desert ecosystems.","Dust pollution; Larrea tridentata; Mojave Desert; Photosynthesis; Water relations","disturbance; dust; irrigation; phenology; physiological response; shrub; Mojave Desert; United States; Larrea tridentata; Larrea tridentata; Tridentata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033230544

Fluorescence parameters were measured with a portable fluorometer with its fibre optics tightly inserted in a gas exchange cuvette at light intensities from 0 to 220 μmol photons m-2 s-1. Ozone caused significant changes of primary photosynthetic reactions: a decrease of the quantum yield of photosystem II and an increase of non-photochemical quenching. In all leaves a biphasic light response of nonphotochemical quenching was observed. Ozone fumigation shifted the onset of the second phase from a PFD of about 60 μmol m-2 s-1 to about 30 μmol m-2 s-1. While the fertilizer concentration had no influence on this character, high fertilization supply of plants partially reduced O3-induced damage. The light responses of Ft, Fm' and NPQ observed in birch leaves grown in O3-free air indicate the existence of at least two different processes governing energy conversion of the photosynthetic apparatus at PS II in the range of PFD 0-200 μmol photons m-2 s-1. The first phase was attributed to a rather slowly relaxing type of non-photochemical quenching, which, at least at low PFD, is thought to be related to a state 1-2 transition. The further changes of the fluorescence parameters studied at higher PFD might be explained by an increase of energy-dependent quenching, connected with the energization of the thylakoid membrane and zeaxanthin synthesis.

The latter objective was addressed by using the NC and FC aquifer materials for anaerobic microcosm studies in which phylogenetic probe analysis was complemented by microbial activity assays. Domain probe analysis of the aquifer samples showed that the communities were predominantly Bacteria; Eucarya and Archaea were not detectable. At the phylum and subclass levels, the FC and NC aquifer material had similar relative abundance distributions of 43 to 65% β- and γ-Proteobacteria (B+G), 31 to 35% α-Proteobacteria (ALF), 15 to 18% sulfate-reducing bacteria, and 5 to 10% high G+C gram positive bacteria. Compared to that of the NC region, the community structure of the FC material differed mainly in an increased abundance of B+G relative to that of ALF. The microcosm communities were like those of the field samples in that they were predominantly Bacteria (83 to 101%) and lacked detectable Archaea but differed in that a small fraction (2 to 8%) of Eucarya was detected regardless of the treatment applied. The latter result was hypothesized to reflect enrichment of anaerobic protozoa. Addition of nitrate and/or toluene stimulated microbial activity in the microcosms, but only supplementation of toluene alone significantly altered community structures. For the NC material, the dominant subclass shifted from B+G to ALF, while in the FC microcosms 55 to 65% of the Bacteria community was no longer identifiable by the phylum or subclass probes used. The latter result suggested that toluene exposure fostered the proliferation of phylotype(s) that were otherwise minor constituents of the FC aquifer community. These studies demonstrated that alterations in aquifer microbial communities resulting from specific anthropogenic perturbances can be inferred from microcosm studies integrating chemical and phylogenetic probe analysis and in the case of hydrocarbon contamination may facilitate the identification of organisms important for in situ biodegradation processes. Further work integrating and coordinating microcosm and field experiments is needed to explore how differences in scale, substrate complexity, and other hydrogeological conditions may affect patterns observed in these systems.",,"nitrate; toluene; aquifer; Archaebacterium; article; bacterium identification; biomass; controlled study; ecology; geographic distribution; Gram positive bacterium; natural population; nonhuman; phylogeny; protozoon; sediment; sulfate reducing bacterium; water analysis; water contamination; Actinobacteria (class); Alphaproteobacteria; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Gammaproteobacteria; Posibacteria; Protozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032925880

The XPS results showed that Ga atoms were dispersed well over the Al2O3 surface for the samples with Ga2O3 content below monolayer coverage (27 wt %) and that Ga2O3 particles appeared at higher content. The XANES and EXAFS results revealed that, below monolayer coverage, Ga atoms were located at the surface cation sites (tetrahedral and octahedral) of Al2O3, and the fraction of tetrahedral Ga species decreased as Ga content increased. The activity per surface area of the catalysts increased with Ga2O3 content up to around the monolayer coverage and declined at higher content. Below monolayer coverage, the activity per exposed Ga atom decreased as Ga content increased, which correlated well with the change in the fraction of tetrahedral Ga species. It was concluded that the present reaction is a structure-sensitive reaction depending on the local structure of Ga atom; GaO4 tetrahedra highly dispersed in the surface spinel are responsible for the activity. © 1999 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000951390

The Al (001) surface was chosen to simulate the previous experiments using Al tips [Tagawa et al., Appl. Surf. Sci. 72, 259 (1993)]. The ultrasoft pseudopotential-based first-principles calculation provided a lattice constant within 1% of the difference from the experimental value and also showed good agreement with the surface states measured by an angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. The computational results indicated a high local density of states (LDOS) near the Fermi level, exceeded by the O adsorption of the Al (001) surface. It was also calculated that the LDOS peak was located 0.2 eV below the Fermi level of the O-covered Al (001). Considering the work function of the clean Al (001) surface (4.4 eV) and its decrease due to the O adsorption (-0.6 eV), this electron-filled LDOS peak was located 4.0 eV below the vacuum level. Calculated results revealed good agreement with the experimental data showing the exoelectron peak at 4.0 eV below the vacuum level [Tagawa et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 61, 1471 (1992)].

In this review, we examine previously published seagrass research through a lens of global climate change in order to consider the potential effects on the world's seagrasses. A primary effect of increased global temperature on seagrasses will be the alteration of growth rates and other physiological functions of the plants themselves. The distribution of seagrasses will shift as a result of increased temperature stress and changes in the patterns of sexual reproduction. Indirect temperature effects may include plant community changes as a result of increased eutrophication and changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. The direct effects of sea level rise on the coastal oceans will be to increase water depths, change tidal variation (both mean tide level and tidal prism), alter water movement, and increase seawater intrusion into estuaries and rivers. A major impact of all these changes on seagrasses and tidal freshwater plants will be a redistribution of existing habitats. The intrusion of ocean water into formerly fresh or brackish water areas will directly affect estuarine plant distribution by changing conditions at specific locations, causing some plants to relocate in order to stay within their tolerance zones and allowing others to expand their distribution inland. Distribution changes will result from the effects of salinity change on seed germination, propagule formation, photosynthesis, growth and biomass. Also, some plant communities may decline or be eliminated as a result of increased disease activity under more highly saline conditions. Increased water depth, which reduces the amount of light reaching existing seagrass beds, will directly reduce plant productivity where plants are light limited. Likewise, increases in water motion and tidal circulation will decrease the amount of light reaching the plants by increasing turbidity or by stimulating the growth of epiphytes. Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide will directly elevate the amount of CO2 in coastal waters. In areas where seagrasses are carbon limited, this may increase primary production, although whether this increase will be sustained with long-term CO2 enrichment is uncertain. The impact of increases in CO2 will vary with species and environmental circumstances, but will likely include species distribution by altering the competition between seagrass species as well as between seagrass and algal populations. The reaction of seagrasses to UV-B radiation may range from inhibition of photosynthetic activity, as seen for terrestrial plants and marine algae, to the increased metabolic cost of producing UV-B blocking compounds within plant tissue. The effects of UV-B radiation will likely be greatest in the tropics and in southern oceans. There is every reason to believe that, as with the predicted terrestrial effects of global climate change, impacts to seagrasses will be great. The changes that will occur in seagrass communities are difficult to predict; our assessment clearly points out the need for research directed toward the impact of global climate change on seagrasses.","Carbon dioxide; Climate; Eelgrass; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Macrophyte; Sea level rise; Seagrass; UV radiation","carbon dioxide; climate change; global change; seagrass meadow; aquatic flora; ecology; environmental impact assessment; geographic distribution; global climate; grass; greenhouse effect; growth rate; marine environment; nonhuman; plant growth; reproduction; review; salinity; temperature sensitivity; ultraviolet b radiation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032894779

After outlining our modifications to their framework in the next section, we illustrate how it can be used to estimate the marginal willingness to pay for reducing air pollution in southern California. Estimates based on a hedonic model are also presented for comparative purposes. Our preliminary estimates of marginal willingness to pay (WTP) measures for reducing ozone (in 1990 dollars) from the spatial sorting model are between 9% and 32% smaller (depending on the county and air pollution measure used) than the hedonic estimates. These estimates move consistently with the averages computed from the hedonic model's point estimates for each housing sale in the thirty-six school districts included in this preliminary analysis. These comparisons are certainly not tests for differences across models. However, they do suggest recognizing the discreteness in local public goods, and site-specific amenities may well introduce an important new restriction, implied by the sorting equilibrium framework, to the measurement of consumers' values for improvements in air quality.",,"air quality; environmental economics; willingness to pay",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033503444

Attempts to control losses include the addition of a C source to stimulate nitrogen immobilization. Composting is a treatment process that recommends the addition of carbonaceous materials to achieve a C:N ratio of 30:1 to stimulate degradation and immobilize nitrogen. Dairies near cities may be able to reduce N loss from manures by composting with urban carbonaceous residues such as municipal solid waste (MSW) or MSW compost that, by themselves, have little agronomic value. Studies were conducted using a self-heating laboratory composter where dairy solids were mixed with MSW compost to determine the reduction of N loss during composting. One-to-one mixtures (v/v) of dairy manure solids and MSW compost were composted and NH3 volatilization, CO2 evolution and temperatures were compared to composting of manure alone. Addition of MSW compost resulted in increased CO2 evolution and reduced N loss. Nitrogen loss from composting dairy manure alone was four to ten times greater than that from composting dairy manure mixed with MSW compost. Adjustment of the C:N ratio to 25 by adding MSW compost to manure appeared to be the major factor in reducing N losses. © 1999 Taylor and Francis.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0003239527

The soil pH was increased or unaffected by the addition of organic manure plus inorganic fertilizers applied in conjunction with lime, but decreased in the absence of liming. The soil C and N contents were greater for all fertilized treatments compared to the control, yet in all cases the soil samples from fertilized plots had smaller C:N ratios than soil from the unfertilized plots. The soil concentrations of all the other inorganic nutrients measured were greater following fertilizer applications compared with the unfertilized plots, and this effect was most marked for P and K in soils from plots that had received the largest amounts of these nutrients as fertilizers. Both biomass C determined by chloroform fumigation and glucose-induced respiration tended to increase as a result of manure and inorganic fertilizer applications, although soils which received the largest additions of inorganic fertilizers in the absence of lime contained less biomass C than those to which lime had been added. Dehydrogenase activity was lower in soils that had received the largest amounts of fertilizers, and was further decreased in the absence of lime. This suggests that dehydrogenase activity was highly sensitive to the inhibitory effects associated with large fertilizer additions. Potential denitrification and anaerobic respiration determined in one soil were increased by fertilizer application but, as with both the microbial biomass and dehydrogenase activity, there were significant reductions in both N2O and CO2 production in soils which received the largest additions of inorganic fertilizers in the absence of lime. In contrast, the size of the denitrifying component of the soil microbial community, as indicated by denitrifying enzyme activity, was unaffected by the absence of lime at the largest rate of inorganic fertilizer applications. The results indicated differences in the composition or function of microbial communities in the soils in response to long-term organic and inorganic fertilization, especially when the soils were not limited.","Dehydrogenase activity; Denitrification potential; Denitrifying enzyme activity; Long-term fertilization; Microbial biomass","calcium oxide; carbon dioxide; chemical and biochemical agents; chloroform; determination of content; enzyme activity; fertilizer production; manure; oxidoreductase; soil pollution; arable farming; fertilizer application; management practice; microbial community; soil microorganism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344673383

The Sa Pala de Sa Fae and the Sa Pedra Bianca veins were subject to intense diamond drilling exploration in the mid 1990 s. The veins extend for 1-3 km, dip steeply, and range from 1 to 10 m in width. High K-calc-alkaline volcanic deposits containing plagioclase phenocrysts (along with lesser pyroxene, amphibole, magnetite, olivine and sanidine) form the main host rocks. Gold grades in drill intersections range from &lt;0.1 to &lt;20 ppm, with silver-gold ratios of around 4 to 7. Mineralogical studies show a systematic distribution of three hydrothermal mineral assemblages. At distances &gt;50 m from the vein, the assemblage albite + Fe-chlorite + illite + pyrite (± montmorillonite ± calcite ± K-feldspar) prevails regionally, and its formation is attributed to minor metasomatism of the country rock involving the addition of water, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. At distances &lt;10 m from the vein, the assemblage quartz + K-feldspar + pyrite ± illite dominates, forming an alteration envelope that cross cuts regional alteration. Quartz and K-feldspar increase in abundance towards the vein. Quartz is the main vein mineral, and it displays a range of morphologies and textures including crustiform colloform banding, quartz pseudomorphs of platy calcite, breccias and coarse euhedral crystals. Electrum and argentite which are the main gold and silver minerals deposited during the early stages of vein mineralization with rhomb-shaped crystals of K-feldspar (adularia). Pyrite, plus lesser marcasite, arsenopyrite, stibnite and sphalerite, are the other sulfide phases in veins. Kaolinite ± halloysite ± jarosite form a late assemblage overprinting earlier hydrothermal alteration. It is mostly restricted to shallow depths of a few meters, except near veins. Most of this assemblage likely formed from weathering and oxidation of sulfides. Microthermometric measurements were made on quartz-hosted, two-phase (liquid + vapor) inclusions, containing ∼75% liquid; mean homogenization temperatures (∼750 measurements) range from 220 to 250°C, and ice-melting temperatures (∼550 measurements) range from 0.0 to -2.3°C. The presence of coexisting vapor-rich and liquid rich inclusions, with quartz pseudomorphs of platy calcite, indicate that boiling conditions existed. Slight vapor-bubble expansion of a few fluid inclusions subjected to crushing experiments indicates inclusion fluids contained variable but low concentrations of dissolved gas. This study shows that gold-silver mineralization formed in subvertical channels from ascending solutions at 250°C at around 300 to 450 m below the paleo-water table in a typical low-sulfidation epithermal environment. Hydrothermal solutions that produced vein mineralization and related alteration were dilute (&lt;4.1 equivalent wt.% NaCl and &lt;4 wt.% CO2), near neutral pH, reduced and, at times, boiling. © Springer-Verlag 1999.",,"epithermal deposit; fluid inclusion; mineralogy; vein (geology); Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033389129

This paper provides a report on the behavior of these cyclonic systems during the three SOPs as revealed in the twice-daily ECMWF operational analyses. The study has been undertaken with an objective cyclone tracking algorithm applied to the digital analyses. The results revealed cyclone behavior generally in accord with long-term climatologies developed with this scheme. In the SOPs the authors observed many systems to be generated in the western part of the ocean basins and then to move east and, to a lesser extent, south. In the three periods they found a concentration of tracks just to the north of the Antarctic continent, being particularly noticeable in the Indian Ocean. At the same time, they found significant differences in cyclone behavior between the climatology and the SOPs in specific regions. The monthly mean sea level pressure (MSLP) anomalies during the SOPs were quite large (and exceeded 10 hPa in places), particularly in the Pacific and in the region to the south of Australia. It appears that the anomalous cyclone structure during the SOPs could be related to the anomalies of the MSLP. The authors suggest that the three SOPs cannot be regarded as typical of their time of year, but it could be argued that no specific period could be so regarded. The resulted obtained with these high quality analyses during the SOPs have confirmed the Antarctic coast as a region of high cyclone density and of very active cyclogenesis. The identification of these high levels of coastal cyclogenesis appears to differ from early studies that suggested the greatest (winter) cyclogenetic activity to be much farther north in the 40°-50°S region. The results presented here, however, concur with recent studies undertaken with high-resolution satellite data and four-dimensional data analyses, and the theoretical consequences of the baroclinic structure of the Antarctic coastal region.",,"atmospheric dynamics; cyclogenesis; cyclone; extratropical environment; Southern Hemisphere; Algorithms; Climatology; Storms; Troposphere; Weather satellites; Extratropical cyclone; Special observing periods (SOP); Weather forecasting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033237228

Subsequent oxidation of DMS to acidic aerosols influences particle nucleation and growth over the oceans, and so has the potential to influence radiative balance and global climate. It has been suggested that this plankton-climate interaction is self-regulated, but tests of this hypothesis have remained elusive as little is known about the feedback effects of climate on the marine DMS cycle. DMS is produced by enzymatic cleavage of the abundant algal component dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), which suggests a high potential for DMS generation in the ocean. But there are competing processes that utilize DMSP in the food web without producing DMS, and the external controls on these processes are unknown. Here we present data of DMSP consumption, DMS production and mixing-layer depths (which are driven by climate) in the subpolar North Atlantic, and compare these data with published results from other latitudes.

No correlation between the values of the 129Xe chemical shift (δ0) and the substructural characteristics of the carbons (interlayer spacing, crystallite size, content of ordered or amorphous carbon of the samples), micropore volume and specific surface area was revealed. The δ0 values increase linearly with the surface concentrations of 'strong' adsorption sites for H2PdCl4, and chemisorbed heteroatoms (O, Cl) as well. HREM studies of carbon surface microstructure revealed δ0 to be nanotexture-dependent. The lowest δ0 value (approx. 14 ppm) was detected for a graphitized carbon black, the surface of which consists primarily of exposed basal planes of carbon crystallites, and the highest δ0 value (approx. 100 ppm) for a carbon sample with exposed edge faces. Medium δ0 values (50±10 ppm) were found for carbons the surface of which was roughened by steps formed by carbon layers of different size. The 129Xe NMR technique, in combination with the common procedures for the determination of the surface area of solids, may open a way to estimate the contribution of the edge faces of carbon crystallites to the total surface area of unoxidized carbons.",,"Adsorption; Atoms; Carbon black; Crystal microstructure; High resolution electron microscopy; Hydrogen inorganic compounds; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Surface chemistry; Surfaces; Textures; Xenon; Basal plane; Carbonaceous materials; Micropore volume; Nanotexture; Physicochemical state; Surface area; Surface concentration; Xenon chemical shift; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032679809

The key assumptions and results of the EVTECA are summarized. The total energy requirements of EVs are estimated to be 24 to 35 percent lower than those of the conventional, gasoline-fueled vehicles that they replace, whereas the reductions in total oil use are even greater: 55 to 85 percent. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are 24 to 37 percent lower with EVs. EVs reduce total emissions of several criteria air pollutants [volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides] but increase total emissions of others [sulfur oxide (SOx), total suspended particulates, and lead] over the total energy cycle. Regional emissions except possibly those of SOx are generally reduced with EVs. The limitations of the EVTECA are discussed, and its results are compared with those of other evaluations of EVs. In general, many of the results (particularly the results for oil use, GHGs, VOCs, CO, SOx, and lead) of the analysis are consistent with those of other evaluations.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon monoxide; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Nitrogen oxides; Synthetic fuels; Volatile organic compounds; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Total energy cycle analysis (TECA); Electric vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033283868

The rapid growth of urbanization and industrialization inevitablly leads to higher consumption of energy usually reflected in increasing pollutant emissions. The paper analyses anthropogenic climate change detection taking empirical case study of Delhi Metropolitan City. Delhi is also known as land locked city. Traffic congestion is a product of the rapid increase in the number of road vehicles. The trend in pollution emissions like CO 2 from all sectors shows upward trend due to rapid growth of urbanization in association with vehicularization and industrial emissions have been considerably increasing over a period. A major source of SO 2 emission in Delhi Metropolitan city is the industrial sector and thermal power plants. National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) has estimated that these thermal power stations produce about 25550 tonnes of SO 2 per year. Total SO 2 emissions are estimated at 45000 tonnes in 2000. Like emissions, the dominant sources of emissions are industry and thermal power plants. In 1990, total emission was about 115700 tones per year and will increase to 122600 tonnes per year by 2000. More than 90 per cent of industrial emissions are from thermal power stations. The levels of air pollution which is discharged from various sources concentrate in a particular area depends largely on local meteorological conditions, existing regulations and urban geometry. The impact of Delhi on its local climate are likely to change in climate parameters, however varies with each climatic variables. These annual pattern indicate that with maximum and minimum temperature for Delhi have positive anomalies. Inadvertent modification with respect to temperature, relative humidity and surface wind were evident not only when data within the core area of city were compared with city's fringe area. Surface wind speeds are found high in the core area of the city at times of light winds, with strong winds however there is a decrease. Temperature is higher and relative humidity is lower in the core city area as compare to its fringe area.

Throughout the day, leaves often reached temperatures as much as 15 °C above air temperature. The highest temperatures were reached for only a few seconds at a time. We compared isoprene emission rates measured when leaf temperature was changed rapidly with those measured when temperature was changed slowly. In all cases, isoprene emission rate increased with increasing leaf temperature up to about 32 °C and then decreased with higher temperatures. The temperature at which isoprene emission rates began to decrease depended on how quickly measurements were made. Isoprene emission rates peaked at 32.5 °C when measured hourly, whereas rates peaked at 39 °C when measurements were made every four minutes. This behavior reflected the rapid increase in isoprene emission rate that occurred immediately after an increase in leaf temperature, and the subsequent decrease in isoprene emission rate when leaf temperature was held steady for longer than 20 minutes. We concluded that the observed temperature response of isoprene emission rate is a function of measurement protocol. Omitting this parameter from isoprene emission models will not affect simulated isoprene emission rates at mild temperatures, but can increase isoprene emission rates at high temperatures.","Air pollution; Biogenic emissions; Forest trees; Modeling; Temperature response","biogenic emission; isoprene; leaf; physiological response; temperature effect; tree; Harvard Forest; Massachusetts; United States; Quercus; Quercus rubra; Quercus rubra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032762415

The palaeoclimate under which the species in a fossil assemblage co-existed can be inferred to lie within the intersection of the individual species' tolerance ranges. This paper describes a factor analysis of modern European climate data to determine two compound variables that describe the main features of the climate: 'summer warmth and dryness' and 'wetness and winter warmth'. Distribution maps of 80 plants from Atlas Florae Europaeae were combined with the climate data to determine each species' climatic range in factor space. MCRs were determined for two living plant assemblages from southeast England and found to give a reliable, although rather imprecise, reconstruction of the true thermal and precipitation climate. Reconstructions for two plant macro-fossil assemblages from Devensian gravels at Earith, Cambridgeshire, demonstrated palaeoclimates that were colder and more continental than the present, but with similar total amounts of precipitation.

This paper discusses emission characteristics generated due to common mode noises which are produced by circuits having with stray capacitances between the PWM inverter frame and the motor frame. It is difficult to cope with reduction of common mode noises emissions in comparison with other differential mode noises. The emissions are analyzed by computer simulations using the method of moments, especially, for the case of emissions connected to the PWM inverter frame and motor frame by a conducting plate. The effects of cable length between the PWM inverter and motor on emissions is also examined In low frequency regions where the structure length of the drive system compromised of the PWM inverter and the motor is less than one-fourth of the electromagnetic wavelength, emissions are remarkably reduced by using a conducting plate between the PWM inverter and the motor. In high frequency regions there is hardly any reduction in emissions. Finally, the resonance phenomenon is shown to occur when cable length between the PWM inverter and the motor is equal to one half of the electromagnetic wavelength. © 1999, The Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Moreover, it is not significantly deactivated by water vapor and SO2. In this study, the activity for direct NO decomposition in the presence of O2 on Cu-PILC was studied and an in situ IR study for the key intermediates and the reaction mechanism was made. The direct NO decomposition activities for Cu-PILC and Cu-ZSM-5 were similar. Under in situ NO and O2 reaction conditions at temperatures up to 300°C, IR absorption bands at well-defined peak positions are identified. The band at 1699 cm-1 is assigned to a dinitrosyl species on Cu+. The bands with peaks at 1609, 1530-1480 and in the region of 1440- 1335 cm-1 are assigned to bidentate nitrate, monodentate nitrate and nitro species bonded to Cu2+. A redox mechanism is proposed for NO decomposition. The limiting step is thought to be the N-N coupling between surface nitrate and gaseous nitric oxide to form nitrogen. The existence of substantial amounts of nitrate formed from NO alone indicates the important role of the large amount of lattice oxygen that is available on Cu-PILC. As a result, the role of external oxygen supply is only to replenish the consumed lattice oxygen. The proposed NO decomposition mechanism suggests that the redox property of Cu-PILC is crucial for this reaction.","Cu2+-exchanged pillared clay; NO decomposition mechanism; NO reduction","copper; nitric oxide; nitrite; article; catalysis; clay; decomposition; ion exchange; metal binding; oxidation reduction reaction; oxygen supply; reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033534313

Multiple carrier-mediated mechanisms have been identified that can fulfill this role in a variety of mammalian cell types, including neoplastic cells, with and without proliferative potential. The absorption of dietary folates also relies on the function of a carrier- mediated system in mature luminal epithelium of small intestine. The various carrier-mediated systems can be distinguished by their preferences for various folate compounds as permeants as well as by differences in temperature and pH dependence. The widely studied one-carbon, reduced-folate transport system is mediated by a transporter encoded by the newly discovered RFC-1 (reduced-folate carrier) gene. The characteristics of this gene in rodent and human cells are similar, consistent with the close similarity between these species of folate transport mediated by this transporter. However, differences occur in the form of tissue-specific expression, alternate splicing, and 5' end mRNA heterogeneity, as well as in promoter utilization regulating transcription. RFC-1 gene expression also appears to regulate luminal epithelial cell folate absorption in small intestine. However, the properties of RFC-1-mediated folate transport in these cells is anomalous when compared with that seen in nonabsorptive cell types. Detailed mechanisms as to the regulation of RFC-1 transcription are now emerging along with other information on structure and function of the transporter and its alteration following mutation.","Kinetics; Multiplicities; RFC-1 gene expression; Structural specificity","folic acid; active transport; animal cell; cell membrane transport; cell proliferation; gene expression; internalization; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; review; Animalia; Mammalia; Rodentia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032807982

Parts of the system have been implemented in four Norwegian communities. Greywater is treated in local nature-based systems or in a new compact filter unit. Food waste and blackwater from new water saving toilets is stored in sub-surface tanks close to the house for one to two years, and then treated in a closed system. By combining the separate blackwater and food waste streams into one, logistics are greatly simplified. After collection by a tanker, the material is sanitised and stabilised in a thermophilic aerobic reactor, especially suited for decentralised solutions. No ammonia is lost, and the product has the highest possible agronomic value, with respect to nutrient content and organic matter. The treated material is spread onto farm land during the growing season. The different parts of the system can be implemented step by step over a longer time period.","Agriculture; Blackwater; Food waste; Recycling; Small scale system","Blackwater; Food waste; Agricultural wastes; Environmental protection; Water conservation; Water pollution control; Water recycling; Water supply; Wastewater reclamation; ammonia; organic matter; agriculture; air pollution; conference paper; filtration; fluid intake; food; Norway; recycling; sanitation; sewage; sewer; tank; waste water recycling; water pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033056325

The chemical model calculates the pCO2 as a function of the total inorganic carbon, alkalinity, temperature and salinity. The ecological model has eight state variables and simulates the transformation of CO2 into organic carbon, vertical transport, and the respiration processes that convert the organic carbon back into inorganic form. The model gives an average annual primary production of 68 g C m-2 y-1, of which 44.7 g C m-2 y-1 is new production. In the eastern part of the Greenland Sea, the average annual new production is above 50 g C m-2 y-1.

ADR1 is itself repressed by glucose, but the significance of this repression for regulating target genes is not known. To test if the reduction in Adr1 levels contributes to glucose repression of ADH2 expression, we generated yeast strains in which the level of Adr1 produced during growth in glucose- containing medium is similar to that present in wild-type cells grown in the absence of glucose. In these Adr1-overproducing strains, ADH2 expression remained tightly repressed, and UAS1, the element in the ADH2 promoter that binds Adr1, was sufficient to maintain glucose repression. Post-translational modification of Adr1 activity is implicated in repression, since ADH2 derepression occurred in the absence of de novo protein synthesis. The N- terminal 172 amino acids of Adr1, containing the DNA binding and nuclear localization domains, fused to the Herpesvirus VP16-encoded transcription activation domain, conferred regulated expression at UAS1. Nuclear localization of an Adr1-GFP fusion protein was not glucose-regulated, suggesting that the DNA binding domain of Adr1 is sufficient to confer regulated expression on target genes.

In order of abundance, there are four inclusion types: (1) three-phase, l-l-v; (2) two-phase, H2O-rich; (3) three- or four-phase, l-v-s and l-l-v-s; and (4) two-phase, CO2-rich. CO2-rich inclusions formed by necking of inclusions containing mixed fluids. Topaz and quartz contain all four inclusion types, and all types occur throughout the pegmatite, although no H2O-rich inclusions occur in beryl. Quartz from gneiss that hosts the pegmatite contains dominantly H2O-rich inclusions. Most inclusions are secondary and occur along healed fractures. Possible primary inclusions occur only among those that contain solids. All inclusions homogenize into the liquid phase; a few homogenize to liquid CO2. H2O-rich inclusions with &lt;2 wt% NaCl (eq.) and homogenization temperatures &lt;200 °C occur in the host gneiss and throughout the pegmatite and are interpreted to contain meteoric waters. H2O-rich and mixed fluid inclusions with 3-7 wt% NaCl (eq.) and homogenization temperatures &gt;290 °C contain fluids interpreted to derive primarily from the pegmatite. Inclusions with salinities between 3-13 wt% NaCl (eq.) and intermediate homogenization temperatures are in part cooled equivalents of the pegmatite fluids, but the origin of those with salinity &gt;7 wt% NaCl (eq.) is uncertain. Homogenization temperatures for CO2 indicate average CO2 densities near 0.65 g/cm3. For mixed fluids homogenizing near 300 °C and this CO2 density, the trapping pressure is estimated to be 2.5 kb.

The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, commits the developed ('Annex l') countries to a reduction in gaseous emissions. The global increase in atmospheric CO2, the main greenhouse gas, comes mainly from fossil fuels (6.5 Gt Cyr-1), together with about 1.6 Gt Cyr-1 from deforestation. The atmospheric increase is only 3.4 Gt Cyr-1, however, due to a net sink in terrestrial ecosystems of about 2 Gt Cyr-1, and another in the oceans. Increasing net carbon sequestration by afforestation of previously nonforested land is one way of reducing net national emissions of CO2 that is permitted under the Kyoto Protocol. Future modifications may also allow the inclusion of carbon sequestration brought about by other forestry and agricultural land management practices. However, associated changes in net fluxes of two other greenhouse gases identified in the Protocol nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) will have to be taken into account. Growth of biomass crops can increase N2O emissions, and drainage of wetlands for forestry or agriculture also increases them, as well as emissions of CO2, while decreasing those of CH4. The problems of how to quantify these soil sources and sinks, to maximize soil C sequestration, and to minimize soil emissions of CH4 and N2O, will present a major scientific challenge over the next few years one in which the soil science community will have a significant part to play.","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climatic change greenhouse effect; Emission; Nitrous oxide; Soil; Soil management","carbon sequestration; Kyoto Protocol; science and technology; soil; soil emission; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032809174

This interdependence in national tax policies may give rise to a need for some degree of policy coordination, to ensure an appropriate balance of taxation between mobile and immobile tax bases and to restrict the ability of countries to exploit the mobility of tax bases to their advantage. At the same time, a number of energy-related environmental problems have a significant international dimension, calling for some degree of international coordination. Whilst such coordination has, to date, mainly taken the form of agreements on abatement targets, there are arguments which would point in the direction of harmonizing the form of policy in addition to agreement on emissions targets. The above arguments for international coordination are applicable, in general, but the high degree of integration between European Union member states means that EU member states may need to pay particular attention to the tax policy problems created by mobility. At the same time, the institutional framework of the EU provides opportunities for coordination, monitoring and enforcement, which may significantly widen the scope for efficient and effective international harmonization of energy taxes.",,"Environmental protection; Laws and legislation; Taxation; Energy taxation; Environmental tax; National tax policy; Tax harmonization; Energy policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032652059

We present a full spectral analysis of these data, which includes 52 Proportional Counter Array spectra from 2.5 to 20 keV and High Energy X-Ray Timing Experiment spectra above 20 keV. We also include a nearly continuous All-Sky Monitor light curve with several intensity measurements per day. The data are interpreted in the context of the multicolor black-body disk/power-law model. The source exhibits two principal outburst states which we associate with the very high and the high/soft states. During the very high state, the spectrum is often dominated by a power-law component with photon index (Γ) ∼ 2.3-2.7. The source exhibits intense hard flares on time-scales of hours to days which are correlated with changes in both the fitted temperature and radius of the inner accretion disk. During the high/soft state, the spectrum is dominated by the soft thermal emission from the accretion disk with spectral parameters that suggest approximately constant inner disk radius and temperature. The power-law component is relatively weak with Γ ∼ 2-3. During the last few observations, the source undergoes a transition to the low/hard state. We find that a tight relationship exists between the observed inner radius of the disk and the flux in the power-law component. During intense hard flares, the inner disk radius is observed to decrease by as much as a factor of 3 on a time-scale of days. The apparent decrease of the inner disk radius observed during the flares may be due to the failure of the multicolor disk model caused by a steepening of the radial temperature profile in the disk coupled with increased spectral hardening and not physical changes of the inner disk radius. The distortion of the inner disk spectrum by the power-law flares indicates that the physical mechanism responsible for producing the power-law emission is linked to the inner disk region. Assuming that our spectral model is valid during periods of weak power-law emission, our most likely value for the inner disk radius implies a* &lt; 0.7. Such a low value for the black hole angular momentum is inconsistent with the relativistic frame dragging and the ""diskoseismic"" models as interpretations for the 300 Hz X-ray QPO seen during some of these RXTE observations.","Black hole physics; Stars: individual (GRO J1655-40); X-rays: stars",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033443338

Midday CO2 assimilation rates averaged 7.6 ± 0.7 and 4.3 ± 0.3 μmol m-2 s-1 at the seawater and hypersaline sites, respectively. Despite this difference, xanthophyll pool sizes per Chl and epoxidation states were similar at both sites. Non-photochemical quenching also indicated comparable energy dissipation from pigment beds. Electron transport rates calculated from fluorescence characteristics were also similar and exceeded the requirements to sustain measured assimilation rates. However, cell wall conductance was low in seawater plants (75 mmol m-2 s-1) and declined to 40 mmol m-2 s-1 in hypersaline plants. This would cause CO2 concentrations in chloroplasts (C(c)) to be lower than expected from measurements of intercellular CO2 concentrations (C(i)). In seawater plants, C(c) was estimated to be 144 μmol mol-1 when C(i) was 245 μmol mol-1, while values for C(c) and C(i) in hypersaline plants were 78 and 212 μmol mol-1, respectively. Reductions in C(c) would enhance rates of photorespiration relative to assimilation, with the higher photorespiratory rates being sufficient to account for apparent excess electron transport rates.","Avicennia marina; Fluorescence; Mangroves; Photoinhibition; Photoprotection; Photorespiratio n; Photosynthesis; Salinity; Xanthophyll cycle","carbon fixation; light availability; mangrove; photosynthesis; salinity; Avicennia; Avicennia marina; Avicennia marina; Magnoliophyta; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033041104

The initial studies involved the calculation of free energy profiles, orientational profiles, and changes in the cylindrical distribution function along the normal to the surface, where the solutes were CO2, N2, CH3CN and Ar. Both CO2 and CH3CN show a strong adsorption layer, while N2 and Ar do not have this feature. The molecules show a weak tendency to lie transverse to the surface normal at the surface. CO2 shows a weak tendency to pull the nearest neighbour water molecules above the surface. We are now calculating the reaction rates and sticking coefficients for the surface. In the case of CO2 an equilibrium is formed between gaseous phase and adsorbed state, making the transition from liquid to adsorbed layes the rate determining process.

The experiment lasted for 33 days. The natural nematode diversity, as well as relevant aspects of the spatial heterogeneity of the soil microhabitat in a 80 m2 sampling area were maintained in the microcosms. No correlation was found between nematode abundance and microbial biomass (CFE) or ergosterol content (as a measure of active fungal biomass). However, a doubling of nematode abundance reduced CO2 production by 11% and increased bacterial substrate utilization (BIOLOG) by 18%. A possible explanation is that fungal activity was strongly reduced at higher nematode density, overcompensating the simultaneous increase in bacterial activity. The results show that the nematode community in a grassland soil is capable of causing a considerable shift in soil microbial activities towards an increased bacterial metabolism, overriding the spatial heterogeneity of the soil habitat and the taxonomic diversity of the community itself, and thereby producing functional effects relevant at spatial scales that far exceed the activity domains of the organisms involved. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1999.","Biolog-assay; CO2 production; Grassland; Microcosms; Microflora; Nematodes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038576566

The 3 sites are located in central Oregon at the confluence of the Deschutes and Crooked Rivers. Two of the sites are typical of central Oregon rangelands in that they have a history of anthropogenic disturbance including active fire suppression and domestic livestock grazing. The third site is a relict mesa that is a protected Research Natural Area and has experienced minimal anthropogenic impacts. We used large scale aerial photography to determine cover and density of western juniper in 1951, 1956, 1961, 1972, 1982, and 1994. We found that western juniper density and cover during the last 4 decades increased at all sites, with changes on the relict site similar to those on one of the disturbed sites. We suggest that even though 2 of the traditionally cited causes of western juniper expansion since the late 1800s (altered fire regimes, domestic livestock grazing) may have contributed to expansion on our disturbed sites, these mechanisms can not explain expansion on the near-relict mesa. Further, we examined climatic changes since 1900 in the region and concluded that the data did not fully support a climate-driven mechanism for the expansion. In seeking to explain western juniper expansion on semiarid rangelands, we suggest that all potential causal mechanisms (e.g., fire history, biological inertia, climate, domestic grazing, atmospheric CO2 enrichment) be considered.","Afforestation; Biological inertia; Central Oregon; Land-use history","climate change; population density; rangeland; vegetation dynamics; Oregon; United States; Juniperus; Juniperus occidentalis; Juniperus occidentalis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032859101

Although such variations in ancient samples have been used to infer differing tectonic settings, these carbonates all formed within a faulted continental margin environment and chemical variations reflect local differences in the sources and flux of carbon to sediment pore fluids. The slow seepage of fluid, and with it dissolved carbon, along the transform-faulted continental margin results in discrete areas of enhanced microbial sulfate reduction, oxidation of methane from both biogenic and thermogenic origins, as well as the active precipitation of both high-Mg calcite (HMC) and dolomite. The authigenic carbonates include semicontinuous pavements of shallow cemented sediments surrounding benthic communities; circular or pipe-like 'chimneys' interpreted as cemented conduits formed as a result of methane gas expulsion; centimeter- to meter-scale rings, doughnuts or slabs winnowed from variable depths within sediments; and carbonate veins (ankerite or calcite) or cements in faulted basement rocks draped with bacterial mat. Abundant pyrite framboids, preferentially filling the tests of the benthic foraminifer Uvigerina peregrina and characteristic of the HMC-bearing samples, are products of a zone of shallow microbial sulfate reduction, a process fundamental to the nourishment of the chemosynthetic cold seep communities. Sites on a sedimented ridge west of the San Gregorio Fault Zone have carbon isotopic values between -35 and -56‰ that are strongly influenced by carbon derived from methane. The higher values of δ18O (more enriched in 18O) are found closer to the active fault zone. Carbonates from sites within the San Gregorio Fault Zone or from Monterey Canyon floor exposures of Miocene sediments have carbon isotope values between -7 and -26‰ that are mixtures of sedimentary organic carbon and microbially oxidized hydrocarbons from organic-rich, petroleum source rocks. Dolomite-bearing samples are more enriched in both 18O and 13C. Bulk carbonate samples with heavier 18O (δ18O &gt; 3.5‰) result from the abundance of authigenic dolomite and low temperatures of formation. Local destabilization of clathrates might also create pore fluids that are more enriched in both 13C and 18O.","Authigenic minerals; Carbonates; Cas seeps; Cold seeps; Diagenesis; Isotopes","authigenesis; carbonate; cold seep; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032784621

The paper describes such a configuration in base of a developed two-stroke engine with electronically controlled gasoline direct injection. The injection system is characterized by a high-pressure modulation obtained in base of the water hammer effect, which can be accurately adapted for a wide load and speed range of the engine. In this assembly the engine has extremely small dimensions and a dry weight of 8 kg, requiring a place which do not disturb the functions of the basic electric vehicle. The performances are convicting, the CO2 emission being reduced 3 times in comparison with a series four-stroke engine for the same car type, with an autonomy of 340 km and with a maximum speed of 100 km/h.

These films have a lower dielectric constant than conventional SiO2. It is this property that makes them attractive for implementation in future integrated circuit technology. The etching of these novel dielectrics was compared to conventional SiO2. We have observed that the different chemical makeup of these SiO2-like dielectrics does not affect the etching when weakly polymerizing gases are used, such as CF4. In this case, the etch rate is primarily dependent on the ion energy. For more polymerizing chemistries, like CHF3 or C3F6/H2 gas mixtures, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed that an increasing steady state fluorocarbon film thickness limits the ion and neutral flux at the interface of the various dielectrics. It is suggested that, as the fluorocarbon film thickness increases, the etching becomes more dependent on neutral species from the gas phase. In this case, hydrogen and carbon impurities in HSQ and MSQ, respectively, limit the etch rate. On the other hand, fluorine in the fluorinated SiO2 film enhances the etch rate as compared with the etch rate of conventional SiO2. In line with these observations, we conclude that fluorine from the gas phase is most likely the controlling etchant as the fluorocarbon film increases beyond the ion penetration depth. © 1999 American Vacuum Society.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000125860

The experimental site is located in a grassland at the Wytham estate, Oxfordshire, UK. The one hectare study area is within a 10 ha abandoned arable field on Jurassic corallian limestone. Two climate change scenarios were used: warmer winters with increased summer rainfall and warmer winters with summer drought. Plant cover and species richness were significantly increased in plots receiving supplemented summer rainfall, while the amount of litter was significantly reduced. Litter formation was significantly increased by winter warming and drought. The responses of the plant community to the climate manipulations were related to the life-history attributes of the dominant species. Seedling recruitment was limited by microsite availability, which also varied in the different climate manipulations. The results are discussed in terms of successional dynamics. They suggest that warmer winters may delay succession, as gap formation in the sward will provide sites for colonisation of annuals, thereby enabling their persistence in the sward. Under wetter conditions during summer, perennial grasses tend to close the sward, thereby inhibiting the establishment of later successional species.","Climate change; Life-history traits; Plant succession; Seedling recruitment; Warming; Water relations","climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; community dynamics; grassland; plant community; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032842952

Our study takes advantage of an open-top CO2 fertilization study in a Florida scrub-oak community to examine the effects of elevated CO2 on herbivore densities, herbivore feeding rates, and levels of attack of herbivores by natural enemies. Higher atmospheric CO2 concentration reduced plant foliar nitrogen concentrations, decreased abundance of leaf-mining insect herbivores, increased per capita leaf consumption by leafminers, and increased leafminer mortality. As suggested by other authors, reduced foliar quality contributed to the increase in herbivore mortality, but only partly. The major factor increasing mortality was higher attack rate by parasitoids. Thus increasing CO2 concentrations may reduce the survivorship of insect herbivores directly, by reducing plant quality, but also indirectly, by changing herbivore feeding and eliciting greater top-down pressure from natural enemies.","Carbon; CO2, response to elevation in; Field experiment; Herbivore-enemy interactions; Increased leaf consumption; Increased parasitism; Nitrogen ratios; Plant nitrogen; Plant-herbivore interactions","carbon dioxide enrichment; herbivory; open-top chamber; parasitoid; phytochemistry; tritrophic interaction; Florida; United States; Agromyzidae; Animalia; Insecta; Lepidoptera; Quercus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033081214

These diversity manipulations were done in factorial combination with a CO2 enrichment experiment in order to investigate the degree to which ecosystem responses to elevated CO2 are altered by a loss of plant diversity. Ecosystem CO2 and H2O fluxes were measured over several 24-h periods during the 1994 and 1995 growing seasons. Ecosystem CO2 assimilation on a ground area basis decreased with decreasing plant diversity in the first year and this was related to a decline in above-ground plant biomass. In the second year, however, CO2 assimilation was not affected by diversity, and this corresponded to the disappearance of a diversity effect on above-ground biomass. Irrespective of diversity treatment, CO2 assimilation on a ground area basis was linearly related to peak above-ground biomass in both years. Elevated CO2 significantly increased ecosystem CO2 assimilation in both years with no interaction between diversity and CO2 treatment, and no corresponding increase in above-ground biomass. There were no significant effects of diversity on water vapour flux, which was measured only in the second year. There were indications of a small CO2 effect on water vapour flux (3-9% lower at elevated CO2 depending on the light level). Our findings suggest that decreasing plant species diversity may substantially decrease ecosystem CO2 assimilation during the establishment of such planted calcareous grassland communities, but also suggest that this effect may not persist. In addition, we find no evidence that plant species diversity alters the response of ecosystem CO2 assimilation to elevated CO2.","Carbon balance; Evapotranspiration; Plant diversity","calcareous grassland; carbon dioxide enrichment; community response; gas exchange; plant community; species diversity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032968776

Many recent studies have attributed observed reversals in surface-water acidification at national and regional scales to the declining deposition. To test whether emissions regulations have led to widespread recovery in surface-water chemistry, we analysed regional trends between 1980 and 1995 in indicators of acidification (sulphate, nitrate and base-cation concentrations, and measured (Gran) alkalinity) for 205 lakes and streams in eight regions of North America and Europe. Dramatic differences in trend direction and strength for the two decades are apparent. In concordance with general temporal trends in acidic deposition, lake and stream sulphate concentrations decreased in all regions with the exception of Great Britain all but one of these regions exhibited stronger downward trends in the 1990s than in the 1980s. In contrast, regional declines in lake and stream nitrate concentrations were rare and, when detected, were very small. Recovery in alkalinity, expected wherever strong regional declines in sulphate concentrations have occurred, was observed in all regions of Europe, especially in the 1990s, but in only one region (of five) in North America. We attribute the lack of recovery in three regions (south/central Ontario, the Adirondack/Catskill mountains and midwestern North America) to strong regional declines in base-cation concentrations that exceed the decreases in sulphate concentrations.",,"nitrate; surface water; acid rain; acidification; spatial variation; surface water; temporal variation; water quality; acid rain; acidification; article; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; Europe; lake; North America; priority journal; water contamination; Europe; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033533820

Cases considered are hydrogen fuel from methane and from iso-octane in generic proton-exchange membrane (PEM) fuel-cell vehicles, methane and iso-octane in spark-ignition (SI) engine vehicles, and diesel fuel (from methane or petroleum) in direct-injection (DI) diesel engine vehicles. We also consider advanced hybrid technology to develop an upper bound for vehicle efficiency realizable using internal combustion engines (ICEs). Future-technology fuel-cell vehicles and future-technology hybrid ICE vehicles (particularly those with direct-injection engines) have similar projected ranges of efficiency. Differences, if any, will only become apparent after fuel-cell and advanced ICE vehicles are ready for market testing. The main challenge for fuel-cell vehicles is to improve the efficiency of hydrogen production (off-board and on-board). The main challenge for ICE hybrid vehicles is to meet stringent new emission standards while maintaining high efficiency. Both fuel-cell and ICE hybrid technologies require a reliable and efficient hybrid powertrain, and both would benefit from cleaner, lower-sulfur fuels, as well as advanced catalysts for improved fuel production and/or exhaust aftertreatment. The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions ranking approximately corresponds to the total fuel-cycle efficiency ranking. Fuel-cell vehicles are excellent candidates for carbon emissions reductions if methane is the preferred feedstock. The GHG benefits of petroleum feedstock for fuel-cell vehicles are less certain relative to advanced hybrid ICE vehicles. Emissions of criteria pollutants from fuel-cell vehicles are expected to be near zero, but upstream emissions of these fuel chains are significant and will not change vs. conventional engine technology. For policy decisions, low emissions of criteria pollutants from fuel-cell vehicles and their less certain GHG and fuel economy benefits (relative to direct-injection hybrid electric vehicles) must be weighed against their earlier state of development. Similarly, unless fuel processing, combustion, and aftertreatment technologies are much improved, the fuel economy and GHG emissions benefits of advanced internal-combustion engines may not be realized as a consequence of new, much tighter emission standards for nitrogen oxides and particulates. © Copyright 1999 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Combustion; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Direct injection; Feedstocks; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Hydrogen production; Ice; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Plants (botany); Pollution; Polyols; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); After-treatment technology; Carbon emissions reductions; Direct injection diesel engines; Direct injection engines; Direct-injection spark ignitions; Fuel cell technologies; Internal combustion engines (ICEs); Transportation vehicles; Fuel cell power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072433704

Different Cr salts as well as different forms of Cr have diverse solubilities. Furthermore, the amount of Cr presented affects absorption, with a lower percentage from higher doses. Many people in the United States have Cr intakes in the 20--30 μg/day range. Certain medications that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, such as aspirin and indomethacin, markedly enhance uptake of 51Cr. Buffering compounds, such as magnesium or calcium carbonates or hydroxides reduce 51Cr absorption. Occupational exposure to hexavalent Cr is a health concern. Hexavalent Cr is potentially a carcinogen when inhaled, but usual acidity of the stomach reduces it to the trivalent form. Despite the general assumption of safety of trivalent Cr, the widespread use of Cr supplements, particularly by diabetic patients, warrants more extensive monitoring of safety for long-term use.","Absorption; Chromium; Safety; Toxicity","acetylsalicylic acid; ascorbic acid; calcium carbonate; carcinogen; chromium; chromium 51; chromium chloride; hydroxide; indometacin; magnesium; prostaglandin; absorption; conference paper; dietary fiber; dietary intake; gastrointestinal tract; occupational exposure; priority journal; prostaglandin synthesis; safety; solubility; stomach pH; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032955795

Review, St. Petersburg, FL, United States","In the late 1980s, St. Petersburg found itself in need of neighborhood focus after many years of attention on economic development and downtown redevelopment. The housing stock averaged more than 40 years old, and the city was over 90 percent built-out with little room for municipal expansion (viz., tax base growth). Fortunately, the city is bounded and interlaced with miles of waterfront property that has served as a stabilizing influence for the tax base and city service costs. New tax cap laws, however, may serve to erode even this component of the tax base. Regardless of high service and infrastructure levels, the city found itself with significantly higher taxes than surrounding 'beach' communities and an unsettled investment and housing climate due to both real and perceived citywide neighborhood disinvestment. In response to this climate, the planning department, in conjunction with one neighborhood that requested assistance, developed the city's first neighborhood plan in 1988. Since that time, the program has expanded to include seven city-assisted neighborhood plans and three plans generated solely by neighborhood associations. In addition, the current political focus is entirely neighborhood based. This shift toward neighborhood-based service delivery is further evidenced by the newly formed Mayor's Neighborhood Partnership Office and the Mayor's 'Operation Commitment' implementation program. The following information will attempt to explain the components, actions, policies, and programs that have characterized the evolution of the program, including suggestions for legislative needs.",,"housing conditions; neighborhood; urban planning; urban renewal; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033377142

The observations span a height range of 360-530 K (∼150-45 hPa) and have nearly pole-to-pole coverage in most seasons. These climatologies are intended to support efforts to evaluate the chemistry and dynamics of assessment models. Reasonable model representations of NOy, O3, and their seasonal variations are necessary to assess the effects of aircraft exhaust on the stratosphere. ER-2 measurements of N2O are combined with the NOy data to examine their lower stratospheric relationship and to identify regions of denitrification. Measurements of these species above ER-2 altitudes in the Arctic vortex support the interpretation of some of the ER-2 NOy - N2O data, which suggest that transport rather than chemical denitrification causes deviations from the normally linear relationship. This places constraints on the use of a linear relationship to calculate denitrification. The observed relationship between N2O and O3 is also presented. The spatial gradients in lower stratospheric O3 photochemistry are used to explain observed variations in the N2O - O3 relationship. The N2O - O3 relationship above ER-2 altitudes in the Arctic vortex, much like the case of NOy - N2O, also differs in slope from lower altitudes. This points to the difficulties in using tracer correlations to infer O3 values in the vortex prior to polar stratospheric cloud processing. It is necessary to understand the photochemical and transport history of the air that descends into the lower stratospheric vortex in order to correctly quantify O3 depletion.

Northern blot analysis of creA mRNA revealed a complex expression profile: the addition of monosaccharides to a carbon-starved culture of A. nidulans provoked a strong transient stimulation of creA transcript formation within a few minutes. In the case of repressing carbon sources, creA mRNA levels were subsequently downregulated, whereas the high creA mRNA levels were maintained in a creA mutant strain and in the presence of derepressing monosaccharides. A high creA transcript level is essential to achieve carbon catabolite repression and is dependent on glucose transport and, at least partially, on the creB gene product. Subsequent downregulation of creA mRNA levels, on the other hand, is typical of carbon catabolite repression and requires a functional CreA recognition site in the creA promoter (and thus involves autoregulation) and formation of glucose-6-phosphate. Despite the presence of continuing high transcript levels of creA in the presence of derepressing carbohydrates, EMSA demonstrated the presence of only low levels of a CreA-DNA complex in respective cell-free extracts.

It will soon become impossible to sustain population, economic, and industrial growth without severe deterioration of the atmospheric environment. This paper addresses the city of Shanghai, the air-quality problems it faces over the next 30 years, and the potential of advanced technology to alleviate these problems. Population, energy consumption, and emission profiles are developed for the city at 0.1°x 0.1°resolution and extrapolated from 1990 to 2020 using sector-specific economic growth factors. Within the context of the RAINS-Asia model, eight technology scenarios are examined for their effects on ambient concentrations of sulfur dioxide and sulfate and their emission control costs. Without new control measures, it is projected that the number of people exposed to sulfur dioxide concentrations in excess of guidelines established by the World Health Organization will rise from 650,000 in 1990 to more than 14 million in 2020. It is apparent that efforts to reduce emissions are likely to have significant health benefits, measured in terms of the cost of reducing the number of people exposed to concentrations in excess of the guidelines ($10-50 annually per person protected). Focusing efforts on the control of new coal-fired power plants and industrial facilities has the greatest benefit. However, none of the scenarios examined is alone capable of arresting the increases in emissions, concentrations, and population exposure. It is concluded that combinations of stringent scenarios in several sectors will be necessary to stabilize the situation, at a potential cost of $500 million annually by the year 2020.","Air quality; China; Coal; Health effects; Shanghai; Sulfur dioxide","Sulfates; Air quality; Costs; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Health risks; Risk assessment; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollution control; air quality; health risk; pollution control; technological development; air monitoring; air quality control; article; China; cost benefit analysis; environmental management; environmental planning; health hazard; risk management; world health organization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033120549

An update of an emission inventory is always combined with new or improved emission factors and models. In order to define the emission trend it is necessary to distinguish between methodological and real changes. This means using the most recent data (models and emission factors) and applying it to the new and old base year. Taking the emission inventory for the city of Graz as an example the effects of methodological changes on emission estimates are shown. Due to the fact that this emission inventory is also used for urban air quality modelling it has a high temporal and spatial resolution. Emphasis was therefore put on an accurate description of the time behaviour of the emission sources. The use of a geographical information system ensures an exact location of the emission source. The new emission inventory serves as a basis for an urban air quality model.

The model system Ge(CH3)2 + XHn (X = C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, and Cl; n = 1-4) has been chosen for the present study. All the interactions involve the initial formation of a donor-acceptor complex, followed by a high-energy transition state, and then an insertion product. The agreement between MP2 and B3LYP results indicates that the latter provides an adequate theoretical level for further investigations of molecular geometries, electronic structures, and kinetic features of the germylene reactions. The following conclusions emerge from this work: (i) the X-H insertion reactions of germylene occur in a concerted manner via a three-membered-ring transition state, and that the stereochemistry at the heteroatom X center is preserved; (ii) the stabilization energies of the germyIene-XHn complexes increase in the order NH3 &gt; H2O &gt; PH3 &gt; H2S ∼ HF &gt; HC1 SiH4 ∼ CH4; (iii) the order of reactivity for X-H bonds toward germylene insertion is Cl &gt; F &gt; S &gt; O &gt; P &gt; N Si &gt; C. In other words, the greater the atomic number of heteroatom (X) in a given row, the easier the insertion reaction of XHn hydrides and the larger the exothermicity. Moreover, the present study demonstrates that both electronic and steric effects play a major role in the course of insertion reactions of germylene into X - H bonds.

The paper cycle involves a broad range of natural resource and environmental impacts because fiber supply relies on trees, paper manufacturing requires fuel inputs, and paper waste disposal can contribute to emissions of the potent greenhouse gas (GHG), metane (CH4). In some countries, the paper cycle may be seen as a net sink for GHG because of reliance on renewable wood by-products and the maintenance of forest plantations. On a worldwide basis, however, this study demonstrates that the paper cycle is a significant contributor to GHG emissions, adding emissions at least comparable in magnitude to that of Australia each year. The estimated global warming contribution of paper in landfills is estimated to be similar to that of paper manufacturing processes, on a heating-equivalent basis. In some temperate regions, original old-growth forests are still harvested to supply pulpwood, resulting in a significant loss of carbon (C) storage. In theory, the paper cycle holds the promise of achieving zero net emissions if pulpwood production, consumption and disposal are carefully managed. In practice, even stabilization of emissions at current levels would be challenging and entail changes comparable to a 20 percent reduction in CH4 generation from landfilled paper, and a 2.5 percent annual increase in plantation establishment would be needed to offset the projected increase in emissions from paper manufacturing.","Carbon sequestration; Forest industry; Greenhouse gases; Industrial ecology; Landfills; Paper cycle; Pulp and paper industry","environmental impact; global warming; greenhouse gas; man-environment relations; pulp and paper industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032743963

The average oxidation states of molybdenum ions in photoreduced samples and ESR data suggest that Mo4+ ions dominate in 0.1% MoO3/Al2O3 samples, whereas Mo4+ and Mo5+ are formed in nearly the same amounts in 1% MoO3/Al2O3. The Mo4+ ions are assumed to be formed from the surface monomolybdates, whereas the Mo5+ ions are formed from polymolybdates, whose fraction substantially increases with an increase in the concentration of the supported molybdenum. The heating of photoreduced samples in a vacuum at 300°C results in a substantial decrease in the concentration of Mo4+ and in an increase in the concentration of Mo5+ due to the metathesis Mo4+ + Mo6+→2Mo5+ in polymolybdate structures. The composition of Mo4+(CO)x complexes in photoreduced MoO3/Al2O3 is studied by IR spectroscopy.

The optical cross-sections were dominated by ultraviolet-A (UVA) absorption, which was a consequence of massive accumulations of mycosporinelike amino acids. The visible region of the spectrum was decomposed into several bands, among which chlorophyll a (Chl a), carotenoids, and individual phycobilipigments could be discerned. There was a clear diel periodicity in the ratio of the optical absorption cross-sections of phycourobilin (PUB) to phycoerythrobilin (PEB), increasing from around 1.7 at night to 2.1 at midmorning. The diel cycle in PUB/PEB is consistent with a reversible interconversion of the two pigments. The ratio of PUB/PEB was inversely correlated with the transfer of excitation energy to photosystem II (PSII). Light absorbed by PUB was not transferred to PSII with a high efficiency, but rather, a significant fraction was reemitted at 565 nm as fluorescence. These observations suggest that the PUBs and PEBs in Trichodesmium act as a dynamic biophysical energy valve that modify the rate of excitation energy delivered to PSII in response to changes in ambient light regime. The low-temperature (77 K) fluorescence emission spectra reveal an extremely weak 685-nm emission signal in relation to that at 730 nm. Based on a simple model, these data suggest that the ratio of PSI/PSII reaction centers in Trichodesmium is about 24:1. Such an extraordinary bias against PSII may help minimize damage to nitrogenase from O2 production in PSII, but it also reduces the photosynthesis-enhanced growth and makes Trichodesmium virtually undetectable by chlorophyll fluorescence. The unique bio-optical properties of Trichodesmium can be used to develop algorithms to study its temporal and spatial distributions from remotely sensed information.",,"Cyanobacteria; Trichodesmium; Trichodesmium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032902606

Consequently, assessment of impact jetting at planetary scales has been largely based on the theories developed for such specific types of collisions. Little experimental work has been done, however, to measure both temperature and target-to-projectile mass ratio of jetting created by spherical projectiles impacting planar targets, which typify planetary impacts. The goal of this study is to examine the validity of applying planar-impact theories to jetting due to impacts of spherical projectiles into planar targets. Using a newly developed spectroscopic approach, we observe jetting created by copper spheres impacting planar dolomite targets at hypervelocities. In contrast with previous experiments using quartz projectiles, the observed mean temperatures of jets due to copper projectiles does not correlate well with the vertical component of impact velocity. Instead, the observed temperatures of jets show much better correlation with impact velocity than the vertical component of impact velocity and impact angle. The experiments also reveal that the target-to-projectile mass ratio within a jet increases with impact angle (measured from the horizontal). In order to understand the significance of these experimental results, they were then compared with a jetting model for asymmetric collisions based on standard theories. Such a comparison indicates qualitative consistencies, such as complete vaporization of the carbonate target (as opposed to mere degassing of carbon dioxide due to incomplete vaporization of carbonate) and higher target-to-projectile mass ratio in a jet at higher impact angles. Quantitative comparison, however, also reveals significant inconsistencies between theory and experiments, such as an impact-angle effect on jet temperature and a correlation in jet temperatures between projectile and target components. In order to resolve these inconsistencies, new factors such as viscous shear heating and the nonsteady state nature of the jetting processes may need to be considered.

By measuring emitted photons as a function of propagation direction with respect to the z axis of the crystal, it is possible to vary the magnitude of a longitudinal-exciton and extraordinary-photon coupling. The effects of this coupling on the resonance energy and oscillator strength of the extraordinary exciton-polariton are established for the emission line of the Γ4 free exciton which exhibits a doublet structure. In contrast, the emission spectra due to the ordinary photons show one weak, sharp line in the same intrinsic exciton region as the Γ4 line. The polarization dependence of the emission intensity is greatly reduced for this sharp line. The behavior is interpreted as arising due to the optically forbidden exciton having Γ3 symmetry. The resonant exciton transitions to the lower exciton-polariton branch and the forbidden state are observed in the extraordinary and ordinary absorption spectra, respectively. ©1999 Publication Board, Japanese Journal of Applied Physics.","Absorption spectrum; CuGaS2; Free exciton; Luminescence spectrum; Mixed-mode exciton-polariton; Polarization dependence","Absorption spectroscopy; Electron transitions; Emission spectroscopy; Excitons; Light polarization; Light transmission; Luminescence; Photons; Copper gallium disulfide; Polaritons; Semiconducting gallium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032674774

This approach is based on a risk concept, where the notion of critical events is introduced and the probability of such events is estimated. The estimation considers both the inherent stochasticity of climatic processes and the artificial stochasticity of climate predictions due to scientific uncertainties. The method is worked out in some detail for the regional problem of crop production and the risks associated with global climate change, and illustrated by a case study (Kursk region of the FSU). In order to get local climatic characteristics (weather), a so-called ""statistical weather generator"" is used. One interesting finding is that the 3% risk level remains constant up to 1.0-1.1°C rise of mean seasonal temperature, if the variance does not change. On the other hand, the risk grows rapidly with increasing variance (even if the mean temperature rises very slowly). The risk approach is able to separate two problems: (i) assessment of global change impact, and (ii) decision making. The main task for the scientific community is to provide the politicians with different options; the choice of admissible (from the social point of view) critical events and the corresponding risk levels is the business of decision makers.","Agriculture; Global change; Risk analysis","Agriculture; Climate change; Cultivation; Economic and social effects; Risk analysis; Risk perception; Assessment approaches; Climate prediction; Global change; Global change impacts; Global climate changes; Mean seasonal temperatures; Scientific community; Scientific uncertainty; Risk assessment; air temperature; climate change; climate effect; crop production; decision making; risk assessment; seasonal variation; stochasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033276217

We suggest this problem to be considered as a non-antagonistic game (in Germeier's sense). A game of this kind is called an ""emission game"". Suppose that there are n independent actors (countries or regions), each of them releasing a certain amount of CO2 per year (in carbon units) into the atmosphere, and that the emission would be reduced by each actor. Each actor has his own aim: to minimise the loss in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) caused by the reduction of emissions. On the other hand, taking into account that it is impossible to estimate more or less precisely the impact of the climate change on GDP for each country today, a common strategy will be to reduce the climate change. Since one of the main leading factors in global warming is the greenhouse effect, then the common aim will be to reduce the sum of emissions. This is a typical conflict situation. How to resolve it? We can weigh the ""egoistic"" and ""altruistic"" criteria for each actor introducing the so-called ""coefficients of egoism"". This coefficient is very large, if the actor uses a very egoistic strategy, and conversely, if the actor is a ""super-altruist"", then the corresponding coefficient is very small. Using these coefficients we get the general solution of the game in a form of some Pareto's equilibrium. The solution is stable and efficient.","CO2 emission; Game theory; Global change; Pareto's equilibrium","Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; CO2 emissions; Common strategy; Conflict situation; General solutions; Global change; Gross domestic products; Reduction of emissions; Total emissions; Game theory; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; emission control; game theory; global warming; Gross Domestic Product",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033264407

A comparison was made between the ambient concentrations measured at 11 background aerosol monitoring stations (in Denmark, the Czech Republic Finland, Norway and Sweden) and the corresponding HM concentrations estimated by the Heavy Metals Eulerian Transport (HMET) meteorological dispersion model. The collected samples were analysed with Particle Induced X-ray Emission analysis (PIXE) except the Finnish samples which were analysed with Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS). The available data covers the period 1985-1994. The comparison showed that the European emissions of As, Cd and Pb seem to be fairly well estimated. On the other hand, the European Zn emissions are underestimated by a factor of 3 or more, while the Cu emissions appear to be slightly overestimated. The HMET dispersion model also made it possible to select occasions for which the sampling sites had a substantial contribution of HM from the highly polluted 'Black Triangle' region (on the borders between the Czech Republic, Poland and Germany). The time evolution of the sources of HMs within this source region could be studied by applying various statistical receptor models on the extensive data set from two Danish stations, Keldsnor and Tange, covering the period 1985-1994. Four source types were clearly discerned throughout the 10 year time period. These sources were: soil dust sea spray; general combustion and oil combustion.

In addition, emission reduction scenarios of varied ambition levels in the bordering areas of Finland and in other parts of Europe were included in the analysis. The impacts of the different scenarios were quantified with exceedances of critical loads for acidification and with the total areas where the critical loads are exceeded. The possibilities for reducing the areas with critical load exceedances with national or bilateral measures were investigated. The differences in areas at risk, if depositions from domestic and nearby sources are estimated with a regional model and point-source databases or with a continental scale model and coarser-scale emission data, were analyzed. The reasons for the differences and the implications for national-level assessment are discussed.","Acidification; Ammonia; Area exceeded; Critical loads; Deposition modeling; Emission scenarios; Integrated assessment; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur oxides","Acidification; Ammonia; Deposition; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Area exceeded; Critical load; Deposition modeling; Emission scenario; Integrated assessment; Sulfur oxide; Risk perception; acidification; air quality; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; forest soil; strategic approach; sulfur emission; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033460428

Many properties related to the carbonate system were analyzed. By using well-known ratios to correct for chemical changes in seawater, the CO2 concentration at a given depth was back calculated to its initial concentration at the time when the water left the surface in winter. We estimated sea-surface CO2 and titration alkalinity (TA) in present-day winter, from which we evaluated the degree of air-sea CO2 disequilibrium in winter was. Using a correction factor for air-sea CO2 disequilibrium in winter, we reconstructed sea-surface CO2 in pre-industrial times. The difference between the back-calculated initial CO2 and sea-surface CO2 in pre-industrial times should correspond to anthropogenic CO2 input. Although the mixing of different water masses may cause systematic error in the calculation, we found that the nonlinear effect induced by the mixing of different water masses was negligible in the upper layer of the North Pacific subtropical gyre along 175°E. The results of our improved method of assessing the distribution of anthropogenic CO2 in that region show marked differences from those obtained using the previous back-calculation method.","Anthropogenic CO2; Carbon cycle; NOPACCS; North Pacific; Subtropical gyre","air-sea interaction; anthropogenic source; back analysis; carbon dioxide; estimation method; gyre; seawater; upper ocean; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033494451

Five of eight exposed animals showed thickened ridges (knob-like structures) at the entrance to alveoli in the alveolar duct and alveolar sac. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the thickening was mainly due to type II cell proliferation. As the previous experiment using sulfite aerosol only showed no alterations in the proximal alveolar regions, the changes observed may be considered as effects of acidic sulfate aerosol alone or in combination with sulfite.

The deposited films were evaluated with XPS, IR, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, and AFM. The nitrogen concentration, chemical bonding, and surface morphology of the deposited films were dependent on substrate self-bias potential, corresponding to ion irradiation energy onto substrate. As substrate self-bias potential decreased, nitrogen-carbon atomic ratio (N/C) increased until -50 V and then decreased below -60 V. The maximum of N/C ratio reached to 1.38, which was almost stoichiometry of C3N4. Crystalline carbon nitride films were formed when substrate temperature above 600 °C. X-ray diffraction pattern of the deposited crystalline film was similar to that of the predicted α and β-C3N4.

The SCOTE retains the port, combustion chamber, and injection geometry of the production six cylinder, 373 kW (500 hp) 3406E heavy-duty truck engine. The engine was equipped with an electronic unit injector and an electronically controlled common rail injector that is capable of multiple injections. An emissions investigation was carried out using a six-mode cycle simulation of the EPA Federal Transient Test Procedure. The results show that the SCOTE meets current EPA mandated emissions levels, despite the higher internal friction imposed by the single-cylinder configuration. NOx versus particulate trade-off curves were generated over a range of injection timings for each mode and results of heat release calculations were examined, giving insight into combustion phenomena in current ""state of the art"" heavy-duty diesel engines. Next, a study of the effects of varying boost pressure levels was conducted. For fixed brake specific NOx levels, with low-pressure (90 MPa) single injections, particulate was found to reduce monotonically as the boost pressure was increased. Interestingly, with low pressure double injections and with high pressure (>90 MPa) single injections, particulate was found to decrease at first and then to increase as the boost pressure was increased beyond an optimum level. A minimum value for particulate with respect to boost level was found for all cases, including the low-pressure single injections, when a correction for the six-cylinder turbocharger efficiency was applied. Computer modeling confirms that this is due to a reduction in the spray penetration and mixing that occurs as the engine gas density is increased. BSFC was generally reduced with increasing boost pressure. These results suggest that variable geometry turbochargers or other enhanced boosting methods will aid in the reduction of emissions and fuel consumption from heavy-duty truck engines.

GRXE is thermal emission from a hot component (∼ 7 keV) and a cool component (∼ 0.8 keV). Observations suggest that the hot component is diffuse, and that it is not escaping away freely. Both what heats the hot component and what confines it in the galactic ridge still remain puzzling, while the cool component is believed to be created by supernovae. We propose a new scenario: the hot component is heated by magnetic reconnection, and confined by a helical magnetic field produced by magnetic reconnection. We solved two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations numerically to study how magnetic reconnection, triggered by a supernova explosion, creates hot plasmas and magnetic islands (helical tubes), and how the magnetic islands confine the hot plasmas in the Galaxy. This is one of the possible mechanisms to trigger reconnection in the Galaxy. We conclude that magnetic reconnection is able to heat the GRXE plasma if the magnetic field is localized in an intense flux tube with Blocal ∼ 30 μG.","Galaxies: Milky Way; Galaxies: X-rays; Interstellar: Magnetic fields; Magnetohydrodynamics; Plasmas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033244795

This study further explores the molecular basis of chemotherapy sensitivity of DS AML patients by examining the expression of chromosome 21-localized genes in myeloblasts from newly diagnosed AML patients. Transcript levels of two chromosome 21-localized genes, cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), measured by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), were 12.0- and 3.8-fold higher in DS compared with non-DS myeloblasts (P &lt; .0001 and P &lt; .0001, respectively). Conversely, there were no significant increases in transcripts for 2 other chromosome 21-localized genes, carbonyl reductase and the reduced folate carrier. CBS transcript levels correlated with both in vitro ara-C sensitivity measured by the 3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium-bromide (MTT) assay (P = .003) and the generation of 3H- ara-C triphosphate (ara-CTP) after in vitro incubations with 5 μmol/L 3H- ara-C (P = .0003). Transcripts of deoxycytidine kinase were 2.6-fold higher in DS compared with non-DS cells and may be a factor in the enhanced metabolism of ara-C in DS cells. There was no significant correlation of SOD transcripts with in vitro ara-C and daunorubicin sensitivities. Increased CBS transcripts could result in elevated CBS activity, which modulates ara-C metabolism by altering reduced folate pools, deoxycytidine triphosphate pools, S-adenosylmethionine levels, and/or methylation of the deoxycytidine kinase gene. The further identification of the molecular mechanisms of chemotherapy sensitivity of DS AML patients may lead to significant improvements in the treatment and cure of AML.",,"cystathionine beta synthase; cytarabine; daunorubicin; superoxide dismutase; acute granulocytic leukemia; adolescent; article; chemotherapy; chromosome 21; clinical article; disease association; Down syndrome; drug mechanism; drug sensitivity; gene expression; gene location; human; human cell; infant; pathogenesis; preschool child; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; school child; Adolescent; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic; Child; Child, Preschool; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21; Cytarabine; Daunorubicin; Down Syndrome; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Leukemia, Myeloid; Leukocytes; Tumor Cells, Cultured",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033566994

Furthermore, this activity could be stimulated in the presence of either α-benzoflavone or β-benzoflavone in an analogous manner to that reported for mammalian P450 forms including human liver cytochrome P4503A4 (CYP3A4).

Part I contains a summary of key policy lessons in pollution management, derived from practical experience inside and outside the World Bank Group over the past decade. Although Part I is aimed primarily at government decision-makers, other readers will derive considerable benefit from a better understanding of the issues facing government agencies. Part II presents good-practice notes on implementation of policy objectives, based on experience with World Bank Group projects and on lessons from the policies and practices of other agencies and organizations in this field. Part III provides detailed guidelines to be applied in the preparation of World Bank Group projects. The guidelines, which cover almost 40 industrial sectors, represent state- of-the-art thinking on how to reduce pollution emissions from the production process. In many cases, the guide-lines provide numerical targets for reducing pollution, as well as maximum emissions levels that are normally achievable through a combination of cleaner production and end-of-pipe treatment. The guidelines are designed to protect human health; reduce mass loadings to the environment; draw on commercially proven technologies; be cost-effective; follow current regulatory trends; and promote good industrial practices, which offer greater productivity and increased energy efficiency. The application of the guidelines set out in Part III can minimize the use of resources and reduce the quantity of wastes requiring treatment and disposal. The guidelines represent good environmental management practices that can be implemented and maintained with the skills and resources typically available in countries in which the World Bank Group operates. The World Bank Group is committed to strengthening management and technical skills and to supporting the development of the necessary institutions in these countries. Where relevant national regulations do not exist, the guidelines may provide a basis for negotiating site-specific agreements between regulators and enterprises.",,"cleaner production; pollution control; World Bank",Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033501401

The involvement of P2 purinoceptors in chemosensory function in the ventrolateral regions of the medulla oblongata was investigated in the anaesthetized rat. We have investigated the effect of antagonizing, or desensitizing, P2 receptors in the retrofacial area of the ventrolateral medulla on factors modifying respiratory activity. 2. Bilateral microinjection of suramin (50 nl, 0.02 M), a P2 purinoceptor antagonist, into the retrofacial area in the artificially ventilated rat reduced resting phrenic nerve discharge. It also markedly affected the response of the phrenic nerve to increases in arterial CO2. Under conditions of hyperoxic, hypocapnic apnoea, the mean threshold for inducing phrenic nerve activity was raised significantly (from an end-tidal CO2 of 2.5% to 4.5%, n = 9). 3. In addition, the slope of the respiratory response curve to increases in CO2 was reduced after suramin. A similar effect was observed after desensitization of certain P2X receptors with αβ-methyleneATP. As arterial levels of O2 were greater than 100 mmHg, and an equivalent pattern of response was observed in sino-aortically denervated and vagotomized animals, we believe any contribution of the peripheral chemoreceptors to be minimal. 4. Our data suggest that respiratory neurones within the retrofacial area (Botzinger complex) represent part of the central site of action of CO2 on respiration.

In general, whether a given policy improves welfare depends on the relative magnitudes of the marginal benefits and costs that depend on the specific structure of the policy. The analysis shows that environmental policies aimed at decreasing urban smog differ considerably in the number and complexity of their effects on welfare, providing important information for the choice of instruments.

The estimates of TEM indicate that over the past 95 years a combination of increasing atmospheric CO2 with historical temperature and precipitation variability causes a 4.2% (4.3 Pg C) decrease in total carbon storage of potential vegetation in the conterminous US, with vegetation carbon decreasing by 7.2% (3.2 Pg C) and soil organic carbon decreasing by 1.9% (1.1 Pg C). Several dry periods including the 1930s and 1950s are responsible for the loss of carbon storage. Our factorial experiments indicate that precipitation variability alone decreases total carbon storage by 9.5%. Temperature variability alone does not significantly affect carbon storage. The effect of CO2 fertilization alone increases total carbon storage by 4.4%. The effects of increasing atmospheric CO2 and climate variability are not additive. Interactions among CO2, temperature and precipitation increase total carbon storage by 1.1%. Our study also shows substantial year-to-year variations in net carbon exchange between the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems due to climate variability. Since the 1960s, we estimate these terrestrial ecosystems have acted primarily as a sink of atmospheric CO2 as a result of wetter weather and higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations. For the 1980s, we estimate the natural terrestrial ecosystems, excluding cropland and urban areas, of the conterminous US have accumulated 78.2 Tg C yr-1 because of the combined effect of increasing atmospheric CO2 and climate variability. For the conterminous US, we estimate that the conversion of natural ecosystems to cropland and urban areas has caused a 18.2% (17.7 Pg C) reduction in total carbon storage from that estimated for potential vegetation. The carbon sink capacity of natural terrestrial ecosystems in the conterminous US is about 69% of that estimated for potential vegetation.",,"atmosphere-biosphere interaction; carbon dioxide enrichment; carbon sink; climate change; sensitivity analysis; terrestrial ecosystem; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032876135

Pinatubo volcanic cloud with the climate model ECHAM4. In order to obtain model results comparable with observations a Newtonian relaxation technique was applied, which forces prognostic model variables towards the observations. A comparison of the simulated aerosol distribution with satellite data reveals good agreement for the first months after the eruption. The model, however, is unable to simulate the tropical aerosol maximum in 1992 and also overestimates the vertical downward and northward transport of aerosols. Substantial improvement was achieved with the introduction of reduced advective vertical transport through the 380 K isentropic layer. Heating rates and top of the atmosphere fluxes, which were calculated online for the first half year after the eruption, are in the observed range. A comparison of Pinatubo simulations between three different vertical ECHAM4 versions (ECHAM4 L19, ECHAM4 L39, MA/ECHAM4) indicates that a vertical resolution of ~700 m in the tropopause region is sufficient to realistically reduce the vertical transport through the tropopause. Consideration of the upper branch of the Brewer Dobson circulation in the MA/ECHAM4 model improves the geographical distribution of the volcanic cloud. The application of a relaxation technique can further reduce major shortcomings of stratospheric simulations with the standard climate model. There remain, however some critical points in the global transport characteristics in all three models which are not fully understood.",,"atmospheric transport; climate modeling; volcanic aerosol; Mount Pinatubo; Philippines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032856912

Taxes are widely used as policy instruments and several supply-side actions like introduction of natural gas, expansion of the district heating network, and strong regulation on the use of electric heating in new buildings. In Denmark, energy regulation towards industry has traditionally been based on voluntary demand-side measures, e.g. free electricity audits funded by the utilities (since 1988), information or subsidies for energy efficient investments (1977-83). Since 1979, taxes on energy have been used for households, and in 1993 taxes were introduced for trade and industry. It was later found that the CO2 objective would not be met unless new initiatives were applied, and that taxes on trade and industry would be the most efficient way to reach further CO2 reductions. The taxes therefore were increased in 1996 especially on trade and industry and will increase in yearly steps until year 2002. The objective was that trade and industry would contribute with 4% of the CO2 reductions. Taxes are now a very important element in the CO2 regulation in trade and industry. In the interest of maintaining competitiveness it was decided that all the revenues from the increased energy taxes should be recycled. Furthermore a number of energy-intensive enterprises will receive a reimbursement, provided they enter into a binding agreement with the Danish Energy Agency. In this paper the Danish energy tax system will be described with the focus on the parts related to the agreements.

The paper argues that whatever long-term policy goals are adopted, greater flexibility lowers implementation costs. Lower implementation costs, in turn, increases the likelihood that the policies will actually be followed and the goals achieved. Importantly, the Kyoto Protocol incorporates key elements of both `what' and `where' flexibility. That is, the `Kyoto basket' includes all six of the major greenhouse gases plus sinks, and the Protocol incorporates several mechanisms that allow emission reductions to take place at the least-cost geographic location, regardless of nation-state boundaries. The Protocol also provides substantial `how' flexibility in the sense that countries can use a variety of means to achieve domestic policy goals. However, the Protocol does not allow emission reductions to take place at a point in time when they can be achieved at lowest cost as long as they are consistent with the long-term environmental goals (`when' flexibility). Additionally, it does not allow the use of efficient price-based policy instruments to define targets and, thereby, balance environmental goals and compliance costs (which could be thought of as a broader version of `when' flexibility). Instead, the Protocol relies exclusively on strict, short term quantity targets. The relative inflexibility of the Protocol with respect to the timing of reductions and definitions of the targets may derive, in part, from a misplaced analogy between the global warming issue and the highly successful effort to phase out CFCs under the Montreal Protocol. The lack of when flexibility may be a key barrier to achieving the broader goals of the Kyoto Protocol, particularly if where flexibility is constrained in the implementation process.",,"Climate change; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Greenhouse effect; Laws and legislation; Public policy; Economic policies; Intertemporal flexibility; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033343038

By comparing a model simulation with the new rate constant to a base case scenario, we found that the [O3] increase was between 2 and 6% for typical rural conditions and between 6 and 16% for typical urban conditions. The increases in [O3] were less than proportional to the reduction in the OH + NO2 rate constant because of negative feedbacks in the photochemical mechanism. Next, we used two different approaches to evaluate how the new OH + NO2 rate constant changed the effectiveness of reductions in emissions of VOC and NO(x): first, we evaluated the effect on [O3] sensitivity to small changes in emissions of VOC (d[O3]/dE(VOC)) and NO(x) (d[O3]/dE(NO); and secondly, we used the empirical kinetic modeling approach to evaluate the effect on the level of emissions reduction necessary to reduce [O3] to a specified level. Both methods showed that reducing the OH +NO2 rate constant caused control strategies for VOC to become less effective relative to NO(x) control strategies. We found, however, that d[O3]/dE(VOC) and d[O3]/dE(NO), did not quantitatively predict the magnitude of the change in the control strategy because the [O3] response was nonlinear with respect to the size of the emissions reduction. We conclude that model sensitivity analyses calculated using small emissions changes do not accurately characterize the effect of uncertainty in model inputs (in this case, the OH + NO2 rate constant) on O3 attainment strategies. Instead, the effects of changes in model inputs should be studied using large changes in precursor emissions to approximate realistic attainment scenarios.The effect of a 20% reduction in the rate constant of the reaction of the hydroxyl radical with NO2 to produce HNO3 on model predictions of ozone mixing ratios ([O3]) and the effectiveness of reductions in emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and NOx for reducing [O3] was examined.

Reforms are also envisaged through Australia's involvement in plans to liberalize energy services and eliminate non-tariff barriers in the energy sector in Apec. The proposal, known as EVSL, was agreed last November 1998 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The non-tariff barriers program aims to compile an inventory by the end of 1999 on non-tariff barriers, which could impede or distort trade flows of coal, gas, electricity and energy products, and related equipment. The EVSL is viewed as one of the keys to economic recovery in Apec and aims to create a low-risk business environment to encourage private-sector investment. Australia's natural gas industry has grown over the last 20 yr from a relatively small base to being the country's third primary energy source, after coal and oil.

In the United States, over one third of perfusion imaging studies are performed with pharmacological stress. Pharmacological stress agents fall into two categories: coronary vasodilating agents such as dipyridamole and adenosine, and cardiac positive inotropic agents such as dobutamine and arbutamine. For both, in the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD), perfusion image abnormalities result from heterogeneity of coronary blood flow reserve. Vasodilating agents work directly on the coronary vessels to increase blood flow, whereas inotropic agents work indirectly by increasing myocardial work load, which then leads to an increase in coronary blood flow. Both classes of agents have high accuracies for diagnosing coronary artery disease, and they have excellent safety records with acceptably low occurrences of side effects. For dipyridamole planar thallium imaging, pooled analysis yields a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 87% for diagnosis of coronary disease, but there is a large variation in reported values depending on various factors, such as the extent of postcatheterization referral bias, the type of imaging (planar versus single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT]), the types of patients being studied (single versus multivessel disease, men versus women), and the imaging agent used (thallium versus one of the technetium-based agents). Diagnostic accuracies for adenosine are similar to those of dipyridamole, with reported overall sensitivities ranging from 83% to 97%, and specificities ranging from 38% to 94%. For dobutamine, pooled analyses yield a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 75%. There is some concern that dobutamine may interfere with uptake of technetium-99m sestamibi, lowering the sensitivity for detection of disease, and thus the vasdodilating agents are generally preferred. Pharmacological stress testing has high clinical use for risk stratifying patients with known or suspected CAD, in patients after myocardial infarction, and in patients needing noncardiac surgery. Vasodilating agents are particularly advantageous in assessing post-myocardial infarction patients, allowing testing as soon as 2 days after the event. Like patients undergoing exercise stress testing, patients with normal perfusion images by pharmacological stress have a < 1% annual incidence of cardiac events. The likelihood of an event increases with the extent and severity of perfusion abnormalities. However, it is important to consider clinical variables when using perfusion imaging for risk stratification, particularly in the presurgery patients. As with exercise testing, adjunct markers such as ST segment depression during testing, lung uptake of radiotracer (if thallium is used), and ventricular cavity dilatation add additional prognostic information to that available from the perfusion images alone. The aim of current research is to find better agents that are easier to use and that have fewer side effects. MRE-0470 is an experimental vasodilating agent that is more receptor selective than adenosine and promises a lower incidence of hypotension. Arbutamine more closely simulates exercise than dobutamine, and it can be administered by a closed-loop computerized delivery device. Work is also underway to look at novel uses of pharmacological stress agents, such as acquiring gated SPECT images during dobutamine infusion to enhance detection of myocardial viability.

However, pressure is mounting from all the quarters to ban these vehicles or to drive them out of the municipal limits. These vehicles with maximum loading capacity of 550 kg employ diesel engines which emit high soot & particulate matter or 2-stroke petrol engines which emit carbon monoxide as high as 13 g/km and hydrocarbon as high as 8 g/km, alarmingly high above the 1996 emission norms of 6.75 g/km CO and 5.40 g/km HC. Also the noise levels were higher. Considering the above threat, the authors had taken up the challenge to investigate and curb the pollution by employing high durability metallic catalytic converters. It was obvious that with conversion efficiency required above 60% for a 2-stroke engine which has high chances of misfiring, a heavy exothermic catalytic reaction in the converter could damage not only the substrate but also the thin carbon steel exhaust system. To overcome these problems, experimental investigations were conducted with respect to Air/Fuel intake system, engine conditions, silencer design, silencer material, converter material and converter location including its inlet & outlet cones. The paper highlights the final configuration, which not only meets the noise & emission norms but also satisfies the converter durability of 6000 kms within permissible performance deterioration.

Orbital measurements can be carried out on solar-system bodies whose atmospheres and trapped radiation environments do not interfere significantly with the emissions. Elemental compositions can be inferred from observations of these line emissions. Future planetary missions also will involve landing both stationery and roving probes on planetary surfaces. Both X-ray and gamma-ray spectrometers will be used for performing elemental analysis of surface samples. These future planetary missions will impose a number of constraints: the flight instruments must be significantly reduced in weight from those previously flown; for many missions, gravity assist will be required, greatly increasing mission duration, resulting in the passage of several years before the first scientific measurement of a solar system body. The detector systems must operate reliably after years of cosmic-ray irradiation. Both spectroscopy and imaging detection systems are required.

It has been shown that air pollution is caused mainly by increased automotive traffic and increased penetration of diesel vehicles. Air-quality problems will become much more complicated and more severe in the future with increased emphasis on reducing air pollution and global warming. These situation will require continuous reduction of automobile emissions. In order to obtain cleaner exhaust emissions, cooperative studies between vehicle and fuel technologies are considered to be essential, and AQIRP in the United States and Auto/oil Program in Europe were already conducted to develop the best combination of measures for air pollution improvement. In 1996, Japan Clean Air Program (JCAP) was launched by Petroleum Energy Center (PEC) in cooperation with the Petroleum Association of Japan (PAJ) and the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA). This program was planned, referring to U.S. AQIRP and European Auto/Oil Program, in order to improve air quality in Japan, taking into consideration Japan's unique conditions such as its regulations, driving patterns, fuel quality, air quality level, climate, and so on. Participants in the program consist of not only from industries but also those from government and academia, so that the study will be reflected in the future environmental policies. As a new attempt, JCAP is introducing fundamental combustion analysis to elucidate the results of fuel/engine matrix tests and health-effects studies in order to understand air quality requirements. Based on results of the emission test of future vehicle/engine and fuel technologies, JCAP will predict air-quality in 2010, and will evaluate the costs and effects. This program is planned to be completed in 2002 spring. This paper describes JCAP's objectives and design, including current air-quality situation in Japan, regulations regarding automotive emissions and fuel-quality, technological development, and the features of JCAP.

As a result of the PCX modelling the experimental errors in ion temperature values can be reduced and the range of accessible PCX spectra extended from magnetic axis to separatrix.

We found worsened health indices in 10 year-old children (n = 61; age = 10.4 ± 0.4 years; height = 142 ± 7 cm; mean ± SD) during a 1986 study in one of the most pollution endangered regions of Bulgaria (total suspended particle matter, TSPM = 520 ± 61 μg/m3; mean ± SE and annual mean concentration of SO2 = 98 ± 19 μg/m3; mean ± SE). Both vital capacity (VC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were consistently lower (X = 88.5% and 82.5%, respectively) than Bulgarian reference values. Because of the strong industrial decrease in this region in recent years, the air pollution was reduced significantly. In 1989 TSPM was 460 ± 40 μg/m3 and SO2 = 60 ± 10 μg/m3; in 1992 - 350 ± 27 μg/m3 and 60 ± 9 μg/m3, and in 1996 - 187 ± 9 μg/m3 and 60 ± 12 μg/m3. In 1996 we conducted a study in the same region to determine the effects of reduced outdoor air pollution on children's lung function. A comprehensive lung function assessment was performed on 97 children (mean age 10.4 ± 0.6 years, height = 145 ± 6 cm). The FEV1 VC were 103 ± 9% and 100 ± 9% respectively. There was a tendency of lower values of MEF(50%) (94 ± 9%) and Single Breath Transfer Factor - T(L,CO)(93 ± 9%). Children with passive smoking home exposure had lower values of T(L,CO) than those of the remainder by 4.4% (p = 0.038).

These requirements were usually presented as concentration of total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH), and ranged from 10 to over 10,000 mg TPH/kg soil. Members of this multi-disciplinary group, consisting of representatives from industry, government and academia, jointly recognized that the numerical standard was not based on a scientific assessment of human health risk and established the following goal for the effort: To develop scientifically defensible information for establishing soil cleanup levels that are protective of human health at hydrocarbon contaminated sites. The approach developed by the TPHCWG for TPH hazard assessment consisted of dividing the petroleum hydrocarbon material into multichemical-containing fractions with similar fate and transport characteristics. These fractions were then assigned fate and transport properties (volatilization factor, soil leaching factor, etc.) and toxicity values (RfDs/RfCs) representative of the fraction. The actual site specific hazard assessment and derivation of cleanup levels is accomplished by analyzing sites to determine which fraction(s) is present and applying the appropriate fate, transport and toxicity factors. The method used by this group to determine TPH Faction specific toxicity criteria is a surrogate approach intended to supplement the indicator approach. Indicators are single, carcinogenic hydrocarbon compounds which are evaluated/regulated individually at either the federal or state level. The TPHCWG surrogate approach utilized all appropriate fraction specific toxicity data (single compound and mixture/product), minus the carcinogenic indicator compounds, to derive the fraction specific RfDs and RfCs. This hazard assessment method for petroleum contaminated sites would be utilized where indicator compounds are not present or are below/remediated to regulatory action levels. Derivation of the RfD/RfC values for the n-hexane containing aliphatic C5 - C8 fraction is examined in detail to illustrate the underlying assumptions and use of existing data employed by the TPHCWG to develop fraction specific toxicity criteria. Toxicity RfDs/RfCs for all of the model fate and transport based fractions are also presented.",,"fuel oil; hydrocarbon; lubricating agent; petroleum; petroleum derivative; conference paper; ecotoxicology; industrial hygiene; leaching; petrochemical industry; risk assessment; soil pollution; soil treatment; volatilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033063623

The blending of a light paraffinic fuel to a commercial diesel fuel reduces HC, CO, PM and NOx emissions and a light fuel with aromatics or kerosene reduces PM and NOx but not HC and CO. The PM and NOx emissions from the paraffinic fuel are lower than these from the kerosene, and these emissions are decreased with an increase in the blending ratio of both light fuels to a commercial diesel fuel. Reformulated diesel fuels such as a clean city diesel fuel and fuels with few aromatics reduce PM and NOx emissions more than commercial diesel fuel, and the reduction rate is highly dependent on aromatic content. The effects on emissions of blending soybean methyl ester or tripropylene glycol methyl ether to a commercial diesel fuel were evaluated. The results showed that the PM reduction rate increases with an increase in the oxygenate content in the sample, and the PM emission from a mixture of 25% glycol and 75% commercial diesel fuel is almost equal to that from a light paraffinic fuel. The analysis of PM composition showed that a reduction in aromatics reduces the SOF caused by the reduction of the unburned fuel portion in the SOF, but not soot. On the other hand, the glycol reduces both the SOF and soot. The PM reduction rate highly depended on aromatic and oxygen content in the sample, and the NOx on aromatic content, according to statistical analysis using all test samples.

The absorption and fluorescence spectra of these compounds were measured in twenty different solvents and the molecular orbitals relating to excitation and emission (or relaxation) were calculated with semi-empirical methods. The absorption/excitation and emission were ascribed to the electronic transition between HOMO and LUMO. The order of energy gaps between HOMO and LUMO of the 4,7-substituted benzofurazan compounds at the optimized geometry of the ground state agreed with the order of the maximum absorption/excitation energy in vapor phase obtained with the Taft-Kamlet treatment. The order of energy gaps at the optimized geometry of the excited state also agreed with the order of the maximum emission energy in the vapor phase obtained with the Taft-Kamlet treatment. The energy levels of the S1 state of the 4,7-disubstituted benzofurazan compounds were just under the energy level of the T2 state. The order of the energy gaps between the S1 state and the T2 state of the 4,7-disubstituted benzofurazan compounds agreed with the order of the fluorescence quantum yield (Φ) in cyclohexane. These results show that the maximum absorption/excitation, emission wavelengths and the fluorescence quantum yields (Φ) of the 4,7-disubstituted benzofurazan compounds are determined by the energy gaps between the HOMO and LUMO energy at the geometry of the ground state, of the excited state and the energy gap between the S1 and T2 states, respectively.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001294894

The fragment contained three complete ORFs; precise subcloning revealed that a 249 bp fragment located in the promoter region between ORF1 and ORF3 was sufficient for repression. Quantification of the promoter activities by using a thermostable malate dehydrogenase gene as a reporter showed that the promoter for ORF3 (P(ORF3)) maintained high activity in mycelia grown in the presence of glucose but lost activity rapidly in maltose medium. P(ORF3) activity increased markedly when the promoter sequence was introduced on a high-copy-number plasmid.

For this problem, under some limiting conditions, an exact solution for the decay process for any value of R is now known[2] which displays the role of causality explicitly and, for small inter-atomic distances, leads to a super-radiance feature of the Dicke model and considerable energy trapping for long times.

Central to any emissions regulation is the test procedure, which must include an appropriate test cycle. Based on actual in-use speed and estimated torque data collected from an agricultural tractor, a backhoe-loader, and a crawler tractor, three duty cycles were developed. Using an iterative process, comparison of chi-square statistical data was used to identify representative microtrips, segments of engine operation gathered during performance of selected activities. Representative microtrips for specific activities for a particular nonroad application were ""strung"" together to make up a test cycle. Before accepting the test cycle, data for the cycle was compared to statistical data used to characterize the raw data in an effort to validate that the cycle was representative of the raw data. After validating the transient cycle, it was transformed into a schedule of torque and speed points at one-second intervals, to facilitate engine testing. Using a reference speed, referred to as Governor Central Speed, the cycle speed points were normalized. The torque points were normalized using the transient federal test procedure (FTP). A representative transient test cycle for each of the agricultural tractor, the backhoe-loader, and crawler tractor developed from this work have been used to conduct emissions tests on diesel engines, and these cycles are referenced here to provide a means to perform a laboratory assessment of nonroad engine emissions.

If the laser pulse is focused onto a solid or gaseous material, a plasma is created. The electrons, as well as the ions are accelerated in the strong laser field up to energies in the range of keV to several MeV. The interaction of the high energy particles with cold material, that is, the solid target yield of intense X-ray emission, K-shell - as well as bremsstrahlung-radiation. The K-shell emission from layered targets is a useful indicator of the production efficiency, energy distribution, and transport of hot electrons produced in fs-laser plasmas. For the diagnosis of laser plasma interaction and its application as an intense X-ray source, the spatial, temporal and spectral distribution of K-shell X rays is of fundamental importance. Focusing crystal spectrographs can be used to obtain a single shot X-ray spectra of laser plasmas produced by table top fs-lasers. With a spatial- and spectral-focusing spectrograph based on a toroidally bent crystal, the emission region of the hoi plasma and Kα-radiation can be determined. Recording the spectra online by a frontside illuminated charge-coupled device (CCD) allows alignment of the crystal spectrograph, as well as the laser beam locusing leading to different X-ray source sizes. Using a controlled fs-prepulse, an increase in Kα radiation could be observed with the diagnostic.

Their lyotropic behaviour appeared to be dependent on the intracolumnar order of stacking of the respective hexaester molecules. With linear alkanes in mixtures with the phenylene centred hexaesters (series 1 derived from hexahydroxybenzene) no lyomesomorphism occurs, whereas with most of the cyclohexane centred analogues (series 2, scyllitol derivatives) even two lyomesophases were observed: a hexagonal type and, in 49 cases, a nematic columnar (induced) phase. Here, the lyotropy demonstrates its dependence on the length of chains both of the alkanoyl groups of 2 and the solvent (the linear alkanes) used. In the case of the selected cyclic solvents, three factors proved to govern the lyotropic mesomorphism of all these disc-like hexaesters: (1) their degree of saturation, (2) their molecular size/volume, and (3) their stereostructure. Interestingly, with benzene and other (less unsaturated) monocyclic solvents, both series of hexaesters exhibit only a hexagonal type of mesophase which is induced in four cases. Saturated monocyclic hydrocarbons act on members of the aromatic centred series 1 in the same way; with cyclohexane however, two more cases of induction of a hexagonal type of lyomesophase have been observed. To our surprise, binary mixtures of most hexaesters of series 2 (scyllitol derivatives) with saturated monocyclic hydrocarbons show the same polymorphic (nematic and hexagonal) situation as that found here with linear hydrocarbons; moreover, in comparison with the results with linear alkanes, four more cases of induced phases appear with these cycloalkanes. These results, in particular the many cases of lyomesophase induction, relate to the first examples of lyotropic mesomorphism in binary systems of disc-like materials with saturated cyclic solvents/hydrocarbons. Finally, in some examples presented here it was found for the first time that bulkiness/space-filling or the stereostructure of the saturated cyclic solvents/hydrocarbons, e.g. cis- or trans-decalin, also play an important role in the lyotropic mesomorphism of their mixtures with the radial hexaesters of the two series 1 and 2. By means of models shown here for the first time in figures 4 to 6, ideas are put forward about peculiarities due to microsegregation in relation to the (formally) very similar members of both hexaester series 1 and 2 as a key to understanding the drastic difference in their thermotropic as well as their lyotropic states. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001165013

There are currently two approaches. One uses simplified climate models that can be run for long periods and helps answer questions regarding the relative amplitudes of the climatic response to precession, obliquity, and eccentricity. The second approach uses more sophisticated climate models to examine the regional variations of climates associated with particular orbital forcing. Neither approach completely bridges the gap between astronomical forcing and the environmental response. In this paper, we review both methods, and their application to Quaternary and pre-Quaternary Milankovitch variations. The simplified models suggest that the temporal characteristic of variability will be different for an ice-free Earth but that there are mechanisms for the amplification of the 100 ka eccentricity variations. We also show that the more sophisticated models are relatively robust in predicting low latitude climate response, but that the predictions for higher latitude response are more variable. This can be explained in terms of whether the climate system goes through a threshold for the formation of snow and ice sheets. If a climate model has a warm bias, this threshold will be incorrectly represented.","Climate modelling; Jurassic climates; Milankovitch; Orbital forcing; Palaeoclimate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347599328

Its chronometric tapping cycle coincides with cycle of the continuous casting machine which makes possible hot rolling with additional energy savings and increased productivity of the entire steel plant. The reduction in noise to approximately 90 decibels maximum inside the meltshop is due to the closed furnace and under the slag.

Enough energy (temperature) is left in the flue gas existing the preheater to treat it in a postcombustion chamber where thermal incineration of noxious emission takes place.

Densities of electronic states of tubulene are comparable with those of fullerene and graphite. The mechanism of intercalation of tubulene is interpreted based on calculations of the total energy and activation barriers to metal atom transfer in the Li@(C20)3 cluster.

The energy depends slightly on the position of the lithium atom within a distance of 1 Å from the axis of the tube, but abruptly increases when the atom approaches the carbon network. Permeation of the lithium atom into a tube through its holes in the ends is a barrierless and energetically favorable process, while permeation through a convoluted graphite layer requires passing through an energy barrier of 50 eV.

These include the first radio images of the planet's entire southern hemisphere, which is shown to be ≈5% brighter than the northern at 6.1 and 2.0 cm, and possibly at 0.35 cm. The latitudinal brightness distribution varies substantially over time. The bright band at latitude 30°N seen throughout the 1980s at wavelengths 6.1 cm and longer by A. W. Grossman, D. O. Muhleman, and G. L. Berge (1989, Science245, 1211-1215), by I. de Pater and J. R. Dickel (1991, Icarus. 94, 474-492), and in our 1990 6.1-cm image is absent in our 6.1-cm image from 1995. Instead, this image shows a bright band around latitude ≈40°S and a dark zone around the equator. An image at 2.0 cm from 1994 shows a bright band around latitudes ≈40°N and another one around ≈17°N which displays substructure. This contrasts with the flat 2.0-cm brightness distribution observed throughout the 1980s. We model the changes in Saturn's brightness at radio wavelengths caused by supersaturation and humidity effects in the NH4SH and NH3-ice clouds, as well as by variations in the temperature structure of the upper troposphere. It is found that each of these processes is by itself able to change the planet's radio brightness, but that a multiwavelength study can disentangle their effects. The 3.6- and 6.1-cm observations from 1990 can be reproduced by supersaturation of the NH4SH cloud, while humidity effects and supersaturation of NH3 ice are ruled out. Detailed modeling of the data from 1990 shows that at northern midlatitudes, NH4SH condensed at the thermochemical equilibrium temperatue of 235.5 K, while over most of the planet, condensation did not occur until T=(190±5) K. Supersaturation may also cause the dark equatorial region seen in 1995 at 6.1 cm. Observations of the rings show that the west (dusk) ansa is brighter than the east (dawn) ansa by factors of up to 2. The polarization characteristics are as expected in the case of single scattering of Saturn's thermal emission. The magnitude of the asymmetry increases with increasing wavelength and with decreasing distance to the planet, implying the effect arises in the scattered planetary emission rather than in the rings' thermal emission. We show that the east-west asymmetry may be due to multiple scattering in gravitational (Julian-Toomre) wakes, although more detailed models are needed to assess this possibility. The measured brightness of the A and inner B rings as a function of scattering angle agrees to within ≈30% with model calculations by J. N. Cuzzi, J. B. Pollack, and A. L. Summers (1980, Icarus44, 683-705) of scattering of Saturn's thermal emission off ice particles with N(r)~r-3 between r=0.1 and 100 cm. In particular, the predicted strong forward peak of the scattering is clearly seen in the data. The brightness of both ansae in the outer B ring is a factor of 2 lower than that of the model and than the brightness at intermediate scattering angles, suggesting an excess of large (radius ≳100 cm) particles in this ring. © 1999 Academic Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001471396

The authors studied the effects of 50% nitrous oxide (N2O) and a low-dose propofol infusion on tc MEPs paired electrical stimulation during fentanyl anesthesia with partial neuromuscular blockade. Design: Cross-over study. Setting: St Antonius Hospital, Nieuwegein, The Netherlands. Participants: Ten patients scheduled to undergo surgery on the thoracoabdominal aorta were studied; 6 women aged 54 to 69 years and 4 men aged 68 to 77 years. Interventions: After achieving a stable anesthetic state and before surgery, tc MEPs were recorded during four 15- minute periods: (I) air/oxygen (O2; F1O2 = 50%); propofol target blood concentration, 0.5 μg/mL; (II) N2O/O2 (F1O2 = 50%); propofol target blood concentration, 0.5 μg/ mL; (III) N2O/O2 (F1O2 = 50%; propofol target blood concentration, 1.0 μg/mL; and (IV) air/O2 (F1O2 = 50%); propofol target blood concentration, 1.0 μg/mL. Measurements and Main Results: Tc MEPs were recorded from the right extensor digitorum communis muscle and the right tibialis anterior muscle. The right thenar muscle was used for recording the level of relaxation; the T1 response was maintained at 40% to 70% of the control compound muscle action potential. There was no significant difference in onset latency among the four phases. The addition of N2O and doubling the target propofol infusion to 1.0 μg/mL resulted in a 40% to 50% reduction of tc MEP amplitude recorded in the extensor digitorum communis muscle and tibialis anterior muscle (p &lt; 0.01). During each phase, tc MEPs could be elicited and interpreted, except in one patient, in whom no tc MEPs could be elicited in the leg because of technical problems. Conclusion: The data indicate that tc MEP monitoring is feasible during low- dose propofol, fentanyl/50% N2O in O2 anesthesia and partial neuromuscular blockade.","Evoked potentials; Motor; Nitrous oxide; Partial neuromuscular blockade; Propofol; Thoracic aortic surgery; Transcranial electric stimulation","fentanyl derivative; nitrous oxide; propofol; adult; aged; anesthesia induction; aorta surgery; article; clinical article; clinical trial; crossover procedure; electromyogram; electrostimulation; evoked muscle response; extensor digitorum longus muscle; female; human; male; neuromuscular blocking; priority journal; spinal cord function; thoracic aorta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033011486

The effects of such abiotic changes on ecosystem variables such as nitrogen mineralization and carbon accumulation can affect plant species composition, which in turn may affect various ecosystem processes. However, these interacting effects of plant species composition on ecosystem processes and vice versa are often not included in simulation models. In this paper, a model is developed that includes both plant competition and the flows of nutrients, carbon, and water through the ecosystem. Direct effects of changing atmospheric CO2 on biomass, plant nitrogen concentrations, and litter quantity and quality are simulated together with indirect effects through changes in plant species composition. This model is validated against data from a primary succession chronosequence sere of Dutch inland dunes. For this validation, historical N deposition and atmospheric CO2 concentration records are used. Simulated plant species biomass, organic matter C and N, and total C and N accumulation were found to correspond to measured data. The model simulated plant species replacement well at the different sites of the chronosequence even though the historic conditions differed much between the sites. Additional analyses of the effect of N deposition (preindustrial to present-day) and elevated CO2 (preindustrial to present-day) in this ecosystem showed that N deposition had a strong effect both on vegetation development and on C and N accumulation. Compared to this, the stimulating effects of elevated CO2 on vegetation development were relatively small. Elevated CO2 affected early vegetation development, but the long-term response of vegetation development is dependent on N availability. In old mature forest, N deposition had only small effects while elevated CO2 delayed forest aging. Indirect effects of CO2 on C and N accumulation through changing plant competitive relations may ultimately be larger than direct CO2 effects.","Carbon accumulation; Chronosequence; CO2 concentration; CO2 levels; Decomposition; Elevated; Historical; Mineralization; Modeling ecosystem processes and plant species composition; N accumulation; N cycling; N deposition; Plant competition; Validation; Vegetation succession","biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; ecological modeling; nitrogen; plant community; succession",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033178334

Our study was designed to evaluate the effect of the combination of desflurane with N2O versus desflurane alone on postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in a subgroup of female patients and PONV was considered as the primary endpoint. After approval of the local Ethics Committee and informed consent 60 female in-patients (ASA I and II), aged 18-65 y, scheduled for breast surgery with a duration of 1-3 h were included. Obese patients or patients with a history of PONV and-motion sickness were excluded. No prophylactic anti-emetic therapy was allowed during the study. Patients received a standardized anesthetic technique consisting of propofol for induction, vecuronium and fentanyl for intubation, followed by desflurane with or without N2O (randomisation list) and fentanyl supplements if required for maintenance of anesthesia. At the end of anesthesia PONV was recorded during 24 h in different periods. There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to demographic data and duration of anesthesia. In addition, there were no significant differences in the amount of intraoperative fentanyl or postoperative narcotics. The incidence of PONV was significantly higher in the group of patients receiving desflurane in N2O-O2 mixture compared with the group receiving desflurane in AIR-O2 mixture. The combination of desflurane with N2O in female patients undergoing breast surgery is associated with a significantly higher incidence of PONV and a higher need of antiemetic drugs, when compared to a N2O free regime.","Anesthetics, volatile, desflurane;Recovery, postoperative; Complications, nausea, vomiting","desflurane; nitrous oxide; vecuronium; adult; aged; anesthesia complication; article; breast surgery; drug effect; female; human; incidence; inhalation anesthesia; major clinical study; nausea; neuromuscular blocking; postoperative complication; risk factor; vomiting; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anesthetics, Inhalation; Anesthetics, Intravenous; Antiemetics; Breast; Female; Fentanyl; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Isoflurane; Middle Aged; Neuromuscular Nondepolarizing Agents; Nitrous Oxide; Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting; Propofol; Prospective Studies; Vecuronium Bromide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033056697

Application to liquids has proved problematic due to high spatial confinement of the LIBS plasma and rapid quenching of the excited-state emission. This work presents an alternative approach to trace metal determination in liquids in which 1.0 mL of liquid is deposited onto a carbon planchet and then evaporated, thus transforming the liquid analysis to a solid surface analysis. Using optimized excitation and detection conditions, we have identified spectral regions for sensitive detection of 15 metals (Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Hg, Pb). The limit of detection (LOD) for the technique ranged from 10 ppb to 10 ppm for these elements. A 100 ppb LOD represents detection of 130 picograms of metal (approximately 2 picomoles) in a single measurement calculated from the laser spot size on the sample. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra of the samples provide insight into the observed reproducibility and linearity of the technique for several of the metals studied.",,"Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Heavy metals; Laser ablation; Scanning electron microscopy; Trace elements; Detection limits; Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS); Solid surface analysis; Trace analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033366032

The content, enrichment factor, concentration trend, distribution, nature and modes of occurrence of major, minor and trace elements in RDC and RDC ash were characterized. It was found that a number of trace elements (Ag, Cd, Cl, Cr, Cu, Ho, I, Pb, Pr, Re, Sb, Sm, Sn, and Zn) in RDC have concentrations significantly higher (enrichment factor ≥10) than the respective Clarke (worldwide averaged) values for coals. The distribution of trace elements such as Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, Sb, and Zn, is controlled mostly by the organic matter, clay minerals and Fe oxyhydroxides, and in some cases by carbonates, sulphates, phosphates, chlorides and alloys. Organics, heavier, magnetic, fine and especially accessory minerals and phases in RDC are concentrating phases for these trace elements. Trace elements in RDC may be present, in decreasing order of significance, as: element-organic compounds; impurities in the mineral matter; major components in the mineral matter; major and impurity components in the inorganic amorphous matter; and elements in the fluid constituents. This characterization also reveals those elements that have the greatest potential for environmental impacts or for possible resource recovery. The results show that the effective economic and environmental management of MSW and RDC requires a long-term strategy based on a detailed understanding of the source, formation, behaviour and fate of the modes of trace element occurrences in MSW, RDC and combustion waste residues.","Ash; Municipal solid waste; Refuse-derived char; Trace elements","Characterization; Clay; Coal ash; Environmental impact; Inorganic compounds; Iron compounds; Management; Minerals; Organic compounds; Recovery; Solid wastes; Trace elements; Clarke values; Content enrichment factor; Municipal solid waste; Refuse derived char; Resource recovery; Thermolysis; Refuse derived fuels; fuel; municipal waste; trace element",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033134260

Complaints about perceived MTBE exposures and adverse health symptoms have been registered in several states, including New Jersey (NJ). Fueling automobiles is the activity thought to cause the highest environmental MTBE exposures. The current study was conducted to determine the MTBE concentrations inside automobile cabins during fueling, which represents the peak exposure that can occur at full service gasoline service stations, such as those that exist in NJ. Air samples were collected at service stations located on the NJ and PA turnpikes from March 1996 to July 1997 during which the MTBE content in gasoline varied. A bimodal distribution of MTBE concentrations was found in the cabin of the cars while fueling. The median MTBE, benzene and toluene in cabin concentrations were 100, 5.5 and 18 ppb. respectively, with the upper concentrations of the distribution exceeding 1 ppm for MTBE and 0.1 ppm for benzene and toluene. The highest in cabin concentrations occurred in a car that had a malfunctioning vapor recovery system and in a series of cars sampled on an unusually warm, calm winter day when the fuel volatility was high, the evaporation maximal and the dispersion by wind minimal. The in-cabin concentrations were typically higher when the car window was opened during the entire fueling process. Thus, exposure to MTBE during fueling can be reduced by properly maintaining the integrity of the fuel system and keeping the windows closed during fueling.",,"benzene; carbon monoxide; ether derivative; gasoline; toluene; air analysis; air sampling; conference paper; dispersion; environmental exposure; human; motor vehicle; vapor; weather; winter",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032799457

The solution algorithm is implemented in a traffic assignment program for emission studies, referred to as TAPES. The use of the algorithm is demonstrated through a TAPES model case study on a Charlotte, NC network database for 1990 AM peak period. The operating mode mix of VMT in cold transient, hot transient and hot stabilized modes, also known as the mix of cold-starts, hot-starts and stabilized mode trips, is derived on a link by link basis. The results are aggregated by facility type and the location of link segments. It is observed that the operating mode fractions in transient and stabilized modes could vary widely across different facility types geographic locations. The aggregated operating mode fractions derived from the assignment analysis indicates that a lesser proportion of VMT operates in cold and hot transient modes when compared to the operating mode mix derived from the Federal Test Procedure (FTP).","Air quality; Car travel; Highway; Traffic assignment","air quality; car use; exhaust emission; Charlotte; North Carolina; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032942768

Our calculations show that they both represent well the experimental Rydberg ℓ state populations but fail to describe the core states (n = 2,3,4).

Some gas-to-liquids products are used as transportation fuels and as blendstocks for upgrading crude-derived fuels. Methylal (CH3-O- CH2-O-CH3), also known as dimethoxymethane or DMM, is a gas-to-liquid chemical that has been evaluated for use as a diesel fuel component. Methylal contains 42% oxygen by weight and is soluble in diesel fuel. The physical and chemical properties of neat methylal and for blends of methylal in conventional diesel fuel are presented. Methylal was found to be more volatile than diesel fuel, and special precautions for distribution and fuel tank storage are discussed. Steady state engine tests were also performed using an unmodified Cummins B5.9 turbocharged diesel engine to examine the effect of methylal blend concentration on performance and emissions. Substantial reductions of particulate matter emissions have been demonstrated for 10 to 30% blends of methylal in diesel fuel. This research indicates that methylal may be an effective blendstock for diesel fuel provided design changes are made to vehicle fuel handling systems.

This lake was treated with toxaphene as a picsicide in July 1963. Electron-capture negative ion mass spectrometry and electron-capture detection were applied in combination with enantioselective gas chromatography using modified cyclodextrin columns. Of the 10 toxaphene peaks identified in each of the sediment slices, two congeners, 2-exo, 3-endo, 6-exo,8,9,10-hexachlorobornane (B6-923 or Hx-Sed) and 2-endo,3-exo,5-endo,6-exo,8,9,10-heptachlorobornane (B7-1001 or Hp-Sed), were the most abundant. Each of the three chiral stationary phases used in this study was successful at resolving the enantiomers in at least of one of the two congeners. Among them was permethylated β-cyclodextrin (Chirasil-Dex), which, up until now, has never been used for enantiomer separation of compounds of technical toxaphene. B6- 923 and another less abundant, as of yet unknown, hexachlorobornane were racemic in all sediment core slices. For B7-1001, the latter eluting enantiomer was always more predominant. Furthermore, the enantiomeric ratio was found to consistently decrease with time from approximately 0.8 in the early slices (~1950) to 0.7 in the slice representing 1992, implying that the first eluted B7-1001 enantiomer is less persistent than the second. B6- 923 and B7-1001 are most likely metabolites of the more highly chlorinated congeners. A structural evaluation provided evidence that reductive dechlorination at carbons with geminal chlorine atoms is the primary microbial degradation pathway in sediments from Hanson Lake.","Enantioselective analysis; Modified cyclodextrins; Sediment; Toxaphene","2,3,5,6,8,9,10 heptachlorobornane; 2,3,6,8,9,10 hexachlorobornane; beta cyclodextrin derivative; bornane derivative; campheclor; unclassified drug; analytic method; article; chemical composition; chirality; degradation; enantiomer; extraction; lake; priority journal; sediment; structure analysis; toxin analysis; toxin structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032707987

On both types of mine spoils, primarily N and P limited plant growth. On non-carboniferous mine spoil, low P availability to plants was alleviated by mineral fertiliser application while on carboniferous mine spoil, due to P immobilisation, P availability was still limiting plant growth after similar levels of P fertilisation. The elevated Nmin content in carboniferous mine spoil compared to non-carboniferous mine spoil is probably the result of less N leaching as the dominant N form in carboniferous mine spoil is NH4+ while the highly mobile NO3-is prevailing in the noncarboniferous mine spoil.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of AC on the visual interpretation of the RCA and anteroseptal (corresponding to the left anterior descending artery [LAD]) regions in CAD patients. Methods: Fifty-six patients with suspected CAD underwent 201T1 stress/4h-delayed imaging SPECT using a simultaneous 201T1 emission/99mTc transmission imaging protocol. Images were reconstructed using the maximum likelihood-expectation maximum algorithm without and with AC. The stress/4h-delayed images were interpreted blindly for reversible or fixed defects in the RCA and LAD regions by three experienced physicians. Coronary angiography, electrocardiography and enzyme findings were used to establish diagnoses of ischemia or infarction, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed. Results: Statistical testing of ROC curve areas showed that defect detection performance improved with AC when compared with performance without AC in the RCA region. This was mainly the result of a systematic increase inspecificity of 12% or more (for any observer and any type of defect) for a similar sensitivity (no definite change insensitivity values). However, defect detection performance significantly decreased in the LAD territory with AC images (P &lt; 0.05) because of a systematic decrease in sensitivity of 20% or more, with no consistent change in specificity. Similar trends were observed when reversible and fixed defects were considered separately. Conclusion: AC significantly affects the visual interpretation of 201T1 stress/4 h- delayed SPECT images. This study confirmed the increase in specificity obtained with AC in the RCA territory. However, in the population considered, the studied AC was deleterious for the LAD territory assessment.","201T1 cardiac SPECT; Attenuation correction; Coronary artery disease; Receiver operating characteristic analysis","thallium 201; article; coronary artery disease; diagnostic accuracy; heart infarction; heart muscle perfusion; human; image analysis; image reconstruction; left anterior descending coronary artery; major clinical study; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; right coronary artery; single photon emission computer tomography; Coronary Disease; Exercise Test; Heart; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardium; Sensitivity and Specificity; Thallium Radioisotopes; Tomography, Emission-Computed; Tomography, X-Ray",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032841130

Thus, &gt;99% of copepod fecal material was remineralized within the mixed water layer (0-20 m). However, in the area and season dominated by the large calanoid copepod Limnocalanus macrurus (bay station in spring), fecal carbon sedimentation was an order of magnitude higher than at the other two stations. From June onwards, when the bay station was dominated by cyclopoids, the situation changed: the fecal carbon sedimentation remained 30% lower in the bay than in the archipelago, although the fecal carbon production was estimated to be 2 times higher in the bay. Furthermore, pellet fragmentation (percentage of broken pellets of total fecal carbon sedimentation) was highest in spring and autumn at all areas and increased towards the open sea, being 27%, 45%, and 61% at the bay, archipelago, and open sea stations, respectively. This gradation was probably due to more intense turbulence and water column mixing in the open sea, resulting in more efficient loosening and breakup of pellets.

These projects will reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or sequester carbon, and will also result in non-GHG benefits (i.e., environmental, economic, and social benefits). Monitoring, evaluating, reporting, and verifying (MERV) guidelines are needed for these projects to accurately determine their net GHG, and other, benefits. Implementation of MERV guidelines is also intended to: (1) increase the reliability of data for estimating GHG benefits; (2) provide real-time data so that mid-course corrections can be made; (3) introduce consistency and transparency across project types and reporters; and (4) enhance the credibility of the projects with stakeholders. In this paper, we review the issues involved in MERV activities. We identify several topics that future protocols and guidelines need to address, such as: (1) establishing a credible baseline; (2) accounting for impacts outside project boundaries through leakage; (3) net GHG reductions and other benefits; (4) precision of measurement; (5) MERV frequency and the persistence (sustainability) of savings, emissions reduction, and carbon sequestration; (6) reporting by multiple project participants; (7) verification of GHG reduction credits; (8) uncertainty and risk; (9) institutional capacity in conducting MERV; and (10) the cost of MERV.","Carbon offsets; Emission trading; Energy efficiency; Evaluation; Forestry; Global climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions; Joint implementation; Monitoring; Reporting; Verification","climate change; emission control; emission trading; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; project assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032845055

Since most experience is available for packaging, the paper first gives an overview of the legislative background and the material flows for this sector. Then recycling and recovery processes for plastics waste from all sectors are assessed in terms of their contribution to energy saving and CO2 abatement. Practically all the options studied show a better performance than waste treatment in an average incinerator which has been chosen as the reference case. High ecological benefits can be achieved by mechanical recycling if virgin polymers are substituted. The paper then presents different scenarios for managing plastic waste in Germany in 1995: Considerable savings can be made by strongly enhancing the efficiency of waste incinerators. Under these conditions the distribution of plastics waste among mechanical recycling, feedstock recycling and energy recovery has a comparatively small impact on the overall results. The maximum savings amount to 74 PJ of energy, i.e. 9% of the chemical sector's energy demand in 1995 and 7.0 Mt CO2, representing 13% of the sector's emissions. The assessment does not support a general recommendation of energy recovery due to the large difference between the German average and the best available municipal waste-to-energy facilities and also due to new technological developments in the field of mechanical recycling.",,"Carbon dioxide; Feedstocks; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Packaging materials; Plastics; Recycling; Refuse incineration; Waste treatment; Waste management; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033355395

The recent development of high-energy pulsed CO2 lasers that minimize thermal injury to uninvolved adjacent structures has revolutionized the manner in which atrophic facial scars are recontoured. Significant improvement of atrophic scars with laser resurfacing has clearly been demonstrated; however, the exact timing for assessment of skin for further treatment has varied due to the unknown amount of time needed after laser scar resurfacing to effect maximal collagen formation and remodeling. OBJECTIVE. The aim of this study was to determine the immediate and long-term (12-18 months) histologic and clinical effects of atrophic acne scars after CO2 laser resurfacing in order to provide physician guidelines for postoperative clinical assessment for retreatment. METHODS. Sixty patients (50 women, 10 men, mean age 38 years, skin types I-V) with moderate to severe atrophic facial scars were evaluated. Nineteen patients received regional cheek treatment and 41 patients received full-face resurfacing with a high- energy pulsed CO2 laser. Independent clinical assessments of treated scars were performed at 1, 6, 12, and 18 months and blinded histologic analyses were made of skin biopsies immediately prior to and after laser resurfacing, and at 1, 6, 12, and 18 months postoperatively in six patients. RESULTS. Significant immediate and prolonged clinical improvement in skin tone, texture, and appearance of CO2 laser-irradiated scars was seen in all patients. Average clinical improvement scores were 2.22 (69%) at 1 month, 2.1 (67%) at 6 months, 2.37 (73%) at 12 months, and 2.5 (75%) at 18 months. Continued collagenesis and subsequent dermal remodeling were observed on histologic examination of biopsied tissue up to 18 months after surgery. CONCLUSION. Continued clinical improvement was observed as long as 18 months after CO2 laser resurfacing of atrophic scars, with an 11% increase in improvement observed between 6 and 18 months postoperatively. We propose that a longer postoperative interval (12-18 months) prior to assessment for re- treatment be advocated in order to permit optimal tissue recovery and an opportunity for collagen remodeling.",,"carbon dioxide; collagen; adult; article; atrophic skin disease; carbon dioxide laser; collagen synthesis; female; human; major clinical study; male; postoperative complication; priority journal; scar formation; skin biopsy; tissue regeneration; Acne Vulgaris; Adult; Atrophy; Cicatrix; Facial Dermatoses; Female; Humans; Laser Surgery; Male; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033381504

Robust methods were used to isolate the clear-sky shortwave observations so that they could be directly compared to values derived using a single-column version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate Model radiation code. The model-derived values agreed with the observations to within 0.5% mean relative error. Additional analysis showed that the model-data clear-sky surface shortwave differences showed no systematic relationship with respect to column water vapor amount. These results indicate that clear-sky absorption of shortwave radiation appears to be well modeled by current theory. Model-derived clear-sky surface shortwave values were combined with the observed (all-sky) values to determine the surface shortwave cloud forcing. The mean of these series were combined with 5-year mean Earth Radiation Budget Experiment derived top of the atmosphere (TOA) cloud forcing values to estimate the surface to TOA cloud forcing ratio. The resulting values range between 1.25 and 1.59. These values, along with the agreement between modeled and observed clear-sky surface shortwave, support the suggestion that our current theoretical radiative transfer models do not properly account for the amount of shortwave energy absorbed by the cloudy atmosphere. Mean values from the 2-year shortwave flux time series were compared to mean values from two climatologies derived from bulk parameterizations that utilize ship-based cloud reports. These comparisons show that the Oberhuber climatology underestimates the surface shortwave flux by ∼20% (∼40 W m-2), while the Esbensen and Kushnir climatology underestimates the flux by ∼4% (∼8 W m-2). The observed mean values were also compared to five satellite-derived climatologies. These comparisons showed much better and more consistent agreement, with relative bias errors ranging from about -1 to 6%. Comparisons to contemporaneous, daily-average satellite derived values show relatively good agreement as well, with relative biases of the order of 2% (∼3-9 W m-2) and root-mean-square differences of ∼10% (25-30 W m-2). Aspects of the role aerosols play in the above results are discussed along with the implications of the above results on the integrity of open-ocean buoy measurements of surface shortwave flux and the possibility of using the techniques developed in this study to remotely monitor the operating condition of buoy-based shortwave radiometers.

These uncertainties have not yet been considered rigorously due to expectations of C4 low responsiveness based on photosynthetic theory and early experiments. We carried out a literature review (1980-97) and meta-analysis in order to identify emerging patterns of C4 grass responses to elevated CO2 as compared with those of C3 grasses. The focus was on nondomesticated Poaceae alone, to the exclusion of C4 dicotyledonous and C4 crop species. This provides a clear test, controlled for genotypic variability at family level, of differences between the CO2-responsiveness of these functional types. Eleven responses were considered, ranging from physiological behaviour at the leaf level to carbon allocation patterns at the whole plant level. Results were also assessed in the context of environmental stress conditions (light, temperature, water and nutrient stress), and experimental growing conditions (pot size, experimental duration and fumigation method). Both C4 and C3 species increased total biomass significantly in elevated CO2, by 33% and 44%, respectively. Differing tendencies between types in shoot structural response were revealed: C3 species showed a greater increase in tillering, whereas C4 species showed a greater increase in leaf area in elevated CO2. At the leaf level, significant stomatal closure and increased leaf water use efficiency were confirmed in both types, and higher carbon assimilation rates were found in both C3 and C4 species (33% and 25%, respectively). Environmental stress did not alter the C4 CO2-response, except for the loss of a significant positive CO2-response for above-ground biomass and leaf area under water stress. In C3 species, stimulation of carbon assimilation rate was reduced by stress (overall), and nutrient stress tended to reduce the mean biomass response to elevated CO2. Leaf carbohydrate status increased and leaf nitrogen concentration decreased significantly in elevated CO2 only in C3 species. We conclude that the relative responses of the C4 and C3 photosynthetic types to elevated CO2 concur only to some extent with expectations based on photosynthetic theory. The significant positive responses of C4 grass species at both the leaf and the whole plant level demand a re-evaluation of the assumption of low responsiveness in C4 plants at both levels, and not only with regard to water relations. The combined shoot structural and water use efficiency responses of these functional types will have consequential implications for the water balance of important catchments and range-lands throughout the world, especially in semiarid subtropical and temperate regions. It may be premature to predict that C4 grass species will lose their competitive advantage over C3 grass species in elevated CO2.","C3 grasses; C4 grasses; Climate change; Elevated CO2; Gas exchange and growth responses; Meta-analysis","C3 plant; C4 plant; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; gas exchange; growth response; meta-analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032700233

We investigated CH4 sink strength of cultivated Canadian prairie and forest soils using undisturbed soil columns and an incubation technique in the laboratory. The sink strength was estimated by determining the rate of CH4 uptake by soils with variations in volume of air-filled soil voids, temperature and CH4 concentration. CH4 uptake was attributed to biologically mediated oxidation reactions since there was no significant CH4 uptake by autoclaved soils. At field capacity moisture content and 24°C, CH4 uptake under ambient atmosphere (2.4 μl CH4 l-1 air) followed first-order kinetics, though this was not the case at a lower temperature (4°C). The rate constant (h-1) of first-order reaction of CH4 uptake at 24°C was 0.1987 (Orthic Black Chemozemic), 0.0803 (Gray Luvisol, high C), 0.0210 (Gray Luvisol, low C), and 0.0091 (Saline Black Chemozemic). Relative to the reaction at 24°C, the percent reduction in amounts of CH4 uptake at 4°C ranged from 49% (Orthic Black Chernozemic) to 80% (Saline Black Chemozemic). Increasing the volume of air-filled soil voids increased the rate of CH4 uptake in the Orthic Black Chernozemic and the Gray Luvisol (high C) whereas it had little effect on the two other soils. The rate of the reaction was reduced by 30% (Saline Black Chernozemic) to 75% (Gray Luvisol, high C) when the reaction was initiated with higher CH4 concentrations (12 and 30 μl l-1). Under these experiment conditions, a two-step process of CH4 uptake also was observed, in which the first step was characterized by a fast CH4 diffusion. These results contribute to the knowledge of relative importance of Canadian prairie and forest soils as a CH4 sink and to the significance of local environmental factors in affecting the CH4 sink strength.","Diffusion; Kinetics; Methane; Oxidation; Soils","forest soil; methane; prairie; soil gas; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032943762

Both lungs were unidirectionally ventilated and the degree of lung inflation was determined by controlling the outflow resistance of these catheters, while ventilatory motor output was assessed on the basis of nervous activity in the mandibular branch of the Vth cranial nerve. The pattern of the recorded activity ('fictive ventilation') resembled the ventilatory patterns previously described for conscious toads. Increasing the fraction of CO2 in the gas mixture used for unidirectional ventilation from 0.00 to 0.05 stimulated fictive breathing. fictive ventilation was also greatly stimulated, at all CO2 levels, by reduced lung volume, while complete inflation of the lungs abated fictive ventilation at all levels of CO2.

Variations of up to 70% in the 2-10 keV band flux are detected during a 1 day ASCA observation performed in 1997 January, while no significant change in the 2-10 keV continuum shape is found. The ASCA spectrum consists of an absorbed power law, a ""soft excess"" below 2 keV, and an Fe Kα emission line at 6.4 keV. The ""soft excess"" can be well described either by thermal emission from very low-abundance material at a temperature kT ≃ 0.8 keV or by scattered/leaking flux from the primary power law plus a small amount of thermal emission. The luminosity of the thermal emission in the former case is 1.2 × 1040 ergs s-1 over the 0.5-2 keV band, while the excess is ∼ 1% of the intrinsic hard X-ray continuum in the latter case. Analysis of ROSAT HRI data confirms that the soft X-ray emission is extended on kpc scales in this object, and the extended component may account for most of the soft X-ray excess observed by the ASCA. The result suggests that in type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the ""soft excess"" comes at least partly from an extended region, causing a serious problem for the model in which the source is partially covered. We argue that the generally low abundances are a drawback for the single temperature thermal model and favor a scattering-dominated model. The scatterer is likely to be relatively cold (kT ≪ 1 keV) in this object. The Fe Kα profile is complex and cannot be satisfactorily modeled by a single Gaussian. Models of either double Gaussians, or a narrow Gaussian plus a line from a relativistic accretion disk viewed at an inclination of about 40° ± 10° provide good fits to the data. However, the inclination of the disk can be substantially larger if there is a small amount of excessive Fe K edge absorption. The intermediate inclinations for narrow-line X-ray galaxies are consistent with a model in which the inner accretion disk is aligned with an outer obscuring torus.","Galaxies: individual (NGC 5506); Galaxies: Seyfert; X-rays: galaxies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033439764

Almost all of the previous and current research and development for reducing emissions has focused, however, onflow, heat transfer, and combustion behavior in the combustors or on the uniformity of fuel injection without placing strong emphasis on the flow uniformity entering the combustors. In response to the incomplete understanding of the combustor’s inlet air flow field, experiments were conducted in a 48 percent scale, 360 deg model of the diffuser-combustor section of an industrial gas turbine. In addition, the effect of air extraction for cooling or gasification on the flow distributions at the combustors' inlets was also investigated. The following three different air extraction rates were studied: 0 percent (baseline), 5 percent (airfoil cooling), and 20 percent (for coal gasification). The flow uniformity was investigated for the following two aspects: (a) global uniformity, which compared the mass flow rates of combustors at different locations relative to the extraction port, and (b) local uniformity, which examined the circumferential flow distribution into each combustor. The results indicate that even for the baseline case with no air extraction there was an inherent local flow nonuniformity of 10 ˜ 20 percent at the inlet of each combustor due to the complex flow field in the dump diffuser and the blockage effect of the cross-flame tube. More flow was seen in the portion further away from the gas turbine center axis. The effect of 5 percent air extraction was small. Twenty percent air extraction introduced approximately 35 percent global flow asymmetry diametrically across the dump diffuser. The effect of air extraction on the combustor’s local flow uniformity varied with the distances between the extraction port and each individual combustor. Longer top hats were installed with the initial intention of increasing flow mixing prior to entering the combustor. However, the results indicated that longer top hats do not improve the flow uniformity; sometimes, adverse effects can be seen. Although a specific geometry was selected for this study, the results provide sufficient generality to benefit other industrial gas turbines. © 1999 by ASME.",,"Cooling systems; Diffusers (fluid); Flow of fluids; Gas turbines; Gasification; Air extraction; Flow uniformity; Combustors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843134224

The target PAHs in the diesel, residue, and soot samples collected during each burn were quantitatively characterized by GC/MS. A simple model based on mass balance of individual petroleum PAHs pre- and postburn was proposed to estimate the destruction efficiencies of the total petroleum PAHs. This study demonstrates the following: (1) Distributions of PAHs in the original diesel and soot were very different. (2) The average destruction efficiencies for the total target diesel PAHs including five alkylated PAH series and other EPA priority unsubstituted PAHs were greater than 99%. (3) Using the model, 27.3 kg of the diesel PAHs were destroyed for each 1000 kg of diesel burned. These were mostly two- and three-ring PAHs and their alkylated homologues. (4) Combustion also generated trace amounts of high molecular weight five-and six-ring PAHs as well as the four-ring benz[a]anthracene. But the total mass of these pyrogenie PAHs was found to be extremely low: only 0.016, 0.032, and 0.048 kg of the five- and six-ring PAHs were generated by combustion in the three different scenarios for each 1000 kg of diesel burned. From these points, we conclude that in situ burning is an effective measure to minimize the impact of an oil spill on the environment, greatly reducing exposure of ecosystems to the PAHs of spilled oils. A new 'pyrogenic index', Σ(other three- to six-ring PAHs)/Σ(five alkylated PAHs), is proposed (see the text for the definition) as a quantitative indicator for identification of pyrogenic PAHs and for differentiating pyrogenic and petrogenic PAHs. Also, this index is demonstrated to be a useful tool for distinguishing heavy fuels from crude oils and light refined products. This method, combined with other criteria, is expected to be applicable to such situations as oil spill investigations, site assessment, and apportioning of legal responsibility for pollution cleanup.Several mesoscale burn studies were conducted in Mobile Bay, AL in 1994, to study the various aspects of in situ diesel fuel burning.

CCD observations were made with λ 550 nm and λ 830 nm filters, with band-passes excluding major cometary gaseous emissions. Images were reduced according to standard procedure, aligned, averaged, navigated and enhanced with azimuthal renormalisation, rotational and temporal derivative and unsharp masking techniques. The rotation period of the nucleus was determined to 11.h46 and the mean projected dust outflow velocity to 0.41 km s-1 measured over a radius range of 5 000 - 45 000 km. No difference in quasi-simultaneous dust morphology between the filter wavelengths was seen. Up to five shell envelopes were visible in the sun-ward side of the coma out to a radius of 80 000 km, separated by a projected distance of ∼15 000 - 20 000 km and spiralling towards smaller radii in the direction of local evening. Outer boundaries of shells were more sharply defined than inner, with shell intensity maxima occurring at ∼35° past the sun-comet line in the direction of rotation. Small scale inhomogeneities of size 1 000 - 2 000 km were seen at radii ≤ 20 000 km. Two superposed shell systems with a relative lag angle of ∼55° were evident during the period of observation. The sense of rotation of dust emission features indicates that the north pole of the nucleus was directed towards the Earth. The shape of the incomplete spiral shell pattern indicates that the angle between the line-of-sight and the rotation axis of the nucleus was not very large.","Comets: individual: c/1995 01 Hale-Bopp; Techniques: image processing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4244098035

METHODOLOGY: Six patients suffering from rectal cancer with cardiac and/or respiratory disorders underwent laparoscope-assisted rectal amputation. The procedure was performed in three steps: 1) sacral approach, 2) laparoscope-assisted abdominal approach under CO2 insufflation, and 3) extracorporeal resection of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and stoma making without CO2 insufflation. RESULTS: Intra-operative cardiopulmonary functions were maintained within normal range during CO2 insufflation. Although all patients had severe respiratory or cardiac disorder or diabetes mellitus, no complications were observed during and after surgery. The post-operative course was uneventful for our patients, each of whom could eat on the first post-operative day and walk on the third post-operative day. All patients were discharged from the hospital uneventfully. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscope-assisted rectal amputation is technically feasible, adequate tumor excision can be achieved with it and post-operative recovery is improved. Sacrolaparoscopic rectal amputation appears to be a safe alternative procedure for patients with rectal cancer and even with severe cardiopulmonary disorders.","Laparoscopic surgery; Rectal amputation","carbon dioxide; aeration; article; cancer surgery; clinical article; clinical trial; diabetes mellitus; female; heart disease; human; inferior mesenteric artery; laparoscopy; male; minimally invasive surgery; priority journal; rectum cancer; rectum resection; respiratory tract disease; skin incision; stoma; Aged; Colostomy; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Laparoscopes; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Staging; Postoperative Complications; Rectal Neoplasms; Rectum; Sacrococcygeal Region; Surgical Instruments; Surgical Procedures, Minimally Invasive",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032929693

Craig and J.H. Hull. Observation suggests that the Earth's surface environment is maintained by processes in which non-living and living causes are linked inextricably. Once established on Earth, life rapidly became a dominant influence on the evolution of the planetary environment. But life was also shaped by that evolution, constrained and directed by the physical and chemical processes that moulded the planet's surface. Life and the planetary environment form a closely coupled entity, a view of the Earth as a complex system which is prefigured in the writings of James Hutton. Hutton compared the workings of the Earth's surface to the body of an animal, being both wasted and repaired continually. In modern times, James Lovelock has argued that it is a property of this system that it acts to maintain the planet in a habitable conditon. Alternatively, perhaps it is pure chance that the planet has always remained hospitable for life - it could just as easily have followed an infinity of different evolutionary paths, many and perhaps most of which would lead rapidly to global extinction. Consideration of the fates of our near- neighbour planets, Mars and Venus, and the dangerous nature of the inner solar system, leads to the conclusion that there is indeed a substantial element of luck involved in the Earth's biosphere having survived as long as it has. The fact that our own existence is dependent on it having survived makes it nearly impossible to accurately assess a priori the probability of survival. Abstract models such as 'Daisyworld' can capture some of the complex behaviour of the Earth-life system. This may include periods of stasis and sudden changes to new states, the stasis being an example of regulatory behaviour where the system is dominated by negative feedback, and the sudden changes being essentially the opposite - brief but traumatic periods where the dominant feedbacks are positive. GEOCARB, a biogeochemical model for the Phanerozoic which links changes in the long-term carbon cycle to planetary temperature, shows examples of both regulatory and destabilizing behaviour in a less abstract system, and suggests that such responses have indeed characterized Earth history. I conclude that the properties of the Earth-life system are complex and not easily predictable. The longevity of Hutton's animal (nearly 4 Ga) is no guide to its future life expectancy, and even if the system as a whole lasts many aeons into the future, any given species (such as humans) is most unlikely to.",,"history of geology; planetary evolution; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032761945

Box 88, M60 1QD Manchester, United Kingdom","Microkinetic analysis of heterogeneous catalytic reactions originated in the early 1970s from a program (KINPAK) that was written to predict the performance of an industrial naphta cracker. This program accepted as input a statement of elementary gas phase cracking and radical-induced hydrogen abstraction reactions, together with their Arrhenius parameters. The reactor conditions of temperature, pressure, flow rate, reactor dimensions, composition of feed, heats of formation of reactants and products, heat capacities, heat transfer coefficients, etc. were also included in the input. Mass balance equations were constructed for every component in the reaction, and the resulting matrix of non-linear equations was solved by a highly modified form of Newton-Raphson iteration [1]. Modification of this program to make it applicable to gas-solid heterogeneous catalysis was effected simply by adding a component that did not flow through the reactor - a catalyst. This paper is a review of the application of this methodology in its application to the industrially important reactions, ammonia synthesis and the water gas shift reaction. It was first applied to the synthesis of ammonia, for which the overall potential diagram constructed from single-crystal data was well established [3]. The surprising result obtained from it was that it predicted rates of ammonia synthesis that were five orders of magnitude too low [2]. Incorporating an energy barrier to nitrogen adsorption, for which experimental evidence from catalytic data existed [13], into the potential energy surface resulted in an exact fit between prediction and experiment [2]. (Changing the original values of the pre-exponential terms from those derived from transition state theory to those obtained experimentally in single-crystal experiments improved the quality of the single-crystal data derived potential to 10% of experiment, thus highlighting the importance of the factors in the calculations [16].) Validation of the requirement for an activated adsorption has been found in the recent experimental determination by temperature programmed adsorption of the energy barrier to nitrogen adsorption on a real catalyst [20]. The program has also been applied to the water gas shift reaction over a Cu/ZnO/Al2O3 catalyst [21-23]. Here, its application demonstrated clearly the non-uniqueness of the mechanism. A previous kinetic analysis using rate expressions had claimed that it 'proved' that the reaction proceeded through a formate intermediate [24]. This application of KINPAK incorporated a redox mechanism, in which water oxidised the copper, producing hydrogen, while CO reduced the copper, producing CO2. An exact fit between prediction and experiment could be obtained. This application also highlighted the interplay between the separate elementary energetics; different combinations of the activation energies of adsorption of hydrogen and of carbon dioxide to produce an adsorbed carbonate species resulted in the same overall activation energy, but totally different adsorbate compositions and totally different overall activities. The methodology imposes a strict rigour on the mechanisms that are proposed and on the limits within which elementary activation energies can be changed, since the overall potential energy surface is fixed by the heats of formation of the reactants and products. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

XYP1 contains three introns, has 5' and 3' untranslated regions of 74 and 145 bp, respectively, and is predicted to encode a protein of 328 amino acids (M(r) 36,700) with four N-glycosylation sites. Although it is secreted, Xyp1 has no predicted signal peptide. Furthermore, Xyp1 appears not to be processed at the N-terminus because one of the peptides isolated from the mature protein is located only six amino acids downstream of the translational start methionine.

We conducted a mesocosm study to test the effects of three different detrital carbon sources (algae, aquatic macrophytes, terrestrial leaves) on several measures of microbial metabolism in a small meso-eutrophic lake (DOC = 5 mg/L). Small DOC additions (ΔC < 1 mg/I.) affected bacterial numbers, growth, and pathways of carbon acquisition. Macrophyte and leaf detritus significantly increased TDP and color, but bacterial densities initially (+12 h) were unaffected. After 168 h, densities in systems amended with terrestrial detritus were 60% less than in controls, while production rates in mesocosms with macrophyte detritus were 4-fold greater. Detritus treatments resulted in greater per-cell production rates either through stable cell numbers and greater growth rates (macrophyte-C) or lower densities with stable production rates (terrestrial-C). After only 12 h, rates of leucine aminopeptidase (LAPase) activity were 2.5x greater in macrophyte-C systems than in controls, but LAPase and β-N-acetylglucosamindase activities in systems amended with terrestrial-C were only 50% of rates in controls. After 168 h, β-xylosidase rates were significantly greater in communities with terrestrial and phytoplankton detritus. Microbial utilization of >20% of 102 carbon sources tested were affected by at least one detritus addition. Macrophyte-C had positive (6% of substrates) and negative (14%) effects on substrate use; terrestrial detritus had mainly positive effects. An ordination based on carbon-use profiles (+12 h) revealed a cluster of macrophyte-amended communities with greater use of psicose, lactulose, and succinamic acid; controls and algal-detritus systems were more effective in metabolizing two common sugars and cellobiose. After 168 h, communities receiving terrestrial detritus were most tightly clustered, exhibiting greater use of raffinose, pyroglutamic acid, and sebacic acid. Results suggest that pelagic bacterial communities respond to changes in organic carbon source rapidly and by different routes, including shifts in per-cell production rates and variations in degradation of a variety of compounds comprising the DOC pool.",,"bacterial metabolism; cytosol aminopeptidase; enzyme activity; pyroglutamic acid; raffinose; sebacic acid; bacterioplankton; carbon; mesotrophic environment; metabolism; nutrient enrichment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032945286

The mole ratio of carbon (in PS) to Mn was 40/1. The gas-phase and liquid-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were extracted with dichloromethane (DCM) and subsequently prepared for further analysis with an HPLC equipped with a wavelength-scanning ultraviolet (UV) detector and a fluorescence (FL) detector. Virtually no char or coke residue was observed in the reactor at the end of the pyrolysis reaction. The addition of MnSO4 into the high-temperature pyrolysis of PS reduced PAH formation in all liquid and gas products. The transition metal-chelating oxidation mechanism previously used to explain soot reduction during combustion was not adequate for explaining the results of PAH reduction via MnSO4 addition into the inert pyrolysis. Furthermore, it is suggested that soot reduction via manganese salt addition into oxygen-rich combustion might not result only from the well-accepted chelating oxidation mechanism; rather, it might result from the reduction of hydrocarbon species in the locally fuel-rich environment via manganese salt addition, as inferred from the reduction of PAH formation during inert pyrolysis with/without MnSO4 addition observed in this study.

Four geochemically similar, but tectonically separate, gas escape centers are distinguishable, out of which 3 show a free gas flux &gt;85000 dm3 h-1. All gases from the centers are CO2-rich (&gt;99 vol.%) and have δ13C values ranging from -1.8 to -4.0‰. 3He/4He ratios are as high as R/R(a) = 5, and are among the highest measured in Europe. The discharge of the gas mixture decreases with distance from the emanation centers with both decreasing fractions of CO2 and δ13C values, whereas the fractions of N2 and trace gases increase. These changes in chemical and isotopic composition are associated by a decrease in R/R(a) ratios from about 5 in the centers to &lt;2 in the peripheries. The changes of the contents and isotopic composition of CO2 can be explained by physico-chemical fractionations of CO2 between gaseous and aqueous phases. Towards the periphery, the contents of free CO2 and its δ13C are reduced by dissolution of CO2 in groundwater, whereby the content of N2 increases. 3He/4He ratios give evidence for mixing of He from both a deep-seated magmatic and a crustal source. The gas emanation centers, with their strongly magmatic δ13C value of about -2.7‰, seem to outline the intersections of the Eger rift and the Marianske Lazne fault, which are considered to represent a deep-reaching fracture system that enables the ascent of gases from a magmatic body in the European subcontinental mantle (SCM). Therefore, the European SCM is suspected to be the main source of CO2. The most mantle-like He (and probably N2) occurs in the centers of gas release. The total regional gas flux in the western Eger rift is determined to be 3.6 X 108 mol a-1. When related to the investigated area of 1500 km2, flux densities greater than 0.24 X 106, 52, and 0.65 mol km-2 a-1 for CO2, N2 and He respectively are calculated.",,"carbon dioxide; hydrothermal system; mantle chemistry; rift zone; volatile element; Czech Republic; Eger Rift",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342980935

However, whilst DMSP undoubtedly does contribute substantially to the overall osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm, several studies have demonstrated that its intracellular concentration is not directly regulated by the osmotic pressure of the growth medium. Thus, DMSP does not behave as a compatible solute sensu stricto and therefore its role may not be strictly osmotic. Recently, HAMILTON & LENTON (1998) proposed that DMS emissions associated with blooms of DMSP accumulating marine phytoplankton may be linked to an aerial mode of dispersal via the induction of cloud formation and local convective winds. Only micro-algae were discussed. All macro-algae, however, also have unicellular stages as gametes or spores which could become windborne. In this paper, we review the literature on the life histories, growth cycles and ecology of marine DMSP synthesising chlorophycean macro-algae, in order to assess whether a similar dispersal mechanism may exist within this group. Whilst only direct experimental evidence can resolve if these macro-algae are dispersed or not by an aerial mechanism, many features of their growth, reproductive and life cycles are consistent with such a mechanism. Such an aerial dispersal mechanism might represent an especial ecological advantage in this group, allowing colonisation of areas separated by land masses or denied to normal waterborne dispersal routes by directional currents. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Climate regulation; Cloud albedo; Cumulus cloud formation; Dispersal mechanisms; DMS; DMSP; Macro-algae","algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chlorophyceae; Eukaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033198641

After briefly explaining the formation and treatment of sewage sludge, current and future sludge production are discussed. Thereafter, the four sludge disposal methods which are currently used, i.e. recycling in agriculture, landfilling, dumping into sea and incineration, are examined, and the future trend presented showing the increasing role of sludge incineration. Thereafter, technologies for thermal processing of sewage sludge are presented. They are discussed in three groups, i.e. mono-combustion, co-combustion and alternative processes. Various mono-combustion incinerators, including multiple hearth, fluidized bed and smelting furnaces are briefly discussed, whereas for co-combustion, attention has been given to co-combustion with coals in pulverized and fluidized bed coal combustors, as well as co-incineration with municipal solid wastes in various furnaces. Where possible, data from large scale plants are presented. Currently being discussed in the sludge disposal cycles are the alternative thermal processes to sludge combustion. These include wet oxidation, pyrolysis, oil from sludge processes, and combinations of pyrolysis, combustion and gasification processes. Some of these alternative technologies are also briefly discussed. An important aspect during thermal processing of sewage sludge is its combustion mechanisms. Compared to coals, sewage sludge has very high contents of moisture and volatile matter which can affect the combustion process. The importance of the drying and devolatilization processes for sewage sludge combustion is thus examined. In a special case, the release and combustion of the volatiles during sludge combustion in fluidized bed combustors is analysed, and some information concerning the combustion of sludge char is presented. Another important issue of sludge combustion is the emissions of pollutants gases as well as the handling of solid by-products. Of concern include the heavy metals, mercury, dioxins and furans, acid gases, as well as NOx and N2O. These are also briefly discussed. A peculiar characteristic of sewage sludge is its high content of nitrogen, and attention has been given to see how this affects the N2O and NOx emissions. In a special case, emission performance of large scale combustors of sewage sludge is presented. © 1998 Elsevier Science 1998.

Plant communities in this ecosystem are determined by soil moisture regimes induced by winter snowpack distribution. Spatial patterns of CH4 flux during the snow-free season corresponded roughly with these plant communities. In Carex-dominated meadows, which receive the most moisture from snowmelt, net CH4 production occurred. However, CH4 production in one Carex site (seasonal mean = +8.45 mg CH4 m-2 d-1) was significantly larger than in the other Carex sites (seasonal means = -0.06 and +0.05 mg CH4 m-2 d-1). This high CH4 flux may have resulted from shallower snowpack during the winter. In Acomastylis meadows, which have an intermediate moisture regime, CH4 oxidation dominated (seasonal mean = -0.43 mg CH4 m-2 d-1). In the windswept Kobresia meadow plant community, which receive the least amount of moisture from snowmelt, only CH4 oxidation was observed (seasonal mean = -0.77 mg CH4 m-2 d-1). Methane fluxes correlated with a different set of environmental factors within each plant community. In the Carex plant community, CH4 emission was limited by soil temperature. In the Acomastylis meadows, CH4 oxidation rates correlated positively with soil temperature and negatively with soil moisture. In the Kobresia community, CH4 oxidation was stimulated by precipitation. Thus, both snow-free season CH4 fluxes and the controls on those CH4 fluxes were related to the plant communities determined by winter snowpack.","Alpine tundra; Methane; Trace gas","alpine environment; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; methane; tundra; United States; Acomastylis; Carex; Kobresia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033046331

Where this occurs, reductions in sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions will be much less effective than expected at reducing PM2.5. As a measure of the efficacy of reductions in sulfate concentration on PM, we define marginal PM2.5 as the local change in PM2.5 resulting from a small change in sulfate concentration. Using seasonal-average conditions and assuming thermodynamic equilibrium, we find that the conditions for PM2.5 to respond nonlinearly to sulfate reductions are common in the eastern United States in winter, occurring at half of the sites considered, and uncommon in summer, due primarily to the influence of temperature. Accounting fordiurnal and intraseasonal variability, we find that seasonal-average conditions provide a reasonable indicator of the time-averaged PM2.5 response.

Extant and emerging individual photosynthetic culms (shoots) were labeled individually and their growth dynamics quantified in replicated plots. Lengths of living (chlorophyllous) portions and basal diameters of several thousand individual culms were determined at weekly intervals and converted to biomass by regression of surface areas to mass. Shoots emerged continuously at all times of the year; the number of ramets increased four times from summer to winter (12,000-&gt;30,000 culms m-2). Individual culms in November-December, however, were generally smaller (41-52%) than in summer. Maximum growth of individual new culms ranged from a maximum of 6.4 mg per day in June (40-50 days to maximum biomass) to 1.1 mg per day in November (70-110 days to reach maximum biomass in winter). Due to continuous recruitment and gradual culm senescence, numerous multiple cohorts occurred on an annual basis. Root production was also evaluated from changes in seasonal biomass and from experimental studies of changes in aboveground biomass in relation to those of rooting tissues. Annual root production was approximately 42% of shoot production. Average annual production estimates of combined above- and belowground components was 9832 g AFDM m-2 per year. The extremely high production rates of this Juncus species result from the continuous growth while simultaneously shoot densities changed as the inverse of biomass seasonally. These processes maximized photosynthetic carbon fixation under mild climatic conditions of the winter and spring seasons. This dynamic growth strategy is likely to be common among herbaceous perennial emergent aquatic plants in mild climatic regions.","Continuous growth; Maximum production; Mortality; Plant production; Root senescence; Shoot biomass; Shoot density; Shoot senescence; Wetland","aquatic plant; biomass; growth rate; population dynamics; primary production; article; biomass; carbon dioxide fixation; controlled study; growth rate; nonhuman; photosynthesis; plant; plant growth; plant root; population dynamics; seasonal variation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033002595

A National Drought Policy was agreed to by Commonwealth (Federal), State, and Territory Ministers in 1992, reaffirmed in 1994, and revised in 1997. It aims to encourage primary producers and other sections of rural Australia to adopt self-reliant approaches to managing for climatic variability, to maintain and protect Australia's agricultural and environmental resource base during periods of extreme climate stress, and to ensure early recovery of agricultural and rural industries, consistent with long-term sustainable levels. These aims can be met by providing research, extension, and education services to assist producers to plan for and cope with a variable climate and by ensuring that there are no financial incentives for inappropriate management practices. The extent to which these aims are being met is still a matter of debate. Given that a sequence of El Niño-based events that started in Queensland in 1991 culminated in much of Australia experiencing abnormally low rainfall throughout 1994 and into 1995, the commonwealth government needed measures to determine which areas had been exposed to exceptional drought so that financial assistance could be directed as effectively as possible. For an area to be declared as experiencing “drought exceptional circumstances,” (DEC) the extent and severity of drought had to be assessed as being beyond the bounds of normal risk management. In this paper we discuss our recent experiences in estimating the extent and severity of drought in the arid, temperate, and subtropical regions of Australia, and progress in developing methods and regionally sensitive indicators to aid assessments of “drought exceptional circumstances. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Agricultural planning; Australia; Climate variability; Drought assessment and policy; El Niño; Remote sensing; Risk management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002433946

Commercial charbroiling in the South Coast Air Basin results in emissions of approximately 10 tons/day of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and 1.3 tons/day of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Over a seven-year period, the South Coast Air Quality Management District worked with industry to develop test methods for measuring emissions from various cooking operations, evaluate control technologies, and develop a rule to reduce these emissions. Of the two basic types of charbroilers—chain-driven and underfired—underfired produce four times the emissions when equivalent amounts of product are cooked. Cost-effective control technology is currently available only for chain-driven charbroilers. The application of flameless catalytic oxidizers to chain-driven charbroilers was found to effectively reduce emissions by at least 83% and is cost-effective. The catalysts have been used worldwide at restaurants for several years. Research efforts are underway to identify control options for underfired charbroilers. Implementation of Rule 1138, Control of Emissions from Restaurant Operations, adopted November 14, 1997, will result in reductions of 0.5 tons/day of PM2.5 and 0.2 tons/day of VOCs. Future rules will result in reductions from underfired charbroilers and possibly other restaurant equipment when cost-effective solutions are available. © 1999 Air and Waste Management Association.",,"volatile organic compound; air quality; air quality control; article; catering service; cost effectiveness analysis; environmental impact assessment; particulate matter; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032875661

While the preservation of the bone matrix protein, collagen I, is the prerequisite for a variety of archaeometric approaches, such as radiocarbon dating and the reconstruction of palaeodiet by stable isotope analysis, little is known about both the rate and state of preservation of non-collagenous proteins. We succeeded in the isolation, electrophoretic separation (SDS-PAGE, IEF) and immunological detection (radial immunodiffusion, IEF immunoblotting and ELISA) of plasma proteins preserved in archaeological human bones. However, sample preparation and electrophoretic methods had to be adapted to the specific demands of these aged proteins, since they are not only degraded and fragmented but also cross-linked to other organic components, either indigenous to the bone or to contaminants from the burial environment. Complex decomposition phenomena are responsible for the altered mode of migration of aged proteins through a gel. After isoelectric focusing, the ancient proteins mainly concentrate below pH 4.45 in the pH-gradient. Thus, highly negatively charged protein components have a better chance of preservation in bone after death. Isoelectric focusing with subsequent immunoblotting of ancient protein samples revealed protein patterns which showed marked charge-modifications in comparison with those of modern human plasma proteins due to protein degradation (e.g. α2-HS-glycoprotein and α1-antitrypsin). Nevertheless, in combination with different immunological analyses, previous results concerning the selective enrichment of α2-HS-glycoprotein in bone compared with other plasma glycoproteins could be confirmed.

A portion of the initiative, the sequestration of greenhouse gases, is the focus of this presentation. Over 4 million acres of bottomland hardwood forests were cleared for agriculture in the Mississippi River Valley in the 1970s. Reestablishing these forests would improve depleted wildlife habitats, serve as wildlife corridors, increase biodiversity, and decrease soil erosion. Also, Louisiana is losing coastal wetlands at a rate of approximately 25 square miles/year. This coastal erosion is due to a number of factors and many efforts are currently underway to address the matter. One such effort is the use of material generated in the dredging of navigational canals; however, this material is low in nutrient value, making the regeneration of marsh grasses more difficult. In addition, bottomland hardwood forests and coastal wetland grasses are excellent 'carbon sinks' because they take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and store it in living plant tissue. Entergy Services, Inc. is an electric utility with a service territory that comprises portions of both the Lower Mississippi River Valley and the Gulf of Mexico coastline. This provides an opportunity to positively address both habitat losses noted above while at the same time addressing global warming, forest fragmentation, and biodiversity. Entergy, through its affiliation with the UtiliTree Carbon Company, is participating in projects that will investigate the feasibility of using bottomland hardwood reforestation on cleared marginal farmlands now managed by the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries and the US Fish and Wildlife Service. Entergy has also begun a research project with the Environmental Protection Agency and the State of Louisiana. The research is a compost demonstration project that will utilize wood waste generated through our tree-trimming program as a compost material that will be mixed with low nutrient dredge material to create new coastal wetlands. Taken together, Entergy's initiatives will be able to address global warming through carbon sequestration, restore fragmented forest habitats, reduce coastal erosion and improve the quality of a vital coastal aquatic nursery habitat. Efforts will be made to manage the created habitats for biodiversity. Pulling all these ideas together creates an effect in which the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. In such a synergy of ideas, there are no losers and the winners are both industry participants and the environment.",,"carbon dioxide; biodegradation; global warming; greenhouse gas; wetland; agriculture; article; biodiversity; carbon dioxide measurement; environmental protection; erosion; forest; grass; greenhouse effect; priority journal; seashore; soil; wildlife; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032875227

But it is the potential for MTBE to enter drinking water supplies that has become an area of public concern. MTBE has been shown to induce liver and kidney tumors in rodents but the biochemical process leading to carcinogenesis is unknown. MTBE was previously shown to be non-mutagenic in the standard Ames plate incorporation test with tester strains that detect frame shift (TA98) and point mutations (TA100) and in a suspension assay using TA104, a strain that detects oxidative damage, suggesting a non-genotoxic mechanism accounts for its carcinogenic potential. These strains are deficient in excision repair due to deletion of the uvrB gene. We hypothesized that the carcinogenic activity of MTBE may be dependent upon a functional excision repair system that attempts to remove alkyl adducts and/or oxidative base damage caused by direct interaction of MTBE with DNA or by its metabolites, formaldehyde and tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), established carcinogens that are mutagenic in some Ames strains. To test our hypothesis, the genotoxicity of MTBE-induced DNA alterations was assayed using the standard Ames test with TA102, a strain similar to TA104 in the damage it detects but uvrB+ and, therefore, excision repair proficient. The assay was performed (1) with and without Aroclor-induced rat S-9, (2) with and without the addition of formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FDH), and (3) with human S-9 homogenate. MTBE was weakly mutagenic when tested directly and moderately mutagenic with S-9 activation producing between 80 and 200 TA102 revertants/mg of compound. Mutagenicity was inhibited 25%-30% by FDH. TA102 revertants were also induced by TBA and by MTBE when human S-9 was substituted for rat S-9. We conclude that MTBE and its metabolites induce a mutagenic pathway involving oxidation of DNA bases and an intact repair system. These data are significant in view of the controversy surrounding public safety and the environmental release of MTBE and similar fuel additives.

Oligotrophic lakes have low nutrient loading and low productivity, while eutrophic lakes have high nutrients and high productivity. The strong empirical relationship between nutrient loading and productivity is a valuable tool for teaching, for research, and for management of lakes. In order to incorporate the variety of other known anthropogenic impacts on lakes, however, lake characterization needs to extend beyond the nutrient-productivity paradigm. For example, acid precipitation, heavy metal and toxic organic contaminants, increases in UV radiation, and global warming are all recognized threats to lake ecosystems. One of the key characteristics of lakes that determines how they respond to disturbances such as these is their concentration of colored dissolved organic carbon (CDOC). Here we argue that a paradigm that includes CDOC (using the absorption coefficient at 320 nm as a proxy) as well as nutrients will be useful in predicting and understanding the response of lake ecosystems to multiple stressors. We propose to resurrect the CDOC axis that was proposed by investigators earlier this century and to extend it by adding some operational definitions to permit placing some of the major lake types on the axes in a way that will help us to better understand the structure, function, and response to disturbance of lake ecosystems that are subject to natural and anthropogenic environmental changes at the local, regional, and global scales. Data from a few diverse lakes and a successional sequence in Glacier Bay, Alaska, are used to illustrate the potential utility of the 2-axis model in separating lake types.",,"dissolved organic carbon; lake ecosystem; nutrient; productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032961167

The availability of favourable conditions for carbonate sedimentation around Borneo was related to a combination of factors, including tectonic setting, the formation of large basinal areas, differential subsidence providing shallow marine areas, a tropical climate and a range of local factors, such as currents or limited elastic input. A detailed sedimentological and diagenetic study was undertaken of middle Eocene to Plio-Pliestocene carbonates which developed in the north Kutai Basin and the Mangkalihat Peninsula, northeast Kalimantan. Carbonate sedimentation in this area occurred in a range of depositional environments, from mixed carbonate elastic shelves, localised and transient shoals or reefs, a variety of platform top settings to deep water redeposited carbonates. An understanding of carbonate depositional environments, spatial facies relationships, and diagenesis is essential in order to develop models for these carbonates which can be used as predictive tools in the subsurface.

Harris Lake has remained fresh throughout the Holocene, with only very slight changes in salinity. A shift from a benthic to a predominantly planktonic diatom flora between 6500 and 5200 BP may be an indirect response to a warmer climate that reduced forest cover and allowed greater rates of inorganic sedimentation. The early Holocene salinity reconstruction from Clearwater Lake indicates that the lake was quite saline (4-20 g·L-1) between 9600 and 8400 BP, similar to several other sites in the northern Great Plains, and then became relatively fresh by ca. 7900 BP. The recent Clearwater record indicates little change in salinity over the past 400 years.

This paper reviews current knowledge of how changes in temperature and precipitation could affect tree species, forest ecosystems, and the forest products sector of the economy. The various types of models used to predict change and the results they calculate are examined. Models currently project both increases and decreases in the range of various species and ecosystems, and similar results for changes in the productivity, biomass and growth of forests in response to changes in climate. Results vary with the models used, the species or ecosystem studied, and the specific condition of the forest in question. The science of forests and global change is reviewed with regard to plant responses to enhanced CO2 environments and forests' response to other bioclimatic and indirect factors, such as insect predation, fire, climatic variation and ozone. Three studies of the economic effects of climate change on forests, which project a range of losses and benefits to the economy, are compared. Economic results vary directly with the results of the forest growth and productivity models which were employed as inputs. No one model can provide a complete answer, and current knowledge and models are limited in various ways which point to areas where further research could provide benefits. © Inter-Research 1998.","Bioclimatic; Economic; Ecotype; Impacts; Modeling; Physiological; Responses; Tree species","climate change; economic impact; forestry production; man-environment relations; United States; Insecta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033579660

Damage to ground water includes acidification, aluminum leaching, elevated concentrations of nitrate, and eutrophication. Monetary risk-based decision analysis (on a national scale) is applied to compare alternative actions designed to protect ground water from further degradation. This decision analysis uses simulations of nitrate and aluminum concentrations over a 15 year period with two reduction scenarios for sulfur dioxide, nitrate oxides, and ammonia, and results in estimates of economic uncertainty. For each alternative, an objective function is estimated including the implementation costs, the economic risk associated with failure according to the selected decision criteria, and the economic benefits related to the implementation. The decision criteria are based on the European Community drinking water quality standards for nitrate and aluminum. The study aims at incorporating the hydrogeologic uncertainty resulting from the propagation of errors from data input to model output. A range of economic values has been applied to the ground water resource to study the sensitivity of the decision analysis to valuing ground water. The results indicate that higher reduction rates of the studied pollutants reduce the economic uncertainty but also lead to larger total costs. The study also indicates that the economic uncertainty may be equal to the total cost provided by the objective function. The contamination level of nitrate is much more responsive to the reduction scenarios than the aluminum concentration. For high, but not unrealistic, ground water valuing, the economic uncertainty makes the decision between the studied alternatives unclear.",,"Ammonia; Decision theory; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Sulfur dioxide; Water quality; Weathering; Atmospheric emission; Ground water degradation; Risk based decision analysis; Groundwater pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033357861

Apart from market penetration rates, cost benefit indicators are also computed to support the decision making process in the local energy and environmental policy. These indicators comprise import dependency, employment effects, capital expenditure, carbon dioxide emissions and government revenues. The systems approach adopted, the simultaneous consideration of not only market penetration rates but also of the associated economic indicators, gives a more complete picture of AES use.

Some of these studies have suggested that this area may be involved in 'selection for action', such as for selecting to respond to a target stimulus. Here, positron emission tomography (PET) and event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to study the effects of target probability during a demanding visual spatial attention task, in which the target percentage was either low (2%, 1 per ~26 sec) or high (16%, 1 per ~3.5 sec). As expected, ERPs to detected targets evoked large, bilaterally distributed P300 waves. The PET showed strong activation of the ACC, particularly dorsally, during all the attend conditions relative to passive. However, these PET activations did not significantly differ between the few-target and many-target conditions, showing only a small trend to be larger in the many-target case. Such results indicate that the bulk of the ACC activation does not reflect selection for action per se, while also suggesting that the ACC is not a likely source of the P300 effect. The current data, however, do not argue against the ACC serving a role in maintaining a vigilant or anticipatory state in which one may need to select for action, or in continually or repeatedly (i.e., for each stimulus) needing to resolve whether to select to act or to not act.","Attention; Event-related potentials; P300; PET; Positron emission tomography, ERP","adult; cingulate gyrus; cognition; conference paper; electrophysiology; event related potential; hemodynamics; human; image processing; male; positron emission tomography; priority journal; Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Female; Gyrus Cinguli; Hemodynamic Processes; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Psychomotor Performance; Tomography, Emission-Computed",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032862231

The X-ray data were obtained using the Proportional Counter Array detector of the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer satellite on 1997 October 17. The optical data were obtained using the 1.5 m telescope of the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory on 1997 September 24. At the time of our observations, BL Hyi was in an unusual high-luminosity state with average visual magnitude mv ≈ 14.4 and orbital phase-averaged 2-10 keV X-ray flux ≈1.5 × 10-11 ergs cm-2 s-1, roughly 50% larger than had been seen previously. The X-ray light curves suggested that two accretion poles were active. The primary X-ray emission region was extended, covering ∼45° in longitude on the white dwarf, while the secondary X-ray emission region was consistent with a point source with flux ∼33% that of the primary region. The X-ray spectra were well fitted by absorbed bremsstrahlung with Gaussian emission-line models; and absorbed power law with Gaussian emission-line models. For the thermal models, the X-ray spectra were consistent with kTx ≈ 11 keV and an emission line at E ≈ 6.7 6.8 keV with equivalent width EW = 0.86-1.2 keV. The absorbed power-law models had slope α ≈ 2.1 and an emission line at E = 6.7-6.8 keV with EW = 1.1-1.5 keV. The optical data showed, 2.7% ± 0.2% rms quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) over the frequency range 0.2-0.8 Hz modulated strongly on the orbital period suggesting that the QPOs were connected with the dominant accretion hot spot. We did not find corresponding QPOs in the X-ray emission for an upper limit of 20% rms. There were no detections of other short-period QPOs or coherent features in either the optical or the X-ray data. The X-ray and optical data were consistent with a radiative shock model. Based primarily on the X-ray continuum and line spectrum, we infer that the mass of the white dwarf in the BL Hyi system is 0.3-0.7 M⊙, depending on the relative cyclotron and hard X-ray luminosities.","Novae, cataclysmic variables; Radiation mechanisms: nonthermal; Stars: individual (BL Hydri); White dwarfs; X-rays: stars",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033589661

The information is contained in the chemical composition, especially the isotopic ratios, of the calcitic shells (e.g., δ11B, δ13C, δ18O). Based on the assumption that our understanding of the major parameters controlling stable isotope incorporation is complete, these geochemical proxies have been used to reconstruct glacial ice volumes, sea surface and deep water temperatures, ocean circulation changes and shifts between carbon reservoirs. However, recent laboratory experiments have demonstrated that the δ13C and δ18O are not only strongly dependent on the carbonate chemistry of the culture medium but that the so-called 'vital-effects' are probably mediated via perturbations of the local carbonate system. These findings have an important impact on the interpretation of isotope data. For instance, the carbonate system of the glacial ocean was quite different from that of the Holocene and since the onset of the industrial revolution the carbonate chemistry of the surface water must have changed drastically. As a first step towards a better understanding of the isotopic fractionation processes we present results of a diffusion-reaction model of the carbonate system (CO2, HCO3/-, CO3/2-, H+, OH-, B(OH)3, B(OH)4/-) in the microenvironment (the diffusive boundary layer) of living planktic foraminifera. The carbon fluxes associated with the main life processes (calcification, respiration and symbiont photosynthesis) lead to substantial perturbations in pH and significant shifts in the concentrations of CO2, CO3/2- and other components in the vicinity of the foraminifer. Consequently, the carbonate chemistry of the ambient environment is quite different from that of the bulk sea water. Comparison with pH-microelectrode measurements confirm our numerical results. Our results further demonstrate that the symbionts must use bicarbonate as an additional carbon source for photosynthesis as the calculated CO2 fluxes are not sufficient to support measured rates of oxygen evolution. The simulations also show that for the fast calcification of Globigerinoides sacculifer the supply of carbonate ions is insufficient and therefore use of bicarbonate or an internal pool for carbon is required, whereas no such pool is necessary for the much slower calcification in Orbulina universa.","Foraminifera; Globigerinoides sacculifer; Orbulina universa; Sea water carbonate system","carbonate; foraminifera; proxy climate record; Globigerinoides sacculifer; Orbulina universa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032954173

This increases the amount of starch available for microbial fermentation to acetate, propionate, and butyrate in the colon. Relatively large amounts of butyrate are produced from starch by colonic microbes. Colonic epithelial cells use butyrate as an energy source, and butyrate causes the differentiation of colon cancer cells. In this study we investigated whether colonic fermentation pathways changed during treatment with acarbose. We examined fermentations by fecal suspensions obtained from subjects who participated in an acarbose-placebo crossover trial. After incubation with [1-13C] glucose and 12CO2 or with unlabeled glucose and 13CO2, the distribution of 13C in product C atoms was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Regardless of the treatment, acetate, propionate, and butyrate were produced from pyruvate formed by the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway. Considerable amounts of acetate were also formed by the reduction of CO2. Butyrate formation from glucose increased and propionate formation decreased with acarbose treatment. Concomitantly, the amounts of CO2 reduced to acetate were 30% of the total acetate in untreated subjects and 17% of the total acetate in the treated subjects.

Daily concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), ozone (O3), and particulate matter &lt; 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) were obtained from seven air monitoring stations in Hong Kong in 1994 and 1995. Relative risks (RR) of respiratory and cardiovascular disease admissions (for an increase of 10 μg/m3 in concentration of air pollutant) were calculated. Results - Significant associations were found between hospital admissions for all respiratory diseases, all cardiovascular diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, and heart failure and the concentration is of all four pollutants. Admissions for asthma, pneumonia, and influenza were significantly associated with NO2, O3, and PM10. Relative risk (RR) for admissions for respiratory disease for the four pollutants ranged from 1.013 (for SO2) to 1.022 (for O3), and for admissions for cardiovascular disease, from 1.006 (for PM10) to 1.016 (for SO2). Those aged ≥ 65 years were at higher risk. Significant positive interactions were detected between NO2, O3, and PM10, and between O3 and winter months.

To provide data on this subject CO2-flux measurements in different plant communities were made in the high-Arctic coastal tundra of Spitsbergen, using a mobile macrocuvette system based on infrared gas analysis. The study area was situated on the exposed west coast, where westerly winds produce precipitation daily in the form of rain, drizzle and fog. During the cold and cloudy measurement period in 1996, light and surface temperatures were limiting for primary producers, resulting in low size and low physiological activity of the plants. Net CO2-flux measurements showed carbon fluxes from soil to atmosphere in most of the communities even during the brightest hours of the day, when mean photon flux density was 325 mmol m2+-2 s-1. Calculations based on spatial distribution of the plant communities and soils in the watershed combined with C-flux measurements revealed information on daily carbon loss. For instance, the Drepanocladus community, covering 21% of the catchment area, was responsible for 42.6 % of the catchment carbon loss. Only two of nine investigated plant communities, the Racomitrium and a Salix-Saxifraga community on debris, both adapted to frequent fog situations, were able to compensate for respiratory CO2-losses under the prevailing low light conditions during daytime. Since there were no significant sunny periods in this area in the summer of 1996, the habitats of the investigated coastal tundra finished the season with a marked carbon loss due to increased cloudiness.","Carbon balance; Catchment study; Climate change; Cloudiness; Spitsbergen","carbon dioxide enrichment; community response; plant community; Drepanocladus; Salix; Saxifraga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344564132

Alteration is pervasive throughout the shear zones and characterized by carbonatization and sericitization of intermediate volcanic, volcaniclastic, and sub-volcanic rocks. The orebodies are mainly shear veins hosted by, or directly associated with, highly deformed carbonaceous volcaniclastic rocks, breccia and stockwork systems or disseminations in felsic and mafic sub-volcanic bodies. Native gold appears as free grains finely disseminated in the quartz veins or closely related to arsenopyrite, pyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, and Fe-chlorite in the carbonaceous wallrocks. Fluid inclusion studies by microthermometry and laser Raman microspectroscopy revealed that the vein quartz is largely dominated by primary, pseudosecondary and rarely secondary, populations of CO2-(±CH4±N2) inclusions (type I), whereas primary groups of low salinity (&lt;6 wt.% eq. NaCl) H2O-CO2-(±CH4±N2) inclusions (type II) comprise the dominant inclusion type in only a few veins. The ThCO2 (L-V→L) data indicated a variation in the CO2 density of 1.05 to 0.60 g/cm3 for the type I inclusions and, conversely, a narrower range of 0.76-0.73 g/cm3 for the type II inclusions. The broader variation of the CO2 density for the CO2-rich fluid could have been the result of trapping of the vein fluid under a variable pressure regime, or by its re-equilibration during continuous deformation within the shear zone domains and reduction of the overburden pressure during uplift. The CO2-rich fluid inclusions provide no evidence that they have been the result of H2O loss either during infiltration (e.g., hydration reactions) or after trapping of an original H2O-CO2 fluid. Accordingly, the CO2±(CH4 + N2) and the H2O-CO2-(±CH4±N2) fluids are considered as representatives of two distinct fluid regimes, which were active during the gold mineralizing events within the shear zones. Both types of ore fluids are interpreted as part of a deep metamorphic-magmatic hydrothermal system in which (i) a CO2-rich fluid, probably originated in the mantle, was transported to, and released in, higher structural levels mainly by tonalitic-granodioritic and alkaline magmas, whereas (ii) a H2O-CO2 fluid, generated by devolatilization reactions during the regional metamorphism, was either directly channeled into favorable structural sites (i.e., metamorphic fluid), or absorbed and later exsolved by the crystallization of felsic magmas (i.e., magmatic fluid sensu lato). In this context, gold deposition occurred between 320°C and 420°C and 2.1 to 4.4 kb and calculated values of fO2 between 10-26.5 and 10-32.4 bar reveal the relatively reducing nature of the mineralizing fluids. The ore paragenesis constrains fS2 to the range of 10-10.1-10-6.5 bar for these fluids. Under such conditions, the gold was transported mainly as bisulfide complexes by the H2O-CO2 fluid, but in the case of the CO2-rich fluid, the role of thiocomplexes or some other types of ligands is obscured by the lack of high temperature experimental data. Deposition of the metal occurred in response to redox changes, which accompanied fluid-carbon interaction, particularly a decrease in fO2 and fS2 of the fluid. On a microscopic scale, phisisorption and chemisorption processes at the fluid-iron sulfide interface may have further enhanced the deposition of the gold, particularly on the surfaces of precipitating pyrite and arsenopyrite.","Fluid inclusions; Gold; Greenstone belt; Microthermometry; Raman microspectroscopy","fluid inclusion; gold; mineralization; Raman spectroscopy; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032857694

The disasters occur mainly from May to August, thus, the frequent periods of their bursts are simultaneous with the maximum period of precipitation in every year. (2) Middle zone (snowmelt water icing zone): most disasters, which happen in the middle-high mountain area, have close relation with variation of temperature (3) Upper zone (snow drift avalanche zone): the movement of snow mantle creates disaster in this zone. The slope direction and height of mountain greatly influence the frequency of hazards and the formation of vertical zone spectrum of natural disasters. Due to the regional diversities of temperature and precipitation, the vertical zone spectrum of natural disasters in mountains are different in different latitude and longitude zones.","Natural disaster; Tianshan Mountains; Vertical zone spectrum","disaster management; mountain region; natural disaster; vertical profile; zoning system; China; Tianshan Mountains; Xinjiang Province",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032840573

This paper has prepared an inventory of GHG emissions from energy consumption activities in the iron and steel industry in East China. (The region comprises two provinces, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and one municipality, Shanghai.) The emission were measured in 1990 following the conventions set in IPCC Guidelines (1995). Energy consumption by the iron and steel industry and GHG emissions (including CO2, CH4, and N2O) inventory data are further analyzed and evaluated. As can be seen from the statistics in this paper, solid fuel is the main type of fuel consumed by the iron and steel industry in East China; this type of fuel accounts for 86.8%, while liquid fuels and gas fuels account for only 12.6% and 0.6% of the total energy consumption, respectively. Accordingly, GHG emissions from the combustion of solid fuels are highest, while those from gas fuels are minimal. The energy consumption and GHG emissions by the iron and steel industry accounts for a large percentage, about 7.86%, of the total GHG emissions in this district. This paper also discusses available mitigation appropriate to the energy consumption and GHG emissions by the iron and steel industry in East China.

The results show that the biogenic-gas consists mainly of methane which is more than 99% in gasous hydrocarbons and of lighter carbon isotopic composition with δ13C, values from -60.0‰ to - 75.4‰. The methane carbon isotopic compositions in the Baoshan Basin is relatively heavy (δ13C1, - 60‰- - 65‰), but those in Luliang and Yanglin basins are lighter (δ13C1, less than -70‰), which implies that the gas field of the Baoshan Basin formed earlier than the others. In the Jinggu Basin, where crude oil is premature-lower mature, the natural gas of associated oil relatively wet and the relative content of methane about 58%-95% in gasous hydrocarbons. Constituently the gas composition is much similar to associated one, but the methane carbon isotopic compositions from - 53.8‰ to - 57.8‰ are obviously richer in 12C than those of general oil fields and similarly characterize the biothermocatalytic transitional zone gas. Their ethane carbon isotopic compositions from - 34.6‰ to - 29.0‰ show that they may be derived from type I or II source rock. But for the associated gas from lower evolutionary stage, the heavier ethane carbon isotopic composition as well as the reversed order among the carbon isotopic composition of ethane, propylane and butane also implies that some gases from the type III organic matter are mixed. The δ13CCO2 of the samples essentially less than - 10‰ may be generated from organic matter.","Carbon isotope; Low-evolution; Natural gas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5644300768

By this means we investigated a pathway linking deutocerebral projection neurons, via hemiellipsoid body local interneurons, to an unidentified target (most likely neurons processing visual information) in the medulla terminalis. Rapid (10- to 20-ms duration), transient changes in absorption with the characteristics of action potentials were recorded from the optic nerve and the region occupied by deutocerebral projection neurons after stimulation of the olfactory globular tract in the optic nerve and were blocked by 1 μM tetrodotoxin. Action potentials appeared to propagate to the glomerular layer of the hemiellipsoid body where synaptic responses were recorded from a restricted region of the hemiellipsoid body occupied by dendrites of hemiellipsoid body neurons. Action potentials were also recorded from processes of hemiellipsoid body neurons located in the medulla terminalis. Synaptic responses in the hemiellipsoid body and medulla terminalis were eliminated by addition to the saline of 500 μM Cd2+ or 20 mM Co2+, whereas the action potential attributed to branches of deutocerebral projection neurons in the hemiellipsoid body remained unaffected. Action potentials of hemiellipsoid body neurons in the medulla terminalis evoked postsynaptic potentials (50- to 200-ms duration) with an unidentified target in the medulla terminalis. Transient absorption signals were not detected in either the internal or external medulla nor were they recorded from other parts of the optic lobes in response to electrical stimulation of axons of the deutocerebral projection neurons. Functional maps of optical activity, together with electrophysiological and pharmacological findings, suggest that γ-aminobutyric acid affects synaptic transmission in glomeruli of the hemiellipsoid body. Synapses of the olfactory pathway located in the medulla terminalis may act as a 'filter,' modifying visual information processing during olfactory stimulation.",,"article; crayfish; nerve potential; nerve projection; nonhuman; olfactory system; optic lobe; priority journal; synaptic transmission; visual information",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033028320

The activity decreased drastically when NO/hydrocarbon concentration ratio in the feed exceeded a certain value, in contrast to the cases of AljO3and Co/Al2Or Supported silver on alumina was characterized as Ag under oxdizing condition. High temperature calcination was effective to enhance the activity in spite of the decrease in surface area, indicating the formation of specific surface state of supported silver and alumina. Amount of Br0nsted acid sites increased by addition of silver as probed by NH, adsorption. IR spectra of adsorbed species were measured under simulated feed gas and peaks assigned to nitrate ion were found to be much stronger on Ag/Al2O3.

The influences of test conditions on carbon reduction of oxides in the briquettes were also examined. The briquettes endured heating at 1186°C under load and could be charged to the melt in small quantity without causing serious splashing. For a high metal recovery, it was necessary to charge the briquettes together with slag-former. Small local zones of smelt-reduction with high carbon concentration could thus be formed during heating.

The behaviors of surface ozone in the Tibetan Plateau are much different than that in eastern China. Physical factors rather than photochemical factors may play important roles in determining surface ozone. Several model experiments are conducted to focus on these questions. Some results can be obtained as follows: (1) In polluted areas, the surface ozone is primarily dependent on its precursors (NOx, NMHC, etc.) and has highly nonlinear sensitivities to their perturbation. However, in clean areas photochemistry is not the controlling factor. Surface ozone on the Tibetan Plateau is sensitive to ozone perturbation in upper layers, suggesting that ozone above the planetary boundary layer may be a greater influence upon surface ozone. (2) The variations in OH and HO2 caused by perturbations in the precursors are very complicated, and the feedback effect of ozone is very important. There is a nearly linear relationship between percentage differences in HO2 and O3 for NMHC emission reduction, and a similar linear relationship also appears between percentage differences in OH and O3 for NOx emission reduction. (3) During summer midday time, the ratio of O3 to NO2/NO has a constant value.

When the potential sweep is confined to the region negative of 0.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl, oxygen reduction is highly inhibited with cathodic current being observed at approximately -0.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl, as compared with the standard potential for the two-electron reduction of oxygen (O2+2H++2e- = H2O2, E° = 0.47 V vs. Ag/AgCl at pH 0). The extreme inhibition of oxygen reduction may be due to an absence of catalytic sites. When the potential is swept to potentials positive of +1.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl, the subsequent sweep into the negative region shows a reduction peak due to oxygen reduction. In this case, catalytic oxygen-containing functional groups can be formed on sp2 carbon impurities. Relatively mild conditions are required to deactivate the catalytic functional groups, but strong oxidative treatment in base appears to substantially remove the sp2 carbon impurities. The oxygen reduction behavior in acid solution could be useful in characterizing diamond electrodes, i.e., as a diagnostic for the presence of sp2-type carbon on chemical-vapor-deposited diamond thin-film electrodes. It is proposed that diamond electrode surfaces free of sp2 carbon are highly insensitive to oxygen, which could be a useful feature in electroanalysis.",,"Boron; Crystal impurities; Diamond films; Polycrystalline materials; Reduction; Semiconductor doping; Thin films; Highly conductive boron-doped diamond electrodes; Linear sweep voltammetry; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033097208

A simplified version of the simulation model was further validated against methane emission measurements from various regions of the world, including Italy, China, Indonesia, Philippines and the United States. Model validation suggested that the seasonal variation of methane emission was mainly regulated by rice growth and development and that methane emission could be predicted from rice net productivity, cultivar character, soil texture and temperature, and organic matter amendments. Model simulations in general agreed with the observations. The comparison between computed and measured methane emission resulted in correlation coefficients r2 values from 0.450 to 0.952, significant at 0.01-0.001 probability level. On the basis of available information on rice cultivated area, growth duration, grain yield, soil texture and temperature, methane emission from rice paddy soils of mainland China was estimated for 28 rice cultivated provinces/municipal cities by employing the validated model. The calculated daily methane emission rates, on a provincial scale, ranged from 0.12 to 0.71 g m-2 with an average of 0.26 g m-2. A total amount of 7.92 Tg CÜ4 per year, ranging from 5.89 to 11.17 Tg year-1, was estimated to be released from Chinese rice paddy soils. Of the total, 45% was emitted from the single-rice growing season, and 19% and 36% were from the early-rice and the late-rice growing seasons, respectively. Approximately 70% of the total was emitted in the region located at latitude between 25° and 32° N.

Methane, CO2, Fe(II), NO3/-, SO4/2-, pH, E(h), H2 and acetate were monitored during anaerobic incubation at 30 °C for 120 days. Based on the accumulation patterns of CO2 and CH4, the reduction process was divided into three distinct phases: (1) an initial reduction phase during which most of the inorganic electron acceptors were depleted and CO2 production was at its maximum, (2) a methanogenic phase during which CH4 production was initiated and reached its highest rate, and (3) a steady state phase with constant production rates of CH4 and CO2. The reduction phases lasted for 19 to 75 days with maximum CO2 production of 2.3 to 10.9 μmol d-1 g-1 dry soil. Methane production started after 2 to 87 days and became constant after about 38-68 days (one soil &gt; 120 days). The maximum CH4 production rates ranged between 0.01 and 3.08 μmol d-1 g-1. During steady state the constant CH4 and CO2 production rates varied from 0.07 to 0.30 μmol d-1 g-1 and 0.02 and 0.28 μmol d-1 g-1, respectively. Within the 120 d of anaerobic incubation only 6-17% of the total soil organic carbon was released into the gas phase. The gaseous carbon released consisted of 61-100% CO2, &lt;0.1-35% CH4, and &lt;5% nonmethane hydrocarbons. Associated with the reduction of available Fe(III) most of the CO2 was produced during the reduction phase. The electron transfer was balanced between total CO2 produced and both CH4 formed and Fe(III), sulfate and nitrate reduced. Maximum CH4 production rate (r = 0.891) and total CH4 produced (r = 0.775) correlated best with the ratio of soil nitrogen to electron acceptors. Total nitrogen content was a better indicator for 'available' organic substrates than the total organic carbon content. The redox potential was not a good predictor of potential CH4 production. These observations indicate that the availability of degradable organic substrates mainly controls the CH4 production in the absence of inorganic electron acceptors.","Acetate; Carbon dioxide; Hydrogen; Iron; Methanogenesis; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Redox balance; Rice paddy soil; Sulfate","methanogenesis; paddy field; reduction; soil property",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032821626

Dissection is analogous to retroperitoneal procedures. There are limited indications for the technically demanding operation, which leads to increased operation time and expenditure. At present, we are gathering experience from selected patients after full explanation of the procedure. Control trials will be carried after the detail technical aspects are defined and custom-made instruments are refined. Results: In 28 months, my team operated on 9 patients with 3 conversions to open surgery due to difficulties in dissection. There were no surgical complications like nerve damage or hemorrhage. All patients underwent a standard hemithyroidectomy with intact specimen retrieved.

Since each activation energy involves the binding energy of the complex (16 kcal/mol on the average), the actual barrier height should be lower by this quantity if measured from the dissociation limit. The inversion of methane can therefore occur at the transition-metal active center of catalysts or enzymes under ambient conditions through a thermally accessible transition state, and it would reasonably lead to inversion of stereochemistry at a carbon atom in catalytic reactions of hydrocarbons. We propose that a radical mechanism based on a planar carbon species may not be the sole source of the observed loss of stereochemistry in transition-metal-catalyzed hydrocarbon hydroxylations and other related reactions.",,"hydrocarbon; metal complex; methane; article; chemical analysis; chemical bond; chemical reaction kinetics; chemical structure; hydroxylation; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; stereochemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033538281

Sciences, Lancaster University, Lancaster LA1 4YQ, United Kingdom","The impacts of acidifying atmospheric deposition to soil and water resources are commonly calculated utilising predictive mathematical models. The estimation of the predictive uncertainty inherent in these models is important since the model predictions are increasingly being used as a scientific basis for decisions on emission abatement policies and strategies in Europe. When predictive uncertainty is taken into account it may significantly affect conclusions ascertained from model predictions. The Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) approach is used here in the estimation of predictive uncertainty of PROFILE, a steady-state biogeochemical model. GLUE is based on Monte Carlo simulation and recognises the possible equifinality of parameter sets. With this methodology it is possible to make an assessment of the likelihood of a parameter set being an acceptable simulator of a system when model predictions are compared to measured field data. The GLUE methodology is applied to PROFILE simulations of five European research sites. The results have revealed that the model is unable to reproduce the characteristics of soil water chemistry consistently, and that the resulting predicted critical loads must be associated with significant uncertainty. The study also demonstrates that a wide range of parameter sets exist that give acceptable simulations of site characteristics as well as a broad range of critical load values that are consistent with the site data. A sensitivity analysis is performed for simulations of data sets from each site; this is employed to evaluate the role of the model parameters in forcing the predictions. Results of the sensitivity analyses show that, in general, site predicted soil chemistry is driven by atmospheric inputs and mineral weathering rates are determined by soil physical properties.

In 1995 we mapped the location of both earthworm surface casts and plants in each of 16 1.2-m2 plots in a species-rich calcareous grassland in northwestern Switzerland. Eight plots have been maintained under current ambient CO2 concentrations (350 μL CO2/L), and eight have been maintained at elevated CO2 (600 μL CO2/L) since March 1994. In addition, total ramet production of each species, as a measure of performance, and cumulative east production at each location (cell) were recorded at peak community biomass in 1995. Plant species within functional groups (graminoids, non-legume forbs, and legumes) differed markedly in their degree of association with casts; however, after two growing seasons elevated CO2 had no effect on plant species or functional group associations with casts. No statistically significant relationship could be demonstrated between plant-species response (i.e., ramet production) to elevated CO2 and the degree of association with casts within any of the functional groups. However, a positive relationship was observed between the mean response of graminoid species to elevated CO2 (measured as the percentage change in mean total tamer production of graminoid species, relative to mean total ramet production at ambient CO2) and their mean degree of association (%) with surface casts at ambient CO2. Thus, graminoid species more frequently associated with casts (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum and Carex caryophyllea) produced more ramets per square meter at elevated CO2 than those less frequently associated with casts (e.g., Agrostis tenuis and Danthonia decumbens). These results, along with the strong and significant positive correlations observed between ramet production and associated cumulative cast mass across CO2 treatments for most plant species in all functional groups demonstrate: (1) that plant species differ significantly in their degree of association with nutrient-rich earthworm surface casts, regardless of the relative abundance of plant species in the community; (2) that graminoid species that are more highly associated with casts may respond more strongly to rising CO2 than those less highly associated with casts; and (3) that nutrient-rich earthworm casts stimulate the growth (ramet production) of most plant species in these grassland communities, even at current levels of atmospheric CO2. The data further suggest that these species-specific relationships between plants and casts have helped define the current structure of these highly diverse grassland communities and will likely influence their future structure as global CO2 levels continue to rise.","CO2 enrichment; Earthworm activity; Earthworm surface casts; Elevated CO2, plant species responses; Fertile soil microsites, role of earthworm casts; Global warming, plant species responses; Lumbricidae; Plant-animal interactions; Plant-cast spatial distribution; Soil ecology; Spatial distribution of plants, earthworm effects","carbon dioxide enrichment; community dynamics; earthworm; grassland; Switzerland; Agrostis; Agrostis capillaris; Agrostis tenuis; Animalia; Anthoxanthum odoratum; Anthoxanthum odoratum; Carex caryophyllea; Carex caryophyllea; Danthonia decumbens; Danthonia decumbens; Lumbricidae; Pheretima sieboldi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032944536

The development of the transportation management component was coordinated through the Transportation Control Measures Development Task Force. Transportation management project proposals were analyzed with the regional travel model and off-network methods as part of the scenario testing for the plan. The results indicated that a regional strategy to establish a comprehensive and coordinated transportation management program can significantly increase transit ridership, reduce automobile use, increase ridesharing, lower regional vehicle miles of travel (VMT), and reduce emissions as compared with conditions without these management strategies. A range of transportation management strategies was identified for inclusion in the RTP. Selection of 11 specific strategies was based on their applicability by the year 2020 and their contributions to achieving RTP goals and objectives. Transportation demand management, transportation system management, and intelligent transportation system applications were analyzed to quantify their effectiveness and to finalize the package of strategies for inclusion in the RTP. Trip making, VMT, and emission reductions were calculated for each of the 11 strategies to compare the impact with the cost of implementation. An overview of the strategy objectives and the methods used to calculate the performance impacts of each strategy is provided. Costs associated with different levels of implementation were estimated and project requirements identified. The final package of 11 transportation management strategies, implementation efforts, funding requirements, and the expected benefits of these strategies are also discussed.

The emission factors, reported both on a fuel-mass basis (mg/kg) and on a defined cooking-task basis (mg/task), were determined using a carbon balance approach for 22 types of fuel/stove combinations. These include various stoves (e.g., traditional, improved, brick, and metal, with and without flue) using different species of crop residues and wood, kerosene, and several types of coals and gases. The results show that all the tested cookstoves produced formaldehyde and acetaldehyde and that the vast majority of the biomass stoves produced additional carbonyl compounds such as acetone, acrolein, propionaldehyde, crotonaldehyde, 2-butanone, isobutyraldehyde, butyraldehyde, isovaleraldehyde, valeraldehyde, hexaldehyde, benzaldehyde, o-tolualdehyde, m,p-tolualdehyde, and 2,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde. Carbonyls other than formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, however, were rarely generated by burning coal, coal gas, and natural gas. Kerosene and LPG stoves generated more carbonyl compounds than coal, coal gas, and natural gas stoves, but less than biomass stoves. Indoor levels of carbonyl compounds for typical village houses during cooking hours, estimated using a mass balance model and the measured emission factors, can be high enough to cause acute health effects documented for formaldehyde exposure, depending upon house parameters and individuals' susceptibility.",,"carbonyl derivative; formaldehyde; air analysis; air pollution; article; biomass; combustion; cooking; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; health hazard; human; Air pollution control; Aldehydes; Environmental impact; Gas stoves; Health hazards; Indoor air pollution; Ketones; Mathematical models; Carbonyl compounds; Mass balance model; Particulate emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033564982

The air mass containing increased concentrations of ozone commonly is found on a horizontal spatial scale of about 600 km over the eastern United States. The diurnal variation in ozone concentrations at different altitudes, ozone flux measurements, and vertical profiles of ozone suggest that ozone and its precursors trapped aloft in the nocturnal residual layer can influence the ground-level ozone concentrations on the following day as the surface-based inversion starts to break up. A simple one-dimensional model, treating both meteorological and chemical processes, has been applied to investigate the relative contributions of vertical mixing and photochemical reactions to the temporal evolution of the ground-level ozone concentration during the daytime. The results demonstrate that the vertical mixing process contributes significantly to the ozone buildup at ground level in the morning as the mixing layer starts to grow rapidly. When the top of the mixing layer reaches the ozone-rich layer aloft, high ozone concentrations are brought down into the mixing layer, rapidly increasing the ground-level ozone concentration because of fumigation. As the mixing layer grows further, it contributes to dilution while the chemical processes continue to contribute to ozone production. Model simulations also were performed for an urban site with different amounts of reduction in the ground-level emissions as well as a 50% reduction in the concentration levels of ozone and its precursors aloft. The results reveal that a greater reduction in the ground-level ozone concentration can be achieved by decreasing the concentrations of ozone and precursors aloft than can be achieved from a reduction of local emissions. Given the regional extent of the polluted dome aloft during a typical ozone episode in the northeastern United States, these results demonstrate the necessity and importance of implementing emission reduction strategies on the regional scale; such regionwide emission controls would reduce effectively the long-range transport of pollutants in the Northeast.",,"ozone; temporal evolution; vertical mixing; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033503945

This paper presents a new database of CO emission factors for commonly used cookstoves in developing countries. The emission factors were determined using a carbon balance approach for 56 types of fuel/stove combinations in China and India. These include various stoves (e.g., traditional, improved, mud, brick, and metal, with and without chimney) using animal dung, different species of crop residues and wood, root fuel, charcoal, kerosene, and several types of coals and gases. The chosen fuel/stove combinations represent a large fraction of the total in developing countries. Thus, the database can be used to improve estimates of CO emission inventories. The CO emission factors ranged widely, from 3.0 × 10-2 g/kg for the coal gas/traditional stove to 2.8 × 102 g/kg for the charcoal/Angethi stove, nearly 4 orders of magnitude. Since stove efficiencies and fuel energy contents were measured simultaneously, CO emission factors on the basis of a standard cooking task (energy delivered) were also determined and reported in this paper. Task-based emission factors are particularly useful for comparing the air pollution potential of different fuel/stove combinations and assessing the impacts of substitutions. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

There are yet no data on the toxicity and health effects of MTBE in China. To evaluate the possible toxicity of domestic MTBE, 40 male, 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 180-200 g, were gavaged with different concentrations of MTBE. MTBE, dissolved in soybean oil, was administered at doses of 1000, 600 or 200 mg/kg b.w., and a control group with soybean oil, once daily, five days per week, for 90 days. There were no marked differences in body weight growth and food intake among the 4 groups.

This analysis is conducted for the years 1981 to 1984 and 1988 to 1991.
