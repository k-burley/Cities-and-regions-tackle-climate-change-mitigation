This has occurred due to the requirement for better fertiliser use efficiency which is essential in: i) developing nations where cost and availability constrain production (Swift 1997) and ii) many developed nations where public concern over environmental pollution from agricultural sources and associated government legislation restricts gaseous losses and nutrient leaching (e.g. N: Hatch et al. 2002, P: Leinweber et al. 2002). There has been a considerable decline in soil organic matter levels and associated loss of soil structure in many intensively cropped soils throughout the world. This has caused scientists and landowners to consider more carefully how various components of the farming system can be managed to more efficiently benefit from biological processes that improve soil fertility. Soil biological processes are extremely diverse and complex (Lavelle and Spain 2001). Physical and chemical soil characteristics, climate, plant communities and agricultural practices influence soil biology in a magnitude of ways, with both positive and negative influences on the overall fertility of soil. This level of complexity constrains our ability to assess or predict the biological state of soil through measures of abundance of organisms or their activity (Pankhurst et al. 1997). The current inability to predict the outcome of a change in agricultural management on soil biological processes, with a subsequent understanding of what this means in terms of production or the environment, is a major constraint to the successful design of farming systems that harness the biological potential of soil. Many studies have attempted to define the biological status of soil using simple indicator measurements (Doran and Parkin 1994, Gregorich et al. 1994, Franzluebbers et al. 1995, Pankhurst et al. 1995, Walker and Reuter 1996, Stenberg 1999). Whilst this is appealing to scientists, land holders and policy makers, it is extremely difficult to find correlations between potential indicators and crop production, long-term sustainability and environmental impact. Part of this difficulty has been with understanding how organisms and the functions that they perform interact with chemical and physical soil attributes in agricultural soils to regulate crop production and influence the longer-term status of the soil resource. Due to spatial and temporal heterogeneity and the enormous diversity displayed in soil biological characteristics, it is not easy to use them to define 'best practice' for land management. The focus of this book is thus to provide an overview of a range of biological processes that contribute to soil fertility and to discuss the manner in which management practices influence soil biological fertility. With the complexity of these biological processes in mind, the impact of major management options and farming systems on soil biological processes can be addressed. The consequence of this is the basis for sustainable use of the whole soil resource, which demands equal consideration of biological, physical and chemical contributions to soil fertility. Inclusion of information about soil biological fertility in farm management decision-making should allow more precision in selecting inputs that complement the capacity of a soil to sustain production and minimise environmental damage such as might be caused by nutrient loss. If the type of production at a site is changed, different biological, physical and chemical states might be required to sustain the soil resource there, depending on the production system in place. A set of biological characteristics necessary for sustaining the soil resource at a particular site cannot be prescribed because different farming systems, or even different stages in the same farming system, might require differences in soil biological fertility. Therefore, a suite of soil biological characteristics needs to be defined for each land use category according to the soil type and climatic conditions. © 2007 Springer.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889980451

As a result, the production of geothermal electricity will decrease foreign exchange expenditures, as well as provide energy security and decrease greenhouse gas emissions. The government has established a conducive environment for Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and investors. It sees its role as bringing project opportunities to the point where private sector companies and investors will become involved, carry them through to completion and ensure long term operation and sustainability. Results of previous work carried out by the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM) of Eritrea and the US Geological Survey (with the financial support of USAID) at the Alid Volcanic area strongly suggest the presence of a hot upper crustal magmatic or plutonic body beneath Alid Mountain. The MEM/USGS study determined that the overall temperature and permeability conditions of the area were favorable for the existence of an electrical grade geothermal resource. The Government of Eritrea wishes to pave the way for geothermal-based rural electrification through the installation of a pilot geothermal power plant at Alid and the identification of new prospects for additional geothermal plants in the future. The Government feels the best way to do this is to pursue a two pronged program that builds on the earlier work at Alid and includes: (A) siting and drilling between 1-3 geothermal exploration wells and carrying out the related resource analysis and modeling at Alid; and (B) implementing a geothermal reconnaissance survey to outline potential geothermal resources in the Nabro-Dubbi region in the eastern lowlands of Eritrea (along the Red Sea) where geothermal manifestations (fumaroles) have been identified. The regional survey should include appropriate geological, geochemical, and geophysical surveys.","Alid; Eritrea; Exploration opportunities; Geothermal; Investment opportunities; Nabro-Dubbi","Analytical geochemistry; Economics; Electric utilities; Gas emissions; Geological surveys; Geothermal fields; Geothermal heating; Geothermal power plants; Geothermal prospecting; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heat pump systems; Investments; Leakage (fluid); Minerals; Natural resources exploration; Offshore oil wells; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Pumps; Renewable energy resources; Rural areas; Wells; Alid; Eritrea; Exploration opportunities; Geothermal; Investment opportunities; Nabro-Dubbi; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58449091239

Microwave heating is recognized for various advantages such as: time and energy savings, very rapid heating rates, considerably reduced processing cycle time and temperature, fine microstructures and improved mechanical properties, better product performance, etc. Until recently the use of microwaves in materials processing was confined only to ceramics and composites, but in the last 10 years of work on the interaction of microwaves with matter, the Penn State group has revolutionized the science and the technology of microwave processing by applying it to metallic materials. The advances have been described in terms of sintering of powder metals, metal-ceramic composites, brazing/joining and melting of bulk metals, etc. Many commercial powder-metal components of various alloy compositions including iron and steel, copper, aluminum, nickel, Mo, Co, Ti, W, Sn, etc. and their alloys have also been sintered in microwaves using a 2.45 GHz multimode microwave system, producing better properties than their conventional counterparts.

This paper explores the energy performance, thermal performance and low energy design strategies in partially air-conditioned (AC) apartment buildings in Kuala Lumpur. Most apartment dwellers prefer to install AC split units in the master bedrooms and living rooms for cooling which results in huge increases in energy consumption. A study on thermal performance (using simulation software Tas) is conducted on a base case (typically built) apartment unit in a medium rise housing block. Simulations for the living rooms are conducted on the hottest day of the year and the total energy use values are presented in kWh. The effects of operation types (continuous and intermittent), varying the set point temperature (28.6 and 26°C), orientation, insulation, shading, materials and location (floor levels and zones) are analysed. The results show that air-conditioning would be needed only on very hot days. On average days, the use of air conditioning is proven unnecessary as passive cooling can be utilised. Recommended thermostat setting based on 90% acceptability is 23.6 - 28.6°C. Setting the thermostat higher will reduce energy use dramatically. In order to minimise the usage of air conditioners, passive climate control strategies (orientation, shading and insulation) should be adopted. Results show that improvements to the base case can reduce the total energy consumption by two thirds.","Apartment building; Performance analysis; Thermal comfort","Air conditioners; Apartment buildings; Control strategies; Energy performance; Energy use; Floor level; Living room; Low-energy design; Malaysia; Passive cooling; Performance analysis; Set-point temperatures; Simulation software; Thermal Performance; Total energy; Total energy consumption; Urban housing; Air conditioning; Computer software; Energy utilization; Mixed convection; Thermal comfort; Thermostats; Apartment houses",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864115153

Decentralised renewable energy systems such as solar photovoltaic (PV) electricity have the potential to provide a viable and sustainable alternative to overcome the physical and economic barriers facing the expansion of low and medium tension grids. This paper critically assesses the impact of small-scale PV systems installed in homes, schools and public buildings over the last six years under the PERMER project-Renewable Energy Project for the Rural Electricity Market-co-funded by a range of public and private sources. The structure of financial subsidies has enabled these remote rural communities to receive an electricity supply that, in many cases, would otherwise not have been possible. Replacing traditional energy sources such as candles and kerosene lamps, the PV electricity systems are providing better quality light, reducing indoor air pollution levels, as well as a means to power communications technologies and extend hours for cultural and productive activities. There are, however, certain technical, organisational and intellectual barriers that remain to be overcome before the project can be considered to be operating optimally. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Vehicle emissions are a significant source of both PM2.5 and PM10. Vehicle fleet emissions per mile traveled have been reduced significantly in the past 30 years as a result of improved engine operation and tailpipe controls. However, ""zero emission"" vehicles will continue to generate PM from tire wear, road wear, brake wear, and resuspended road dust. In this study, aerosol measurement techniques at Arizona State University were applied to evaluate tire wear emissions from the vehicle fleet by using the Deck Park Tunnel in Phoenix, Arizona. The Deck Park Tunnel highway surface was portland cement concrete (PCC) and was resurfaced with an asphalt rubber friction course (ARFC) layer as part of the Arizona Department of Transportation Quiet Pavements Program. This study took advantage of a rare opportunity to sample tire wear emissions at the tunnel before and after the ARFC overlay. The hypothesis was that an ARFC surface results in less tire wear than the existing PCC road surface. This paper reports on the measured PM emissions from the on-road vehicle traffic during typical highway driving conditions for the two different roadway surfaces. It presents the analysis of representative tire tread samples for tire wear marker compounds and a comparison of roughness and frictional surface characteristics as measured before and after the ARFC overlay. The study found that emission rates of tire wear per kilometer driven on PCC road surfaces were 1.4 to 2 times higher than emission rates of tire wear on ARFC road surfaces.",,"Asphalt rubber friction courses; Tire wear; Air quality; Asphalt; Environmental Protection Agency; Mathematical models; Particulate emissions; Tires; Rubber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40049094157

Two types of tests were performed at 1500 rpm, two loads (3.1 bar and 5.5 bar IMEP), two compression ratios (11:1 and 14:1) and with two fuels (gasoline and natural gas). The first test involved holding EGR level constant and increasing the H2 concentration. The EGR level of the engine was increased until the CoV of IMEP was &gt; 5% and then small amounts of hydrogen were added until the total was 1% by volume. The effect of increasing the amount of H2 on engine stability was measured along with combustion parameters and engine emissions. The results showed that only a very small amount of H2 was necessary to stabilize the engine. At amounts past that level, increasing the level of H2 had no or only a very small effect. The second test was to fix the H2 level at 1% by volume and measure the EGR limit increase of the engine. At low load conditions, the EGR limit increased from the previous high of 25% to over 50% for gasoline and from 20% to 28% for CNG. At high load conditions, the EGR limit was achieved when the engine reached wide-open throttle and the addition of extra EGR would have required reducing the engine load. The results of this test indicate that the addition of even small amounts of H2 can significantly improve the EGR tolerance of the engine when fueled with gasoline. This improvement in EGR tolerance can lead to reduced emissions and the potential to improve fuel economy by allowing high compression ratio operation. High IMEP was not tested with natural gas. Part load performance and EGR tolerance was explored to characterize the benefit hydrogen enriched EGR can provide to the emerging stoichiometric heavy duty natural gas engine community.

The key to pollutant transport is longevity of the compound concerned and the circulation patterns of the atmosphere. Pollutants that are relatively unreactive and volatile will, with time, be spread across the globe, eventually reaching even the most remote areas. Even semi-volatile pollutants can be transported by successive phases of volatilisation and deposition (multi-hop) until they too are spread across the globe. One of the implications of this world-wide distribution is that pollutants may reach areas where specific climatic, physical or chemical conditions occur that result in increased deposition fluxes to marine and terrestrial surfaces, with the consequence that pollution hot spots may be created at vast distances from the original pollution source. The Polar regions, particularly the Arctic because it is in the same hemisphere as the major industrialised nations, are a good example. Levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and mercury (Hg) in polar wildlife, particularly larger predators, have been known for some time to be higher than the norm at lower latitudes. Mercury is deposited in the Arctic, not just because of its reduced volatility due to low temperatures, but also as a result of specific atmospheric chemical conditions related to the tropospheric ozone depletion events. These events, prompted by the so-called 'Bromine Explosion,' which releases reactive halogen compounds to the troposphere, create conditions in which the atmospheric oxidation of Hg(g)0 occurs with such rapidity that its concentration can fall below detectable limits in a matter of hours. The oxidation products that are much more soluble than elemental Hg are deposited along with particulate matter or dry deposited, and at a time (around polar dawn) when the Arctic ecosystem is entering an active phase with the return of sunlight. There is evidence that Hg released by coal-burning power stations in China can be deposited in rain along the Pacific coast of the U.S. Hg released in the U.S. could potentially be transported with other atmospheric pollutants across the Atlantic to Europe and the Mediterranean. Industrial emissions in northern Europe due to the general north to south flow of the boundary layer air in summer months have a negative effect on Mediterranean air quality (high O3 concentrations) and it seems, on atmospheric Hg deposition to the Mediterranean Sea. If the description above seems rather qualitative it is because as yet the tools with which to model (and to a certain extent measure) atmospheric transport, transformation, deposition and re-emission on such a scale are in their infancy. There is a great need for strategically situated monitoring stations, creating a network to sample within the major air mass trajectories, not only at ground level but also at altitude. This would allow models and the emission inventories of pollutant fluxes to be validated in a far more comprehensive manner than isolated measurement campaigns permit. From validated models, it would then be possible to evaluate the potential effects of changing emissions resulting from legislation or changes in, for example, the power generation industry towards renewable energy sources. Finally, it would be possible also to investigate changes in pollution transport and deposition that occur with changing atmospheric transport patterns resulting from climate change. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A strong competition of several CSP technologies could lead to higher overall CSP growth rates than those assumed in the present study (around 30 per cent per year). In 2025 14 per cent of the electricity demand of MENA may be covered by CSP, which will become the dominating power source with a share of 57 per cent by 2050. According to our scenarios the mix of renewable energies will cost around 5 cents/kWh in 2050. The cost of CSP will be reduced from the current 8 cents/kWh to 6 cents/kWh in 2010 to 5 cents/kWh in 2020 (other scenarios quote 15 cents/kWh). From 2020 until 2050, the MENA region will save US$250 billion compared to the business as usual policy scenario, where it was assumed that the fuel prices start at US$25/bbl for oil and US$49/ton for coal and escalate by only 1 per cent per year (currently the prices are at a level of US$55/bbl and US$65/ton respectively and the escalation rates have amounted to 40 per cent per year since 2003). The study shows that solar thermal power plants are suitable for seawater desalination. A concentrating solar thermal collector array required for desalinating 1 billion m3/y would cover a total land area of approximately 10 × 10km, corresponding to about 10m3 of desalinated water per m2 of collector area. About 10 per cent of the desalinated water would suffice to irrigate the desert land beneath the collectors with a water column of 1m/y. The study shows that the total carbon emissions of electricity generation of all MENA countries can be reduced from 770 million tons per year to 475 million tons in 2050, instead of increasing to 2000 million tons. Furthermore, the greenhouse emissions from constructing the plants for most renewable energy technologies are between 10 and 25g/kWh of useful energy. In the case of photovoltaic systems, reductions are possible in the medium term to about 50g/kWh. The scenario reaches a per capita emission of 0.58 tons/cap/y in the power sector in 2050, which is acceptable in terms of the recommended total emission of 1-1.5 tons/cap.","Global solar radiation; Installed power capacity; MENA; Water deficiency; Wave and tidal power",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947684851

On the other hand, aerosol formation around Milan seems to be similarly dependent on HNO3 and NH3 most of the time. However, there are times when limitation by NH3 is stronger.

Competition in the generation and supply of power provides new business opportunities and strategic business alliances with partners at home and abroad, especially after the introduction of the Energy Community Treaty. A short review of the situation in Croatia regarding liberalization is presented. The analysis of possible variants of the establishment and development of market relations is made, as well as of the corresponding repercussions on short-term and long-term power plant operation and development. Electricity prices are still being regulated by the state and a small share of industrial consumers. Electricity consumption is around 17 TWh which is increasing, supplied by a relatively large share of hydropower plants. This has implications on the development of the power generation sector in Croatia as well as on electricity market operation. Environmental protection in the energy sector implies the primary action in connection with energy efficiency, renewable sources, choice of energy-generating products and application of state-of-the-art protection technologies, quality legislation and supervision, public opinion and education, and promotion of best practices.

In this study we estimate the three different process of CO2 trapping (structural, dissolution and mineralogical) by performing numerical modelling of the injection period. Two separate simulations have been performed using two modules of the simulator TOUGH2 (Pruess, 1991). The first module called TOUGHREACT is a reactive transport simulator allowing estimates of the mineral trapping due to geochemical reactions occurring between CO2 gas, aqueous phase and minerals (Xu and Pruess, 2001). In this case, fluid-rock interaction is modelled considering only pure CO2 for the gas phase. TOUGH2/EOS7C is a second adaptation of TOUGH2 simulator dealing with the equation of state for the CO2 and CH4 mixing (Oldenburg, 2004). The injection of CO2 into a CH4 reservoir (Case B) is considered but no geochemical reactions are incorporated in the model. Using these two models an estimate of the structural, dissolution and mineral trapping is provided by calculating the amount of CO2 remaining as (i) a gas phase, (ii) a dissolved phase and (ii) a mineral phase at the end of the injection period.",,"Carbon dioxide; Dissolution; Equations of state; Exhibitions; Fluid dynamics; Gas dynamics; Gas industry; Gases; Mineralogy; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Salinity measurement; Silica; Silicate minerals; Simulators; Water injection; Aqueous phase; CO2 gasses; Depleted gas reservoirs; Different processes; Equation of states; Gas fields; Gas phase; Geochemical reactions; Geological sequestrations; North seas; Numerical modelling; Reactive transports; Rock interactions; Simulator TOUGH2; Minerals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55549085212

The climate generates a temporal unit of variation throughout the year along a latitudinal gradient, that is strongly modified by the altitude. The proposed grouping of small water bodies into limnological regions in Mexico is associated with six ecological areas that are defined by the climate: a) a humid tropical area that covers 4.7% of the country's surface, b) a sub-humid tropical area with 23%, c) a humid temperate area with 2.7%, d) a sub-humid temperate area with 20.5%, e) an arid and semi-arid area with 49% and f) an alpine area with 0.1%. The limnological characteristic that was used to group the small water bodies was the change in water volume. With respect to this, three regions can be defined: a) warm and temperate humid regions where the volume of water varies but does not dry up (perennial astatic systems), b) warm sub-humid, arid and semi-arid regions that dry up annually (seasonal astatic systems), and c) sub-humid temperate regions, as a transition group (semi-perennial astatic systems).

Symptoms first appeared as water-soaked (1-3 mm in diameter) and irregular-shaped lesions on cotyledons and young true leave. There was halo on young true leaves, but not on cotyledons. Lesions on true leaves later enlarged and became brown to dark brown and angular. On older leaves and petioles, lesions coalesced, causing large areas of necrosis. A fluorescent, gram negative and rod-shaped bacterium was consistently isolated from diseased tissues onto King's Medium B. All of the strains were identified as Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato with similarity incidence of 61 to 90% based on fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analysis in Sherlock Microbial Identification System (Microbial ID, Newark, DE, USA). All of the bacterial strains were negative for oxidase, arginine dihydrolase and pectolytic activity, but positive for levan production. They induced hypersensitive reaction on tobacco leaves. All strains were capable of acid production from glycose, glycerin, sorbitole, sucrose, mannose, fructose, L (+) arabinose, D (-) mannitol, D (+) xylose, but not from lactose, maltose, raffinose, melibiose, trehalose and D (-) arabinose. Pathogenicity was confirmed by spray inoculating three plants with 106cfu/mL adequeous suspension of bacteria from 48-h King's Medium B cultures. Inoculated plants and water-sprayed controls were covered with polyethylene bags for 24 hours in a climate room at 25°C, 70% relative humidity and 16-hour per day light period. Bags were removed and plants maintained in the climate room to observe symptoms. Typical speck lesions on the inoculated plants similar to those observed in the nursery were developed within 5-7 days after inoculation. No symptoms developed on negative control plants. The bacterium was re-isolated from the inoculated plants and characterized as identical to the original strain (GSPB 483, obtained from Gottingen, Germany). Occurrence of bacterial speck disease on greenhouse- and field-grown tomato in Turkey has been reported previously, but this is the first observation of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato causing disease on tomato in a commercial nursery in the Eastern Mediterranean Region of Turkey.","Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato; Tomato","Bacteria (microorganisms); Lycopersicon esculentum; Negibacteria; Nicotiana tabacum; Pseudomonas syringae; Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449376995

This paper considers the consequences of both climate change and reduced agricultural diversity on global food security and nutrition. The inextricable link between climate change and crop diversity is examined, particularly in the context of crop production in Africa where most agricultural diversity exists and where climate change will have most impact. The Green Revolution, often seen as a model for increasing global agricultural productivity, is reconsidered in terms of its failure to make a significant impact in hostile tropical environments such as those of much of Africa. An alternative or, at least, a complementary strategy, is advocated where we might better harness the huge repository of indigenous plant species cultivated and conserved by local communities for many generations across variable climates. An example is given of multidisciplinary research on bambara groundnut (Vigna subterranea), an ancient grain legume grown, cooked, processed and traded mainly by subsistence women farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. The experience gained on bambara groundnut is considered as a basis for similar efforts on many other potentially useful underutilised food crops in the climates of the future.","Agricultural biodiversity; Bambara groundnut; Climate change; Underutilised crops","Arachis hypogaea; Bambara; Harness; Vigna subterranea",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250843125

Under the same condition of ambient temperature and pressure, and the same injection pressure, the rates of CO2 or N2 mixing were changed from 0 to 15% and the combustion characteristics of diesel spray were examined. Through the systematic experiments, it was explored that the ignition delay and the combustion period became longer with the increase of CO2 and N 2 mixing, and the effect was larger in the case of CO2 mixing. The flame temperature became lower with the N2 mixing mainly due to the dilution effect. In the case of CO2 mixing, the flame temperature decreased notably, and the flame region with higher temperature became very small. The reason of this tendency was attributed to the dilution effect, the higher heat capacity of CO2 and the chemical effect of CO2. Though the combustion delayed and the combustion temperature became lower with the CO2 mixing, the amount of soot in flame did not change so much.

Perchlorate causes alarm because it mimics iodine physiologically and is adsorbed by the thyroid gland, subsequently interfering with the endocrine systems of the brain. Removal of perchlorate to very low ppb is difficult on two fronts: competing ions such as nitrate, sulfate, carbonate etc. are often present at 1000 times higher concentration than perchlorate, and perchlorate is surprisingly stable considering its reputation as a rocket fuel oxidant. Direct electrochemical reduction of perchlorate in the parts per billion range is too slow and expensive to be viable. Ion exchange produces a troublesome disposal problem: either a perchlorate laden ion exchange resin or a brine stream containing high concentrations of perchlorate, nitrate, sulfate and bicarbonate. Electrochemical redox reduction of perchlorate, coupled to ion exchange capture and concentration is an economic and elegant method of dealing with both nitrate and perchlorate, particularly if the kinetics of the reduction process are fast. Perchlorate is surprisingly stable to reduction at a reducing cathode and with common reducing redox ions such as Cr2+, Fe2+. The reaction of perchlorate with Ti3+ is well documented in the literature, but the kinetics are slow in common solutions. In our latest study we have discovered that the reaction of perchlorate with titanium ions in methanesulfonic acid is very fast. We describe the laboratory experiments and pilot plant field trials in California that demonstrate the utility of this method for removing perchlorate and nitrate directly from drinking water and from regenerant brines from ion exchange systems.","Brine; Electrochemical destruction; Groundwater; Ion-exchange; Perchlorate; Removal","California; Direct electrochemical reductions; Drinking waters; Electrochemical destruction; Electrochemical redoxes; Endocrine systems; Field trials; High concentrations; Higher concentrations; Ion exchange systems; Laboratory experiments; Methanesulfonic acids; Parts per billions; Perchlorate; Perchlorate ions; Reduction processes; Rocket fuels; Thyroid glands; Titanium ions; Alarm systems; Brines; Chromium; Deionized water; Dewatering; Electrolytic reduction; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Hydrogeology; Iodine; Ion exchange resins; Ion exchangers; Ions; Nitrates; Nitrogen removal; Pilot plants; Potable water; Reaction kinetics; Reduction; Remediation; Resins; River pollution; Rockets; Sedimentology; Sediments; Soil pollution; Soils; Titanium; Underground reservoirs; Ion exchange",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58349117880

The use of source apportionment is more desirable than the ""zero-out"" approach to determine geographic and emissions sector culpability. Zeroing out emissions for large regions such as entire States fundamentally changes the atmospheric chemistry and makes interpretation of the results difficult. Source apportionment of high ozone concentrations at non-attainment monitor locations is useful for regulators in developing effective emissions control scenarios. The Comprehensive Air-Quality Model with extensions is a state of the science photochemical model containing multiple ozone source apportionment tools. Ozone contributions are tracked using the anthropogenic pre-cursor culpability assessment (APCA) source apportionment tool for 18 geographic regions and 6 emissions sector categories: electrical generating point sources, non-electrical generating point sources, on-road, off-road, area, and biogenics. A future year emissions scenario for 2012 is used for this application to present a better understanding of what is contributing to high ozone concentrations in the future when certain emissions controls and sector growth is taken into consideration. Results are given for receptors in counties near the Great Lakes that may not meet the 8-hr ozone NAAQS by 2012. The highest contributors to high modeled ozone concentrations include on-road, off-road, and point source emissions of nitrogen oxides. The Chicago and Detroit receptors are dominated by local emissions. The Cleveland receptor has a large contribution from emissions in down-State Ohio in addition to large local contribution. Chicago emissions also dominate contributions to high ozone at receptors to the north along the western and eastern shores of Lake Michigan. Source apportionment results for the finer compared to coarser grid resolution show a higher percentage of local contribution to ozone at the finer grid resolution.","APCA; CAMx; OSAT; Ozone; Photochemical model; Source apportionment","Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Highway administration; Lakes; Nitrogen oxides; Potential flow; Roads and streets; Transportation; Waste management; APCA; CAMx; OSAT; Photochemical modeling; Source apportionment; Ozone",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649118006

We systematically explore how the bonding varies with carbon concentration in this structure and the origin of the fundamental electron deficiency of the phase. As the carbon concentration is reduced, we find that the exo-polyhedral BEq-C bonds of the icosahedra in the structure become increasingly engaged in multiple bonding, and the repulsive steric interactions between the bulky B12 units surrounding the carbon atom are reduced. The short bond lengths observed within the three-atom ≡C-B-C≡ chains are then due to substantial π-bonding, while the carbon deficiency weakens its σ-framework significantly. We conclude that the idealized framework of boron carbide has to expel some electrons in order to maximize its bonding; disorder in the structure is an inevitable consequence of this partial oxidation. The localization of electronic states arising from the disorder leads to the semiconducting nature of boron carbide throughout its composition range. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.",,"boron derivative; carbon; article; atom; chemical bond; chemical structure; electron; oxidation; priority journal; stereochemistry; structure analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34147139295

Historic operations have created situations where petroleum hydrocarbons and other constituents of concern in groundwater could possibly affect nearby water bodies. When groundwa,ter expresses itself as a seep, direct flow of constituents as a dissolved groundwater fraction or a separate phase fraction may result in concerns related to human health or the environment. When seeps create a hydrocarbon sheen on open water bodies, rapid action and long-term solutions may be required by the railroad, community and regulators. CSX Transportation (CSXT) and ARCADIS identified a situation requiring seep mitigation related to petroleum hydrocarbons in groundwater. Dissolved hydrocarbon constituents and a hydrocarbon sheen were discovered along a river in West Virginia. CSXT and ARCADIS developed, designed and constructed a Petroleum Hydrocarbon Sheen Containment System (the System). The responsive actions taken by CSXT and the System implementation was awarded for the West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection's prestigious 2005 DEP Environmental Excellence Award and received Honorable Mention. The System is designed to eliminate the seep through the capture, containment, and recovery of groundwater. The System consists of a 105 foot long, 80-mil high density polyethylene (HDPE) containment barrier wall along the riverbank with wing walls on the upstream and downstream ends. The barrier wall is anchored into shale bedrock. A HDPE liner is welded to the top of the HDPE wall and covered with non-woven geotextile fabric to line the slope of the river bank. A concrete blanket protects the HDPE slope liner and geotextile fabric. Two rows of gabion baskets positioned at the toe of the slope between the barrier wall and the river provide additional protection for the barrier wall and slope liner. Capture and containment of groundwater is achieved through 4-inch stainless steel groundwater recovery wells installed behind the barrier wall. Recovered groundwater is pumped using controllerless pneumatic pumps to a wastewater treatment system within an operation facility or diverted to a 40,000-gallon above-ground temporary storage tank (AST) constructed as part of the System. Construction of the System presented unique challenges related to wide fluctuations in river level, relocation of a NPDES permitted outfall, and logistics in a remote area. The system was brought on-line in August 2004. The ongoing operation of the system has successfully mitigated the seep and also prevents groundwater movement to the river.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79551607888

The well-known type of microbial respiration, in which oxygen serves as an electron acceptor for the oxidation of organic carbon and/or hydrogen, has been studied elsewhere in detail. Anaerobic microorganisms are widely distributed in oil-producing vents, hydrothermal vents, volcanic hot springs, non-volcanic geothermally heated subsurface aquifers, and soil. In this study, anaerobic, thermophilic, and fermenting microorganisms in a petroleum sample from the Adiyaman region of Turkey were examined for their ability to use different electron acceptors. The temperature range for growth of the enrichment culture (TP1) was between 40 and 65°C and the optimum pH ranged from 4.5 to 8.0. TP1 had the ability to use a wide variety of mono-, di-, and polysaccharides to form acetate, lactate, ethanol, H2, and CO2. No sulfate-reducing or methanogenic microorganisms were found. As an electron acceptor, TP1 reduces thiosulfate, elemental sulfur, sulfite, Fe(III), anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS), arsenake, and MnO2, but not sulfate, nitrate, (per)chlorate, or selenate. Herein, we show that the enrichment culture from the petroleum environment was able to reduce multiple electron acceptors. The utilization of these electron acceptors by TP1 also indicated their presence in this area. The results presented suggest that TP1 may occupy a niche as an environmental opportunist by taking advantage of diverse electron acceptors. © TÜBİTAK.","Anaerobic bacteria; Degradation of organic compounds; Electron acceptor utilization; Petroleum environment","Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34347361598

Forest fires are the regions most dynamic disturbance factor, occurring mainly in Siberia, Russian Far East, Canada and Alaska, and these fires represent a globally important release of terrestrial carbon to the atmosphere, via the burning of vegetation and organic soils. Currently the boreal region is believed to be a net carbon sink, but climate change predictions indicate significant boreal warming, with consequent increases in fire activity and carbon release. Ultimately, the boreal zone may become a net carbon source through forest fires and increased soil decomposition, and there is evidence that the Canadian forest may have already made this transition. Critical to estimating both direct and longer-term fire-related perturbations to boreal carbon storage is knowledge of fire extent, intensity and/or type, which has a strong control on forest fire ""damage"", the fraction of available fuel combusted, and patterns of post-fire re-growth. These variables are currently derived from model-based assessment of often-uncertain accuracy, introducing large uncertainties to current carbon flux calculations. The post-fire re-growth process is of great importance since whilst fire releases carbon Into the atmosphere, carbon sequestration through post-fire regeneration of plants and woody vegetation may help to reduce the amounts of carbon in the atmosphere. Observational data, such as vegetation indices, biophysical vegetation parameters, burnt area and Are radiative power, derived from satellite measurements are exploited to investigate post-fire regeneration and pre and post-fire temporal dynamics in the boreal forest The relationship between post-fire dynamics and variables such as fire intensity, vegetation cover and climate are investigated. The ultimate aim of the proposed work is to improve insight into the Siberian boreal forest post-fire dynamics, leading to more realistic carbon flux quantification in the boreal biome and subsequently to a better quantitative understanding of the role of boreal forest regeneration in the global atmospheric carbon record. © 2007 IEEE.","Climate change; Fire; Forest; Phenology; Siberia","Boreal forest; Carbon flux; Post-fire dynamics; Carbon; Climate change; Forestry; Remote sensing; Soils; Vegetation; Fires; Forestry; Phenology",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82355169960

The 3-phase, multi-year program goals are to develop an advanced syngas, hydrogen and natural gas fired gas turbine fully integrated into coal-based Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plants. The Program objectives are to demonstrate 3-5 percentage points efficiency improvement over current state of the art, less than 2 ppm NOx @ 15% O2 and reduction in plant capital cost. An additional objective is to show how the advanced gas turbine - IGCC plant can be configured for CO2 sequestration readiness. These objectives represent the overall DOE Advanced Power System goal to conduct Research and Development necessary to produce fuel flexible, CO2 sequestration ready advanced IGCC power systems for FutureGen type applications. Phase 1 entails advanced technologies identification, research and development Implementation Plan preparation and new gas turbine component conceptual designs. Phase 2 focuses on novel technologies development, validation, down selection and advanced gas turbine detail design. Phase 3 involves advanced gas turbine and IGCC plant construction and validation testing to demonstrate that efficiency, emissions and cost goals will be achieved and to prove the system's commercial viability. The end objective is to validate the advanced gas turbine technology by 2015. The SGT6-6000G was selected as the basis for this development effort, due to its high firing temperature, output power and efficiency, as well as its advanced secondary air and steam cooling systems. It will be adapted for operation on coal, refinery residue and biomass derived hydrogen and syngas fuels, as well as natural gas, while achieving high performance levels and reduced plant capital costs in $/kW. New or enhanced technologies required to achieve high plant efficiency, while minimizing emissions and capital cost, will be developed and gas turbine design changes needed for optimum integration into the IGCC plant will be carried out. The main development thrust will be in the combustion, turbine cooling, materials/coating technologies and engine integration/operational flexibility. Several combustion systems will be investigated and the most successful candidate down selected. To minimize cooling air consumption, novel cooling concepts will be investigated, and validated in rig tests. Advanced bond coats, thermal barrier coatings, superalloys and airfoil architectures will be developed to minimize cooling air use.

One consequence of these instabilities can be large amplitude pressure oscillations, which are often coupled with heat release oscillations. As this coupling leads to performance degradations or acoustic noise, various instability control techniques have been developed. The purpose of the present paper is to propose an original instability control technique acting on thermo-acoustic combustion instabilities appearing in an experimental lean premixed burner. The actuation system consists in injecting an hydrogen jet in a premixed hydrocarbon flame. Several diagnostic techniques have been used to characterize the burner behavior and to evaluate the effects of hydrogen injection on both combustion instabilities and pollutant emissions. It is shown that hydrogen injection induces a significant decrease of the amplitude of pressure oscillations while the heat release oscillations remain at the same level. To increase the understanding of the phenomena observed, phase locked images of OH* and CH* emission fluctuations have been obtained. These images show that the hydrogen jet breaks the coupling between acoustic and heat release oscillations. The transient period following the hydrogen injection has also been studied, using a solenoid valve to command the hydrogen injection. This study shows that the hydrogen jet acts quickly on pressure oscillations (<50 ms) without inducing any oscillatory transitory regime in the combustion chamber. Lastly, it has been shown that the hydrogen injection has no negative effects on NO emission but induces a strong increase of CO emission. However, as the hydrogen injection modifies the properties of the gaseous mixture that fed the burner, a new emission index was defined, to compare the different cases studied in terms of pollutant emission. © 2006 The Combustion Institute.

The main components of an in-flight FC system are a compressor-turbine unit, a kerosene reformer, and the fuel cell. Polymer exchange membrane fuel cells (PEM-FC) may be favored because of their currently advanced level of development, their high power density and the available liquid water in the cathode-off gases which can be used as service water on-board. Transient requirements may have significant impact on system design and operating range and will therefore be addressed in this paper During in-flight operation, air has to be compressed from the ambient to a pressure near standard conditions, which allows the application of state-of-the-art PEM-FC and ensures a constant power density independent from the operating altitude. A centrifugal compressor is chosen for pressurization of the system and is powered by a radial turbine, which allows autonomous operation at cruising altitude without external power. For off-design operation and transients, electric support from the PEM-FC is necessary, see [1]. The radial turbine itself is run by the hot exhaust gases from a post-combustor using the remaining energy in the cathode off-gases. A thorough trade-off between suitable compressor techniques for the air supply system was carried out in [1]. Turbomachinery revealed to be favourable for the PEM air supply system due to their low specific weight and high efficiency. The air supply system resembles the turbocharger for a combustion engine (Fig. 1), which represents a good starting point for a successful integration into the flight environment and further development due to known technology. Based on a turbomachinery design which satisfies the system requirements, the dynamic behavior of the air supply system is analyzed when coupled to the PEM fuel cell. The main focus is on the detection of sensitive system parameters causing system response delay or critical operating conditions. The present paper suggests system features, turbomachinery design parameters and controller types which achieve inherent stability and fast response of the air supply system throughout the entire flight envelope.

The process occurs as zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZDDP) decomposes in an engine creating many phosphorus species, which eventually interact with the active sites of exhaust catalysts. This phosphorous comes from both oil consumption and volatilization. Novel low-volatility ZDDP is designed in such a way that the amounts of volatile phosphorus species are significantly reduced while their antiwear and antioxidant performances are maintained. A recent field trial conducted in New York City taxi cabs provided two sets of ""aged"" catalysts that had been exposed to GF-4-type formulations. The trial compared fluids formulated with conventional and low-volatility ZDDPs. Results of field test examination were reported in an earlier paper (1). As a part of our current examinations, Federal Test Procedure (FTP-75) emissions tests were conducted. Emissions data collected showed a statistically significant difference in 50% hydrocarbon (HC) efficiency light-off time, on low impact ZDDP as compared to conventional ZDDP, and an even greater effect on nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions due to a reduction in the phosphorus-derived catalyst deactivation.

Among them, various doped barium cerate compounds, such as BaCe1-x YxO 3-δ have been intensively investigated because of their high proton conductivity. As a drawback, cerates are chemically unstable in CO 2-containing atmospheres, such as in case of hydrocarbon or syngas fuelled fuel cells. Conversely, doped barium zirconates electrolyte materials exhibit high chemical stability but lower proton conductivity. A goal of this work was to obtain full-density proton conducting materials having both high conductivity and good chemical stability. In particular, the compositions investigated in this work were BaCe1-x-yZrxY yO3-δ (x=0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4; y=0.15, 0.20). The partial substitution of Ce by Zr in doped barium cerate considerably increased their chemical stability in CO2 atmosphere without sensibly affecting the conductivity. ©The Electrochemical Society.",,"Barium zirconate; Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Proton conductivity; Solid electrolytes; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Solid state devices; Temperature; Doped barium cerate; Electrolyte material; High conductivity; Low temperature solid oxide fuel cells; Partial substitution; Proton conducting materials; Proton conductors; Proton-conducting electrolyte; Chemical stability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65749099186

An improvement in flood risk assessment and study of a possible increase in flooding occurrence are therefore needed. To carry out these tasks it is important to have at our disposal extensive knowledge on historical floods and to find an efficient way to manage this geographical data. In this paper we present a complete flood database spanning the 20th century for the whole of Catalonia (NE Spain), which includes documentary information (affected areas and damage) and instrumental information (meteorological and hydrological records). This geodatabase, named Inungama, has been implemented on a GIS (Geographical Information System) in order to display all the information within a given geographical scenario, as well as to carry out an analysis thereof using queries, overlays and calculus. Following a description of the type and amount of information stored in the database and the structure of the information system, the first applications of Inungama are presented. The geographical distribution of floods shows the localities which are more likely to be flooded, confirming that the most affected municipalities are the most densely populated ones in coastal areas. Regarding the existence of an increase in flooding occurrence, a temporal analysis has been carried out, showing a steady increase over the last 30 years.",,"climatology; database; flooding; geographical distribution; GIS; risk assessment; twentieth century; Catalonia; Eurasia; Europe; Southern Europe; Spain",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34147209232

Sealing faults or fractures reduce contacted hydrocarbon volume per well by compartmentalizing the reservoir and reduce rate by locally impairing permeability. Open fractures or conductive faults enhance well productivity and contacted volume, but cause drilling difficulties and may lead to early aquifer influx or injection water breakthrough. With their lengthy drilling and production history, the West Sole area gas fields provide a natural laboratory for the study of sealing and conductive fractures and their inter-relationships. Conductive fractures were recognized early in field life, but the poor performance of some wells indicated that fractures were not uniformly distributed. As development continued, entire field segments were found to be unfractured. Subsequent appraisal drilling identified undepleted and partially depleted compartments, demonstrating that sealing faults or fractures are also present. More recent development of the satellite fields Newsharn and Hoton has confirmed the presence in a single field of both conductive and sealing fractures, although there is a general inverse spatial relationship between the two. The structural history of the reservoirs provides an explanation for this phenomenon. Faulting at high pressures and temperatures during Jurassic rifting gave rise to sealing lithified cataclasite fault rocks. Inversion to form the hydrocarbon traps took place at lower pressures and temperatures. The associated brittle deformation breached sealing faults and generated open fractures. © The Geological Society of London 2007.",,"brittle deformation; compartmentalization; conference proceeding; drilling; faulting; fracture; gas field; gas well; hydrocarbon; hydrocarbon reservoir; sealing; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38349157302

In these cases, climate has an immediate impact on human mobility, which is severely constrained during the pronounced cold/dry intervals of the Pleistocene. As high mobility becomes incompatible with the environmental limitations of extreme intervals, such as the Last Glacial Maximum, previously disparate mobile human groups aggregate and compete for limited and spatially segregated resources. During such times, regional cultural variation evolves in isolation and natural selection acts on group-level adaptations, facilitating the evolution of cohesive and cooperative social networks. The process of group selection further allows for the rapid diffusion of cultural and technological innovation and may explain the rapid diffusion of microblade technology throughout northeast Asia during the post-glacial period. While climate change does present challenges to human survival and may promote alternative adaptive strategies, rapid cultural evolution is driven primarily by group formation, between-group competition, and the mechanics of cultural transmission. The degree to which climate change mediates these interactions is the extent to which climate should be implicated in cultural evolution. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A strategy to lower the impact of availability and cost of materials will have positive externalities, lessening exporting jobs abroad. A robust policy framework will improve eco-efficient resource use and promote sustainable production and consumption. An Institutional Framework for Resource Management incorporating an international panel, would help to decouple natural resources use from its environmental impacts, monitor global material and energy flows balance and guide the design of policies and measures. Additionally, it would coordinate constituencies and generate information and knowledge, within the framework of existing environmental institutionalism. Humans change ecosystems to meet their respective needs. Their unfathomable ingenuity and drive needs a strong legal framework to provide order and deter predatory free market practices, thus limiting environmental degradation and depletion of natural resources throughout the global economy. The world economy is based on abundant fossil fuels reserves, and their use as fuels to supply energy and transport have the undesirable side-effects of air pollution and global warming. Energy consumption is likely to expand with economic growth and prosperity; 'business as usual' needs to be checked with innovation playing a crucial role in reducing CO2 emissions and creating alternatives to satisfy societal needs, but also in devising new laws. Market enthusiasm alone without strong guidance could lead to disorder, like the optimistic biofuels boom, compared with a more organized and orderly evolution provided by laws such as the German feed-in law or Danish container law. Better organization based on a robust legal framework, innovation, information and incentives, within a market context, will create conditions to develop core competences and attitudes for achieving efficiency. Incentives, economic and fiscal, will help counterbalance the increasing importance of gas and coal and promote life cycle thinking, ecoefficiency and ecoplanning of cities.

The main objective of this paper is to present optimisation models that can be used to determine the most cost effective strategy or combination of strategies to reduce CO2 emissions to a specific level. Optimisation results for an existing network of power plants show that it may be possible to reduce CO2 emissions by increasing power plant efficiency through a variety of adjustments in the plants.

Different cumulus parameterization schemes in RegCM3 for prediction of convective precipitation were tested for monsoon period during the years 1998 and 2001. The model predicted results compared with the satellite pictures, CRU observational data and the surface synoptic observatories data of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD). This may be mentioned here, that the year 1998 was a dry year and the starting year of a severe drought which lasted up to the year 2000. This may also be added here, that during the year 2001, the precipitation over some parts of the country exceeded the normal and some areas in the northern parts of the country observed exceptionally high rainfall rate. The results indicated that some convective parameterization schemes of RegCM3, well captured the summer monsoon precipitation over south-Asia region. However, the schemes need to be selected carefully depending upon the region of any particular focus. Some interim findings were that the Grell scheme with both closures: Arakawa-Schubert (AS) and Fritsch-Chappell (FC) satisfactorily predicted the total monthly rainfall in the northern mountainous regions of Pakistan. However, both predicted high precipitations over southern and south-eastern plain regions. Both the modified-Kuo and Betts-Miller (BM) schemes substantially under-predicted the rainfall, although the patterns were captured adequately. The modified-Kuo scheme was more close to the observed data when compared with the performance of the BM scheme It is recommended to further test the model schemes, perhaps a further improvement in the modified-Kuo scheme would yield a scheme even better than both of the Grell closures (which predicted exceptionally high precipitation over south-eastern plain regions of Pakistan and the adjoining Indian regions. In a future paper we shall be presenting more results and will try to suggest some modifications in the existing schemes to be able to better capture the summer monsoon precipitation over south-Asia. Due to their coarse resolution General Circulation Models (GCMs) often perform poorly in simulating regional processes, especially in regions with local fine-scale forcing topography (Gates, 1992, Gao et al., 2002). On the other hand, modeling studies with regional climate models also indicated that some cumulus parameterization schemes do not perform well in some specific regions of the world e.g. Asian monsoon regions (Leung et al. 2003, Lee and Suh 2000). Scale interactions are extremely complex in the Asian monsoon regions (Holland 1995), which are further complicated due to the effects of Tibetan plateau, ocean-continent contrast and sea-air interactions. These specific features require special consideration in designing regional climate models to be used in this particular region. The impacts of climate change on food and water resources of a country are linked with the regional climate rather than to the global scale. It is therefore imperative to understand and predict how global climate change is manifested at these regional scales. Using GCM output to drive limited-area atmospheric simulations on regional scales has been reported to be a promising approach for simulating regional climates (Giorgi and Mearns, 1991, 1999). The principle behind this approach is that, given a large-scale atmospheric circulation, a limited-area model with a suitably high-resolution, resolving complex topography, land-sea contrast, land use and detailed description of physical processes can generate realistic high-resolution (both spatial and temporal) information coherent with the driving large-scale circulation. The large-scale circulation can be supplied by either reanalysis data or a GCM output. A critical weakness that needs improvement in both global and regional climate models is the treatment of clouds (Giorgi and Mearns 1999). Although the detailed explicit cloud microphysics parameterization for grid resolved moist processes, is considered in some of the regional climate models, the complex interaction between sub-grid cumulus convection and grid scale moist processes is very crudely treated. Some studies have indicated the improvements in radiation budgets by using cloud microphysics information (Petch and Dudhia, 1998), but the cloud amount is treated in a quite simple way and is usually estimated by the relative humidity in most of the climate model applications (Giorgi et al. 1993, Dudek et al. 1996, Wang et al. 2000). Although some previous studies (Houghton et al., 1992) have shown the capability of regional climate models in reproducing intra-annual variability when driven by good quality driving fields, more analyses are needed to improve model performance in simulating climate variability at short timescales (days to weeks). The increased resolution of regional climate models can allow simulation of a broader spectrum of weather events to improve simulation of the daily to monthly precipitation intensity distributions. We in this work, have studied the capabilities of a regional climate model, RegCM3 (available from http://www.ictp.trieste.it/~pubregcm/RegCM3) to simulate the precipitation intensity/patterns during summer monsoon season in the Indian subcontinent. The summer monsoon systems are originated from the Bay of Bengal, Indian Ocean and some times get accentuated by the juxtaposition of passing westerly disturbances and the Arabian Sea component. We have tried to identify some suitable cumulus parameterization schemes for predicting the summer monsoon precipitation (July to September) over the regions or to access the need of further modification in the model. Different cumulus parameterization schemes in RegCM3 for prediction of convective precipitation were tested for monsoon period during the years 1998 and 2001. This would be interesting to mention here that 1998 was the starting year of a severe drought in Pakistan, which lasted up to the year 2000. Due to this drought the agricultural productivity in the country was badly affected. On the other hand, during the year 2001, the precipitation over some parts of the country exceeded the normal and some areas in the northern parts of the country observed exceptionally high rainfall rate. July 23, of the year 2001 witnessed heavy rainfall in a cloud burst fashion over some of the northern parts of Pakistan (Districts of Mansehra, Abottabad, Rawalpindi and Islamabad). This heavy precipitation exceeded the recorded maximum rainfall in Islamabad, during a single spell and caused severe economic and life loss. In this work, we have tried to explore the capabilities of RegCM3 and the effects of the use of different convective closure schemes on the intensity and spatial patterns of the precipitation during the summer monsoon months (July, August and September) of the selected years. The model was initialized using the NCEP reanalysis data having spatial resolution of 2.5° × 2.5° and temporal resolution of 6 h. The model domain was from 5N to 45N and 55E to 105E with a spatial resolution of 90 km and a 1:3 nesting was provided over a domain from 24N to 36N and 60E to 76E to focus on Pakistan.

The concern for environmental pollution and damage from the emission of automobile, thermal power plant, petroleum-crude refinery would catalyse the process of development unless financial benefits in terms of lowering of pollution damage cost are perceived by users and the manufacturers. Infrastructure development of the hydrogen energy encompasses production, distribution, dispensing and safety regulations of fuels (e.g., hydrogen, alcohol, esters and natural gases, naphtha and synthesis gases), which is directly fed to the fuel cells or to the fuel processor. Out of these hydrogen and alcohols can be generated from renewable sources (wind, solar power in water electrolysis, biomass gasification and fermentation) and others including hydrogen and alcohol can also be generated from fossil fuel. In the former case, green house gas emission is much lower and almost negligible. One can dream of zero emission of air pollutant and green house gases from automobiles and stationary power plants except for the case of biomass gasification. In the latter case, the air pollutant will be generated in a centralized location and cities will be free of pollution, which is otherwise generated from automobile using internal combustion engine. It should be noted that the hydrogen fuel cell vehicle (H2FCV) and H2FCV- hybrid electric vehicle offers least environmental damage among all the advanced options. When fuelled with hydrogen derived from natural gas, pollution damage costs are 1/8 as large as for today's gasoline internal combustion engine vehicles without CO2 sequestration and 1/15 as large with CO 2 sequestration (Ogden et al. 2004). Although economics does not work out at present for PEMFC (Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell) based automobile or SOFC (Solid Oxide Fuel cell) based stationary power plant with present inadequate hydrogen infrastructure but it is hoped that with the increase in crude price, no new crude or gas reserve findings, increase in fuel cell stack efficiency and decrease in cost of the fuel cell and improvement of hydrogen energy infrastructure facility, the Fuel Cell Vehicle (FCV) and distributed power generation from fuel cell will become more profitable leaving aside the cost benefits due to less environmental pollution. © 2007 Anamaya Publishers, New Delhi, India.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889847193

The records mimic the Greenland ice core records in that they display the Heinrich events and the rapid Dansgaard/ Oeschger-type stadial-interstadial oscillations. Warm interstadials correlate with an expansion of deciduous forests on the adjacent continents and enhanced river runoff and organic matter flux from terrestrial sources. In contrast, cold stadials are characterized by an expansion of semi-desert vegetation, reduced river runoff and limited terrestrial organic matter flux. The organic carbon record displays a longer-term cyclicity that correlates with the North Atlantic 'Bond' cooling cycles. The records enable the documentation of rapid changes of continental climates in the western Mediterranean borderlands that caused changes in river runoff and in oceanic productivity that were driven by rapid fluctuations of the Atlantic inflow into the Mediterranean Sea. The combined terrestrial-marine patterns demonstrate the close linking of western Mediterranean climate with the climatic evolution in the North Atlantic region.","Alboran Sea; Climatic changes; ODP Site 976; Organic matter; Quaternary","calcium carbonate; climate change; Dansgaard-Oeschger cycle; Heinrich event; ice core; interstadial; Last Glacial; Ocean Drilling Program; organic matter; planktonic foraminifera; Quaternary; runoff; Alboran Sea; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Mediterranean Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847411606

The GISS climate model is used in this study, including atmospheric gas- and aerosol phase chemistry to investigate current and future (2030, following the SRES AlB emission scenario) atmospheric compositions. A set of sensitivity experiments was carried out to quantify the individual impact of emissionand physical climate change on nitrate aerosol formation. We found that future nitrate aerosol loads depend most strongly on changes that may occur in the ammonia sources. Furthermore, microphysical processes that lead to aerosol mixing play a very important role in sulphate and nitrate aerosol formation. The role of nitrate aerosols as climate change driver is analyzed and set in perspective to other aerosol and ozone forcings under pre-industrial, present day and future conditions. In the near future, year 2030, ammonium nitrate radiative forcing is about -0.14 W/m2 and contributes roughly 10% of the net aerosol and ozone forcing. The present day nitrate and pre-industrial nitrate forcings are -0.11 and -0.05 W/m2, respectively. The steady increase of nitrate aerosols since industrialization increases its role as a non greenhouse gas forcing agent. However, this impact is still small compared to greenhouse gas forcings, therefore the main role nitrate will play in the future atmosphere is as an air pollutant, with annual mean near surface air concentrations, in the fine particle mode, rising above 3 μg/m3 in China and therefore reaching pollution levels, like sulphate aerosols.",,"aerosol formation; atmospheric pollution; climate change; climate modeling; emission; nitrate; ozone; troposphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34948845009

This has created the illusion that effective measures are being pursued in the public interest for both this and future generation(s). The reality is, however, that nearly of all these initiatives are ""input focused"" and the various States of the Environment reports confirm that, despite decades of endeavour and large financial investment, there is little return on investment and that the rate of environmental degradation, particularly of the global atmosphere, continues to increase. Despite fierce posturing from the global warming sceptics, it seems that finally, the long-term data indices of global warming are being accepted seriously and politicians around the world are responding by investing public funds in the quest for options. This paper contends that with global warming the major trends will be inexorable but the manifestations complex so humans will need to embrace uncertainty and manage change. Innovation and cooperation across all disciplines and the cooperation of the entire political and social spectrum will be required to solve the ecological disasters that have already begun to unfold and accelerate in frequency.

The high concentration of ground level ozone can cause a variety of health problems including chest pain, coughing, throat irritation, and congestion or it can worsen bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. Other effects include reduction of agricultural crop and commercial forest yields, lower growth and survivability of tree seedlings, and higher susceptibility of plant to diseases, pests and other stresses such as harsh weather. Ozone generation rate is directly related to the ambient concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic carbons (VOCs). These two air pollutants, mostly produced from combustion of fossil fuels, react with oxygen to form ozone in presence of sunlight. In urban areas, ozone generation rate can be decreased by reduction of ozone precursors, NOx and VOCs. Air Quality Research group of University of Central Florida proposed that one of the emissions reduction strategies be for school bus fleets in the area. School buses were chosen because of their important impact on ambient air quality in general and on student health in particular. There were about 473,000 school buses in 2004-05 school year nationwide which traveled for a total mileage about 4 billion miles in that period. Orange County Public School owns about 1400 school buses which traveled about 17 million miles in 2005-06 school year, serving 71000 students. The use of diesel fuels Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD, diesel fuel containing 15 ppm sulfur) and Biodiesel (B20, a mixture of 20% biodiesel and 80% petroleum diesel) were chosen as the first proposed action to be studied. This report reviews the effects of ULSD, B20 and Conventional Diesel (CD, diesel fuel containing 350 ppm sulfur) on school bus fleet emissions and it does comparison analysis among the fuels in order to show advantages and disadvantages of each fuel. The CD and ULSD emissions were estimated by using MOBILE6.2 model, and effects of B20 on emissions were derived from previous studies. It was found that using B20 or ULSD can reduce the emissions significantly for most of major pollutants but in the case of NOx, the change percentage is not certain yet and more investigation is required.","Biodiesel; Emissions; School bus; Ultra low sulfur diesel","Air pollution; Air quality; Biodiesel; Citrus fruits; Crops; Diesel fuels; Emission control; Fleet operations; Fuels; Health; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Particulate emissions; Pollution; Reduction; Seed; Sulfur; Waste incineration; Waste management; Ambient air quality; Ambient concentrations; Comparison analysis; Emissions reduction; School bus; Ultra-low sulfur diesel; University of Central Florida; Volatile organic carbons; Buses",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649178665

This demand of energy for indoor air conditioning represents a challenge for environmental policies, a potential enemy of energy efficiency and energy saving and, definitely, an issue at stake for global climate policies. The trend of energy demand for cooling purposes also brings many problems for the generation capacity and the management of peak loads. The technologies for centralized trigeneration (electricity, heating, cooling) seem promising but do not always enter the market with convincing commercial strategies. Nevertheless, the presence of district heating from cogeneration plants in large metropolitan areas (like in Turin, Italy) represent the possibility of developing district conditioning. The preliminary conclusions of the research are as follows: 1) given the assumed technology and the trend for indoor air-conditioning demand, district cooling brings net social benefits from both sides of industrial figures (global investments, maintenance and running costs) and environmental externalities; 2) some cautionary remarks are due in relation to the assumptions, sometimes questionable, about emissions rate per kWh, energy efficiency in electricity production, discount rate, market prices of alternative technologies, plumbing and networking costs. The analysis does not encompass the distribution of costs and benefits among stakeholders (among the others: electricity producers, network owners, end users), a question that is more relevant in the political local arena.","District cooling; District heating; Energy efficiency; Energy externalities; Environmental cost-benefit analysis","cost-benefit analysis; developing world; energy use; environmental policy; global warming; indoor air; metropolitan area; stakeholder",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849161494

On the other hand, geological storage in deep saline aquifers and hydrocarbon reservoirs of large amounts of CO2, captured from large stationary sources is one method that is under consideration for reducing greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere on a worldwide basis. In both cases of CO2-EOR and CO2 capture and geological storage (CCGS), the containment of CO2 within the injection unit and leakage avoidance are essential. Effective CO2 containment is achieved by the overlying tight caprock that is initially highly saturated with formation brine, which prevents CO2 migration into uphole intervals and potentially into shallow freshwater aquifers and ultimately to the atmosphere. The confining properties of the caprock are due to its very low permeability and to relative permeability and capillary pressure effects that prevent the penetration of CO2 into, and significant flow through the caprock. Essential to the assessment of CO2-EOR and CCGS operations, including numerical simulation, is knowledge' about the caprock permeability to brine and CO2. This paper presents results of detailed measurements at full reservoir conditions for permeability to water, primary drainage and secondary imbibition permeability, relative permeability and trapped saturation of supercritical, dense-phase CO2 and brine for three different, regionally-extensive low permeability formations in the Alberta basin, Canada. These formations include Devonian and Cretaceous shales and a Devonian anhydrite whose measured relative permeabilities were found to be in the nano to pico Darcy range. The, methodology used in the test program and the results can be extended to the evaluation of other sealing caprocks for other prospective CO2-EOR or CCGS operations around the world.

The Earth Explorer missions are defined, developed and operated in close cooperation with the science community and focus on the key components of the Earth System: the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere and the Earth's interior. The emphasis of these missions is on providing data to advance our understanding of these individual components, their interaction with each other and the impacts that human activities have on natural Earth processes. By involving the science community from the beginning and introducing a peer-reviewed selection process, this ongoing user-driven approach has given the Earth science community an efficient tool in their endeavor to better understand and monitor our planet. So far, this process has resulted in six missions currently under development: GOCE, Cryosat, ADM Aeolus, SMOS, Swarm and EarthCARE. The third cycle of Earth Explorers Core Missions was started in 2005 to select the seventh Earth Explorer mission due to launch in 2014/2015. At present there are six candidate missions being assessed at pre-phase A level. These missions were chosen to enter the assessment phase as a result of the Call for Core Mission ideas released by ESA in 2005, which resulted in 24 proposals out of which six candidates were selected: BIOMASS - global measurements of forest biomass and extent; TRAQ - (TRopospheric composition and Air Quality) - Air quality monitoring and long-range transport of air pollutants; PREMIER - (PRocess Exploration through Measurements of Infrared and millimetre-wave Emitted Radiation) Understanding the processes that link trace gases, radiation, chemistry and climate in the atmosphere; FLEX - (FLuorescence Explorer) - Observation of global photosynthesis through the measurement of fluorescence; A-SCOPE - (Advanced Space Carbon and Climate Observation of Planet Earth) - Improving the understanding of the global carbon cycle and regional carbon dioxide fluxes; CoReH2O - (Cold Regions Hydrology High-resolution Observatory) - Detailed observations of key snow, ice and water cycle characteristics.

We focused our attention on dye doped silica whose porosity allows controlling the light transport mean free path. Synthesized materials were silica monoliths prepared through sol-gel processing in the presence of a polymer that induces porosity through a spinodal phase separation. This technique allows the preparation of bulk samples with a controlled pore size varying from several microns to less than 100 nm. These samples were doped through impregnation with a naphthalimide fluorescent dye solution. Homogeneous dispersion of the dye was achieved using a silanated derivative leading to its homogeneous deposition as a thin film at the surface of the pores. This gives strongly fluorescent and diffusive materials. Optical properties of the samples were characterized using the 425.84 nm line of a dye laser. FWHM reduction of the sample emission was observed as a function of the pumping power, showing a typical behavior for a random laser in the weakly localized regime. Due to the versatility of the synthesis, the efficiency of the random lasing effect was investigated as a function of the materials microstructure.","Fluorescent dye; Naphthalimide; Porous silica; Random laser; Sol-gel","Dyes; Microstructure; Sol-gel process; Solid state devices; Fluorescent dye; Random laser; Silica",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149188142

Design/methodology/approach - Benchmarking indicators were developed inductively in four SHE areas - governance/ administration, curriculum/student opportunities, research/scholarship, and operations - via thematic content analysis of 15 descriptions of USA and Canadian universities active in SHE. Data were triangulated with data from the four Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education Campus Sustainability Leaders 2006. Findings - The assessment against selected North American peers suggests that the project is unique in its scholarly approach to and scientific foundation of sustainability in higher education. The transdisciplinary transformative case study is not replicated at any of the comparison institutions; however, elements of the approach and scholarly framework can be found at all North American universities participating in this assessment. North American institutions tend to excel in operational innovations; to keep abreast of international developments, University of Lüneburg is encouraged to commit to a climate-neutral campus strategy and to implement a sustainability management system, amongst other initiatives. Practical implications - Knowledge transfer and capacity-building: North American post-secondary institutions can learn from the theoretically-guided, applied research-based approach to SHE. Through intensified exchange (partnerships) with North American peers, the project and the University of Lüneburg stand to profit from community-based research approaches and the practice-oriented work of USA and Canadian campus sustainability offices.

However, little is known about the accumulation of C and N by sandy soils under perennial irrigated crops in semiarid regions. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of irrigated fruit orchard cultivation on the stocks of soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (N) of an Arenosol/Quartzpsament from Paraipaba-CE, Semiarid Brazil. Soil samples were taken from irrigated orchards of banana (Musa ssp.), cashew (Anacardium ocidentale), guava (Psidium guajava), bullock's heart (Annona reticulata), mango (Mangifera indica), and sapote (Manilkara zapota) in the wetted-bulb and non-irrigated area between the plant rows. Additional samples were collected from adjacent areas under secondary Caatinga forest, and under a 2-year-old deforested area. Sampling depths were: 0-0.1, 0.1-0.2, and 0.2-0.4 m. The highest contents of SOC and N were found in the surface layer. The soil bulk density did not change in depth. The stocks of SOC and total N under secondary forest at 0-0.40 m layer were 27.6 and 2.4 Mg ha-1, respectively. Caatinga Forest conversion into fruit orchard cultivation led to a decrease of 5 to 23% and 4 to 21% on SOC and N stocks, respectively. Compared to other soil uses, sapote and bullock's heart contributed for a lower decrease of SOC and N stocks after deforestation. Guava, bullock's heart, mango and sapote contributed for improving the SOC stratification index.","Caatinga forest; Soil organic matter; Soil stratification index","Anacardium; Anacardium occidentale; Annona; Annona reticulata; Casimiroa; Mangifera indica; Manilkara zapota; Musa; Psidium; Psidium guajava",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249060038

Benefits of cold in-place recycling on urban service roads include reduced consumption of new source aggregates, reduced rehabilitation costs, and significant reductions in weather exposure during construction. Additional benefits of cold in-place recycling include significant reduction in load induced damages to surrounding streets, and reduced total construction energy required to rehabilitate streets, which reduces vehicle emissions released in urban environments associated with street rehabilitation projects. This paper demonstrates the use of mechanistic-climatic laboratory characterization applied to the rehabilitation of two cold in-place recycled City of Regina streets. The City of Regina streets employed in this study were chosen as typical urban pavements requiring structural rehabilitation. This study presents the material characterization results of the composite recycled surfacing and granular base materials strengthened with an engineered blend of cement and asphalt emulsion. The mechanistic laboratory characterization was performed across the spectrum of multiaxial stress states and load frequencies typical of urban field state conditions. The a priori ground penetrating radar profiles were used to quantify the spatial quantities of in situ recyclable composite surfacing and granular materials. Based on the ground penetrating radar profiles, significant variation in recyclable granular layer thickness was identified across both pavement structures. The thickness information proved critical in the full depth recycling design process to accurately quantify the reclamation thickness, as well as material stabilization design. This research also presents the use of structural asset management performance measurements taken before and after strengthening of the Regina pilot test sites. The non-destructive falling weight deflection structural asset measurements performed in this study demonstrated a significant increase in structural asset value as a result of the full depth cement-asphalt emulsion strengthening systems employed. The field structural responses concurred with the increase in mechanistic laboratory material properties obtained in the material design phase of this project. This research also demonstrated cold in-place recycling to be similar in cost to conventional full depth remove and replace street rehabilitation systems. It is believed that the cost to perform cold in-place recycling and full depth strengthening will decrease over time as the technology becomes more reliable and more commonly deployed, whereas the costs of conventional street rehabilitation are believed to continue to increase over time. Additional holistic benefits of cold in-place recycling include reduced construction time, and therefore interruption to homeowners; reduced emissions and energy consumption; as well as recycling of in situ materials and conservation of aggregate sources in the Regina area.","Asphalt emulsion; Cold in-place recycling; Urban road stabilization","Aggregates; Asphalt; Cements; Costs; Emulsification; Energy utilization; Geological surveys; Ground penetrating radar systems; Pavements; Recycling; Stabilization; Asphalt emulsions; Cold in-place recycling; Falling weight deflections; Ground Penetrating Radar; Material characterizations; Significant deteriorations; Structural rehabilitation; Urban road; Characterization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84898474260

A second result of this field demonstration project was a significant breakthrough in the application of a mechanistic approach to engineering urban recycled pavements. To illustrate, this field application study helped engineers overcome the considerable sensitivity that road materials have to urban field state conditions. This ability to directly characterize the sensitivity that urban roads have to load rate, field stress state, and material quality as typically experienced in urban field state conditions can significantly change the structural capacity of the pavement design. These conditions are known to lead to more rapid deterioration of urban infrastructure assets, however, until now, could not be reliably quantified. In summary, the expected benefits of the in-place recycling and full depth strengthening field demonstration project in the City of Regina included the following. 1) Reduced environmental emissions to structurally rehabilitate urban streets (up to 75 percent reduction in construction vehicle emissions). 2) Reduced road user delays and residence inconvenience. 3) More sustainable and less volatile road rehabilitation costs due to reduced reliance on energy and conventional road materials. 4) Optimal reuse of in situ road materials, particularly select granular materials. 5) Reduced use of high quality non-renewable aggregate resources. 6) Reduced need for re-grading and excavation of existing roads. 7) Improved drainage within established curb lines. 8) Preservation of in-place aggregate materials due to reduced moisture infiltration from strengthened subgrades. 9) Reduced road damage resulting from concentrated aggregate haul. 10) Reshaping, drying and reuse of marginal substructure materials. 11) Improved mechanical performance of road substructure materials. 12) Improved climatic durability of road substructure materials. 13) More efficient road rehabilitation construction productivity. 14) Reduced construction risk due to poor weather. 15) An effective road strengthening system that can be used in conjunction with other road management/strengthening strategies. 16) Ability to employ modern road reclaimers that efficiently incorporate chemical and/or mechanical stabilizers that improve the performance of in situ road soils. Additional environmental benefits could be realized from the reduction in emissions resulting from the application of warm mix surfacing systems placed directly on the in-place recycled and strengthened system. Additional environmental emissions reductions that could be realized from engineered warm mix bituminous surfacing systems are estimated to add an additional 25 percent in the overall reduction in emissions related to street rehabilitation. In summary, this technology could result in a total of 75 percent reduction in emissions to rehabilitate urban streets.

The fabrication and integration cost of these devices, however, have been prohibitive and/or the devices do not allow smooth transition from the conventional design paradigm. To address some of these limitations, we have developed a new family of devices called ""Complementary Nano Electro-Mechanical Switches"" (CNEMS) using carbon nanotubes as active switching/latching elements. The basic structure of these devices consists of three co-planar carbon nanotubes arranged so that the central nanotube can touch the two side carbon nanotubes upon application of a voltage pulse between them. Owing to the unique properties of carbon nanotubes, these devices have very low leakage current, low operation voltages, and have built-in energy storage to reduce computation power, resulting in very low overall power dissipation. CNEMS have stable on-off state and latching mechanism for non-volatile memory-mode operation. Besides, the devices can be readily integrated in the same substrate as CMOS transistors with high integration densities - thus, allowing easy manufacturability and hybridization with conventional CMOS devices. In this paper, we present the properties of these devices and based on our analysis, we propose a reconfigurable computation framework using these devices. For the first time, we demonstrate that these devices are promising in dynamically reconfigurable instant-on system development with about 25X lower power dissipation. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Carbon; Computer aided design; Data storage equipment; Digital integrated circuits; Electric power utilization; Energy storage; Industrial engineering; Leakage currents; Mechanization; Nanocomposites; Nanopores; Nanostructured materials; Nanostructures; Nanotechnology; Nanotubes; Optical design; (PL) properties; Basic structures; CMOS transistors; Complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS) devices; computation power; Conventional designs; Design automation conference (DAC); Electro mechanical; Integration costs; Integration densities; Low leakage current; Manufacturability; Mode operation; nano tube; Nano-meter-scale; Non-volatile memory (NVM); operation voltages; Overall power; Power dissipations; Re Configurable Computing (RCC); Re-configurable; Smooth transition (STR); South Pacific; System development; voltage pulses; Carbon nanotubes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46649085455

The carbon black surface has been modeled with and without carbonyl groups. Part of this investigation is a decomposition of the heat capacity into its contributions from the different interaction potentials of an adsorption system. All systems show a spectrum of heat capacity versus loading, and this behavior depends on the carbonyl configuration present on the surface. For methanol and ammonia the variation of the heat capacity between the two for the same carbonyl configurations is greater than the variation in the heat of adsorption. Heat capacities of methanol and ammonia are generally dominated by fluid-fluid interactions due to the strong association of fluid particles through hydrogen bonding. The difference in the heat capacity behavior of the two fluids is an indicator of their different clustering behaviors on the carbon black surface. The presence of carbonyl groups reduces the fluid-fluid contributions to the heat capacity. This is due to the compensation of fluid-fluid interactions with fluid-functional group interactions. At 87.3 K a first layer transition to a solidlike state is present for argon and results in a large peak in the heat capacity on a bare surface. The presence of functional groups greatly reduces this peak in the heat capacity by disrupting the packing of argon on the surface and preventing a transition to a solidlike state. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.",,"Adsorption; Carbon black; Computer simulation; Hydrogen bonds; Methanol; Specific heat; Spectrum analysis; Carbonyl groups; Clustering behaviors; Fluid-functional group; Interaction potentials; Molecular dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847081206

Due to regulation enforcement, auto manufacturers are developing systems to increase the mileage and reduce emissions. Turning off the engine at traffic lights and regenerative braking systems are simple ways to reduce emissions and fuel consumption. In order to develop strong manufacturer and consumer interest, this type of operation needs to be automated such that the stop/start functionality requires no driver interaction and takes place without the intervention of the vehicle operator. Valeo Electrical Systems has developed such a system that replaces the OEM engine alternator with a starter/alternator driven by a standard multi-ribbed V belt. To avoid a break and dual voltage network, this system is based on a 12V electrical system using an Enhanced Power Supply. In 2004, this system was designed for and integrated into a 2003 GMC Envoy and is capable of starting the vehicle's engine very quickly and quietly. In order to obtain smooth, transparent start/stop operation on the road, a substantial amount of integration work with the factory PCM, engine, and transmission was accomplished. During operation, the Start/Stop system can start and stop the vehicle very quickly and is able to produce acceleration from vehicle rest that feels identical to a production factory vehicle. Baseline vehicle fuel economy was measured for the OEM configuration and after installation of the start/stop system using standard chassis dynamometer fuel economy test procedures. This testing demonstrated 5.3% improvement in the city cycle and found approximately a 4.0% improvement in the highway drive cycle due to regenerative braking. Future development of the start/stop system was done using a forward looking vehicle simulation model to determine the fuel economy impact of modifying this system to operate as a mild hybrid electric system. Using the vehicle simulation software (RAPTOR), it was determined that hybridization of the start/stop system could obtain a 10% improvement in the city cycle and a 5% improvement in the highway drive cycle, based on the applied system architecture and design. This type of system can be easily integrated into a production vehicle and could provide significant fuel economy improvements with minimal cost or affect on vehicle performance.

The results showed that oxygen could be reliably produced from CO2 at temperatures as low as 400 °C.

The CT plume extends from a grain elevator approximately 2,500 feet (760 meters) downgradient where it discharges into a small creek; the highest concentrations of CT (2,500 μg/L) are located near the source area.

Bench-scale testing was conducted using soil and groundwater collected from the study area to identify the preferred pilot test remedial technology-injection of Adventus EHC™ across the plume width near the source area to form the TZ. EHC acts through in situ chemical reduction (ISCR) and combines controlled-release, fibrous organic carbon, and microscale zero-valent iron. Following injection of EHC into the aquifer, various physical, chemical, and microbiological processes combine to create strongly reducing conditions in situ that stimulate rapid dechlorination of CT and other chlorinated solvents.

This paper briefly describes the development, field technique, strengths, and limitations of the technology and presents a summary of the remediation results for each of the pilot- and full- scale applications. The technology was conceptually identified at a Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) facility in West Virginia during 2000 and has since been applied in bench-, field pilot-, and full-scale applications at ten different sites in four states. The technology involves the subsurface injection of a refined soy methyl ester, which serves as a fatty acid electron donor supporting microbial oxygenase enzyme production. The process is performed in conjunction with air sparging to distribute the methyl ester and maintain oxidizing conditions in the remediation area. The highly biodegradable substrate in the presence of oxidizing conditions and indigenous microorganisms supports the aerobic microbial generation of enzymes which have been demonstrated to rapidly oxidize halogenated hydrocarbon molecules. Bench-scale testing was performed to refine the physical and mechanical aspects of the technique and to evaluate various products and mixtures for use as a cometabolite. A commercially available soy oil mixture was developed and used in a multi-step process that combines liquid/liquid extraction and cometabolic processes to achieve rapid and highly cost effective reduction in aquifer contaminant concentrations. Target compounds have included several common halogenated hydrocarbons such as trichloroethene, di- chloroethene, tetrachloroethene, carbon tetrachloride, and chloroform, as well as several less common hydrocarbons and fluorocarbons. In nine of the ten applications, the technology resulted in rapid, cost-effective reduction in overall halogenated groundwater constituents of concern (COC). Halogenated hydrocarbon reductions of greater than 99 percent have been achieved in individual wells and up to 98 percent reductions in average site-wide concentrations have been achieved in as little as four months. In the single unsuccessful application, high pH (>11) is believed to have precluded the establishment of adequate microorganism populations to support the cometabolic process. The process described within this paper combines several proven technologies, including air sparging, liquid/liquid extraction, and biological cometabolism. Application of the technique during the past five years at several in situ field-pilot-test and full-scale remediation sites has resulted in rapid and dramatic decreases in groundwater COC concentrations.",,"Air; Applications; Aquifers; Biodegradation; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Carbides; Carbon tetrachloride; Cost effectiveness; Drying oils; Enzymes; Esterification; Esters; Fatty acids; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Halogenation; Hydrocarbon refining; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogeology; Petroleum refining; Pollution; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Refining; Technology; Trichloroethylene; Underground reservoirs; Vegetable oils; Aerobic (CSTR); Air sparging; Bench scale; Contaminant concentrations; Electron donors; Enzyme production; high pH; Hydrocarbon molecules; In-situ; Mechanical aspects; Methyl esters; Oxygenase; Soy methyl ester (SME); Target compounds; Union Carbide (CO); United States; West Virginia; Organic compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58449122782

Most strategies and policies under consideration to counter these trends, such as fuel economy standards, target the design of vehicles or the fuels they use. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) and other donor agencies have many opportunities to assist in the implementation of sustainable transportation strategies in developing countries to reduce the risk of climate change. These opportunities include tools directly available to limit carbon emissions from the transportation sectors of developing countries, as well as indirect tools that are oriented to other goals but that provide the co-benefit of reducing GHG emissions. A new tool to address transportation and climate change in developing countries is the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), defined by the Kyoto Protocol, which recently entered into force. The CDM enables public and private entities in developed countries to invest in projects or programs in developing countries that reduce projected GHGs. Programs to reduce local air pollution, if focused on transportation systems, often reduce GHG emissions as well. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Vehicle emissions were measured using a remote sensing device (RSD). The pollutants CO, HC NO and UV smoke were sampled in the exhaust plumes of passing vehicles. Vehicle speed and acceleration were also measured and the number plate photographed. The number plate information was matched with emission measurements and then the emission data were analysed in detail. The RSD was linked to a driver feedback sign that instantaneously informed the driver about the state of their vehicle's emissions. This paper presents the preliminary results of measurements made in Brisbane, the first of the three cities monitored. The emissions of 20,000 vehicles are profiled by vehicle age, fuel type and purpose of use. The use of on-road vehicle emission measurements to validate emission factors, assess the effect of congestion and improve health impact assessments is examined. The utilisation of the data in the development and assessment of effective air pollution management strategies is discussed.

Industrialization growth combined with the increasing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere and massive deforestation are well above the values over the past several decades and are expected to further grow. Air temperature is rising rapidly well as does the weather variability producing frequent extreme events. Six of the ten warmest years occurred in the 1990s. Temperatures predicted for the 21st century ranges well above the present day value. The time period of the last 100-200 years covered by the direct meteorological observations is too short and does not provide material to reliably assess what may happen over the next hundred(s) years. A faithful prediction of the future requires understanding how climate system works, i.e. to reconstruct past climate much further in the past. Borehole paleoclimatology enables climate reconstruction of the past several millennia, unlike proxy methods provides direct past temperature assessment and can well broaden the areal range to the remote regions poorly covered with meteorological observations. Considerable debates have recently focused on the causes of the present-day warming, i.e. to distinguish between the natural and anthropogenic contribution to the observed temperature increase, eventually to quantify their regional distribution. Complex interpretation of borehole data with the proxies and additional socio-economic information can hopefully help. On observed data taken in various places all over the world we demonstrate suitable examples of the interaction between the subsurface temperature response to time changes in vegetation cover, land-use (farming) and urbanization. Precise temperature-time monitoring in shallow subsurface can further provide the magnitude of the present-day warming within relatively short time intervals. As far as we know, there exists so far no book dealing entirely with the subject of the Borehole climatology. Only relatively rarely this method is mentioned in otherwise plentiful literature on climate reconstruction or on climate modelling. There are, however, series of papers focussing on various borehole--climate related studies in numerous journals (e.g. Global and Planetary Change, Climate Change, Tectonophysics, Journal of Geophysical Research, Geophysical Research Letters, etc). Time to time a special issue appears to summarize papers on this topic presented during specialized symposia.

However, in general, reductions in all major emissions species were found, with no conclusive change in power output or fuel consumption between the different fuel blends.","Biodiesel; Bus emissions; Exhaust emissions; PM; Tallow methyl ester; Transient driving","Biodiesel; Esters; Exhaust gases; Fuel consumption; Gas emissions; Bus emissions; Tallow methyl ester; Transient driving; Bus transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44449159373

Geopolymer materials could provide a route towards this objective. The main benefit of geopolymer cement is their reduction in environmental impact as they use lesser amounts of calcium-based raw materials, have lower manufacturing temperature and use lower amounts of fuel, resulting in reduced carbon dioxide emissions for geopolymer cement manufacture by up to 80%-90%, in comparison with Portland cement. It is possible to use alkali-activated natural pozzolans to synthesize environmentally friendly and sound cementitious construction materials.

The program requires manufacturers to measure gaseous and particulate matter (PM) exhaust emissions from diesel engines using portable emission measurement systems (PEMS) installed on vehicles. In order to measure PM emissions, a cooperative contract between Sensors, Inc. and the USEPA was commenced to develop a Proportional Particulate Mass Device (PPMD). It is comprised of three key elements: a micro-proportional sampling system (MPS) incorporating an exhaust flow-meter (EFM) and an eight element quartz-crystal microbalance (QCM) to measure particulate mass. Evaluation of the exhaust flow meter (EFM) at third-party facilities have shown that the mass emission data and flow data produced with the EFM correlates extremely well with traditional (non-portable) constant volume sampling (CVS) certification systems. A single element version of the QCM has been undergoing extensive testing in both CVS systems and in an on-board MPS based system. These tests include a 760 vehicle EPA sponsored emissions study in Kansas City and an on-board 5000 mile diesel truck study. Completing the list of key components of the PPMD is the MPS, of which the first unit was delivered to EPA in pre-production form in August 2005 for testing in HDD emission certification laboratories. This unit has subsequently been tested in a Coordinating Research Council (CRC) test project (E66) at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in San Antonio, Texas and during the aforementioned 5000 mile cross country road test.

In Southern California, recent evaluation studies on HOV lanes confirm the effectiveness of HOV lanes in several ways. However, little research has been performed to evaluate the air quality benefits of HOV lanes. This paper describes a study that examines operational differences in traffic dynamics between HOV lanes and mixed-flow (MF) lanes and evaluates their impacts on vehicle emissions. Four general HOV lane scenarios were identified: underutilized, neutral, well utilized, and overutilized. Extensive driving trajectories in both lane types for each scenario were collected. Their speed profile and joint speed-acceleration frequency distribution were analyzed and compared. Vehicle emissions and fuel consumption were then estimated with a state-of-the-art modal emissions model. The results show that HOV lanes produce lower emission rates per vehicle per mile in most cases, except when they are underutilized. When normalized by average vehicle occupancy, HOV lanes produce much lower emission rates per the same amount of travel demand, on the order of 10% to 70%. In almost every case, HOV lanes produce less emissions mass on a per-lane basis than MF lanes. Southern California freeway lane performance matrices show that on a typical weekday during the summer of 2005, HOV lanes operated mostly under Scenarios 1 and 2 during peak periods. Overall, they were well utilized about 14% to 17% of the time. According to the emissions estimates, the HOV lanes are considered effective in reducing vehicle emissions.",,"Emission rates; High-occupancy vehicles; Emission control; Fuel consumption; Ground vehicles; Mathematical models; Particulate emissions; Roads and streets; Air quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39849092920

Nitrogen laser at 337 nm and light-emitting diode with maximum at 405 nm have been used as excitation sources. For investigation of formalin influence over hard tissues, an experiment was made on teeth samples. Sound teeth were demineralized with a phosphoric acid for 10 seconds to obtain enamel structure near to the tooth lesion, and were fixed in formalin. Before and after teeth treatment spectra from the areas of interest were detected. There were not observed changes in the shape of the teeth spectra, related to the introduction of formalin fluorescence. Samples from mucosa of esophagus and stomach, where initially an ALA/Protoporphyrin IX diagnosis was applied, were used as soft tissue specimens. After fluorescent diagnosis in vivo biopsy samples were obtained from normal and cancerous areas and were conserved in formalin. Initially, spectrum observed has one autofluorescence maximum from the mucous tissue at 500-600 nm and secondary maxima from the protoporphyrin fluorescence at 635 nm and 720 nm, as well as pronounced minima at 540 and 575 nm related to hemoglobin absorption. After formalin conservation hemoglobin absorption was strongly reduced that increases mucous emission signal in green-yellow spectral region. Simultaneously the maxima at 635 nm and 720 nm were reduced. As conclusion we could say that formalin has negligible influence over fluorescence spectra of conserved hard tissues and has more pronounced influence over fluorescence spectra obtained in the case of soft tissue conservation, which has to be taking into account in measurements in vitro.","Fluorescence spectroscopy; Formalin influence; Mucosa; Teeth","Absorption; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Formaldehyde; Hemoglobin; Light emitting diodes; Porphyrins; Tooth enamel; Autofluorescence; Mucosa; Teeth; Tissue",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35648952099

This sudden growth is resulting in increasing traffic congestion, fuel use, and CO2 emissions and in deteriorating air quality. This paper presents a common framework to explore scenarios of vehicle and energy use and emissions in three South Asian cities: Bangalore, India; Colombo, Sri Lanka; and Dhaka, Bangladesh. Scenarios are built by separately analyzing transportation activity (in tonne kilometers or passenger kilometers), modal structure (i.e., share of tonne kilometers or passenger kilometers occurring on each mode), modal energy intensity (in energy burned per tonne kilometer or passenger kilometer), and emission factors. Although the types of data available across cities vary widely and there are deficiencies and inconsistencies in the available data, the analysis suggests that motor vehicle use would roughly double in each city by 2020 in the business-as-usual scenario, largely because of expected income increases; fuel use and CO2 emissions would triple; and pollution loading would rise exponentially. An alternative scenario of slower vehicle and energy growth is explored, premised on substitution of personal vehicles with buses and reduction in traffic congestion. Consequently, fuel use and CO 2 emissions would only double in Bangalore and Dhaka, whereas in Colombo the increase would not be significantly lower than in the business-as-usual scenario. The cumulative carbon mitigation potential over a 15-year period would be 13% in Bangalore, 9% in Dhaka, and 2% in Colombo.

All modes of public transport available in Paris and the Ile de France region were examined: bus (with distinctions made between the types of fuel used and the commercial routes); Metro; regional express railroad, and trams. The modes of rail transport offer very competitive energy efficiency and very low GHG emissions. These emission factors would still be lower than privately-owned transport or air transport using electric power produced in another European country. The unitary emissions of buses were 10-20 times greater than those of the modes of rail transport in France because the electric power is produced using a process that does not produce emissions. However, the energy efficiency of buses is doubled if the route is on a dedicated site with priority over the other modes of road transport. By improving the traffic conditions and the fill rates for urban public transport, the energy efficiency will be improved even more.

An analysis of the greenhouse production as forming a multilevel hierarchized system is presented. Using this grid of analysis, the recent developments in the field of greenhouse control processes are examined with respect to the information, criteria and control strategies that are taken into account in the three levels of the decision process: a) physical and chemical (climate, substrate) information and criteria related to the greenhouse environment; b) physiological and biological ones, related to crop behaviour and other biotic (bio aggressors and defenders) agents which were seldom considered in the control strategies; and, c) environmental, economical and social ones, related to sustainable crop production. Our focus was on control of the recycling of the nutrient solution, integrated pest management (IPM), temperature and more generally climate integration by plants. We concentrated on global approaches dealing with different levels of the decision process and allowing for example for the simultaneous setting and control of several parameters concerning the climate and/or the fertigation and/or the sanitary state of the plants. Finally, we analysed how the recent progress in control methodologies can answer to the new constraints involved by the sustainable development criteria and we outlined new prospects.","Greenhouse; Sustainability",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61449084813

These two discoveries cast a completely new light on carbon as an element, and the international scientific community reacted immediately, with such vigour that two associated fields of research were born, which soon established their importance in the world of science, both from a fundamental standpoint and in terms of applications. To give an idea of the magnitude of the phenomenon, the subject is expanding exponentially if gauged by the number of publications: 2000 per year at present, having doubled between 1999 and 2002. This deep and long-lasting development is to a large extent due to the very special geometric characteristics of carbon nanotubes, with dimensions that are both nanometric and micrometric, leading to novel and versatile properties. For this reason, the related fields of research and applications are vast and ever more relevant to other branches of physics, chemistry and even biology. Nanotubes are thus particularly appropriate for scientific developments at the interface of these three disciplines. The aim in this chapter is to attempt to explain what fullerenes and nanotubes are, how they are synthesised and studied, what properties they have, and what the future prospects are, both in fundamental research and in applications.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892831295

We investigate this premise by examining the archaeological record of changes in hunter-gatherer economies in three geographically distinct coastal regions of tropical northern Australia. These case studies support the argument that Aboriginal mollusc exploitation reflects the altered local ecological habitats that accompanied broader coastal environmental change over the last few thousand years. Overlap between the phases and timing of climatic and behavioural changes within each region suggests that, given regional variation in the nature and of these changes, there was an associated human response to late Holocene climatic variability. These case studies establish that archaeological and environmental evidence mutually support the argument for climate change influencing cultural change in northern Australia. We suggest that, while a direct physical link between environmental change and the interpretations of significant cultural change in the archaeological record have yet to be demonstrated unambiguously in this region, the analysis of mollusc exploitation has the potential to provide the direct link that is currently missing between changes in climate, environment and human responses over the last millennium.","Arnhem land; Hunter-gatherer economies; Middens; Mollusc exploitation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-61149521135

This fuel-flexibility could allow for evolutions of the fueling supply and also allow the same engine to operate on the local fuel of choice in markets around the world. This multi-year program has already made significant technology advances by customizing the chemical process train to give a fuel processor that is small enough and powerful enough for vehicle applications. The most recent fuel processor system continues the advances with a design that is being integrated into a lab-independent fuel cell power plant. Laboratory controls components have been replaced by integrated balance of plant (BOP) components to control the flows of fuel, air, and water as well as the thermal management and cooling. The program has produced fuel processors sized for up to 70 kWe of fuel cell power output and the current system is now exploring a lower power of 10 kWe to cover a variety of possible onboard applications.

Both vehicles are 2005 model year vehicles and both are equipped with identical data acquisition systems. Ten drivers were used in testing of the vehicles on the streets and freeways of Sacramento, California and 28 separate tests were conducted. The EnergyCS Plug-in Prius is a ""blended"" mode Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) which normally operates in all-electric-mode at speeds below 34 miles per hour. The engine is programmed to turn on above 34 miles per hour as well as under heavy acceleration conditions below 34 miles per hour or during low battery conditions. Electric assist continues during all operating modes (engine off or engine on) as long as there is sufficient energy in the battery. The battery charge depleting assist range averaged approximately 40 to 45 miles for freeway driving conditions. Tests showed that the SMUD-EnergyCS Plug-in Prius averaged 98 miles per gallon for all accumulated summer driving (city, mixed and freeway). In addition, test data showed that fuel economy decreased significantly for short driving ranges less than 8 miles. The short trip fuel economy was attributed to increased engine operation to support heating of the engine/emission control system in order to meet emission targets. Fuel economy comparisons were made for cold starts and warm starts to confirm this phenomenon. Future test plans have been made to test different battery configurations that will provide comparative data for gasoline fuel economy as well as electricity use over the charge depleting range.",,"Acceleration condition; At-speed; Battery condition; Cold start; Comparative data; Data acquisition system; Driving conditions; Driving range; Electricity use; Emission targets; Engine operations; Gasoline fuels; Operating modes; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Plug-ins; Plugin hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV); Sacramento , California; Sacramento municipal utility districts; Test data; Test plan; Toyota Prius; Warm start; Digital storage; Electric drives; Electric vehicles; Exhibitions; Fuel cells; Sustainable development; Fuel economy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872024795

Here we quantify the latitudinal shift of the location of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the tropical regions during boreal summer and the change in precipitation in the northern part of the ITCZ. For both periods the shift is more pronounced over the continents and East Asia. The maritime continent is the region where the largest spread is found between models. We also clearly establish that the larger the increase in the meridional temperature gradient in the tropical Atlantic during summer at the MH, the larger the change in precipitation over West Africa. The vegetation feedback is however not as large as found in previous studies, probably due to model differences in the control simulation. Finally, we show that the feedback from snow and sea-ice at mid and high latitudes contributes for half of the cooling in the Northern Hemisphere for the LGM, with the remaining being achieved by the reduced CO2 and water vapour in the atmosphere. For the MH the snow and albedo feedbacks strengthen the spring cooling and enhance the boreal summer warming, whereas water vapour reinforces the late summer warming. These feedbacks are modest in the Southern Hemisphere. For the LGM most of the surface cooling is due to CO2 and water vapour.",,"albedo; atmosphere-ocean coupling; carbon dioxide; climate modeling; heat budget; Holocene; Last Glacial Maximum; paleoclimate; precipitation (climatology); temperature gradient; tropical region; water vapor; Africa; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250196528

The Hunter Region, on the east coast of NSW, is a major area of coal mining (mainly open-cut mines in the Upper Hunter), with scattered heavy industry (especially in Newcastle, the port city), and coal-fired power stations. The Port of Newcastle exports 85 MT of coal per year. The Hunter also has a thriving vineyards area, small-scale agriculture, and dairy and beef cattle. Research on air quality has ranged from assessment of emissions from power station plumes, to evaluation of rainwater quality, to particulate and gaseous emissions and concentrations, to sources and emissions inventories, to development of air quality management strategies. All these studies have lead to significant progress in practical air pollution management. This presentation will review examples of the research, and the benefits of partnerships for air pollution emissions control and management in the Hunter. Such partnerships can create positive communication, cooperation and compromise. Significant progress has been made in reducing sulphur dioxide in the Lower Hunter, removing it as a problem pollutant. Particulate emissions have been significantly reduced in Newcastle, although occasionally fine particulate matter causes concern. Particulate concentrations, however, have increased in the Upper Hunter associated with the expansion of open-cut activity. Increasing emissions from traffic provides the precursors for increased ozone problems in the future in Newcastle.

This personal evaluation of the planning response to climate change concludes that measures to mitigate climate change and to adapt to the urban heat island have multiple benefits in terms of amenity and the environment and basically represent what is already good planning. Flooding, coastal erosion and landsliding are now firmly within the planner's horizon. Implementation of current policy, to consider these weather-related issues as they are now and to test the sensitivity of development design against likely changes should lead to an appropriate planning response to the need to adapt to climate change. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Coastal erosion; England; Land-use planning; Landsliding; Local development; Planning systems; Policy guidance; Urban heat island; Landslides; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51949099338

Bulk samples of pure and Er-doped silica with SnO 2 nanoparticles were prepared by a sol gel technique and further thermal sintering process. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) reveals the formation of spherical nanoclusters with a size distribution strongly determined by erbium doping. Small angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments confirm and detail the TEM data evidencing the existence of a interphase region at the cluster boundaries where a SnOlike phase compensates the structural mismatch between the crystalline lattice in SnO2 nanoparticles and the amorphous silica network. The analysis of the SANS patterns show what kind of modification of the interphase morphology of SnO2 nanoparticles in silica brings to the passivation of interfacial defects. Surface states, which may preclude the exploitation of UV excitonic emission, are reduced after doping by rare earth ions. We demonstrate, by means of transmission-electron- microscopy and small-angle-neutron-scattering data, that a smooth interphase with a non negligible thickness takes the place of the fractal and discontinuous boundary observed in undoped material. The time resolved photoluminescence spectra of erbium in the infrared region show the spectral profile ascribable to ions in a ordered environment. Moreover, the absence of the broad contribution of the radiative decay of erbium ions dispersed in the silica amorphous matrix indicates that the excitation transfer follows paths enveloped in the interphase region. The spectroscopic analysis allows us to conclude that the excitation is transferred from ion to ion within a quasi-crystalline region where each site is surrounded by a different distribution of PL quenching sites which are responsible for the multi-exponential decay kinetics.","Nanostructured glasses; Rare earth doping; Small-angle neutron scattering; TEM; Time resolved spectroscopy","Doping (additives); Light emission; Neutron scattering; Optical glass; Rare earth elements; Silica; Transmission electron microscopy; Nanostructured glasses; Rare earth doping; Time resolved spectroscopy; Nanostructured materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36249023132

Unfortunately, for organizations attempting to use these systems there is a lack of proven tools to help them understand if they are on track to achieving such goals. To resolve this dilemma, two organizations have embarked on developing a national green building standard. At the heart of both of these proposed standards are energy sections that will use CO 2 as the basis for their respective calculations. The paper will review how both CO 2 calculation protocols evolved and how they both will operate in practice. The paper will conclude with an example of how a building would actually use both of these protocols. In particular, an example will be generated to illustrate how a building using a non-renewable fuel will compare with the same building using renewable energy. Results will suggest that renewables will be critical in any attempt to achieve carbon-neutral buildings. Thus CO 2 calculation protocols will become an important new tool for promoting renewable energy technologies and one that needs to be understood by the renewable energy community.",,"Calculation protocols; Carbon emissions; Green buildings; Non-renewable fuels; Renewable energies; Renewable energy community; Renewable energy technologies; Renewables; Building codes; Buildings; Commerce; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Marketing; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857076458

The system consists of a wetland pretreatment followed by the four cells connected in a serpentine manner. The mining impacted water flows from the wetland through each cell before discharge. Sulfate reducing bioreactors mitigate acidity and metal contamination through the microbial production of sulfide. The produced biogenic sulfide precipitates metals, and the microbial process of reducing sulfate to sulfide produces alkalinity. The health of the entire microbial community present in such systems is important for remediation to be effective. Classes of microbes generally present in such systems include fermenters, methanogens and sulfate reducers. The health can be measured in terms of active microbial populations and positive interactions between populations for the support of sulfate reduction. The goal of this research is to measure the activity of each class utilizing analyses that quantify the groups by their function, as opposed to the traditional molecular techniques of identifying bacteria. Gas chromatography, HPLC- DAD, and ICP-AES are used to identify and quantify the end products of metabolism. The microbial activity can then be characterized and changes can be monitored over time. Results from 2005 sampling of Cell 3 within the system indicate that the activity of sulfate reducing bacteria is much higher than the numbers present would indicate. These results combined with those from 2006 sampling indicate that methanogenesis is a minor process within this cell. The calculation of the stoichiometry of carbon utilization by SRB is much higher than what would be predicted from known stoichiometric ratios of carbon used per sulfate reduced.","Acid mine drainage; Microbial populations; Stoichiometry","Acid mine drainage; Bioreactor system; Carbon utilization; End-products; ICP-AES; Metal contamination; Methanogenesis; Microbial activities; Microbial communities; Microbial populations; Microbial process; Microbial production; Mining district; Molecular techniques; Positive interaction; Pre-Treatment; Stoichiometric ratio; Sulfate reducing; Sulfate reducing bacteria; Sulfate reduction; Sulfate-reducer; Superfund sites; Treatment systems; Water flows; Atomic emission spectroscopy; Bacteria; Bioreactors; Carbon; Cells; Cytology; Gas chromatography; Reclamation; Serpentine; Stoichiometry; Wetlands; Sulfur compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865355404

In flow cytometry, investigators achieve greater multiplexing of cellular markers by using tandem fluors, long-wavelength organic dyes coupled to fluorescent donor proteins, R-phycoerythrin (RPE) or allophycocyanin (APC), to enable far red emission using 488 and 635 nm laser excitation. Tandem fluors suffer from poor stability, batch variability, and donor dye spectral bleed-through. Qdot nanocrystals have long effective Stokes shifts and relatively narrow emission peaks. Even with sub-optimal excitation at 488 and 635 nm, they provide better population resolution than is achieved with most tandem fluors. For example, Qdot 705 and Qdot 800 secondary antibody reagents allow more effective resolution of CD4-positive populations in human blood than RPE and APC tandem fluors in far red emission regions. No emission is observed in the tandem fluor donor dye region, but fluorescence in the target emission region is observed with excitation off every laser. Nanocrystal reagents resolve tandem fluor issues with stability and donor bleed-through, but require cross-laser correction. Qdot nanocrystals can be used in place of tandem fluors in antibody staining, allowing detection of more targets over the same spectral range.","Flow cytometry; Nanocrystal; Quantum dot; Tandem dye","Flow cytometry; Fluorescence; Light sources; Multiplexing; Nanocrystals; Photoexcitation; Cellular markers; Fluorescent labels; Tandem dye; Wavelength excitation; Semiconductor quantum dots",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547993575

Part of the development of the CAMR involved simulations of atmospheric mercury emission, transport and deposition across a large part of North America using a special version of the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to assess the expected decrease in mercury deposition from various emission control options. CMAQ model simulations of a 2001 base case and a 2020 case with full implementation of the CAMR and the separate Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) showed that mercury emissions from EGUs are expected to decrease by 48% by 2020. Emission reductions of 68% were shown for reactive gaseous mercury, the form of mercury most readily deposited from the atmosphere. Simulated wet deposition of atmospheric mercury for 2001 was compared to observations from the Mercury Deposition Network (MDN). The CMAQ modeling was able to resolve about 60% of the observed site-to-site variance. The modeling also showed that the reduction in mercury deposition expected by 2020 from the CAIR and CAMR is similar to that which would have been obtained by completely eliminating mercury emissions from EGUs in the U.S. in 2001. Most of the emission reductions from the CAMR are in the form of elemental mercury. The CMAQ modeling showed nearly all of these emissions were exported from the modeling domain. Thus, it is expected that the CAMR will result in a reduction of the transport of mercury to other parts of the world. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Solar thermal absorption cooling systems use chillers powered by solar energy rather than natural gas or electricity. The following factors may position solar thermal absorption cooling systems as a competitive alternative to conventional electric or naturalgas-driven air conditioning: Recent technology advances have occurred in concentrating solar thermal direct flow vacuum tube-type collectors. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 includes a non-capped 30% investment tax credit for solar thermal cooling systems on commercial buildings. Natural gas retail prices are near record highs, increasing peak electricity rates. Use of renewable energy powered cooling systems can lead to lower electric demand and reduced power plant emissions. Initial assessment results show that solar thermal cooling systems are feasible in areas with a confluence of high solar insolation, high cooling demand, and high electric rates, achieving payback of less than 8 years in typical five-story buildings.

Incandescent lightbulbs convert a mere 5% of the supplied power into light (most of the rest emerging as heat) whereas the more efficient fluorescent bulbs achieve about 20% efficiency. Improving the efficiency of these light sources is difficult since in all cases the emission of light is essentially a byproduct of an energetic excitation process. In contrast, solid state lighting utilizes materials which directly convert electrical energy to light with little production of heat and therefore have the potential for far higher efficiency, with over 70% demonstrated in the infrared. New materials based on direct bandgap semiconductors and organic light emitters may permit this level of efficiency for general lighting. In both cases, however, understanding the nanoscale structure of the material is critical to achieving high efficiency. This is particularly evident in the case of organic molecular compounds, where weak inter-molecular interactions can permit the photophysical properties of a solid to be tuned by changing the chemical structure of the molecular building block.","Lighting; Molecular; Organic; Solid state","Electricity; Energy gap; Incandescent lamps; Molecular interactions; Artificial lighting; Organic light emitters; Organic molecular compounds; Photophysical properties; Solid state lighting; Light sources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547992539

Transportation-related energy use and resulting GHG emissions pose looming threats to economic growth, global environment, public health, and overall quality of life. To reduce GHG emissions from the entire transport sector broader changes are needed. Transportation growth is not limited to the Asia Pacific region. It is a significant component of growth in energy demand in virtually all rapidly developing economies. Meeting the expected growth in travel and therefore energy requires accelerated gains in vehicle efficiency, provision of timely and adequate alternative transportation services, increase in the diversity of the transportation energy mix, and integration in transport services to meet mobility and access needs through a seamless and efficient intermodal transportation network. If supply or demand challenges are not met, economic growth is compromised. The transportation sector must accept its proportionate responsibility in addressing this threat.

A simple strategy is proposed in which, by using only-odd or only-even switching states, it is possible to reduce the common mode voltage variations to a single pulse per switching period. Moreover, with the introduction of a special notch in the gate signals, such a pulse can be partially or totally erased by obtaining no common mode currents in the drive.

The European Commission opted for the aircraft operator in their proposal for a Directive. A major drawback is that non-EU aircraft operators might legally challenge their inclusion in this scheme and, if the challenge was successful, discrimination between EU and non- EU operators would undermine the scheme. An alternative would be to place an obligation on fuel suppliers to prove possession of allowances, thus avoiding discrimination. However, emissions trading can be evaded to some extent by increased refuelling beyond EU boundaries (tankering). Typical city pairs were used to analyse the conditions under which such tankering strategies are economically attractive. The analysis shows that the attractiveness of tankering depends substantially on the relationship between fuel prices and allowance prices. If the price relation as of March 2006 is taken as a basis, tankering would be attractive within a radius of up to 4,000 km especially on southbound and eastward routes. Emissions trading could, under unfavourable conditions, be evaded for up to 20% of the total fuel consumption in aviation with the help of tankering. Although this value is only a theoretical upper limit, more than 10% of fuel consumption could be affected by tankering. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Aviation; Climate change; Emissions trading; Evasion strategies; Fuel penalty; Regulation; Tankering","airline industry; emissions trading; European Commission; European Union; fuel consumption; pollution policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37349095229

When a single step is missed, the lining installation will suffer significantly. Development of a usable quality control standard for material selection, design, installation, and inspection are critical for a successful installation. Work in this area began in the 1980's with studies conducted by the University of California San Diego for the Department of California Transportation (Cal Trans) for the purpose of retrofitting highway bridge columns. The technology moved to the general building industry following the guidelines of ACI 440. During the mid 1990's this technology entered the pipeline industry for the retrofit of Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe (PCCP) with broken wires. Initially, a quality control standard directly related to this application was unavailable. Initial methods drew from the column wrapping methods developed by Cal Trans, ICC and those outlined in ICC (International Code Council) AC 125. However, as this application became more popular both the Fyfe and Fibrwrap Construction companies made large advancements in materials, application, and quality control methods. In the year 2000, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, MWD, took a serious interest in carbon fiber liners for the retrofit of its 163 miles of PCCP and implemented a testing and review program for CFRP (carbon fiber reinforced polymer). Presented in the paper are the most recent methods developed for the safe and reliable installation of carbon fiber liners. Discussion of mobilization concerns, materal requirements and related verification testing, critical paths for installation, and inspection methods for both during and post installation are provided. A case history is discussed outlining program considerations for both owners and contractors. Discussion is also provided outlining the pitfalls owners should avoid in order to obtain an installation within their predetermined shutdown window. Areas of discussion are: access, dewatering planning, permitting, design coordination, mobilization, contract requirements, and field support. © 2007 ASCE.",,"Dewatering planning; Post installation; Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe (PCCP); Shutdown window; Bridge components; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Installation; Pipelines; Quality control; Carbon fibers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36349030779

Even more critical pollution contexts are ports placed near towns. Board electric generation has a high incidence on port emissions because of ship engines significance and, above all, because of the lack of limits to ship emissions values. The present study is pertaining to a real life case: the area of Civitavecchia whose port is situated inside the urban conglomeration. Ship classes of the port of Civitavecchia are cruise, container and ferry boats. Cruise ships traffic has increased so much that from year 2006 Civitavecchia has become the first cruise port of call in Europe. Besides container ships traffic increasing is foreseen in the port evolution ambit. The present work focuses on in-port emissions generated by vessels during hotelling time. While in port, ships use their Auxiliary Engines (AEs) to produce electricity for hotelling, unloading and loading activities. This means several hours of auxiliary engine running at berth for these vessels. One measure to reduce emissions while at berth is to feed energy to ships utilities from the national grid instead of from ship AEs. To do that a shore-side electricity supply system is required. These supply way have lower emission factors per kWhei, either due to the energy sources mixing (e.g. wind, hydro, nuclear, etc) and to the stringent emission controls imposed on land based power plants. In the present work emissions assessment and shore side specifications and measurement pertaining port of Civitavecchia are described.","Electricity; Emissions; Energy; NOx; PM10; Pollutant; Port; Ships; Shore-side; SO2","Auxiliary equipment; Containers; Electric power transmission networks; Electricity; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Engines; Environmental impact; Ferry boats; Particulate emissions; Pollution; Sulfur dioxide; Unloading; Energy; Pollutant; Port; Shore-side; SO2; Ships",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930983338

WTP has an existing, comprehensive Environmental Improvement Plan in place, which includes an ongoing focus on odour management in the context of a recently completed significant program of upgrade works that have resulted in an estimated reduction in odour emissions from the WTP site of about 90%. In this context, the purpose of the odour risk management project was to assess any ongoing residual odour impact risks for the plant and to identify any further odour mitigation approaches that may be available to appropriately manage this risk if required. Due to the scale and the unique nature of the facility, changes in odour emissions from any of the various sources may have a significant effect on off site odours, and reliably assessing the varying impact of these sources is much more complex than for other WWTPs. For these reasons, the data collection and assessment phase of the project was more comprehensive than would normally be undertaken for an odour impact assessment, and integrated some unique and interesting new tools. There were concerns that causality effects in AUSPLUME could result in overly conservative predictions. Therefore, the investigation also assessed the available odour dispersion models, (AUSPLUME, CALPUFF and TAPM) and their appropriateness for assessing odour impacts from this unusually large site. In particular, the predictions of AUSPLUME were compared to the predictions of CALPUFF, community surveys and field olfactometry data to ascertain the relative accuracy of each model. This paper will present the results of this investigation, including some interesting findings about the relationships between odour strength, perception (how humans interpret odour strength) and odour annoyance in the community.","AUSPLUME; Community survey; Nasal Ranger; Odour; Odour modelling; Odour risk management; Odour sampling; Western Treatment Plant","Community survey; Odor sampling; Odour risk management; Western Treatment Plant; Environmental impact; Odor control; Particulate emissions; Sewage; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Risk management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053171145

Thus, it is increasingly being suggested that CO2 capture will be a requirement for continued use of coal for electricity generation in coming decades. For example, within Europe, it has been proposed that CO2 capture could be mandatory for all new coal-fired power plants from 2020 (Commission of the European Communities, 2007). A number of site-specific considerations can be expected to shape technology choice and other decisions related to investments in new coal-fired power plant. These include restrictions in the coal available at reasonable cost, local environmental legislation and the electricity market that the plant would operate in. This paper outlines some considerations for investors, utilities and possibly regulators when identifying sites and making technology choices for new coal-fired plants which are expected to use CO2 capture, either from the outset or following later retrofit (i.e. the initial plant would be capture-ready). It identifies some extra factors in selecting appropriate sites, when compared to plants built without CO2 capture considerations, and outlines some potential 'show-stoppers'. For example, CO2 capture plants must be sited in locations which allow CO 2 to be transported to safe geological storage (or other use). These new factors must ultimately feed into investment decisions. An initial discussion of approaches which could be used by investors and other stakeholders to compare specific technology options is included here. It is important that methods that allow investors and legislators to make informed choices, taking into account site-specific factors which are often neglected in general comparisons of technology, are identified and developed. The qualitative discussion in this paper is intended to inform the quantitative analyses that will be used by project developers in the next few years to select power plant technology options for capture-ready plants and for plants built from the outset with full-scale CO2 capture as part of integrated carbon capture and storage schemes.",,"Carbon capture and storage; Coal-fired power plant; Dangerous climate changes; Electricity generation; Environmental legislations; Geological storage; Investment decisions; Power plant technology; Carbon capture; Climate change; Coal; Coal fueled furnaces; Fire tube boilers; Fossil fuel power plants; Investments; Mining; Technology; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877641983

The object of the current study is to characterize the pre-ignition formation of the fuel plume in the vicinity of the PSC spark plug, using a complementary experimental and numerical approach. Visualization of the PSC plume was conducted using Schlieren motion photography in a constant volume pressure chamber at various injection pressures and signal durations. Inlet conditions were determined with 1-D and 2-D numerical models derived from experimental conditions. Subsequently, the 3-D numerical study was carried out with FLUENT using the SST k-ω turbulence model. It was found that the simulation results were adequate in representing the experimental data in terms of injection angle and jet penetration. As local fuel concentration of the spark region is vital to the stability of the combustion event, the result of this study will be instrumental in predicting the combustion quality under the PSC regime, leading to an optimized PSC system designs.

In particular, a 6-cylinder medium duty compression-ignition engine burning number 2 diesel fuel, a single-cylinder spark-ignition engine fueled by isooctane, and a local utility power plant burning coal/woodchip mixtures are considered. Direct sampling methods are employed to extract particulates from the exhaust plumes onto microscope grids without any sample preparations or manipulations. The samples are then analyzed with high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and electron diffraction method. Physical sizes and morphologies, chemical compositions, crystalline properties, and fine internal structures are determined and compared. The present experimental findings provide scientific guidance for the identification of particulate source in heavily polluted areas and for the improvement of emission reduction strategies.",,"Coal combustion; Diesel engines; Emission control; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Power plants; Compression ignition engine; Crystalline properties; Emission reduction strategy; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Fine particulate matter; Physical characteristics; Single-cylinder spark-ignition; Sub-micron particulates; Particles (particulate matter)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943578584

Conical flames were anchored on a disk shaped bluff-body that was attached to a center pod in the nozzle. The combustible propane-air mixture flowed through a converging axisymmetric nozzle with a concentric insert allowing radial mixture variation by tailoring the composition in the inner and outer nozzles. The radial mixture profiles were characterized above the location of the flame holder by laser Rayleigh light scattering. Additionally, a loudspeaker at the nozzle base allowed introduction of periodic velocity oscillations with an amplitude of 9 % of the mean flow velocity up to a frequency of 350 Hz. Blow-off points were experimentally determined by decreasing the inner and outer flow equivalence ratios by means of continuously lowering the fuel flow rates and determining the flame detachment point from the flame holder. Flame detachment was detected by a rapid reduction of CH∗ emission from the flame base imaged by a photomultiplier detector. It was found that flame blow-off is preceded by progressive narrowing of the flame cone for the case of higher inner jet equivalence ratios. In this case, the fuel lean outer flow is not combusted and clearly this is not a good way of operating a combustor. Nevertheless, the overall blow-off equivalence ratio is reduced by inner jet fuel enrichment based on the mean value of inner equivalence ratio gradient. However, this is found to be an artifact of the fuel distribution in the inner stream which has a significantly higher local value. On the other hand, fuel enrichment in the outer flow was found to have no effect on the blow-off as compared to the case of uniform mixture. These results were typical for the whole range of mean flow velocities and upstream excitation frequencies.",,"Electron beams; Flow velocity; Fuels; Light scattering; Mixtures; Nozzles; Velocity; Axisymmetric nozzles; Bluff-body stabilized; Equivalence ratio gradient; Excitation frequency; Mean flow velocities; Photomultiplier detectors; Rayleigh light scatterings; Velocity oscillations; Combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943564420

More attention was paid to its combustion characteristics, the effects of ethanol on particulate matter (PM) components, SOF (soluble organic fraction), DS (dry soot), and sulfate mass, using different fuel blends in the engine. To understand the effect of ethanol blended diesel fuels on combustion processes and soot formation, images of combustion processes were recorded using a high-speed CCD camera. The results show that with increasing ethanol in the blended fuel, both smoke and PM can be reduced, but the PM decrease is not as efficient as the smoke decrease. The smoke and PM behave differently even for one kind of fuel blend, and it is unreasonable to evaluate the PM emission by the smoke. In addition, under the same condition, increasing ethanol in the fuel blend, the DS emission in PM is reduced significantly, the sulfate emission hardly changes, and the SOF emission in PM is not reduced as expected. The results also indicate that addition of ethanol to diesel fuels the ignition is prolonged, maximum heat release ratio and peak pressure increase, and combustion duration is shortened. In addition, the flame luminosity in the combustion is decreased using blended fuels, which indicates that soot formation in fuel-rich regions is suppressed by the ethanol. © 2006 The Combustion Institute.

The pilot study was conducted to support the design and construction of a new treatment plant for the Turlock Irrigation District, an irrigation and power company in California. It was anticipated that pre-ozone in conjunction with alum would increase iron, manganese, color, turbidity, and organic carbon removal and improve membrane performance compared to coagulant addition alone. As a result of improved organic carbon removal, it was anticipated that a decrease in disinfection by-product (DBP) formation would be observed. Results from the pilot evaluation, however, showed that although iron, manganese, and turbidity levels were significantly decreased through membrane filtration, the reduction was consistent with and without pre-ozone. Increased reduction in the UV254 and total organic carbon (TOC) concentrations was observed in conjunction with a decrease in the total trihalomethane (THM) and haloacetic acid (HAA) formation for pre-ozone and alum addition compared to membrane treatment alone or with post-ozone treatment. Oxidation with ozone resulted in a reduction in organic carbon, a DBP precursor, and the chlorine dose necessary to provide adequate disinfection residual. Combined, these two factors reduced the total THM and HAA formed during 7-day simulated distribution system (SDS) evaluations. Impact of preozone on membrane system performance was membrane system dependent. Pretreatment with pre-ozone and alum combined and alum only were found to enhance membrane performance by significantly decreasing the rate of membrane fouling for one system, to increase the fouling rate for another membrane system, and to result in similar fouling for the third system as observed without chemical addition. Issues with solids carryover due to poor sludge drainage was likely the cause of some of the membrane fouling for one of the membrane systems. However, one membrane system did not appear to be impacted by the solids carryover and continued to show improved membrane performance during this period. Based on these piloting results, the recommended treatment train for the new water treatment plant for Turlock Irrigation District includes pre-ozone, alum coagulation, flocculation, plate settlers, microfiltration membranes, and post-chlorination. © 2007 American Water Works Association.",,"Advanced oxidation; Alum coagulation; California; Chemical addition; Chlorine dose; DBP precursors; Design and construction; Disinfection byproducts; Disinfection residuals; Fouling rate; Haloacetic acids; Irrigation districts; Membrane filtrations; Membrane performance; Membrane system; Membrane system performance; Micro-filtration membranes; Pilot scale; Pilot scale evaluation; Pilot studies; Power company; Pre-ozonation; Pre-Treatment; Simulated distribution systems; Total Organic Carbon; Treatment plants; Trihalomethanes; Tuolumne River; Chlorine; Coagulation; Disinfection; Electric utilities; Exhibitions; Flocculation; Irrigation; Manganese; Membrane fouling; Membranes; Microfiltration; Organic carbon; Ozone; Ozonization; Turbidity; Water filtration; Water quality; Chemical water treatment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871584416

Since then Beijing, Shanghai and other big cities have built a few MSW incineration plants. MSW incineration has gradually been used in some cities of China due to its advantages such as significant volume reduction (about 90%), mass reduction (about 70%), and toxicity reduction of the waste and energy recovery. However, MSW incineration is sometimes considered to the general public as the secondary pollution source, because of concerns about is toxic combustion byproducts (TCBs). Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) are the most toxic compounds among the TCBs. In this paper, PCDD/Fs in flue gas produced from a MSW incinerator were isokinetically withdrawn and collected in a multi component sampling train. Then the PCDD/Fs samples were extracted, concentrated and cleaned up step by step.

The total annual distance driven by approximately 4,677,000 visitors to the 26 HWRCs in Hampshire, United Kingdom, is estimated to be 40 million kilometers (assuming that 60% of visitors made dedicated trips), costing approximately £14 million (£1 - $1,896 in April 2005 U.S. dollars) in private transport and emitting approximately 1,873 tonnes of CO2 (as carbon) into the atmosphere. Providing a network of 104 bring sites capable of accepting green waste, in addition to the existing facilities provided by the 26 HWRCs, could save approximately 8.5 million kilometers (21%) of vehicle travel per annum (£3 million in visitor transport costs and approximately 369 tonnes of CO 2 as carbon). Such a scheme would require a fleet of approximately 78 refuse collection vehicles at an annual cost to the scheme provider of slightly more than £1.5 million. If HWRCs become a major channel for the return and reprocessing of waste electrical and electronic equipment and some newly classified hazardous waste items, space at existing sites could become an issue.

However, the environments at road side monitoring stations in urban areas still exceed regulation limits and some counter measures are required. To improve these situations, the mechanism of atmospheric dispersion must be clarified and modeled together with the emission of pollutants by automotive sources. The simulation models should be easily changed the surrounding building conditions and also meteorological conditions. Simulation models must be easily adaptable to account for different characteristics of surrounding building and meteorological conditions. In these respects, numerical simulation models are superior to wind tunnel experiments or the other tools. In this study, tracer gas diffusion in a real urban street canyon in Tokyo was simulated by the computer program FLUENT. The objective street canyon is about 400metres long, 33 metres wide and is surrounded by buildings of six to ten floors in height. We constructed the geometrical model of the target area of about 400 by 600metres and set it in the center of a multilateral column of sixteen faces with a radius of 1250 metres and 1000metres high. The wind enters from four neighboring faces and by this construction we can easily change the inflow wind direction.

In particular, cogeneration technologies enable enhanced energy efficiency and thus CO2 emission saving with respect to the conventional separate production of heat and electricity. However, the distributed cogeneration production could dramatically worsen the air quality on a local level, due to emissions of various hazardous pollutants such as NO 2, CO, and so on. In addition, in urban areas the air quality regulation could be quite stringent, thus calling for a thorough environmental impact assessment at the planning stage. In this paper, the emission characteristics of distributed cogeneration are evaluated with respect to the conventional separate production of heat and electricity on the global and local levels through the emission balance approach. The analysis is carried out with reference to small-scale (below 1 MW2) distributed generation technologies available on the market, such as microturbines and internal combustion engines. In particular, after evaluating the emission break-even conditions for equivalence between distributed and centralized generation, it is shown how the specific results may depend upon the plant operation characteristics (at partial load) and upon the reference values for emission assessment. These aspects could be particularly relevant for energy policy formulations. ©2007 IEEE.","Air pollutants; Cogeneration; Distributed generation; Environmental impact; Local and global emissions","Efficiency; Energy efficiency; Regional planning; Air pollutants; Cogeneration; Distributed generation; Local and global emissions; Environmental impact",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50849093873

A consumer model for selecting vehicles, which was established in the previous report, was calibrated with statistical data from each of the countries. The results of the analysis shows that England has the highest potential for reducing CO2 emissions among these countries, but that this is still insufficient to accomplish the Kyoto protocol requirements. Market shares of low emission vehicles are similar in Japan and England, and hybrid cars appear to be able to reach a substantial shares in 10 years, while the share of fuel cell powered cars will be very small.

The design capacity of the stoker-type incinerator pilot-plant was 150 kg/h. Combustion chamber temperatures, as well as the stack gas concentrations, i.e., NOx and CO, and the residual oxygen were measured. The maximum ratio of organic sludge waste to total waste input was 30%. Oxygen-enriched air, 22% oxygen, was used for stable combustion. As the co-incineration ratio of the sludge increased, the primary and secondary combustion chamber temperatures were decreased to 900 and 750°C, respectively, approximately 100°C below the proper incineration temperatures (primary: 1,000°C, secondary: 850°C). However, if the supplied air was enriched with 22% oxygen content, the incinerator temperature was high enough to burn the waste mixture containing 30% sludge, with an estimated heating value of 1,600 kcal/kg. There are two main benefits of using oxygen enrichment in the co-incineration; first, the sensible heat can be reduced as the quantity of nitrogen in the flue gas will be decreased. However, this has been shown to not be significant, based on the results from computer simulation, including a heat balance calculation. Secondly, the unburned carbon formation is reduced due to the oxygen-enriched burning of the waste, despite an increase in the sludge co-incineration ratio.","Co-incineration; Municipal solid waste; Oxygen-enriched; Sludge waste","Chamber temperature; Co-incineration; Design capacity; Effect of oxygen; Heat balance; Heating value; Incineration temperature; Maximum ratio; Municipal Solid Waste; Organic sludge; Oxygen content; Oxygen enrichment; Oxygen-enriched; Oxygen-enriched air; Pilot plant experiments; Residual oxygen; Secondary combustion chamber; Sensible heat; Sludge waste; Stack gas; Unburned carbons; Waste mixtures; Combustion chambers; Computer simulation; Experiments; Flue gases; Heat treatment; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Pilot plants; Refuse incinerators; Sewage; Solid wastes; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Waste incineration",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956973155

The emissions targets for this project are to demonstrate US 2010 emissions standards on the 13-mode steady state test. To meet this goal, a chemically correct combustion (stoichiometric) natural gas engine with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and a three way catalyst (TWC) was developed. In addition, a Sturman Industries, Inc. camless Hydraulic Valve Actuation (HVA) system was used to improve efficiency. A Volvo 11 liter diesel engine was converted to operate as a stoichiometric natural gas engine. Operating a natural gas engine with stoichiometric combustion allows for the effective use of a TWC, which can simultaneously oxidize hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide and reduce NOx. High conversion efficiencies are possible through proper control of air-fuel ratio. Adding EGR lowers combustion chamber temperatures, which can improve efficiency, reduce the tendency to knock and lower engine out NOx emissions. A camless HVA system by Sturman Industries was applied to the engine. Using the HVA system can reduce pumping losses at light loads through either an early intake valve closing or a late intake valve closing (Miller cycle). The HVA system can also enable the use of high compression ratio pistons, where a lower effective compression ratio can be used at the high loads through either an early or a late intake valve closing, and higher compression ratios can be used at light to medium loads. Pistons with a 14.3:1 compression ratio were used on this engine. Emission tests were run at the 13-mode steady state test points and at three additional points (15% load at the low, intermediate, and high engine speeds). The results show a weighted 13-mode NOx emission level of 0.005 g/kW-hr, which easily meets the NOx emissions target of 0.27 g/kW-hr (0.2 g/bhp-hr). The high compression ratio pistons and variable valve timing available from the HVA system improved efficiency by 6.1% over a fixed valve timing cam based system using the weighted 13-mode results. Further efficiency improvements may be possible through reduced losses of the HVA system and through improvement in light load combustion by using the HVA system to increase in-cylinder motion (swirl).

The DOC(Diesel Oxidation Catalyst) and DPF(Diesel Particulate Filter) have been used to reduce the emissions of diesel vehicles. The DOC can oxides HC, CO and SOF(Soluble Organic Fraction) in the PM emissions, and the DPFs can filter the most of solid PM, such as carbon particles. As the DPFs, wall flow type ceramic honeycomb filters have been commonly used and now being still advanced. However, the cost and durability of the currently used DPFs are not perfect yet. Metal foam is the one of promising materials for the DPFs due to its cost effectiveness, good thermal conductivity and high mechanical strength. The metal foam can be produced with various pore sizes and strut thickness and finally can be coated with catalytic wash-coats with low cost. A number of foam filters of different pore size and filtering volume are tested in an engine bench and this paper shows the filtration and pressure drop characteristics of the metal foam filters.

Particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NO x) emitted from a large locomotive engine (2-cycle, 16-cylinder, and 3,000-horsepower) under various engine-rating conditions was analyzed with a scanning mobility particle sizer and a gas stack sampler by using a dilution tunnel. The maximum concentrations of PM and NO x were measured to be 505.0 mg/m 3 and 1,822 ppm, respectively. The hourly emissions of these pollutants were calculated to be 9.3 kg and 105.4 kg, respectively. By dividing these values by the power (3,000 horsepower in our study) of the engine, we could gain the emission values of 2.1 g/horsepower-hour for PM and 42.7 g/horsepower-hour for NO x. Based on these values, we proposed the emission reduction goal of the railroad diesel locomotive.","Diesel locomotive engine; Emission reduction goal; Nitrogen oxide; Particulate matter","Diesel locomotive engine; Emission reduction goal; Horsepower; Air pollution; Concentration (process); Diesel engines; Environmental protection; Locomotives; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Emission control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868401321

Downscaled climate scenarios (ensembles) were used as forcings to the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrology model, which in turn forced the Colorado River Reservoir Model (CRMM). Ensembles of downscaled precipitation and temperature, and derived streamflows and reservoir system performance were assessed through comparison with current climate simulations for the 1950-1999 historical period. For each of the 11 GCMs, two emissions scenarios (1PCC SRES A2 and B1, corresponding to relatively unconstrained growth in emissions, and elimination of global emissions increases by 2100) were represented. Results for the A2 and B1 climate scenarios were divided into three periods: 2010-2039, 2040-2069, and 2070-2099. The mean temperature change averaged over the 11 ensembles for the Colorado basin for the A2 emission scenario ranged from 1.2 to 4.4°C for periods 1-3, and for the B1 scenario from 1.3 to 2.7°C. Precipitation changes were modest, with ensemble mean changes ranging from -1 to -2% for the A2 scenario, and from +1 to -1% for the B1 scenario. An analysis of seasonal precipitation patterns showed that most GCMs had modest reductions in summer precipitation and increases in winter precipitation. Derived April 1 snow water equivalent declined for all ensemble members and time periods, with maximum (ensemble mean) reductions of 38% for the A2 scenario in period 3. Runoff changes were mostly the result of a dominance of increased evapotranspiration over the seasonal precipitation shifts, with ensemble mean runoff changes of -1, -6, and -11% for the A2 ensembles, and 0, -7, and -8% for the Bl ensembles. These hydrological changes were reflected in reservoir system performance. Average total basin reservoir storage and average hydropower production generally declined, however there was a large range across the ensembles. Releases from Glen Canyon Dam to the Lower Basin were reduced for all periods and both emissions scenarios in the ensemble mean. The fraction of years in which shortages occurred increased by approximately 20% by period 3 for both emissions scenarios.",,"climate change; environmental impact assessment; evapotranspiration; general circulation model; hydrological change; hydrological modeling; rainfall-runoff modeling; streamflow; water resource; Arizona; Colorado Basin; Glen Canyon Dam; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547330128

As a consequence, the global greenhouse gas emissions should be cut by 15 to 50 by 2050. However, eventually every Member State has to be given a specific emission reduction target. Since carbon emissions have a cost, a protectionist reflex in burden sharing negotiations can be expected. Therefore, as with Triptych in 1997, a scientific model-based proposition will probably be generated, prior to political discussions. To be acceptable, this model must be transparent. A crucial aspect is how to deal with local conditions: Are degree-days to be incorporated? Should countries be compensated for phasing out nuclear energy? A case study was carried out applying the Triptych model to the situation in Flanders. The Triptych approach is a sector specific approach distinguishing three groups of economic sectors: the energy-intensive industry, the power-producing industry and the domestic sectors. Two variants of the model were used: an improved version of the original European model and a global version. In the former, specific CO2 emissions from the energy-intensive industry are expected to be reduced by 1.5 per year. In the power-producing sector the energy efficiency is improved by 1 each year. The domestic sectors take into account convergence of 1990 per capita emission levels to equal per capita allowances in 2030. In the Global Triptych approach, convergence is applied to all three sectors. The outcome of the model was compared to projected energy use in Flanders until 2020. The comparison shows a gap between the results of the Triptych exercise and what may be expected in a business-as-usual scenario.","Burden sharing; Climate change; Emission projections; Triptych model","climate change; comparative study; convergence; emission control; energy efficiency; energy use; European Union; greenhouse gas; nuclear power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849200330

However, at its heart there is a potent oxidation catalyst and other basic surface chemistry components capable of 99% reduction of CO, organic compounds, SOx and high performance removal of particulate matter. In its basic configuration EMx consists of two active components. The first is a regenerable SOx guard bed. The second is the lean NOx trap. As exhaust gases pass through the system SO2 is oxidized to sulfate and trapped on the guard bed. NOx is then oxidized to NO2 and trapped on the surface of the NOx trap. Both of these units are periodically regenerated with a stream of dilute hydrogen, releasing the NOx as molecular nitrogen and the sulfur as SO2 (which can be collected and removed from the gas stream). However, while NOx and SOx are being adsorbed other processes are also taking place. CO and hydrocarbons are readily oxidized, often leading to non-detectable levels at the system exhaust. Also, significant reductions in particulate matter - particularly the condensable inorganic fraction - have been measured, suggesting a mechanism for soot oxidization. This points the way for further developments in the technology with positive implications for air shed regions such as California's South Coast Basin and San Joaquin Valley, and Texas' greater Houston area.",,"Active components; California; Catalyst technologies; Catalytic technologies; Emissions controls; Gas streams; Greater houston areas; Guard beds; Inorganic fractions; Lean NOx traps; Molecular nitrogens; Nox emissions; Oxidation catalysts; Oxidization; Particulate matters; San joaquin valleys; Significant reductions; South coast basins; Air pollution; Catalysis; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen; Landforms; Organic compounds; Sulfur; Surface chemistry; Exhaust gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053655756

However there is an increasing concern that current trends of consumption of natural resources cannot continue. It is imperative that major targeted investments are made into economical and reliable environment friendly propulsion and power solutions. A significant amount of this investment will be in the aerospace sector. A well utilised civil aircraft may burn more than 2000 times its weight in fuel during its life, so the examination of the propulsion system is essential from an environmental point of view. A preliminary parametric study for geared, intercooled and/or recuperated turbofan for short range commercial transport applications has been performed with regard to fuel consumption and emissions. A high by-pass ratio turbofan engine with performance characteristics and technology from the year 2000 was set up as a baseline. The results offer interesting qualitative comparisons showing that, for instance, a recuperated engine will yield a lower fuel burn for lower OPR values. An engine with a mid-compressor intercooler may give significant reduction of NO x emissions whilst increasing the amount of CO2. The intercooled and recuperated cycle offers higher thermal efficiencies (i.e. higher fuel consumption benefit) in comparison to other cycles at medium OPR values; therefore NOx formation may be reduced as well as the engine core weight. Additionally, the inherent advantage of high BPR against low BPR turbofans in terms of SFC is evident (GTF). Clearly, therefore, an increase of BPR is an inevitable solution for the reduction of both fuel consumption and the level of noise produced, however this may involve NOx and integration penalties, hence innovative cycles(e.g.: ICR) and state of the art combustor technology (e.g.: PERM and LDI combustors) must be considered. This is first on the series of work that would be carried out on the cycles being proposed in this paper. Further work on the issues of weight, noise, aircraft performance, other emissions, economics, etc, so-called a multidisciplinary objective assessment, would be published when completed. Also, at this time the design has been limited to take-off being the point of maximum aerodynamic performance. An extension to full mission is currently under investigation.

The high-temperature gas turbine produces shaft power to turn an electric generator. The hot exhaust is then fed to a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) that provides steam to a steam turbine for added electrical power production. A simplified computational model of the thermal power conversion system was developed in order to parametrically investigate two different steady-state operation conditions: base load nuclear heat only from an Advanced High Temperature Reactor (AHTR), and combined nuclear heat with fossil heat to increase the turbine inlet temperature. These two cases bracket the expected range of power levels, where any intermediate power level can result during electrical load following. The computed results indicate that combined nuclear-fossil systems have the potential to offer both low-cost base-load electricity and lower-cost peak power relative to the existing combination of base-load nuclear plants and separate fossil-fired peak-electricity production units.

An advanced centralised voltage regulation system has been studied by the Authors to allow a greater DG penetration and a high quality service to customers. However, depending on the characteristics of the specific network, it could be sometimes impossible to solve some operating conflicts between voltage regulation and correct DG operation. In practice, in order to connect a greater amount of DG, it might be necessary, not only to revise the employed regulation criteria, but also to act at the planning stage to make specific changes in the structure of a distribution system. In this view the paper presents a planning procedure that, besides existing distribution system data bases, load variation forecast, environmental/climatic conditions, and planners experience, takes into account information directly provided by the operation of the aforementioned advanced voltage regulation system. ©2007 IEEE.","Dispersed generation; Power distribution; Power distribution planning; Voltage control","Computer networks; Distributed parameter networks; Distribution of goods; Electric current regulators; Electric load forecasting; Electric power distribution; Galerkin methods; Local area networks; Voltage stabilizing circuits; Dispersed generation; Power distribution; Power distribution planning; Voltage control; Voltage regulations; Voltage regulators",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50849089256

However, cost reduction and durability are still critical issues in particular for the integration of the PM-filter with other components of the after-treatment system (e.g. pre-turbo-catalyst, close-coupled-catalyst, PM-filter, SCR). To respect functional (available temperature and gas composition) and space restraints, very complex shapes may result from the design causing tortuous flow patterns and influencing the flow distribution into the PM-filter. Uneven soot distributions in the filter may cause a non-homogeneous development of filter regeneration, leading to failures, for example due to the occurrence of large temperature gradients during the oxidation of soot deposits. A detailed analysis of flow fields during the loading phase may represent an useful tool to design the filter and its integration into the exhaust system. In this work an effort for the development of a comprehensive model able to describe both large scale phenomena related to the complete exhaust system and local processes acting in the filter channels is presented. The model is based on a multilevel approach, built on FLUENT CFD solver, and it is capable of predicting the dynamic PM-loading 3D field into the filter.

These capabilities can be achieved only by the adoption of very high noble metal loadings (up to 140 g/ft3), which lead to very high costs. Washcoat distribution may play a key role in this context. In this paper the influence of washcoat distribution on light-off behaviour of a Diesel Oxidation Catalyst has been then investigated by means of a 3D numerical model. The model is capable of representing the coupling among flow, washcoat diffusion and detailed surface chemistry.

Looking for short-term solutions, the introduction of moderate quantities of H2 (up to 30%) into Natural Gas (NG) SI engines may be a feasible solution to get a faster combustion process, and therefore less HC and CO2 emissions, and a slight NOx increase which may be potentially limited by the adoption of lean-burn engine control strategies. However, concurrent effects of volumetric efficiency reduction and maximum temperature in the combustion chamber require a careful optimization of operating conditions to fully exploit the H2 potential and to determine the most convenient H2/NG mixture ratio. In that context, 3D numerical tools may be useful to analyze the effect of H2 introduction on engine performance. Combustion modelling should be handled with care, since performance variation mainly depends on fuel properties (heating value, laminar flame speed) and on the effect of turbulent transport on the global turbulent flame speed. In this paper, results concerning a project (BONGHY) to introduce H2/NG fuel mixtures into a public transport fleet are reported. Project BONGHY activities have been carried out in conjunction with ENEA, ASM and Universities of Roma La Sapienza and Cattolica di Brescia, to analyze the H2/NG mixture potential as a fuel for garbage trucks in urban areas. Results here reported particularly concern numerical activities to predict the effect of H2 introduction on final engine performance. To that aim, KIVA-3V code has been utilized as the basic thermal-fluid-dynamic platform where an advanced combustion model (CFM) based on the flamelet assumption and suitably modified to support H 2/NG mixture combustion has been implemented. The application of the model to the analysis of several operating conditions has proved its usefulness to identify the effect of variation of engine control parameters (primarily spark advance) on performance to support experimental activities and finally get a reduction of CO2 and fuel consumption with no major penalties on tailpipe NOx emissions.

This effort represents the first emissions evaluation of an actual United States (US) military aircraft operating with a semi-synthetic fuel. The engines were tested on-wing of a parked B-52 aircraft at Edwards AFB, and one of the engines was also tested in Test Cell #8 at Tinker AFB. Gaseous and particulate matter (PM) emissions were quantified. Measurements of the mostly nonvolatile PM emissions were performed using conventional instrumentation to determine particle number (concentration), size, mass and smoke number. Soot samples were collected on quartz filters fo r subsequent chemical analysis. The engines were operated with each fuel at four power settings, idle-to-maximum thrust, and a 50 hour engine endurance test with the FT blend was conducted in the test cell at normal rated thrust. Average reductions of 30-45% in PM mass emissions relative to JP-8 were observed in both engines burning the FT blend. In addition, significant reductions in particle number and engine smoke numbers were also observed. Chemical analysis of the soot samples showed reductions of 50-70% in three and four-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) concentration with the FT blend. Effects of the synthetic fuel on gaseous emissions were negligible except for slight reductions in unburned hydrocarbons and the anticipated reductions in sulfur oxides.

The emissions campaign supports the Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) project CP-1401 to determine emissions factors from military aircraft. The purpose of the project is to develop a comprehensive emissions measurement program using both conventional and advanced measurement techniques to determine emissions factors of pollutants, and to investigate the spatial and temporal evolutions of the exhaust plumes from fixed and rotating wing military aircraft. Standard practices for the measurement of gaseous emissions from aircraft are well known in the technical community; however, there is no certified methodology for the measurement of aircraft PM emissions. In this study, several conventional instruments were used to physically characterize the PM emissions from the two turboprop engines. Exit plane measurements were made by extracting emissions samples via probes and transporting through heated lines to the analytical instruments. Multiple sampling probes were used to assess the spatial variation and obtain a representative average of the engine emissions. Particle concentrations, size distributions and mass emissions were measured using commercially available aerosol instruments. Engine smoke numbers were determined using established Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) practices, and gaseous species were quantified via an FTIR-based gas analyzer. In order to cover a wide range of operating conditions, the engines were tested at five power settings, from idle to take-off power. Over 30 data sets were collected throughout the testing period. Dilution corrected particle numbers (PN) of 3.5-6.0E+06 particles per cm3 and PN emission index (EI) from 6.5-8.0E+15 particles per kg-fuel were observed for both engines. The highest PN were observed for the maximum power condition; however, the PN EI was slightly higher for the three idle conditions than for the two high power cases, which suggests improved semi-volatile particle combustion at the high power settings. The mean particle diameter varied between 50 nm at idle to 70 nm at maximum engine power. PM mass EI ranged from 2.0-4.0 g/kg-fuel throughout the conditions tested.

One of the advantages of using PNAs is the possibility to dissect the effect of chirality in a controlled way, using modified chiral PNA monomers. Unlike DNA, both enantiomers of a PNA can easily be obtained. In this context, we evaluated the properties of modified PNAs carrying stereogenic centers at C2 and/or C5 carbon. Our approach was to study first PNA:PNA duplexes and their structures in order to evaluate the effect of chirality in inducing preferential helix handedness and then to correlate this property with the DNA binding ability. A modified PNA with a chiral insert of three lysine-based PNA monomers (""chiral box"") into an achiral chain was found to be highly sequence selective. The structure of the complex formed by this modified PNA with DNA in the solid state, described by us few years ago, represents a good model to explain helical preference and stereoselectivity at the molecular level.

Ambient measurements of diesel-related species can provide additional data and confirmation of the magnitude of modeled air concentrations in proximity to the monitored sites. The Placer County APCD initiated an intensive air-monitoring program in the summer of 2005. The air monitoring network consists of two pairs of upwind/downwind monitoring sites located adjacent to the rail yard. Measurements include Federal Reference Method (FRM) filter-based measurements of PM2.5 mass, organic carbon and elemental carbon; continuous aethalometer measurements of PM2.5 black carbon (BC) as a surrogate for diesel particulate matter (DPM); continuous beta attenuation monitor (BAM) measurements of PM2.5 mass; and continuous NOx measurements. During the 2005 summer sampling campaign, 24-hour FRM filter samples were collected every third day. This sampling schedule was modified in the 2006 summer sampling campaign to collect seven-hour samples between 10 PM PST and 5 AM PST to correspond to the time period with the greatest wind persistence during the summer months. Measurements are also planned for the summer of 2007. The results from the three summer sampling campaigns will be used to assess whether ambient diesel particulate matter concentrations have been reduced from the 2005 base year due to Union Pacific's mitigation measures implemented in 2006 and 2007. BC/PM2.5 and NO/NOx ratios are consistently higher at the downwind sites compared to the upwind sites, which is consistent with the presence of fresh emissions from the rail yard. Ambient concentrations of BC and PM2.5 mass are significantly higher at the downwind sites compared to the upwind sites. This paper will present the ambient monitoring results from the 2005 and 2006 summer monitoring periods. © 2007 by the Air & Waste Management Association.","Air Toxics; Black Carbon; Diesel Particulate Material; Locomotives","Air pollution; Engines; Health risks; Locomotives; Machinery; Monitoring; Organic carbon; Particles (particulate matter); Risk assessment; Air monitoring networks; Air toxics; Ambient concentrations; Beta attenuation monitors; Black carbon; Diesel particulate; Diesel particulate matters; Federal reference methods; Waste management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649143217

In addition to this it is experiencing a nation wide drought, which in some areas is the worst on record. Adding to the already problematic nature of our natural water supplies, are some longer-term trends in Cities such as Perth showing significant reductions in annual rainfall and runoff. While unproven, it does raise the spectre of human induced climate change. Hence managing climate variability is the quintessence of water resource management in Australia and it is this variability that creates the greatest challenge for water resource managers across the country. In addition to climate variability, our cities face other significant challenges going forward including population growth, water demand hardening, community expectations for increasing levels of service, a need for improved waterway health, and more sustainable decision-making. Traditionally the urban water needs of Australia's major cities have been met via surface water storages. However with waterways across Australia already stressed, few new future surface water storages are planned. To meet these challenges, major urban water utilities across Australia have been reviewing their water supply planning. In all cases the new strategies are underpinned by diversity as this is regarded as the best means of managing the major risks to our urban water supplies. More specifically, this entails reducing our almost exclusive reliance upon surface water storages and hence climate dependent water sources. The municipality of the Gold Coast in the State of Queensland, Australia has developed a water supply strategy that is underpinned by diversity, adaptability and sustainability. Furthermore this strategy has taken an integrated approach to managing water across the entire water cycle and focused on providing water that is fit for purpose, rather than using potable water for all uses within the home. This strategy will deliver benefits such as significant reductions in potable water consumption, nutrient run off to adjacent waterways and per capita reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. This strategy is well advanced in its implementation to meet the demands of growth in the region along with the current drought. As a consequence, change management issues are being resolved in parallel with the delivery of the strategy. This makes the water industry in Australia at present a challenging and most times rewarding place to be.

Depending on proximity to the oceans, and this includes the Arctic Ocean, the degree of winter versus summer warming is likely to differ. In northern regions the influence of oceanicity on plant distribution is very marked. The models described in this paper show that among some of the commonest woody species winter warming may in some cases cause a significant retreat in areas that where the climate is influenced by the ocean, while in other areas the species may make significant advances. Due to seasonal differentiation in responses to temperature the nature of the migration of species into these vacated areas or changing communities is unlikely to be a mere latitudinal shift northwards of existing species assemblages. It appears therefore highly probable that species migration will be strongly influenced by seasonality of temperature change, and for any one species similar patterns of climatic change in different parts of its range, could result in migration in opposite directions. Consequently, changing thermal conditions will be likely to alter species composition of existing northern plant communities. Attention will therefore have to be given to the roles of seasonality gradients as potential barriers to migration notwithstanding overall warming. © 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-81355129940

For the Third Assessment Report published by the United Nations International Program on Climate Change in 2001, a series of economic development scenarios were created and four major general circulation models (GCM) were used to estimate the anthropogenesis-forced climate change. These GCMs produce worldwide grids of predicted monthly temperature, cloud, and precipitation deviations from the period of 1961-1990. As this period is the same used for several major typical meteorological year data sets, these typical data sets can be used as a starting point for modifying weather files to represent predicted climate change. Over the past 50 years, studies of urban heat island (UHI) or urbanization have provided detailed measurements of the diurnal and seasonal patterns and differences between urban and rural climatic conditions. While heat islands have been shown to be a function of both population and microclimatic and site conditions, they can be generalized into a predictable diurnal pattern. This paper presents the methodology used to create weather files which represent climate change scenarios in 2100 and heat island impacts today and present the typical climatic patterns resulting for 20 climate regions worldwide.","Climate change; Historical weather; Urban heat island; Weather data","Climate change scenarios; Climate regions; Climatic conditions; Data sets; Diurnal pattern; Economic development; General circulation model; Heat island; Historical weather; Human impact; International program; Seasonal patterns; Site conditions; Typical meteorological year; United Nations; Urban heat island; Urbanization impact; Weather data; Atmospheric temperature; Precipitation (meteorology); Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869753951

Conjunction of col-lisional thrust tectonics and prethrusting normal faults generated a complex fore-deep with intrabasinal structural highs that represented additional source areas to the basin. Detrital modes of the late Miocene central Apennines orogenic system range in composition from intrabasinal carbonate to quartzofeldspatholithic and calclithite arenites. The external zone of the foredeep is characterized by hemipelagic deposits, called the Orbulina Marl. Their arenite beds are composed by intrabasinal carbonate, with dominant bioclasts and minor intraclasts, and glauconite derived from an active shallow-marine carbonate source. These hemipelagic deposits are partly coeval with and partly overlain by siliciclastic turbidites of the Frosinone and the Argilloso-Arenacea Formations, and they represent deposition within local foredeep depocen-ters. Siliciclastic turbidite sandstones are quartzofeldspatholithic, which documents provenances from metamorphic, plutonic, ophiolitic, and sedimentary rocks. Carbonate intrabasinal structural highs were the main source for carbonate breccias, intrabasinal arenites, and calclithites of the Brecce della Renga Formation, the deposits of which are locally interbedded with the coeval siliciclastic turbidite sandstones. Evolution of late Miocene sandstone detrital modes reflected the changing nature of the central Apennines thrust belt through time and the complex architecture of the foreland basin system; it records the history of accretion, deformation of the fore-deep, and progressive areal reduction of carbonate-producing areas along with the sedimentary and structural evolution of local intrabasinal highs. © 2007 Geological Society of America.

Multiple issues, stakeholders and scales of system behaviour must be considered, as well as the key disciplines within and between the human and natural sciences. Modelling is a critical tool in integrated assessment. It enables effects of policy interventions, climate forcing and demographics to be predicted (although with some uncertainty), and provides a means of expanding understanding of river basin behaviour. It also acts as a vehicle for social learning among various interest groups. This paper discusses the various frameworks and methods being used for integrated modelling, and their suitability and unfulfilled potential for these purposes. The frameworks include coupled component models, systems dynamics models, metamodels, risk-assessment approaches, Bayesian decision networks, agent-based methods, expert systems and other heuristic knowledge-based techniques. Specific software platforms are not considered but the lessons from software development and implementation are clearly spelt out. The paper presents three Australian case studies in integrated assessment. They vary in their range of catchment/watershed sizes, hydroclimatology, issues of concern and stakeholders engaged. Two of them utilise a coupled component modelling framework and the third a Bayesian decision network approach. The paper illustrates the value, problems and lessons of integrated assessment and modelling. In particular it proposes some ways to address the challenges of assessing options to obtain more sustainable basin-wide outcomes. © 2007 Springer.","Agent-based; Bayesian decision networks; Expert systems; Integrated modelling; Integration frameworks; Knowledge-based; Metamodels; Risk assessment; River basin management; Stakeholders; System dynamics","Agent based; Bayesian decision networks; Integrated modelling; Integration frameworks; Knowledge-based; Meta model; River basin management; Stakeholders; System Dynamics; Bayesian networks; Expert systems; Heuristic methods; Water management; Risk assessment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890388180

Vegetation communities when Paleoindians lived on the North American continent were governed by climatic conditions and an earth-sun relationship that do not exist on earth today. Therefore, rather than simply examining pollen records to provide information concerning the plants that were present, we have found it more insightful to incorporate archaeoclimatic modeling to understand the variations in seasonal temperature and precipitation that affected local plants and animals. Once the model is created, it is essential that pollen or other proxy records be consulted to ""ground truth"" the model. That is to say, models are excellent tools, but they should not be considered a substitute for data. Examining data at the closest interval possible provides considerably more information concerning local vegetation than does examining data averaged over long periods of time. © 2007 by University Press of Colorado.

Alternate delivery methods are often determinant in establishing the most efficient configuration for water treatment facilities. Such is the case with the Twin Oaks Valley Water Treatment Plant where San Diego County Water Authority chose to implement a Design-Build-Operate (DBO) delivery method for its new 100-mgd water treatment plant. Because of the DBO process, decisions have been made on a true net present value basis driving many decisions on the project to very high levels of sustainable, efficient, and least impact practices including: • Most cost-effective approach based on use of low-pressure membrane treatment technology compared to conventional water treatment. • Zero liquids discharge from the site by neutralizing and recycling backwash streams. • Reducing consumables over the life of the project, not just during construction. • Minimized footprints to reduce impact to site and construction material requirements. • Substantially reduced chemical consumption and residuals handling requirements by eliminating coagulant. • Minimized environmental impacts with early site work packages to avoid impact to wildlife habitat during nesting season. • Worked win-win agreement with neighboring water district to eliminate 10,000 truck trips for fill required onsite. • Designed facilities to maximize use of site topography with campus style facility. As a result, the facility requires less than 11 acres for all elements, including clearwells, of a 100-mgd plant employing state-of-the-art treatment technologies. The plant incorporates low pressure ultrafiltration (UF) membrane filtration, ozonation/advanced oxidation processes, and biological activated carbon contactors. The plant utilizes high-rate residuals treatment processes and a unique approach for neutralizing spent chemical cleaning solutions to completely recover all waste streams generated in the main process stream. This effort, alone, saves over 5 mgd of potentially lost water resource and results in a process that is over 99.99 percent water efficient.

Small scooters, which are very much used in the congested centers of several cities, are a remarkable source of air pollution. Therefore every effort to reduce the emissions is an important contribution to improve the air quality in urban centers. In the present work detailed investigations of particle emissions of different 2-stroke scooters with direct injection and with carburettor were performed. The nanoparticulate emissions were measured by means of SMPS, (CPC) and NanoMet. Also the particle mass emission (PM) was measured with the same method as for Diesel engines. Extensive analyses of PM-residuum for SOF/INSOF, PAH and toxicity equivalence (TEQ), were carried out in an international project network. Particle mass emission (PM) of 2-S Scooters consists mostly of SOF. The standard coulometric EC/OC-analysis, as well as the analyzer MEXA 1370 PM overestimate the amount of soot due to the effect of ""charring"", which provokes the heaviest VOC to stay in the sample during the thermal extraction and to be indicated as EC. A solution for this analytical problem is demonstrated. Wiremash Filter Catalyst (WFC) is en efficient measure to intensify the oxidation of the exhaust gas components and to reduce PM, PC, PAH, TEQ &amp; VOC. The presented WFC needs a further development for durability and product integration. The amount of total PAH, as well as the toxicity equivalence factor TEQ correlate roughly with the total particle mass PM. WFC is an efficient aftertreatment measure to substancially lower the toxicity of 2-S exhaust gases.

The challenge for governments is to find and develop cost-effective ways to improve urban air quality without scarifying economy. Natural gas as vehicle fuel can reduce compared to conventional Diesel technology, particulate matter by as much as 99%, nitrous oxides (NOx) by as much as 85%, and carbon monoxide (CO) by more than 90%. Relative to gasoline, the global warming impact (GWI) for dedicated natural gas vehicles (NGVs) is generally more than 20 % lower. When non-regulated emissions are included on a well-to-wheel basis, NGVs still show advantages over gasoline and Diesel vehicles. Nowadays, there are more than 4.7 million NGVs in operation all around the world. It seems that the catalysts used in NGVs are close to Three-Way Catalysts (TWC) typically used for gasoline engines. However, there are very few studies about the impact of catalysis for NGVs. This work deals with a comparative study of natural gas vehicles commercial catalysts in order to evaluate their efficiency to reduce emissions of CO, NOx and CH4. All tested catalysts are efficient in the CO and NOx treatment. The CO light off temperature varies from 75 to 145°C. The NOx reduction depends on the reductants available in the exhaust gases (H2 at low temperature, CO at medium temperature and CH4 at high temperature). However, at low temperature, the selectivity on N2 is lower than 20%. Finally, the major problem is the methane treatment. Only one catalyst leads to a Tlight off, CH4 around 315°C. For the other catalysts, Tlight off, CH4 were found around 375-400°C.

This agreement contained new and more stringent limits than those set out by environmental legislation. The application of BATTER, a tool that indicates the best environmental scenarios for a territory, identified the best technical solutions: only the application of Industrial Ecology (IE) principles would allow the achievement of advantages regarding air quality (emissions reduced up to 65%), water quality (pollution reduced between 20 and 30 times), water and energy consumption and CO2 emissions (reduced up to 60%). As compared to other applications of Industrial Ecology, the Venetian case differs in the attention paid to the stakeholders' needs and their involvement in the decision-making process.

Due to the high level of political pressure on agriculture to reduce its emissions, the agricultural community in Colorado has recently developed a Rocky Mountain National Park Ag Strategy for decreasing ammonia emissions from agriculture and nitrogen deposition in the park. The strategy includes the completion of a thorough literature review on Best Management Practices (BMPs) for ammonia reduction and a field evaluation of the efficacy and cost of the most promising BMPs on local feedlots and dairies. In addition, a survey will be completed to evaluate producer attitudes and understanding of the ammonia issue, as well as current levels of ammonia BMP adoption, and constraints to increased BMP adoption. The strategy also includes education and outreach functions including the development of a BMP factsheet series, photo gallery of ammonia BMPs, and a decision tree to aide producer decision-making regarding ammonia BMPs. These components will be available to producers and their consultants through a website. Our goal is to minimize the negative human health and environmental impacts of ammonia emissions from agriculture through the adoption of field-tested, effective, and economical BMPs on Colorado's feedlots and dairies.","Ammonia; Animal feeding operations; Best management practices","Agriculture; Air pollution; Air quality; Alternative fuels; Ammonia; Dairies; Decision theory; Decision trees; Emission control; Environmental impact; Feeding; Food products plants; Landforms; Management; Parks; Planning; Problem solving; Silver; Strategic planning; Ammonia emissions; Ammonia reductions; Animal feeding operations; Best management practices; Case studies; Current levels; Field evaluations; Human healths; Literature reviews; National parks; Nitrogen depositions; Photo galleries; Political pressures; Public concerns; Rocky mountains; Web sites; Waste management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349084228

While many measures to alleviate water scarcity are within the water sector, it is increasingly recognized that many drivers, policies and institutions outside the water sector have large and real implications on how water is being allocated and used. Important drivers for water use include population and income growth, urbanization, trade and other macroeconomic policies, environmental regulations and climate policy. While some of these processes and trends, especially those at global level, may prove difficult to influence directly, it is important to understand their linkages with water issues to analyze the relative impact of various policies in the agricultural and water sectors on water and food security. The strong linkages between economic trends, agricultural policies and water use call for an integrated and multidisciplinary modelling approach. The WATERSIM model, developed by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) is a suitable tool to explore the impacts of water and food related policies on global and regional water demand and supply, food production and the environment. This paper introduces the WATERSIM model and, using some preliminary results, illustrates the importance of global economic trends on food and water outcomes. © 2007 Springer.","Global water and food model; Integrated modeling approach","Agricultural policies; Business-as-usual; Food modeling; Integrated modeling approaches; International waters; Macroeconomic policies; Water demand and supply; Water supply and demands; Agriculture; Economics; Environmental regulations; Food supply; Population statistics; Water management; Water supply",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890398219

It is analyzed through characterization of processes that take place in counter-diffusion configuration obtained by two opposed jets of the fresh air-fuel mixture and inert flow. The reactive field is modeled through a numerical code exploiting a detailed chemical kinetics scheme of O2/CH4/N2 system. Distributions of temperature and enthalpy as a function of the spatial coordinate and the mixture fraction are obtained for different values of the external parameters, i.e. the maximum temperature increase, the fresh mixture temperature, the inert gas mixture, the reference strain rate. They can be classified in four main categories on the ground of location and broadness of the heat release and occur in contiguous exclusive regions of external parameters plots. Continuous transitions between regions are characterized by single solutions, whereas extinction/ignition discontinuous mechanisms are obtained in transition regions where double solutions are allowed. Unique characteristics, different from those of deflagration, emerged for well-identified ranges of external parameters. They are related to a distribution of the heat release in a broad spatial and mixture fraction range. The operative conditions, for which such peculiar behavior occurs, are coincident with those where Mild Combustion is expected to take place on the ground of its ""a priori"" definition.","Combustion regimes; Diluted combustion","Gas mixtures; Heat transfer; Jets; Parameter estimation; Reaction kinetics; Thermal diffusion; Air-fuel mixtures; Combustion regimes; Homogeneous Charge Diffusion Ignition (HCDI); Transition regions; Ignition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548711456

With the use of a thermodynamic analysis the CoWO4 spinel was introduced as a new oxygen carrier material, capable to be reduced with methane (15% CH4/Ar) and reoxidized with steam (30% H2O/Ar) to produce syngas and hydrogen in each redox step, respectively. H2 production is feasible during the regeneration of CoWO4 by oxidation of reduced species (Co and W) with steam. CoWO4 synthesis was performed using the solid state reaction. Characterization included: XRD, SEM and particle size determination. Redox-cycle performance was followed by TGA. Thermal stability of CoWO4 was tested by exposing the material to ten consecutive reduction/oxidation (H2/Ar, H2O/Ar) cycles at 850°C and after. Results indicate that CoWO4 showed no significant loss of activity. This stable behavior is associated to its crystalline structure, which allows the fixation of the active metals (Co + W) through the spinel structure, thus inhibiting particle nucleation and migration, which are the main causes of sintering after exposure to steam at high temperatures. The addition of Ni to CoWO4 as a POX catalyst produced an enhancement of the reduction step of 20% in metal oxide conversion with respect to CoWO4. Copyright © 2007 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

The Reference BaU scenario considers the evolution of the system without any particular constraint and following the historical trends for any sub-system. The Building Regulation (BR) scenario assumes particular prescriptions, aimed to improve energy efficiency for new buildings as well as for refurbishment of existing ones, related to the space heating requirements, and particular targets for the contribution of solar thermal technologies.

This is particularly true for buildings which are conceived to protect object of art or which are themselves important monuments. Ventilation systems for Exposition Spaces, Museums or Archaeological Sites, using only natural forces such as wind, thermal buoyancy and geothermal energy need to be designed together with the building itself considering that their components are the elements that can reduce or increase air movement as well as influence the air content (dust, pollution etc). (Figure Presented) Designers need to acquire qualitative and quantitative information about the interactions between building characteristics and natural ventilation in order to design buildings systems consistent with a passive low-energy approach [1]. Qualitative information includes design context background, design concept and design criteria; quantitative information includes CFD simulation techniques for defining climate parameters, sizing openings and estimating flow rate. The position of the Sanctuary, which is out of the urban area of Tivoli, on the top of the canyon of the Aniene river, makes natural ventilation an important strategy to control the microclimate in the spaces confined by the ruins and by the designing roof.

However, the economy is made up of multiple individuals, not a single representative agent. This article reports the results of alternative ways of distributing emissions allocations across citizens. Macroeconomic effects interact with the policy for distribution, but the distributional weights are more important for the welfare of individual agents than the economy-wide effects of the emissions reductions. Egalitarian distributions of the emissions allowances have the potential to increase the welfare of most people, even if significant emissions reductions are mandated. Focusing on the distribution of emissions allowances (or the revenues generated from an emissions tax) rather than on aggregate GDP may provide guidance in identifying and implementing politically viable solutions to the climate change mitigation problem. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Cap-and-trade; Climate policy; Distributional effects of climate policies; Emissions allowances; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Income distribution; Macroeconomic effects of climate policies; Wealth distribution","economic impact; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; income distribution; macroeconomics; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37349069501

Monitoring the reactions by in-situ IR spectroscopy in MeCN as the solvent indicates an interaction of the precatalyst with the silane prior to activation of CO 2. In the absence of CO2, hydrosilylation of the MeCN solvent occurs. Catalytic activity in CO2 hydrosilylation is enhanced by Me2PhSiCl, generated during reduction of RuIII in mer-[RuX3(MeCN)3] to RuII or, when added as promoter to RuII precatalysts. The reaction mechanism for the catalytic cycle has been calculated by DFT methods for the reaction of Me 3SiH. The key steps are: Transfer of the Me3Si moiety to a coordinated halide ligand, resulting in an LnRuH-(XSiMe3) intermediate → CO2 coordination → Me3Si transfer to CO2 → reductive elimination of formoxysilane product. This reaction sequence is more favorable energetically for chloride complexes than for the analogous bromide complexes, which accounts for their differences in catalytic activity. Calculations also explain the rate increase observed experimentally in the presence of Me2PhSiCl. A parallel reaction pathway leads to (Me3Si)2O as a minor byproduct which arises from the condensation of two initially formed Me3SiOH molecules. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

In the past, these data were processed through Quality Assurance/Control (QA/QC) systems that were primarily network-specific with no standard for rules/algorithms applied to similar parameters across the different observing networks. Therefore, NCDC implemented a plan to integrate surface climatological data into a common format and data model and process these data through one processing system that capitalizes on network independent standardized QA/QC algorithms and procedures. NCDC developed an Integrated Surface Data (ISD) format and database and a new QA/QC processing system, the Integrated Surface Data Processing System (ISDPS). ISD and ISDPS integrate QA/QC algorithms into a unified system. Numerous historical datasets have been fully integrated into ISD. Data from several sources and networks, totaling nearly 20,000 active observing sites, are now operationally processed (eg, daily) through ISDPS. These sources include NOAA's Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS), the Automated Weather Observing System (AWOS), global hourly and synoptic data from the Air Force Combat Climatology Center (AFCCC), U.S. Navy station data, the National Cooperative Observers (COOP) Network, and the Climate Reference Network (CRN). Additional historical datasets will be integrated into ISD, and additional data sources and networks will gradually be integrated into ISDPS. NCDC is working with partners (National Weather Service, Regional Climate Centers, State Climatologists, National Center for Atmospheric Research, AFCCC, etc.) to continue developing network-independent standards for QA/QC and to further expand ISD.

In both species the rate of gonadal development was directly related to the increase in temperature. At 14°C the reproductive behaviour was similar, both species needing over 2 months to mature. At 18*C, the rate of gonadal development of R. philippinarum was greater than that of R. decussatus. Nevertheless, the results of this study confirm that both species have adapted perfectly to the temperature conditions of the Galician Rias, though certain differences between the reproductive behaviour of these species were detected. R. philippinarum accumulates oocytes prior to their partial or total emission, while in the case of R. decussatus gametes are liberated continuously. In the early-phases of its development, the gonad of R. philippinarum is highly heterogeneous in nature, with up to 3 reproductive states being present at the same time, while in R. decussatus gonadal development is much more uniform. Another major difference concerns the phenomenon of reabsorption, common in R. philippinarum but very rare in R. decussatus. These characteristics may well result in a greater reproductive activity in R. philippinarum than in R. decussatus, and a longer reproduction period in the former. They may also represent a certain advantage for the adaptation of the foreign species (R. philippinarum) over the native species (R. decussatus) to the temperature conditions of the Galician Rias.","Gonadal development; Hermaphroditism; Histology; Ruditapes decussatus; Ruditapes philippinarum; Temperature","adaptation; clam culture; coastal water; comparative study; environmental factor; gamete; hermaphroditism; histology; reproductive behavior; ria; temperature tolerance; Eurasia; Europe; Galicia; Southern Europe; Spain; Bivalvia; Mollusca; Venerupis (Ruditapes) decussatus; Venerupis (Ruditapes) philippinarum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48549094592

Scientists from the USGS and several academic institutions have been conducting research on the physical, chemical, and biological processes controlling the transport and fate of petroleum hydrocarbon contaminants in the subsurface at this site. Results of 24 years of research have provided fundamental knowledge, new tools, and new techniques that have been applied in remediating similar sites worldwide. The Bemidji research project was one of the first to document that the extent of crude-oil contamination can be limited by natural attenuation, and also was the first to document the importance of anaerobic degradation of hydrocarbons, particularly through iron reduction. Bemidji researchers developed a ""freezing drive shoe"" for collecting undisturbed cores below the water table that has been used at numerous other research sites. A two-dimensional, multispecies, solute-transport model (BIOMOC) was developed for the research site to analyze the evolution of the ground-water contaminant plume. Initial remediation of the site, completed about 24 years ago, removed approximately 60% of the spilled oil. A second period of pump-and-treat remediation conducted by the pipeline company from 1998-2005 is being evaluated by the research team. Other current research topics include the processes of diffusion, volatilization, and biodegradation in the unsaturated zone, microbe-mineral interactions, stimulation of degradation by iron reducing bacteria; and use of in situ microcosms for precise rate determinations. The research team currently is evaluating the processes of diffusion, volatilization, and biodegradation in the unsaturated zone. In addition, the USGS is collaborating with the pipeline company and the local regulatory agency to promote research and education at the site while also protecting the environment. As a part of this effort, we are interested in developing new collaborations with researchers, industry, consultants, regulators, teachers, or students on the development and testing of conventional, alternative, or enhanced in situ remediation strategies at the Bemidji site.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79551566358

However, integration of olefins production with bitumen upgrading / refining is a new concept which has recently been developed as a study. The study was for the government of Alberta Hydrocarbon Upgrading Task Force (HUTF) which includes industry sponsors such as Dow and Nova - major ethylene producers in the province of Alberta. The overall concept is upgrading of high sulfur, hydrogen deficient, bitumen from Northern Alberta. This is assumed to be processed in the Edmonton area, to produce fuel products: diesel, kerosene and gasoline. These are produced by conventional refining and conversion processing. Hydrogen, mainly for the various hydroprocessing units, is produced by gasification of petroleum coke. The economics of the fuel products is greatly enhanced by integrated production of olefins, pyrolysis gasoline and butadiene by steam cracking from advantageous feed streams. These are co-products from the refining conversion units and therefore substantially improve the overall economics of the proposed complex. The entire complex is driven by electric power, produced by combustion of low value solid fuels in fluidized bed boilers. Incremental energy is supplied by coal. The gasification of coke is integrated with the coal fired steam generators. This energy integration is unique in that all of the major compressors are driven by electricity and all of the high pressure steam goes to a central power island. Since the incremental energy is coal derived ($0.73 per million BTU cost), the economical approach temperature for the cross exchangers is larger which also results in lower capital. The two most positive attributes to the overall economics are: 1. Bitumen is valued at only 41% on a volume basis (35% on weight basis) of West Texas Intermediate crude. 2. Almost 25% reduction in capital investment resulted from integrated production of petrochemicals, hydrogen and electric power as opposed to the traditional stand alone upgrading/refining and power units. Given all the above, with appropriate (conservative) contingency and escalation, the projected ROI is about 20% per year after Canadian federal and provincial taxes The paper presents the overall flow scheme and the rationale for selection of the major processing routes.

Over 2 barrels of water are pumped to produce a thousand cubic feet (MCF) of gas. The only environmental problem associated with the production of this clean burning domestic fuel is that the water's sodium bicarbonate content is so high that its discharge to the environment is harmful to both plant and animal life. EMIT Water Discharge Technology LLC and Severn Trent Services, Inc. have teamed together to apply one of STS's technologies for the purification of this produced water. The Higgins Loop Continuous Ion Exchange (CIX) System utilizes cation resins in an efficient mode to remove sodium from the water and concentrate it into a very small brine stream for disposal. The process also reduces the water's bicarbonate content by evolving carbon dioxide gas from the low sodium treated water under slightly acidic pH conditions. Purified water is then neutralized with limestone. This step increases its calcium content and makes the water more suitable for use in irrigation, human consumption, ranching and for aquatic life in rivers and creeks. The CIX process was first demonstrated in April, 2003 in a well field north of Sheridan, WY. Since then, EMIT has placed 15 more CIX Systems in operation in both Wyoming and Montana treating over 180,000 barrels per day of water. The technology has been accepted by both the gas producers and state regulators as the best available technology (BAT) and most economical process for CBM produced water treatment. This paper describes the reasons for produced water treatment, the purification process and the overall benefits to the industry and environment.

It is well known that temporal changes of the space plasma environment (electron plasma temperature or density) can cause threshold charging. Threshold charging can also result from by temporal changes in the juxtaposition of the spacecraft to the environment, including spacecraft orbit, orientation, and geometry. This study focuses on the effects of possible changes in electron emission properties of representative spacecraft materials. It is found that for electron-induced emission, the possible threshold scenarios are very rich, since this type of electron emission can cause either positive or negative charging. Alternately, modification of photon- or ion-induced electron emission is found to induce threshold charging only in certain favorable cases. Changes of emission properties discussed include modifications due to: contamination, degradation and roughening of surfaces and layered materials; biasing and charge accumulation; bandstructure occupation and density of states caused by heat, optical or particle radiation; optical reflectivity and absorptivity; and inaccuracies and errors in measurements and parameterization of materials properties. An established method is used here to quantitatively gauge the relative extent to which these various changes in electron emission alter a spacecraft's charging behavior and possibly lead to threshold charging. The absolute charging behavior of a hypothetical flat, two-dimensional satellite panel of a single material (either polycrystalline conductor Au or the polymeric polyimide Kapton™ H) is modeled as it undergoes modification and concomitant changes in spacecraft charging in three representative geosynchronous orbit environments, from full sunlight to full shade (eclipse) are considered.",,"Computational geometry; Degradation; Electron emission; Parameterization; Phase equilibria; Photons; Plasmas; Juxtaposition; Roughening; Space plasma; Spacecraft charging; Spacecraft",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250824004

It is fed up with a detailed transboundary inventory update on the domain, integrating a speciation of non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) (Sambat et al., 2004) and particulate matter (PM) (Pregger et al., 2004) worked out by IER (Institut für Energiewirtschaft und Rationelle Energieanwendung) and CITEPA (Centre Interprofessionnel Technique d'Etudes de la Pollution Atmosphérique). Daily forecasts for the Upper Rhine Valley are operational since the beginning of 2005 and will be soon available on Internet. Indicators on the forecasting performances of the platform are calculated thanks to comparison with the routine measurements. Further, Atmo-rhenA allows the study of ozone production in the Upper Rhine Valley and the simulation of the impact of emission reduction scenarios on ozone peaks.

It includes several interesting complexities that are a challenge to modeling efforts. There are regions of lean premixed prevaporized combustion (the main flame) and regions of nonpremixed combustion (the pilot flame). High-pressure chemistry occurs and flames propagate into highly preheated reactants. A large degree of unsteadiness is associated with the recirculation zone, vortex shedding and shear layers, which make the LES modeling approach attractive. The GE TAPS fuel injector has been demonstrated previously to provide significantly reduced emissions while still providing wide stability limits. The experiment provides optical access and relatively large mass flow rates of pre-heated air at elevated combustor pressures. PIV was used to investigate the flow field, including the size and strength of the shear layers and recirculation zone and the vorticity distribution. The degree of unsteadiness was quantified by recording the large difference between the instantaneous and average flow fields. The PIV work to date also indicates the way in which the heat release from the pilot flame alters the flow field.",,"Combustors; Flow fields; Fuel injection; Gas turbines; Large eddy simulation; Shear flow; Experimental database; Gas turbine combustor; High-pressure chemistry; Lean premixed prevaporized combustions; Nonpremixed combustion; Recirculation zones; Stability limit; Vorticity distribution; Combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84943522313

Emissions during oxy-coal combustion with different input O2 concentrations have been established. Results have demonstrated that emission behaviour during oxy-coal combustion with 27% 02/73% CO2 is almost similar to air-blown combustion. Fuel NOX reduction potential during oxy-coal combustion with the application of oxidant-staging by utilising over-fire oxidant have also been established and includes in-flame measurement of NOX precursors like HCN and NH3 as well. Results strongly indicate that fuel-NOx formation mechanism in fuel rich condition during oxy-coal combustion is similar to air-blown combustion and the state-of the art Low NOX technology is applicable to reduce NOX emissions under oxy-coal conditions as well. Fate of NO recycled back into the furnace during staged as well as un-staged combustion have been investigated by injecting known concentration of NO into the furnace and there are firm evidences that reduction of recycled NOX is completely dependent on local stoichiometry, the time available to interact with hydrocarbon radicals and the location of injection of NO. Investigation carried out so far on the fate SO2 when using Lignite coal has revealed that recycled SO2 is not reduced at all in the high temperature radiative section of the furnace. However, depending on the combustion condition, between 5-20% SO2 is reduced in the fluegas path where the temperature is around 450°C. Results also indicate that due to SO2 accumulation in the furnace, the H2S concentration during oxy-coal combustion is around 2.5 times more than corresponding air-fired combustion.","CO2 capture; Fate of recycled NO; NOx formation; Oxy-fuel firing; SO2 formation","Air pollution; Bituminous coal; Coal; Coal industry; Combustion; Concentration (process); Fuels; Furnaces; Hydrocarbons; Lignite; Organic compounds; Oxidants; Recycling; Reduction; Smoke; Stoichiometry; Theorem proving; Thermochemistry; CO2 capture; Fate of recycled NO; NOx formation; Oxy-fuel firing; SO2 formation; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349133575

The gas-phase chemistry is described by elementary reactions with transport equations solved for any species. The chemical paths yielding to soot are modeled by a sectional approach for Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). Soot dynamics is described by a two-equation model for soot mass fraction and particle number density. Phenomena like nucleation, growth and oxidation have been included both for PAHs and soot. Moreover, PAH-PAH and PAH-soot collisions are taken into account. Species, PAH and soot transport equations are implemented in the in-house DLR-THETA CFD code. The laminar, ethylene-air diffusion flame investigated experimentally by McEnally and coworkers (2000) is simulated in order to validate the model. An analysis of the main flame's features as well as the interaction between them and the soot chemistry will be given.

The use of different labeling methods recently led to profound changes in our views of plant metabolism. Examples are taken from primary metabolism, with sugar interconversions, carbon partitioning between glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, or metabolite inputs into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, as well as from secondary metabolism with the relative contribution of the plastidial and cytosolic pathways to the biosynthesis of terpenoids. While labeling methods are often distinguished according to the instruments used for label detection, emphasis is put here on labeling duration. Short time labeling is adequate to study limited areas of the metabolic network. Long-term labeling, when designed to obtain metabolic and isotopic steady-state, allows to calculate various fluxes in large areas ofcentral metabolism. After longer labeling periods, large amounts of label accumulate in structural or storage compounds: their detailed study through the retrobiosynthetic method gives access to the biosynthetic pathways of otherwise undetectable precursors.

This increases the potential for plume-induced ground-level fogging in the vicinity of these plants. A modeling methodology was developed to estimate the potential for the occurrence of ground-level fogging due to this increased water vapor and liquid water emissions from wet-scrubbed plumes. This methodology can be applied to assist a source in the determination of a stack height that will minimize the fogging impacts of wet-scrubbed plumes. The methodology consists of: 1. Air dispersion modeling of the water vapor and liquid water emissions from the source 2. Post-processing of model-predicted ground-level water vapor concentrations to determine the probability of fogging and/or icing occurrence.

To grasp the issues relating to the transport of CO2, it is necessary to be aware of its physical properties. For the issues relating to the transport of CO2 by ship, the most efficient way to transport CO2 is in supercritical or dense phase because it has a higher density in these states. The practice of transporting liquefied gas, such as LPG and LNG, is well established and they can be carried in fully refrigerated, semi-pressurized, or fully pressurized ships. For the issues relating to transport by pipelines, captured CO2 must be transformed to dense phase by compression above its critical point prior to transport by pipeline, which itself will be determined by the impurities present in the flow. The major sources of CO2 emissions and potential sinks in the UK to be used in EOR or simply for storage are shown. The major sources are mostly coal/gas/oil fired power stations and some large industrial concerns such as steel and cement works. Thus, in order for carbon capture and storage to perform its function as a bridging technology to a carbon neutral future in the UK, these issues must be addressed with considerable urgency if CO2 transportation is not to impose a bottleneck on its implementation.",,"Energy policy; Enhanced recovery; Greenhouse gases; Offshore oil fields; Offshore power plants; Storage (materials); Carbon capture; Carbon neutral technologies; Enhanced oil recovery; Sinks; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40449136316

Relativ; humidity (RH) was found to be the primary operating parameter associated with the rapid voltage decay during this thermal cycling. It was found that repeated thermal cycling could affect the RH inside a fuel cell and, consequently, alter the water activity of membrane/ionomer. We propose an extension of the generally accepted reverse-current carbon corrosion mechanism to account for the RH effects. The rapid voltage decay was linked te a RH-dependent cathode carbon corrosion process which was attributed to a lag in the ionomer/membrane hydration state during the thermal cycling. It has been demonstrated that one can reduce the carbon corrosion rate by avoiding the combination of cold starts and hot stops. Recommended strategies for mitigation are discussed in the context of the corrosion mechanism. © The Electrochemical Society.",,"Carbon; Corrosion rate; Thermal cycling; Carbon corrosion; Cold start; Corrosion mechanisms; Fuel cell performance degradations; Hydration state; Operating parameters; Reverse currents; Water activity; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40549106694

Following reductions of primary emissions of various legacy POPs, there is an increasing interest and debate about the relative importance of secondary re-emissions on the atmospheric levels of POPs. In spring of 2006, biomass burning emissions from agricultural fires in Eastern Europe were transported to the Zeppelin station on Svalbard, where record-high levels of many air pollutants were recorded (Stohl et al., 2007). Here we report on the extremely high concentrations of PCBs that were also measured during this period. 21 out of 32 PCB congeners were enhanced by more than two standard deviations above the long-term mean concentrations. In July 2004, about 5.8 million hectare of boreal forest burned in North America, emitting a pollution plume which reached the Zeppelin station after a travel time of 3-4 weeks (Stohl et al., 2006). Again, 12 PCB congeners were elevated above the long-term mean by more than two standard deviations, with the less chlorinated congeners being most strongly affected. We propose that these abnormally high concentrations were caused by biomass burning emissions. Based on enhancement ratios with carbon monoxide and known emissions factors for this species, we estimate that 130 and 66 μg PCBs were released per kilogram dry matter burned, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first study relating atmospheric PCB enhancements with biomass burning. The strong effects on observed concentrations far away from the sources, suggest that biomass burning is an important source of PCBs for the atmosphere.",,"atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; boreal forest; emission; organic pollutant; PCB; pollutant source; pollutant transport; Arctic; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548447157

Highly flexible powder coatings with excellent mechanical properties can be cured completely at temperatures below 150°C. Furthermore a two step curing process was developed for a new processing technology. Two dimensional metal sheets (e.g. aluminum) can be coated at low temperatures and then formed directly into complex units. This strategy reduces the use of cost intensive and ecologically harmful cleaning processes. If required an independent second curing process can be followed up at higher temperatures, e.g. to enhance the stability of the coated units. At the state of the art no forming stable powder coating system is available for coil coating processes, so there is a high demand of developmental work which can be realized on the basis of the two step curing together with fast application and curing technologies.","Low temperature curing; Powder coatings; Pre-coating; Weatherability","Aluminum coatings; Curing; Mechanical properties; Organic solvents; Temperature; Coil coating process; Curing technology; Low-temperature curing; Pre-coating; Processing technologies; Two-dimensional metals; Weatherability; Weathering resistance; Powder coatings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902435629

This chapter discusses global societal trends and future energy challenges. The technologies available today are capable of making sizeable reductions in the carbon emitted into the atmosphere. One example is that the universal introduction of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) powered by biofuels alone would contribute a 1 Gte reduction. Another practical example of a technology that will lead to reduced CO2 emissions is the proposed first power station to be fueled by hydrogen derived from natural gas. Most energy used today is obtained from the burning of fossil fuels. Although fossil fuels are far from running out, they are a finite resource and increasingly confined to remote locations or areas of political sensitivity. During the past century, the developed world has increasingly taken for granted the access to virtually unlimited supplies of energy. The World Business Council for Sustainable Development has forecast that if the UN goal to eliminate extreme poverty is to be met, global energy demand will increase over the period 2000 to 2050 by a factor of 2 to 3, with the greater demand associated with the greater reduction in poverty.

It is derived from the Fully 3D Monte Carlo (F3DMC) approach in which the system matrix is calculated using Monte Carlo simulations. The originality of the TF3DMC reconstruction is that the volume to be reconstructed is irregularly sampled: a conventional voxel sampling is used in functional regions of interest while only average activity values are estimated in regions that are without any particular interest. In this paper, we study the performance of TF3DMC reconstruction as a function of the definition of these functional regions of interest. This study was performed using SPECT simulations of a phantom filled with Tc99m and including cold and hot rods of various diameters. The system matrix was calculated for 4 different sampling, varying in the delineation of the regions around the rods in which voxel sampling was used. The TF3DMC system matrix was inverted either using MLEM or using a maximum-likelihood algorithm allowing negative reconstruction values (NEG-ML). Rod-to-background activity ratios and signal-to-noise ratios were measured in the reconstructed images. Our results suggest that TF3DMC reconstruction is robust with respect to the delineation of the functional regions of interest: drawing loose regions around the structures of interest is sufficient to accurately estimate the activity in these structures. Using NEG-ML instead of MLEM significantly reduced the biases in activity estimates, leading to biases less than 10% whatever the region. Variance was however increased in the images reconstructed using NEG-ML compared to images reconstructed using MLEM. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Diagnostic radiography; Getters; Image enhancement; Medical imaging; Monte Carlo methods; Repair; Restoration; Signal to noise ratio; Tomography; Activity ratios; Maximum-likelihood; Monte carlo; Monte Carlo simulations; Reconstructed images; Regions of interests; Signal-to-Noise ratios; System matrixes; Tomographic reconstructions; Three dimensional",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48349092387

One of these objectives is the development of an air quality strategy framework. The framework provides a system and mechanism for making rational policy decisions. At the same time, it helps with identifying the most relevant issues to be addressed, the specific issues which affects the environment in Egypt, the institutional responsibilities with respect to different interventions, and role of the Egyptian Environmental Affairs Agency (EEAA). The ultimate objective of the NAQS is to significantly reduce the levels of air pollution suffered in many urban areas in Egypt. EEAA has already developed many of the information components needed to support the development of the framework, i.e., air quality standards, emission inventories, monitoring of meteorological conditions and air pollution. They are also developing, a public information system, whereby the public will be informed about air quality issues through various media.

Ozone, sulphur dioxide, and partly nitrogen oxides observations are taken to infer source strength estimates. As methodology, the four-dimensional variational data assimilation technique has been generalised and employed to include emission rate optimisation, in addition to chemical state estimates as usual objective of data assimilation. To this end, the optimisation space of the variational assimilation system has been complemented by emission rate correction factors of 19 emitted species at each emitting grid point, involving the University of Cologne mesoscale EURAD model. For validation, predictive skills were assessed for an August 1997 ozone episode, comparing forecast performances of pure initial value optimisation, pure emission rate optimisation, and joint emission rate/initial value optimisation. Validation procedures rest on both measurements withheld from data assimilation and prediction skill evaluation of forecasts after the inversion procedures. Results show that excellent improvements can be claimed for sulphur dioxide forecasts, after emission rate optimisation. Significant improvements can be claimed for ozone forecasts after initial value and joint emission rate/initial value optimisation of precursor constituents. The additional benefits applying joint emission rate/initial value optimisation are moderate, and very useful in typical cases, where upwind emission rate optimisation is essential. In consequence of the coarse horizontal model grid resolution of 54 km, applied in this study, comparisons indicate that the inversion improvements can rest on assimilating ozone observations only, as the inclusion of NOx observations does not provide additional forecast skill. Emission estimates were found to be largely independent from initial guesses from emission inventories, demonstrating the potential of the 4D-var method to infer emission rate improvements. The study also points to the need for improved horizontal model resolution to more efficient use of NOx observations.",,"emission; estimation method; four-dimensional modeling; model validation; nitrogen oxides; optimization; ozone; pollutant source; sulfur dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249817837

There are several routes for the beam to reach the gas switch but all of them cross over the high voltage regions. The Z laser tube crosses over the outer to inner PFL electrodes with a voltage difference no larger than 3.5 MV. The ZR gas switch was designed to be in oil, given the higher operational voltages, as a consequence the laser tube is in the oil side of the PFL interface. The ZR laser tube is required to hold in excess of 5 MV across it using high pressure SF6 gas, the ID is 2.5″ to accommodate the laser beam, mechanically should tolerate the non-axial shock loading during the water switches firing. After a couple of iterations it was decided to use Polyurethane, it provided most of the desired mechanical properties, except that it outgases ether and ether based compounds. The effect of just a few ppm of ether on SF6 is a significant reduction on the HV hold off especially surface tracking or flashover. As a consequence the final design is such that the electric field distribution on the tube is as conservative as it was possible due to space constrains. We present the basic design, the field distribution, its relationship with available SF6 breakdown data and the present performance. © 2005 IEEE.",,"Architectural design; Electric currents; Electric potential; Electric switches; Energy storage; Gases; Laser beams; Lasers; Metallizing; Photolithography; Pressure; Pulsed laser applications; Pulsed laser deposition; Tubes (components); Zirconium; Cross over (CO); Gas switches; High pressure (HP); High-voltage (HV); interface designs; laser tube; Operational voltages; Pulsed forming line; Pulsed-power; voltage difference; Z-LASER (CO); Phase interfaces",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45149092444

This is partly due to the ""right to know"" principle embodied in European legislation. Despite this common legislation, the way air quality is being interpreted and communicated differs considerably. For specialists raw monitoring data for Europe are available but these are not usable by the general public. Easy to understand and internationally comparable air quality information from one city to another is scarce. The CITEAIR project facilitates the comparison of urban air quality in near real-time by introducing two products: common air quality indices (hourly, daily and annual), implemented on a common website www.airqualitynow.eu. This paper describes these indices and presents their application on the common website. The indices and the website both aim at presenting the air quality of the participating cities in a comparable way. The website is designed to receive and display data from each city wanting to join. The main part is dedicated to compare the cities index values using different time scales (hourly, daily or annual) and for two types of exposure thanks to a background and a traffic index. In addition, space is offered to cities for presenting themselves according to a common template, providing background information on their specific air pollution situation and associated reduction measures. Participating is easy: cities upload their data through ftp and the indices calculations are automatically made. The website provides a dynamic picture of the air quality and is updated each hour enticing viewers to make repeated visits. However, participation with only a daily update or with yearly data is feasible as well. The indices and the website do not aim to replace more targeted local information. Their value added is to provide, for the first time, a European and comparable picture of the air quality in near real-time easily accessible through a common platform and presentation of the results. © 2007 WIT Press.","Air quality index; European platform; Public information; Website","air quality; atmospheric pollution; comparative study; environmental legislation; index method; participatory approach; pollution monitoring; real time; World Wide Web; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148986814

Among these, sequestration into oil reservoirs while enhancing oil recovery is one of the most feasible ways as the additional oil recovery would offset the cost of CO2 sequestration operation. We postulate that the matrix, the main source of oil, could be a good CO2 storage medium. Hence, we focus on the matrix-fracture interaction during CO2 injection into naturally fracture oil reservoirs (the Weyburn and Midale fields are good examples for this case) in this paper. Proper design of this process is essential to maximize both the amount of CO2 sequestered and oil recovered. In this cooptimization process, miscibility, oil viscosity, matrix properties (permeability, porosity, pore characteristics, wettability, etc.), fracture properties (permeability, orientation, connectivity), injection rate, gravity, and the physical state of CO2 play a critical role. Clear understanding of the contributions of these properties on the dynamics of matrixfracture interaction is essential in designing EOR and CO2 sequestration application. In this paper, the dynamics of CO2 injection was studied experimentally. 2-D glass-bead models with a fracture in the middle were prepared and pentane was used as solvent to displace the kerosene or mineral oil to mimic miscible CO2 displacement. The focus was on the displacement patterns and solvent breakthrough controlled by matrix fracture interaction and pore scale behaviour of solvent-oil interaction for different matrix (wettability), fracture and injection conditions (rate, vertical vs. horizontal injection) as well as oil viscosity. Besides the visual investigation, the produced fluid was analyzed to calculate the solvent cut and oil recovery. It is believed that the visual understanding of the process will provide substantial information for further modelling studies. © 2007 Petroleum Society of Canada.",,"Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Coal deposits; Fracture; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Hydrogeology; Kerosene; Petroleum reservoirs; Solvents; Viscosity; Wetting; Displacement patterns; Fracture interactions; Fractured oil reservoirs; Geologic formations; Glass bead models; Injection conditions; Pore characteristics; Visual investigation; Petroleum reservoir engineering",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036749079

While the two concepts are closely interconnected, they are nonetheless distinct. A conceptual understanding of the relationship between vulnerability and poverty is presented, and the types of responses that can address both of these challenges are identified. An empirical example from Kenya is used to show how climate change adaptation can potentially reconcile the objectives of both poverty reduction and vulnerability reduction. Significantly, each and every poverty reduction measure does not reduce vulnerability to climate change, just as each and every adaptation measure does not automatically contribute to poverty reduction. It is argued that adaptation measures need to specifically target vulnerability—poverty linkages. Although most adaptation efforts have been focused on reducing risk, there is a need to address local capacity to adapt, as well as the societal processes generating vulnerability. An implication is that the mode of implementing adaptation measures must capture the specificity of both the vulnerability and poverty context. Furthermore, adaptation is not simply a local activity, since targeting the processes generating vulnerability and poverty often entails addressing political and economic structures. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adaptation; Capacity building; Climate change; Developing countries; Governance; Kenya; Poverty; Risk reduction; Sustainable development; Vulnerability","capacity building; climate change; developing world; empirical analysis; local adaptation; poverty alleviation; sustainable development; vulnerability; Africa; East Africa; Kenya; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38549131498

By correctly selecting the step within the cycle for process start-up, the steady periodic state can be achieved in a minimum number of cycles. Hence, the adsorbates and eluent quantities required to experimentally reproduce the periodic state of the SMB process can be greatly reduced.

By assuming that CR sources are distributed like supernova remnants (SNRs) we estimated the spatial distribution of primary nuclei by solving numerically the diffusion equation. For the first time in this context we used diffusion coefficients as determined from Montecarlo simulations of particle propagation in turbulent magnetic fields. Concerning the ISM, we considered recent models for the H2 and HI spatial distributions which en- compass the Galactic Centre (GC) region. Above the GeV we found that the angular distribution of the simulated γ -ray emission along the GP matches well EGRET measurements. We compare our predictions with the experimental limits/observations by MILAGRO and TIBET ASγ (for γ-rays) and by AMANDA-II (for neutrinos) and discuss the perspectives for a km3 neutrino telescope to be built in the North hemisphere.",,"Cosmic-ray nucleus; Diffusion equations; Interstellar mediums; Monte-Carlo simulations; Neutrino telescopes; Particle propagation; Supernova remnants; Turbulent magnetic fields; Diffusion; Experiments; Gamma rays; Spatial distribution; Neutrons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890101633

The analysis is performed for present-day conditions (year 2000) and for two future ship emission scenarios. In one scenario ship emissions stabilize at 2000 levels; in the other ship emissions increase with a constant annual growth rate of 2.2% up to 2030 (termed the ""Constant Growth Scenario"" (CGS)). Most other anthropogenic emissions follow the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) SRES (Special Report on Emission Scenarios) A2 scenario, while biomass burning and natural emissions remain at year 2000 levels. An intercomparison of the model results with observations over the Northern Hemisphere (25°-60° N) oceanic regions in the lower troposphere showed that the models are capable to reproduce ozone (O 3) and nitrogen oxides (NOx=NO+NO2) reasonably well, whereas sulphur dioxide (SO2) in the marine boundary layer is significantly underestimated. The most pronounced changes in annual mean tropospheric NO2 and sulphate columns are simulated over the Baltic and North Seas. Other significant changes occur over the North Atlantic, the Gulf of Mexico and along the main shipping lane from Europe to Asia, across the Red and Arabian Seas. Maximum contributions from shipping to annual mean near-surface O3 are found over the North Atlantic (5-6 ppbv in 2000; up to 8 ppbv in 2030). Ship contributions to tropospheric O3 columns over the North Atlantic and Indian Oceans reach 1 DU in 2000 and up to 1.8 DU in 2030. Tropospheric O3 forcings due to shipping are 9.8±2.0mW/m2 in 2000 and 13.6±2.3 mW/m2 in 2030. Whilst increasing O3, ship NOx simultaneously enhances hydroxyl radicals over the remote ocean, reducing the global methane lifetime by 0.13 yr in 2000, and by up to 0.17 yr in 2030, introducing a negative radiative forcing. The models show future increases in NOx and O3 burden which scale almost linearly with increases in NO x emission totals. Increasing emissions from shipping would significantly counteract the benefits derived from reducing SO2 emissions from all other anthropogenic sources under the A2 scenario over the continents, for example in Europe. Globally, shipping contributes 3% to increases in O3 burden between 2000 and 2030, and 4.5% to increases in sulphate under A2/CGS. However, if future ground based emissions follow a more stringent scenario, the relative importance of ship emissions will increase. Inter-model differences in the simulated O3 contributions from ships are significantly smaller than estimated uncertainties stemming from the ship emission inventory, mainly the ship emission totals, the distribution of the emissions over the globe, and the neglect of ship plume dispersion.",,"anthropogenic source; atmospheric chemistry; biomass burning; exhaust emission; hydroxyl radical; nitrogen oxides; Northern Hemisphere; ozone; radiative forcing; shipping; sulfur dioxide; troposphere; Arabian Sea; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Baltic Sea; Gulf of Mexico; Indian Ocean; North Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847146219

The states are challenging the federal government to regulate CO2 and have taken the fight to the highest Court in the land. The states are demonstrating a commitment to controlling GHG emissions by establishing reduction targets and utilizing statutes, regulations, and executive orders to implement GHG reduction programs. The states are beginning to mandate the reporting of GHG emissions and are forming regional registries to support control programs. The states developed action plans to reduce emissions, and even in states that are not actively implementing the plans, a foundation exists that can be implemented at any time or when required. The states are mandating the integration of renewable energy resources, vehicle GFIG emissions standards, and establishing GHG caps. As the states move forward in addressing climate change, it is California and the northeastern states that are leading the way. Programs conceived and implemented in these areas, such as vehicle GHG emissions standards, required GHG reporting, regional registries, and cap-and- trade, are being considered and/or implemented in other states and regions throughout the country. The proliferation of GHG emissions monitoring and control programs may force industry to monitor, quantify, control, and report GHG as they would any other regulated pollutant. Companies will place increased emphasis on energy and operational efficiency to limit GHG emissions from industrial facilities and from the transportation of goods. As states proceed in regulating GHGs individually and regionally, industry will face the difficulty of dealing with different and inconsistent programs in various areas of the country. This issue, combined with the continuing development of regional registries that are able to interact with one another, may indicate a trend toward a nationwide regulatory program at some point in the future. © 2007 by the Air & Waste Management Association.",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Energy resources; Industrial emissions; Laws and legislation; Renewable energy resources; Waste management; Continuing development; Federal governments; Industrial facilities; Integration of renewable energies; Operational efficiencies; Regulated pollutants; Regulatory program; Transportation of goods; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649113124

Moreover, a particular sequence of flow observations rarely reoccurs in identical form in a future period. If important characteristics of the historical series such as annual sequences of low and high flows are poorly modeled, design and/or planning shortcomings may then result, because their effects were underestimated. To better grasp drought and flood variability, the Lake OntarioSt. Lawrence River Study used both historical and synthetic hydrological scenarios. A set of stochastic hydrological Net Basin Supplies series for the Great Lakes, and local inflows of the St Lawrence Rivers major tributaries upstream from Trois-Rivieres sequences was developed, based on the statistical properties of the historical series. The set constitutes a large number of potential hydrological scenarios that could occur due to the observed natural variation in climate. The simulated series were then used, along with the observed 1900-2000 data, to design and evaluate the adequacy of newly proposed Lake Ontario multiobjective management strategies. In addition, four hydrologic scenarios incorporating climate change fields on seven climate variables were developed for the Great Lakes and Ottawa River. Scenarios from General Circulation Model (GCM) output changes, covering the range of climate change variability for the future 30-year period 2040-2069, were used to test the robustness of the management strategies under possible future climates. This paper summarizes the special hydrological characteristics of the Great LakesSt. Lawrence River System, the major modeling hypothesis and retained strategies used to prepare a stochastic generation model, and the preparation of climate change scenarios for a major tributary, the Ottawa River basin. It also illustrates their use in evaluating Lake Ontario multiobjective management strategies.","Climate change scenarios; Lake Ontario regulation plans; Shifting mean and ARMA process; Stochastic generation model","climate change; conference proceeding; hydrology; stochasticity; water management; water planning; water resource; Canada; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Ontario; North America; Ottawa River; Saint Lawrence River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849091995

The building used for the case study is a university teaching and research complex located in Miami, Florida. The building's original service centrifugal chiller plant and natural gas boiler are compared with the proposed cogeneration system based on energy and exergy performance. Because of the complexity of the system configuration and control schemes, building energy simulation code EnergyPlus is used as the primary tool to solve the energy balance equations. Further mathematical model for individual process exergy destruction, i.e. space cooling, dehumidification, VAV box reheating, mechanical ventilation, cooling tower evaporation, etc. are developed. To address both the processes of space cooling and dehumidification, the reference state which is associated with ambient temperature and humidity ratio is used throughout the analysis. The simulation results meet well with on-site measurement of energy usage. It is found that at whole system level, exergy efficiency is generally much lower than that of energy. The performance of chiller plant, natural boiler, air handling unit is far from thermodynamic ideal operation. By comparing different chiller plant modification scenarios, the cogeneration energy system with centrifugal chillers demonstrate the ability to increase both energy and exergy efficiencies for the overall system. The system with single-effect absorption chiller exergy efficiency is the lowest among all the candidate scenarios. The implication between exergy efficiency and sustainable building is discussed. To further improve the exergy efficiency, low exergy resources such as geothermal and solar heating should be used.

Here we discuss prospects for inclusive approaches to adaptation, drawing particularly on studies of long-term coastal management in the UK and elsewhere. We affirm that public participation is an important normative goal in formulating response to climate change risks, but argue that its practice must learn from existing critiques of participatory processes in other contexts. Involving a wide range of stakeholders in decision-making presents fundamental challenges for climate policy, many of which are embedded in relations of power. In the case of anticipatory responses to climate change, these challenges are magnified because of the long-term and uncertain nature of the problem. Without due consideration of these issues, a tension between principles of public participation and anticipatory adaptation is likely to emerge and may result in an overly managed form of inclusion that is unlikely to satisfy either participatory or instrumental goals. Alternative, more narrowly instrumental, approaches to participation are more likely to succeed in this context, as long as the scope and limitations of public involvement are made explicit from the outset. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adaptation; Anticipatory strategies; Coastal zone; Inclusion; Managerialism; Participation; Power; Stakeholder involvement","climate change; coastal zone management; decision making; environmental planning; local participation; participatory approach; policy strategy; stakeholder; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35349009522

The paper explores the relationship between population density, per capita energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in water distribution infrastructure. An analytical model of a trunk main is developed to link population density to energy use and GHG emissions in activities such as pipe fabrication, pipe repair, water pumping, and pipe recycling and/or disposal. The results indicate that increasing population density from 10 ca/ha to 150 ca/ha reduces energy use and GHG emissions by 67%. Increasing population density beyond 150 ca/ha produces no significant decrease in annual per capita energy use and GHG emissions.

NCL is considered the historically richest and most comprehensive multidisciplinary scientific collection in hydrographic surveying, oceanography, ocean engineering, atmospheric sciences (climatology and meteorology), meteorological satellite applications, living marine resources, geophysics, cartography, and mathematics in the United States, possibly in the Western Hemisphere. It incorporates holdings of NOAA's predecessor agencies, including the Coast and Geodetic Survey, the Weather Bureau, and the Bureau of Fisheries. The collections reflect the history of these organizations, their scientific research, observations and data from 1820 to the present. The NOAA Library Network collections are unique: over 40% of the items in NOAALINC (the online catalog) and their manual catalogs are not found anywhere else. Unique polar research materials include historic and current reports from various polar expeditions, with research and observations from both the Arctic and Antarctic regions. The presence of these unique and historical resources in NOAA prompted the Library to participate in 4th International Polar Year (IPY) 2007-2008 activities. Many unique and historically valuable NOAA polar research documents and scientific data, in the forms of digital videos, still images, and datasets, have been entered into the NOAALINC, the National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) Ocean Archive System (OAC), and other oceanographic information catalogs and databases. This was possible thanks to the Library's collaboration with several NOAA projects and programs, including the Video Data Management System (VDMS), Climate Data Modernization Program (CDMP), and NODC Cruise Report Program. Over one hundred fifty of these unique and historically valuable documents were selected, cataloged, imaged and entered into NOAALINC to assure online, open access to their full-text files. A comprehensive bibliography has been prepared to provide an additional access point to the polar related resources via the Library's home page. This online bibliography also serves as an Internet locator for printed and remote resources in polar research. It is available via the NCL Bibliographies' home page at: http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/Bibliographies/IPY2007.pdf During the 4 th International Polar Year, the NOAA Library Network collections serve as an important resource for polar data and research. ©2007 MTS.",,"Climatology; Computer graphics; Computer networks; Earth sciences; Internet; Management information systems; Mapping; Maps; Marine applications; Marine biology; Meteorology; Modernization; Multimedia systems; Ocean currents; Ocean engineering; Oceanography; Silver; Surveying; Video recording; World Wide Web; Home pages; Polar research; Electronic document exchange",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50449084713

Indeed, policies in the United States and abroad often target new vehicles as a means to improve fuel economy and reduce passenger vehicle emissions. Although fuel economy and emissions performance of new vehicles are easily compared on an individual basis to the extant vehicle stock, information about longterm aggregate effects is much more difficult to obtain. This project addresses this limitation with the development of an interactive tool that allows users to investigate how scenarios of the penetration of new vehicle technologies would affect future fleet fuel consumption and vehicle emissions (CO, HC, NOx, PM, CO2). The attractiveness of this approach is in the transparency of the assumptions, the ease with which input variables can be manipulated, and the incorporation of uncertainty. Users can vary a number of parameter inputs (e.g., growth of the passenger vehicle fleet, the rates of technological diffusion, and future emissions and fuel economy of these technologies) and generate instantaneous forecasts of pollution and fuel consumption compared with 2005 levels, as well as a baseline technology scenario, for the period 2005 to 2020. Currently, the tool runs as an Excel spreadsheet application with 15 variable inputs and output for four criteria pollutants, CO2, and future fuel consumption. This paper describes the motivation for the model, explains its development as a spreadsheet application, and demonstrates its utility with a number of examples. Future work will improve the sophistication of certain default assumptions and upgrade the software from a spreadsheet application to an interactive website.",,"Interactive forecasting tools; Vehicle stocks; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Costs; Fuel economy; Gasoline; Particulate emissions; Spreadsheets; Fuel consumption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40049109809

The determination of the temperature and mixture field occurs by employing in-flame measurement techniques. Valuable information concerning the mixing procedure, the temperature distribution, the turbulence level and the velocity field of the flame is provided. The results demonstrate that there is sufficient residence time in the pre-combustion area of the lifted flame in order to achieve spatial and temporal uniformity of the mixture, leading to a quasi premixed state. It was also found that hot reaction products, carried upstream by large vortices along the jet, could possibly react with fresh unburnt mixture in a reignition process. The determination of the flow pattern revealed the presence of an inner weak recirculation zone in the nozzle vicinity and a dominant external recirculation zone. The examination of the probability density function (PDF) of the velocity-measurements was also found to be a very useful tool in terms of the analysis of the turbulence structure of the flow. The bimodal distribution yield the existence of large scaled eddies in the shear layer between the downstream flow and the recirculated gases. Finally, the significant reduced NOx emissions in the lean area were also shown by means of emission measurements for elevated pressure conditions.

These changes have taken place during a period in which the primary gases and the wet deposition throughout Europe were extensively monitored. Since the end of the 1970s, for example land based sulphur emissions declined by between 90 and 70% depending on the region. Over the same period the total deposition of sulphur and its partitioning into wet and dry deposition have declined, but the spatial pattern in the reduction in deposition differs from that of emission and has changed with time. Such nonlinearities in the emission-deposition relationship are important to understand as they complicate the process of assessing the effects of emission reduction strategies. Observed non-linearities in terrestrial sulphur emission-deposition patterns have been identified in north west Europe due to increases in marine emissions, and are currently slowing the recovery of freshwater ecosystems. Changes in the relative amounts of SO2 and NH3 in air over the last two decades have also changed the affinity of terrestrial surfaces for SO2 and have therefore changed the deposition velocity of SO2 over substantial areas. The consequence of this effect has been the very rapid reduction in ambient SO2 concentration in some of the major source areas of Europe, where NH3 did not change much. Interactions between the different pollutants, generating non-linearities are now being incorporated in long-range transport models to simulate the effects of historical emission trends and to provide projections into the future. This paper identifies non-linearities in emission deposition relationships for sulphur and nitrogen compounds in Europe using data from the EMEP long-rang transport model and measured concentration fields of the major ions in precipitation and of SO 2 and NO2 in surface air. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","nitrogen; non-linearity; shipping; sulphur; wet and dry deposition",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865174645

This paper presents an overview of the evolution of this increased awareness of climate change issues by policy makers brought about by the strong link between climate science and policy in the state. The State Legislature initiated this link in 1988 with the mandate to prepare an assessment of the potential consequences of climate change to California. Further interactions between science and policy has more recently resulted, in summer of 2006, in the passage of Assembly Bill 32, a law that limits future greenhouse gas emissions in California.

First, we show that the physically-based Canadian RCM (Regional Climate Model) is able to reproduce basin-scale annual runoff within observational errors. The robustness of the CRCM at stimulating annual runoff at the basin scale is studied through an analysis of the model's intrinsic internal noise (i.e., internal variability related to the non-deterministics nature of the climate system), which we find to be small (with the respect to observational errors and the interannual variability of observed runoff). The CRCM's main advantages is that it is constructed with balanced land and atmosphere water and energy budgets, and includes feedbacks between the surface and the atmosphere; providing variables that are all internally consistent. However, due to weaknesses in the representation of snow and land-surface processes in CLASS 2.7, the simulated intra-annual runoff is not adequently reproduced. Sensitivity experiments show that domain size has an important effect on simulated annual runoff, and that surface scheme and driving reanalyses have less influence but still remain significant. These findings imply that not only should the experimental configuration of a simulation be carefully defined according to the area of interest, but also that one must consider results from more than a single RCM simulation. Following these basic steps, more trustworthy climate change data can be provided to water resources managers. Through the provision of an ensemble of regional climate projections, it is then possible to evalaute the climate change signal and the association level of confidence.",,"Climatology; Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Snow; Water management; climate change; energy budget; ensemble forecasting; land surface; modeling; regional climate; runoff; sensitivity analysis; water management; Canada; North America; Quebec [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38749095262

The local frequency of the explosion occurrence, temperature profile and exhaust gas emissions were measured in spray flames of water-in-oil type emulsion formed using an air-assist atomizer with a ring pilot burner. Those results indicate that the flame structure changes as the water droplet diameter in the emulsion fuel was varied, even if the fuel components and their fractions were same. When the fuel includes the water droplet, whose median diameter was about 75μm, HC and CO emission were reduced as compared to those for the fuel of smaller water droplet content. It is probable that if the water droplet diameter is uniform, avalanching microexplosions occur at certain local region in the flame, and the water content vaporizes almost at once and extinguishes the flame. It leads to HC and CO emission increase. When the water droplet diameters are large, atomizer atomizes those; therefore, emulsion droplets include various size of water droplet in the flame. Consequently, the avalanching microexplosion occurrence is avoided, and HC and CO emissions are reduced.

Among them being CO2 sequestration into geological reservoirs including deep saline aquifers, depleted oil/gas reservoirs and coal seams are interested in a powerful means for drastically reducing emissions of CO 2. When CO2 would be injected into geological reservoir, it should be necessary to know the potential of CO2 storing into the reservoir. In this study, amount of CO2 sorption of granite was to evaluate experimentally at temperatures 50, 70, 100 and 200°C and pressure up to 20 MPa using a magnetic suspension balance (MSB), which allows to measure under supercritical condition. As a result, we confirmed that the granite have the potential of CO2 sorption. Sorption isotherms obtained from the MSB experiment showed that amount of CO2 sorption increased with the increasing pressure and decreased with the increasing temperature for all experimental conditions. Especially, amount of CO2 sorption at 50°C compared with that at other temperatures (70, 100 and 200°C) increased rapidly in the vicinity of the critical state. In addition, the granite showed a maximum of CO2 sorption into granite could reach up to about 1.0% by weight at 50°C and 14.4MPa. The present results may provide a fundamental knowledge for the development of CO2 geological sequestration technology. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.","Amount of CO2 sorption; CO2; Geological sequestration; Granite",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248229286

Glass spheres generally show a cone of inelastic deformation under each contact area, and the meridian plane cracks initiate below this cone. Due to symmetric loading they are driven right through the sphere. The significant plastic deformation found in PMMA in compression can be explained by its high-strain rate dependence. For PMMA a close similarity to impact tests conducted by Salman et al. [29] can be obtained if the compression is asymmetric, with soft curve platen on one side and a hard flat one on the other. In this case, an approximately conical region was found at the end loaded by flat platen and as was found in the impact case [29] the meridian crack was initiated from the tip of the cone. For aluminium oxide plastic deformation occurs without any change in the material in the contact area which suggests that densification may have occurred. This material shows a combination of small-scale cracking and displacement of grains in a conical region under the contact area with some degree of localised flow processes that together can be referred to as compression failure. This conical region of compression failure causes a hoop stress and meridian plane cracks to form. Similar fracture patterns are observed in case of fertilizer granules. The normal sequence of events for fertilizer granules is plastic deformation along with disintegration at both ends, followed by splitting into two planes and then continued loading of one or both hemispheres resulting in failure by cracks along meridian planes. The calcium carbonate granules fail by flattening of the contact area. This flattening may form a compacted cone followed by meridian cracks. It is thought that during compression the energy generated in the compression is dissipated when the conical volume is indented into the granule structure generating a wedging action, thus inducing tensile hoop stress along oblique and meridian planes leading to fracture of granules. Internal tensile stress may be responsible for the lateral increase in diameter. The failure pattern remains more or less similar for roughly spherical granules. However, the loading at which failure occurs will depend on factors such as type and amount of binder, primary particle size and manufacturing process conditions. There have also been a large number of careful experiments on annealed spheres, hemispheres and quadrants which gives clear evidence of a different mode of failure. Meridian plane cracks form first, with subsequent fragments, including the characteristically shaped region of crushing along the axis that was also seen by others, occurring as secondary failures. If cone cracks occur, they are contained within segments, and do not directly contribute to fragmentation processes. For wet granules there were two observed modes of failure, namely brittle and plastic. At low speeds, the pellets were found to display brittle behaviour and fail by large-scale cracking. Conversely, at high-compression speeds, pellets instead failed by uniform plastic flow. For binderless granules, at strains beyond the elastic limit they experienced irreversible deformation as a result of densification at the contact zone. Failure of these granules is first by meridian crack propagation, resulting in the splitting of the granule into two hemispheres. Secondary fracture results in each hemisphere splitting into further fragments of varying size and shape. A small cone-shaped fragment of granular material was found adhering to each compression platen after the fractured granule was removed. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The primary goals of the test are to evaluate the performance and cycle life of traction batteries for future PHEV Sprinter Van production using PHEV test profiles. The test profile replicates the most demanding urban driving conditions for the battery (i.e., low speed, high acceleration in charge-sustained HEV mode at low battery state of charge). It also uses a combination of HEV and EV driving modes to represent over 50% of statistical daily trips. One cycle includes three modes: (1) charge depletion mode, simulating the EV operation, (2) charge sustained mode, simulating the HEV operation, and (3) recharge mode, simulating the plug-in operation. This paper focuses on the SAFT Li Ion technology. The SAFT battery technology shows encouraging results from simulated PHEV tests; one test cycle represents an average daily operation of a PHEV Sprinter Van (i.e., a 2.6-hour, 50-mile drive).","Battery; Li-Ion; Life-cycle; PHEV; SAFT","Accelerated testing; Battery; Battery state of charge; Battery technology; Battery tests; Charge depletion; Cycle lives; Daimler-chrysler; Driving conditions; Driving mode; Grid electricity; High acceleration; Li-Ion; Li-ion technology; Lithium ions; Low speed; Nickel metal hydride; Operating efficiency; Paper documents; Petroleum consumption; PHEV; Plug-ins; Plugin hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV); SAFT; Southern California; Test cycles; Traction battery; Urban areas; Electric drives; Electric vehicles; Exhibitions; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Sustainable development; Technology; Testing; Lithium batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872014700

To control and reduce tailpipe pollutants, it is critical to understand in-use emissions as a basis for any future emission controls. At present, emission factors are mainly studied by chassis dynamometer methods. However, concerns have been raised about the extent to which emissions produced by on-road vehicles can be predicted using emission factors developed based on standardized dynamometer test procedures. This paper describes an on-board, in-use vehicle emissions measurement system which measures tailpipe emission rates while the vehicle is in real service experiencing complex traffic conditions, driver behavior and weather. The instantaneous mass flow rate (g/s) of fuel and five typical emission gases (NOx, HC, CO, CO2, O 2) are recorded along with operating parameters such as mass air flow, vehicle speed, engine speed, ambient temperature, coolant temperature, etc. The equipment consists of an ECM OBD-II scanner, a mass air flow meter and two emissions analyzers, coordinated and recorded by a laptop computer. The measurement package is adapted for easy transition from vehicle to vehicle and, at only 17 kg (38 lbs), has minimal impact on vehicle operation. The paper presents a set of vehicle emission factors based on sixty on-road tests with five typical mid-life vehicles in urban, highway and aggressive driving situations. Tailpipe emission factors for HC, CO and NOx are developed in terms of g/kW.h, g/km and g/kgFuel. Based on these emission functions and the idle emission rate measurements, an emission model is developed for estimating the variation of tailpipe cumulative emissions for vehicles experiencing real-world driving conditions which are significantly different from the standard test sequences.

At the same time, efficient resource management becomes a vital process at the governmental and transnational companies’ levels. Therefore, a competent classification and structuring of all reserves and resources will be inevitable soon to improve their accurate estimates and effective management in various aspects, including resource availability, technical feasibility, and environmental-socio-economic viability. The importance of the latter is indisputable since social and environmental stability is an essential component of the country's sustainable economic development policy. From this perspective, the United Nations Framework Classification for Resources (UNFC) is seen as a tool to help accomplish these tasks and provide simple screening and verification procedures for evaluating future investment projects. Given that hydrocarbon reserves make a significant contribution to the economy, a study on the application and adaptation of UNFC to local petroleum resource management has been granted as a pilot project to assess the feasibility of its further implementation for other energy and mineral reserves and resources of the country. The UNFC current state analysis as a global standard for classifying energy and mineral resources and their applications is carried out to launch the project. The review covers various case studies, including the classification of hydrocarbon reserves and resources (HCRR) using UNFC (Mexico project, transition projects to the classification of the Russian Federation, etc.), as well as mineral resources in different countries. The research primary goal is to screen different approaches and techniques to assess the practicality of their application to petroleum reserves and resources of Azerbaijan in transferring currently used old Former Soviet Union HCRR classification to UNFC, possibly via PRMS.

Impediments for agricultural applications include modest forecast skill, limited climate predictability, inappropriate forecast scale for site-specific applications, difficulties in interpretation of probabilistic forecasts by farmers and integration into agricultural decision systems, uncertainty about the value and effect of forecast information in multi-variable decision system, and generally low frequency of relevant forecasts. Various research institutions have conducted case studies of climate effects on agricultural production systems, particularly effects of historical ENSO signals in the south-eastern United States. Several studies addressed risk and economic values of seasonal climate forecasts, and others bridged the gap between current forecasting software and products and agricultural applications. These studies attest to the availability and suitability of forecast and impact-prediction software, as well as derived products for agricultural applications. Yet, little attention has been given to operational and application-specific prediction products for general agricultural use, and to an effective and affordable delivery system that reaches and resonates with the agricultural end-user (a prerequisite for adoption). The two latter impediments are the focus of this paper. Two existing approaches, the top-down and the participatory end-to-end approach for development and delivery of prediction products, are reviewed. A third approach, the hybrid approach, is emphasised and uses the top-down approach for climate forecast delivery and a participatory approach for development and delivery of farm-specific prediction information for the agricultural end-user. Suitability of such prediction products for agricultural applications and constraints to successful adoption are also discussed. © CSIRO 2007.","Application; Decision","agricultural application; climate prediction; decision support system; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; forecasting method; information; participatory approach; North America; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37349127599

Our observations show that their midinfrared spectra are dominated by the simultaneous presence of strong and broad amorphous silicate absorption features together with crystalline silicate features, originated in their O-rich circumstellar shells. Of the five sources observed, three are clearly nonvariable at infrared wavelengths, confirming their post-AGB status, while the remaining two still show strong photometric fluctuations and may still have not yet departed from the AGB. One of the nonvariable sources in the sample, IRAS 17393-2727, displays a strong [Ne ii] nebular emission at 12.8 mm, indicating that the ionization of its central region has already started. This suggests a rapid evolution from the AGB to the PN stage. We propose that these heavily obscured OHPNe represent the population of high-mass precursors of PNe in our Galaxy. © 2007.

For six local case studies on the south coast of the UK, difficulties in meeting the requirements of the EC Habitats Directive within individual case study areas were found. The most significant issues were related to intertidal saltmarsh and mudflat areas, which decline under all the sea-level rise scenarios considered. Compensation for these losses in some localities could be achieved through the creation of replacement habitat by the managed realignment of sea defences, often in conjunction with engineered sediment supply to raise intertidal surfaces to levels conducive to vegetation establishment. However, historic land use decisions will restrict this approach in many areas. In particular, managed realignment will lead to a decline in coastal grazing marsh, also a designated habitat under the Directive. However, at wider scales potential exists to compensate for lost coastal grazing marsh with fluvial grazing marsh in adjoining river catchments, although the functionality of the habitat may change. Spatial planning offers the potential for future land-banking of these areas, but its implementation may require a reinterpretation of the application of the Habitats Directive.",,"Catchments; Climate change; Coastal engineering; Ecology; Land use; Landforms; Law enforcement; Laws and legislation; Rivers; Sedimentation; Sediments; Wetlands; Case studies; Coastal habitats; Coastal management; Institution of Civil Engineers; International conferences; Land-use decisions; Mud flats; River catchments; Salt marshes; Sea defences; Sea-level rise; Sediment supply; Spatial planning; Ocean habitats",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52649122697

A case study of the TNEB network in India is used to demonstrate the reduction in CO2 emissions that are possible with this concept.

In Europe, light-duty diesels are the technology of choice for many consumers (""good, clean, green fun""), while in the United States, diesels face significant regulatory certification hurdles. Moreover, U.S. consumers are more interested in hybrids as a solution for improving fuel efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions. The objective of this paper is to assess U.S. attitudes about hybrid and diesel technologies and behavior of those who purchase these technologies. With survey research, the attitudes of likely diesel and hybrid new car buyers are compared, and the actual driving behavior of new owners of diesels and hybrids is examined. Significant differences were found in both cases. Significant attitudinal differences exist across 20 questions spanning regulatory and environmental issues, with likely hybrid buyers being more environmentally concerned and willing to accept tougher regulatory standards. Hybrid drivers logged fewer annual miles and had a higher percentage of in-city driving. Hybrid buyers generally traded in vehicles that were newer, had better fuel economy, and had smaller engines than did diesel buyers. Both hybrid and diesel drivers saw significant fuel savings with their new vehicles. Because of the bigger improvement from their previous cars and the greater number of miles per year that they drove, however, diesel owners saved more fuel than did new hybrid owners (420 gal per year compared with 275 gal). Acknowledging these differences in public attitudes and behavior is a necessary first step in the development of strategies to reduce mobile source greenhouse gas emissions.",,"Driving behaviors; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Diesel fuels; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Gasoline; Fuel economy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40049098948

Where the diesel engine has an advantage by principle, the efficiency of the SI engine has to be improved significantly, while of course there must be no deterioration in exhaust emissions. Another approach is to switch from gasoline to gaseous fuels such as compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) with more appropriate C/H ratios in order to reach the CO2 targets. Both methods of using liquid and gaseous fuels in an SI engine take into account that the air/fuel mixtures in the combustion chamber turn to a lean air/fuel ratio to increase engine efficiency, whether by stratification or air dilution. The challenge in this case is to solve the conflict between high efficiency and low raw emissions, especially in the field of NOx emission. Ignition itself increasingly becomes a relevant parameter to reach the most efficient combustion, with common ignition systems being limited in terms of energy and spark position. There are currently two competing systems offering potential for igniting a greater mixture volume and lead from local dependency of the spark; these are laser ignition on the one hand and plasma torch systems on the other. IAV has studied the potential of a plasma torch system, using a pre-chamber for mixture preparation to generate an optimized jet flame. This paper presents results from numerical simulation, optical investigations and engine testing to give an overview of the ignition system's potential regarding engine operation under lean burn conditions.

These include an altered energy exchange creating an urban heat island, and changes to hydrology such as increased surface runoff of rainwater. Such changes are, in part, a result of the altered surface cover of the urban area. For example less vegetated surfaces lead to a decrease in evaporative cooling, whilst an increase in surface sealing results in increased surface runoff. Climate change will amplify these distinctive features.

A major concern for regulatory agencies when evaluating bioremediation is how to determine acceptable levels for residual organics in soil. Although guidelines have been developed for some organics in soil, limited information is available to define acceptable levels of the metabolites of biological degradation. The products of oxidative degradation are likely to be more water soluble and may also be more toxic. The purpose of the current study was to monitor changes in compound concentration and genotoxicity in soils undergoing bioremediation. The site selected for this study was a former wood-preserving site in the northwestern United States. Soil samples were collected over a 4-year period from two 6075-m2 land treatment units. Conditions for biodegradation were enhanced by the addition of water and nutrients, as well as by frequent tilling to add oxygen. Due to the location of the facility, the temperature was conducive to a more rapid rate of biodegradation for approximately 6 months per year. Soil samples were collected using a grid system and solvent extracted. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were quantified in soil extracts using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and genotoxicity measured using the Salmonella/microsome assay. After 2 years of treatment, concentrations of total and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were reduced to approximately 10% the concentration in the untreated soil. However, the mean weighted activity of the untreated soil was 293 net revertants per g soil, whereas the extracts of soil collected after 2 years induced a mean weighted activity of 325 net revertants per g soil. Thus, although biodegradation clearly reduced the concentration of total and carcinogenic PAHs in the surface soils, the results from the genotoxicity bioassay indicate that there was a lag in the reduction of mutagenicity in treated soils. © 2007 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Biodegradation; Genotoxicity; Land treatment; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons","Biological degradation; Carcinogenic PAHs; Cost-effective technology; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Genotoxicities; Grid systems; Land treatment; Limited information; Mutagenicity; Northwestern United States; Organics; Oxidative degradation; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons(PAHs); Polycyclic aromatics; Rapid rate; Regulatory agencies; Soil extracts; Soil sample; Surface soil; Treated soils; Watersoluble; Bioassay; Biodegradation; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Gas chromatography; Land reclamation; Microbiology; Petroleum chemistry; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Soil surveys; Soils; Solvent extraction; Waste treatment; Soil pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863229788

The sustainability of the U.S. carbon sink and the extent of fire activity in the next 100 yr depend in part on the type and effectiveness of fire reduction employed. Previous studies have bracketed the range of dynamics from continued fire reduction to the complete failure of fire reduction activities. To improve these estimates, it is necessary to explicitly account for fire reduction in terrestrial models. A new fire reduction submodel that estimates the spatiotemporal pattern of reduction across the United States was developed using gridded data on biomass, climate, land-use, population, and economic factors. To the authors' knowledge, it is the first large-scale, gridded fire model that explicitly accounts for fire reduction. The model was calibrated to 1° × 1° burned area statistics [Global Burnt Area 2000 Project (GBA-2000)] and compared favorably to three important diagnostics. The model was then implemented in a spatially explicit ecosystem model and used to analyze 1620 scenarios of future fire risk and fire reduction strategies. Under scenarios of climate change and urbanization, burned area and carbon emissions both increased in scenarios where fire reduction efforts were not adjusted to match new patterns of fire risk. Fuel reducing management strategies reduced burned area and fire risk, but also limited carbon storage. These results suggest that to promote carbon storage and minimize fire risk in the future, fire reduction efforts will need to be increased and spatially adjusted and will need to employ a mixture of fuel-reducing and non-fuel-reducing strategies.","Carbon storage; Fire model; Fire suppression","Climate change; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Forestry; Fuel storage; Fuels; Land use; Population statistics; Risk perception; Storage management; Sustainable development; Carbon storage; Environmental issues; Fire modeling; Fire suppression; Management strategies; Reduction activity; Spatiotemporal patterns; Terrestrial models; Fires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72449120798

Measurements of smoke emissions using each fuel in two commercial vehicles were made with a light extinction opacity meter and the SAE J1667 snap acceleration test method. Emission opacity from each engine was significantly reduced (p<0.05) with both the e-diesel and soy-diesel blends compared to No. 2 on-road diesel. In addition, opacity was significantly lower in both engines with the e-diesel blend compared to soy-diesel. Overall, relative to conventional petroleum diesel fuel, smoke emissions were reduced by 9% and 32% using the soydiesel and e-diesel fuels, respectively. These results indicate that as part of a comprehensive air quality improvement program for the Mid-Atlantic region, e-diesel blends can provide significantly more emission reductions than biodiesel blends in diesel powered engines for both on- and off-road vehicles and power units.","Biofuels; Diesel emissions; e-diesel; Particulate matter","Diesel emissions; E-diesel; Particulate matter; Soydiesel; Air quality; Biofuels; Biomass; Diesel fuels; Engines; Ethanol; Particulate emissions; Smoke abatement",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35748939709

Design/methodology/approach - A total of 12 managers of environmental non-profit organizations were interviewed to identify and classify their responses to a single external fiscal shock. These organizations are connected by a social capital network, their national association, Green Communities Canada. The social economy and ecological economics literatures are reviewed to construct a definition of green community entrepreneurship. Interview respondents identified factors which facilitate this process. Findings - The need for green community entrepreneurship was driven by two interrelated issues (a loss of external government funding, and an associated market collapse for residential energy audits), and facilitated by three main factors (external social capital network flows, internal human capital stocks, and strategic partnerships). Research limitations/implications - Future research should examine other social economy organizations to determine if the dynamics discovered here are unique to green community organizations delivering climate change programs or apply more generally.

After a detailed calibration on the last 30 years and validation on recent periods, quantitative interpretations can be drawn from the groundwater model results. Considering IPCC climate change scenarios, it appears that, on a multi-annual basis, most tested scenarios predict a decreasing trend in groundwater levels in the Geer basin.

Because of the regional nature of this pollutant, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) required the States to undertake large reductions in nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions by 2004 to address long-range transport of ozone and its precursors as part of their State Implementation Plans (SIPs). As a result of this control program, referred to as the ""NOx SIP Call"", 21 states in the eastern United States have achieved substantial NOx reductions from the utility sector by 2004. This emission control strategy should greatly reduce ambient ground-level ozone in the eastern United States. A systematic tracking of air quality achievements is necessary to properly evaluate U.S. policy and program results in protecting public health and the environment. Consequently, EPA has undertaken a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of this control program to meet its objectives. In this paper, integrated observational and modeling methodologies are described in order to assess the impact of NOx emission reductions on maximum ozone concentrations. In particular, the emphasis in this paper is on selected results from the photochemical modeling effort. A set of modeling scenarios was performed that included point source NOx emission measurements from extended summer periods before and after implementation of the emission reductions. The model results revealed discernable decreases in daily maximum 8-h ozone in downwind areas of a major point source emission region exhibiting substantial NOx emission reductions, and the impacts were found to be greater at higher ozone values, which is a desirable benefit of the control program. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

RF-DC dispersion, known as current collapse, seems to be related with carriers being trapped at the AlGaN surface. The use of a preprocessing N2-plasma treatment of the surface seems to have no effective improvement, in comparison with that of the prepassivation processing step. A set of three AlGaN/GaN heterostructures, subject to various surface treatment and cleaning procedures, have been studied. A reduction of ΔVth = (1.3 ±0.4) V for the pinch off voltage and of Δn5 = (-2.4 ±0.3) cm-2 for the 2DEG charge density were found, for the three samples. The N2-plasma treated samples showed a modification on the surface states and consequently a worsening of the initial characteristics of the surface. On the other side, an annealing post-processing shows a layer oxidation that modifies the electron distance to the surface δWB = (-5 ±2) nm, and increases the 2DEG charge density, δns = (1.4 ±0.3) cm-2. Finally from XPS results, a contamination of oxygen, carbon and fluorine was found.

The goal of this study is to evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of using small to medium scale modern technologies to exploit the co-production of two of the major forms of energy that can be derived from the sugar cane plant: ethanol (by fermentation and distillation of the cane juice) and electricity (by cogeneration of bagasse). The market potential for ethanol, electricity and carbon credits (for associated emissions reduction) is examined and a site selection analysis is performed to decide the most suitable location within the Non-Interconnected Zones (NZI) in Colombia. Development scenarios are constructed and analyzed in the context of the markets identified, combining different alternative technologies. Production costs of sugar cane, investment costs, operating costs, labour costs and maintenance costs are estimated for each development scenario, and economic and financial characteristics are quantified and compared, to determine which options are the most attractive. The study identifies that the key factors which affect the feasibility of distilleries with CHP systems in Colombia are: 1) specific location and conditions, 2) type of technologies used, efficiencies and maximum capacities of production, 3) total investment costs, 4) incomes for ethanol, electricity and emissions reduction and 5) national and global incentives.

Over the past 10 years, ozone technology has made the cross-over to the environmental remediation industry creating a viable and cost effective option for the in-situ destruction of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in soil and groundwater. Ozone works by oxidizing and breaking the bonds of targeted VOC(s) such as methylene tert-butyl ether (MTBE). The ozone oxidizes the dissolved-phase MTBE, the primary constituent of concern at the study site, and creates an oxygen-rich environment that encourages microbial degradation of MTBE breakdown products such as tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) and tert-butyl formate (TBF). The byproducts of complete oxidation and microbial degradation of MTBE in groundwater include carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). The study site is a former aggregate mining facility located in Southern California that operated several diesel and gasoline fuel tanks until the late 1990s for fueling facility vehicles and cement trucks. Upon removal, it was determined that the tanks and associated product piping had leaked significantly resulting in an approximately 50,000 ft2 (aerial extent) source area with adsorbed- and liquid-phase fuel hydrocarbons, and an approximately 100,000 ft2 MTBE plume that included a small fraction of dissolved-phase BTEX near the source area. Because of a fast-track property transaction, the client preferred remedial options that would meet relatively stringent site cleanup goals within a short timeframe. To address the aggressive remediation schedule and cleanup requirements, Brown and Caldwell implemented a 2-phased approach that included: 1) removal of source area fuel impact by excavation with subsequent soil remediation via biopile treatment, and 2) remediation of dissolved-phase MTBE via ozone sparging. The objective of the source area removal was to remediate adsorbed-and liquia-phase hydrocarbons and reduce further impacts to groundwater via leaching. Source area removal resulted in the excavation of nearly 50,000 cubic yards (yd3) of soil. Out of the total 50,000 yd3, 17,000 yd3 was considered impacted and was staged for passive remediation in a series of 17-1,000 yd3 ""biopiles"" or treatment cells. The objective of the ozone sparging phase is to restore groundwater quality to regulatory-imposed standards within 7 months to expedite property reclamation and transfer. The remediation network includes 16 sparge wells constructed with ozone diffusers to reduce bubble size and maximize surface area contact.

Although the Morrison Formation has recently been interpreted as a semiarid lowland savannah on the basis of geological and paleobiological indicators, many microenvironments within this system are more consistent with new interpretations of the Morrison as a ground-water dominated ""wetland"" deposit. Here we report new fossils from a little-studied exposure of the Morrison Formation in and around Temple Canyon Park near Cañon City, Colorado. The Temple Canyon section shows a relatively thin sequence of conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, mudstone, and limestone beds representing alluvial to fluvial and possibly lacustrine deposition. The section rests on Precambrian basement and is unconformably overlain by the Lower Cretaceous Lytle Formation. The mudstone and limestone beds preserve an abundant fossil flora and fauna distinct from those previously described from the Morrison Formation. The floral assemblage includes species of algae, bryophytes, ferns, ginkgophytes, horsetails, cycads, bennettites, and conifers; together these plants indicate a warm climate with abundant local water supply. The faunal assemblage contains ostracodes, conchostracans, traces of aquatic insect larvae, a terrestrial insect body fossil, prosobranch and pulmonate gastropods, many species of fish, a possible frog, and rare turtle remains. The presence of prosobranch gastropods, fish, and aquatic insect larvae suggests a perennial water body with high oxygen content, while the presence of conchostracans and pulmonate gastropods may indicate some fluctuation in water quality. © 2007 The Geological Society of America.

These collapses were caused by changes in the local system brought about by a combination of natural and human activity. So, for example, the Mayan and Anasazi civilizations developed agricultural technologies during periods when the climate was favorable. The result was an expanded population which could not be supported when extended droughts occurred. But collapse was not inevitable; all of these cultures made choice; indeed, some like the Anasazi survived by changing practices. Our global civilizations have now created the anthropocene, in which human, natural and technological systems are inextricably intertwined. Human activity can, in a very short time, create holes in the ozone layer and change the climate across the entire planet. According to Brad Allenby, our species has a responsibility to manage the global ecosystem. Indeed, it the key to the survival of civilization.

It is expected to localise ∼80 GRBs/yr, thanks to the on-board real time event processing. The GRBs (and other transients) coordinates will be distributed within a few seconds from the onset of the burst with a typical uncertainty of ∼5-10 arcmin. The detection system will also include a soft X-ray camera (1-10 keV) allowing to study in detail the prompt soft X-ray emission and to reduce the error box for about half of the GRBs seen by ECLAIRs to ∼30 arcsec. ECLAIRs is expected to be flown in late 2011 and to be the only instrument capable of providing GRB triggers with sufficient localisation accuracy for GRB follow-up observations with the powerful ground based spectroscopic telescopes available by then.

Basic research work has been performed to improve the fundamental understanding of ferroalloy processes and the environmental aspects. This paper will present work dealing with the understanding of formation and control of NOx, PAH and dioxins. During this work various techniques and methods have been applied, such as comprehensive industrial measurements, laboratory experiments, model development and application of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The main goal has been to reduce the environmental impact of ferroalloy plants, by means of improving the combustion processes done by introducing new charging routines and optimized furnace operations, instead of installing expensive gas treatment systems. The Norwegian obligations in accordance with the Gothenburg protocol are to reduce the NOx emissions by 30%, compared with the 1990 level within 2010. Measures developed in this work have resulted in 40-60% reduction in NOx emission, and major reductions in PA H and dioxins for ferrosilicon and silicon metal plants. This has been achieved by introducing semi continuous charging and improved furnace operations. Semi continuous charging and optimized furnace operations are shown to reduce the blowing activity (i.e. emission of large quantity of SiO over the charge by direct channelling from the crater zone). It also reduces variation in off-gas temperature and dust production. To understand the processes and to achieve our results we have used online equipment, with fast sample rates and response times, to measure the off-gas compositions and temperatures. Most of the measuring techniques used are based upon optical principles making use of the absorption- and emission spectrum of the gases. In addition a new prototype instrument is developed for continuous measurement of off-gas characteristics, total dust amount and off-gas temperature. The presented work is a result of a long term co-operation research and development teamwork, between the industry and the research community, and has improved both the process and reduced the emissions. The work has introduced new process design and operation standards, and has resulted in ferroalloy production with better environmental standards.",,"Basic research; Combustion pro-cess; Continuous measurements; Design and operations; Dust production; Emission spectrums; Environmental aspects; Environmental standards; Furnace operations; Gas treatment; Industrial measurements; Laboratory experiments; Measuring technique; Model development; NOx Emissions; Prototype instrument; Research and development; Research communities; Sample rate; Semi-continuous; Alloys; Computational fluid dynamics; Dust; Emission spectroscopy; Furnaces; Gases; Industry; Nitrogen oxides; Optimization; Organic pollutants; Research; Silicon compounds; Silicon oxides; Silicon steel; Standards; Gas plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857747053

Problems often arise with demonstrating compliance, especially when the goal of noise control is very low acoustic emission and the noise control actions are implemented successfully. Compliance is most easily demonstrated by making noise measurements at each receiver, but at large distances there is a problem of separating low-level plant noise emission from non-plant ambient community noise. Verifying compliance by extrapolating measured data has proven practicable. An additional measurement location is selected that has a very favorable plant signal to ambient noise ratio, plus other attributes. The additional location needs to be between the plant and the receiver, selected carefully to maintain a line-of-sight to the plant, and avoid interfering buildings and ground clutter. This location's measured noise levels are mathematically extrapolated to demonstrate compliance. The method increases accuracy of plant noise contribution by reducing contamination from non-plant ambient noises. While this method is intuitive to acoustical engineers, it is a more difficult sell to some governmental regulators and contract compliance attorneys. The method has been used to verify noise compliance of power plants, and is recognized by the California Energy Commission.",,"Ambient noise; California energy commissions; Community noise; Control actions; Ground clutter; Industrial facilities; Line-of-sight; Measurement locations; Noise contributions; Noise emissions; Noise levels; Noise measurements; Acoustic emissions; Acoustic variables control; Extrapolation; Regulatory compliance; Acoustic noise",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867833509

The TRU is used to provide refrigerated space during the transport of fruits, vegetables, meat, pharmaceuticals, beverages, and any other product that needs a temperature controlled environment while being transported. TRUs are used in all modes of transport, on rail cars, on ocean going shipping containers, over the road truck trailers and even on airplane Unit Load Devices. Policy making bodies, understanding the adverse effects of diesel emissions, noise pollution, and fuel consumption have started to pass legislation in an effort to curtail transport diesel emissions. At the local level many states as well as some municipalities have instituted policy designed to eliminate these sources of pollution. This paper examines the impact of emissions from TRU diesel engines and details the design, construction and performance of both a fuel cell powered APU and a fuel cell powered TRU.

Average fuel-based emission factors derived from the remote sensing measurements were compared with corresponding emission factors derived from IVE calculations for urban, hot stabilized condition. The results show a good agreement between the two methods for gasoline passenger cars' HC emission for all IVE subsectors and technology classes. In the case of CO emissions, the modeled results were reasonably good, although systematically underestimate the emissions by almost 12%-50% for different technology classes. However, the model totally overestimated NOA emissions. The IVE NOA emission factors were 1.5-3.5 times of the remote sensing measured ones. The IVE model was also evaluated for light duty gasoline truck, heavy duty gasoline vehicles and motor cycles. A notable result was observed that the decrease in emissions from technology class State II to State I were overestimated by the IVE model compared to remote sensing measurements for all the three pollutants. Finally, in order to improve emission estimation, the adjusted base emission factors from local studies are strongly recommended to be used in the IVE model. © 2007 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","evaluation; fuel-based emission factor; IVE model; remote sensing","Computer simulation; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Remote sensing; Vehicles; Fuel-based emission factor; International vehicle emission model; Air pollution; carbon monoxide; gasoline; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxide; Air pollution; Computer simulation; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Remote sensing; Vehicles; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; data set; developing world; environmental protection; environmental technology; estimation method; measurement method; modeling; remote sensing; traffic emission; air pollutant; article; China; environmental monitoring; evaluation; exhaust gas; methodology; theoretical model; Air Pollutants; Carbon Monoxide; China; Environmental Monitoring; Gasoline; Hydrocarbons; Models, Theoretical; Nitrogen Oxides; Vehicle Emissions; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Hangzhou; Zhejiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447117002

Some early studies suggest that fullerenes and nanotubes may pose significant health risks, and this has given rise to an emerging literature on carbon nanotoxicology. This young field has now begun to yield insight into toxicity mechanisms and the specific material features involved in those mechanisms. This paper explores the potential to alter those material features through post-processing or reformulation with the goal of reducing or eliminating carbon nanomaterial health risks. The paper emphasizes the important roles of metal content and bioavailability, carbon surface chemistry, and nanomaterial aggregation state. The nanotechnology movement has been given a unique ""window of opportunity"" to systematically investigate the toxicity of nanotechnology products and to develop ways to manage health risks before large scale manufacturing becomes widespread.","Carbon nanotubes; Fullerenes; Purification; Surface chemistry; Toxicity","Carbon nanotubes; Environmental impact; Fullerenes; Health risks; Surface chemistry; Toxicity; Carbon nanomaterials; Carbon nanotoxicology; Environmental safety; Nanostructured materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38349130273

This paper reviews the methodological approach pursued, and findings from the first phase of 12 POE studies undertaken by students of the MSc Energy Efficient and Sustainable Building course run at Oxford Brookes University (Oxford, UK). The 12 buildings studied cover a whole range of OCC's non-domestic estate: seven community centres, two modern office buildings, two leisure centres and one old Town Hall. The overall POE methodology involves an energy and environmental audit of these buildings, as well as a thermal comfort assessment of their occupants. It therefore includes both hard and soft issues of building energy performance. Recommendations are then made to improve the building performance in terms of energy, environmental impact and occupant satisfaction (thermal comfort); these are often sub-divided into no-cost, low-cost, medium-cost and high-cost measures for ease of implementation. Findings from these 12 POE studies shows that potentially about 30% of CO 2 emissions could be reduced cost-effectively using a combination of 'no-cost' and 'low-cost' measures, whilst above 50% emissions are technically-possibly. Particularly, the improvements in the building fabric would also improve the comfort for occupants, highlighted as a key concern in the thermal comfort assessments of these buildings. In fact some of the measures proposed are being adopted in the refurbishment of these buildings. Since such building-types represent the building stock of any city in the UK or elsewhere, these findings are generic, and may therefore provide a useful example for other cities in their endeavour for emission reductions. It also shows how City councils can become agents of change in the efforts to mitigate the worst impacts of climate change.","Carbon emissions; Non-domestic buildings; Post-occupancy evaluation","Building energy performance; Building performance; Building stocks; Carbon emissions; City council; Climate change mitigation; Emission reduction; Energy efficient; Environmental audit; Methodological approach; Occupant satisfaction; Post occupancy evaluation; Soft issues; Sustainable building; Architecture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Intelligent buildings; Office buildings; Teaching; Thermal comfort; Costs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864115155

However, field experience and measurements show that the characteristics of weak snowpack layers, including type, structure and details of formation, are primary indicators of avalanches that form. Despite its importance in the characteristics of local avalanche activity, weak-layer information is currently not a formal part of any snow-climate classification scheme. The focus of this study is the analysis of persistent snowpack weak layers in southwestern Canada. Observations from the industrial information exchange (InfoEx) of the Canadian Avalanche Association are used to examine the frequency, sequence and distribution of the most common types of snowpack weakness and their related avalanche activity. The results show significant temporal and spatial variations in areas with the same snow-climate characteristics. The weak-layer patterns observed in transitional snow-climate areas are clearly more complex than a simple combination of maritime and continental influences. 'Avalanche winter regime' is suggested as a new classification term that describes the snowpack structures relevant for local avalanche activity and complements the existing snow-climate classification system.

Metal recycling contributes to reducing air and other emissions by reducing energy consumption 65-95% compared to primary metal production. Since the metals industry is now the major source of metal air emissions, air pollution control technology which has been successfully applied in the coal power industry should be effective in the metals industry.

In order to accomplish this necessary change, architects and all the personnel in the building and construction fields must be aware of and trained in the issues and techniques related to carbon-neutral buildings and communities. Subsequently, Mazria issued the Architecture 2010 Imperative (that all schools teach carbonneutral design by 2010) and spearheaded the February 20, 2007, emergency teach-in webcast available to students and faculty nationwide. The University of Idaho's McCall Field Campus project presented itself as an ideal vehicle for this experiment because it had a willing client eager to discover the carbonneutral possibilities for the site, which is a wooded 11 acres on Payette Lake and is surrounded by the much larger Ponderosa State Park. Moreover, my teaching colleagues in Interior Design and Landscape Architecture were eager to enlist their graduating students in an interdisciplinary quest for solutions to the problem. This paper reports on successes and problems encountered in addressing the concept of carbon-neutral design and planning in a studio project in the context of 25 years of experience in teaching passive, low-energy, and sustainability issues in architecture studios. In general the students embraced the project and understood the concept. Their designs reflected emphasis on carbon-neutrality through frugality and innovative thinking. Informational resources that allowed computation of carbon debt for construction methods and materials were difficult to find. Beyond the success of the students' work, their projects have also served as a catalyst for university-wide discussion and interdisciplinary cooperation toward creating a more sustainable campus.",,"Building and construction; Construction method; Design and planning; Innovative thinking; Interior designs; Landscape architecture; Low energies; Sustainability issues; Architectural design; Climate change; Commerce; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Marketing; Students; Studios; Sustainable development; Teaching; Carbon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867840233

The GHP was established in 1995 to contribute to the WCRP objective of ""developing the fundamental scientific understanding of the physical climate system and climate processes needed to determine to what extent climate can be predicted and the extent of man's influence on climate"". More specifically, the GHP contributed to the GEWEX objectives such as ""determining the hydrological cycle and energy fluxes, modelling the global hydrological cycle and its impact, developing a capability to predict variations in global and regional hydrological processes and fostering the development of observing techniques, data management and assimilation systems"". GHP activities included diagnosis, simulation and prediction of regional water balances by various process and modelling studies aimed at understanding and predicting the variability of the global water cycle, with anemphasis on regional coupled land-atmosphere processes. GHP efforts were central to providing a scientific basis for assessing critical science issues such as the consequences of climate change for the intensification of the global hydrological cycle and its potential impactson regional water resources. This paper discusses the more relevant scientific issues relating to hydrology addressed by the GHP in collaboration with the international science community, in particular the IAHS Predictions in Ungauged Basins (PUB) initiative. GHP activities have now been formally merged with the Coordinated Enhanced Observation Period (CEOP) I and II activities to form a new body, called the Coordinated Energy and water-cycle Observations Project (CEOP), which will continue to foster large-scale hydroclimate research. Within GHP and now within CEOP the Water Resources Applications Project (WRAP) was established in 2000 to facilitate the broader use of GEWEX products in water resource applications and initially promoted dialogue between the GEWEX community and the water resources community. With members from each of the RHPs, IAHS, UNESCO programmes, and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), this group provided a wide range of expertise related to water management. WRAP relied on the development of physically-based hydrology and ""application"" or decision support models, and the coupling of these models with regional climate models. Application studies require a capability to downscale largearea (model grid square) precipitation forecasts and observed averages, statistical analyses of the relationships between SST anomaliesandseasonal streamflow, and analysis of the value and utility of seasonal forecasts in water management decisions. WRAP is now evolving toward a Hydrologic Applications Project (HAP) which was defined in October 2006 together with the ""Roadmap"" for the remainder ofthe Second Phase of GEWEX (2006-2012). This paper summarises the achievements to date of GEWEX pertaining to hydrology and gives an indicationof the planned hydrological focus of the project over the next five years. It also discusses the more relevant scientific issues relating to IAHS hydrological issues to be addressed by CEOP, including the IAHS Predictions in Ungauged Basins (PUB) initiative.

Global interest in tropical forests is more and more focused on their role in the global carbon cycle from the perspective of carbon emissions produced by deforestation (e.g., Detwiler and Hall 1988) and their potential role to store carbon (e.g. Brown et al. 1993), as well as concern for conservation of species and ecosystems. Climate Action Projects (CAPs) in the developing tropics, financed by the developed world, are put forth as one means to satisfy both carbon emission offsets and conservation of threatened ecosystems (Brown, Masera, and Sathaye 2000). Forest conservation, or averted deforesta-tion, CAPs currently are not eligible activities under the Kyoto Protocol mostly due to the perceived uncertainties in determining key elements of a project cycle, particularly the baseline or the business-as-usual deforestation rate and pattern. However, many developing countries, and investors, continue to be interested in developing forest conservation projects given the potential for such projects to slow or even reverse high rates of deforestation while at the same time generating credible greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions. For averted deforestation projects (and for all carbon sequestration projects) carbon credits can be earned only for that carbon that is in addition to a business-as-usual baseline. In an effort to develop reliable methods for projecting deforestation baselines at various scales, we have recently applied the land use-change model GEOMOD (Hall et al. 1995a; Pontius, Cornell, and Hall 2001) to a number of sites in Latin America (Brown 2002; Brown et al. 2006). Our approach is sensitive to larger regional patterns of change, and hence we were able to use it to analyze deforestation in six areas of Central and South America and to project what would happen to these landscapes if no measures to limit deforestation were implemented. For each analysis, we generally have worked with data sets provided to us by project partners and in the process have discovered that both map scale and scale of analysis play a significant role in identifying both spatial land-use pattern and rate drivers, depending on the degree of human development already occurring in a region. We found that it is often difficult to capture the trajectory of change fully if the scale of analysis is limited to the local or even regional scale of interest, because the factors that drive land-use change are often operative at a scale larger than the locality affected. In this chapter we explain how we developed a methodology to capture development pressure in the region of the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park (NKMNP), a frontier environment in northeastern Bolivia.

There are many sources of natural and anthropogenic emissions, but combustion of coal is known to be the major anthropogenic source of mercury (Hg) emissions in the U.S. and worldwide. To address this, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recently promulgated the Clean Air Mercury Rule (CAMR) to reduce Hg emissions from coal-fired utility boilers. This rule makes the United States the first country in the world to regulate mercury emissions from such plants. However, atmospheric mercury is a global problem and mercury emissions from U.S. coal-fired boilers represent only a small fraction of the total worldwide emissions. Mercury emissions from Asia - especially from countries with rapidly growing economies, such as China and India - account for almost 60% of worldwide anthropogenic mercury emissions. Mercury can be controlled as a co-benefit of existing NOX, SOX, and PM control technologies and via sorbent injection technology. The level of control is strongly affected by the type of mercury emitted (elemental, ionic, or particulate-bound), coal type, chlorine levels, and type of air pollution controls used. With knowledge of the impact of each of these, mercury can be controlled, and improved methods to achieve further control can be developed.","Mercury (Hg); Oxides of nitrogen (NOX); Particulate matter (PM); Sulfur oxides (SOX)","Air pollution control; Chemical contamination; Coal; Coal combustion; Environmental Protection Agency; Fossil fuel power plants; Mercury (metal); Anthropogenic emissions; Anthropogenic mercury emissions; Clean Air Mercury Rule; Environmental health concern; Mercuries (Hg); Oxides of nitrogen; Particulate Matter; Sulfur oxide; Coal fired boilers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908475799

Box 20000, 3502 LA Utrecht, Netherlands","Driven by science, engineering and daily practice in sediment management a big variety of technologies for treatment and disposal is available. Main fields for further development with respect to sediment management is to find the way to compare different complex scenarios of treatment and disposal (assessment) and to build up the markets for treatment of sediments. The SedNet mission makes obvious that sustainability is only achievable on a new spatial and time scale. Since the present structures for decision-making are mostly local or regional acting administrations, however their actions have often consequences on a bigger scale, the river basin scale. Additionally, to build up a sustainable sediment management long-termeffects over the time span of a generation or more have to be considered. According to the aim of a sustainable sediment management we recommend assessment on a river basin scale considering a sustainable time scale of one generation! A sustainable river basin model has to integrate social, environmental and economic aspects, but so far a model offering this is only vague: In a river basin the members of the society are the driving force, economy can be seen as the sum of activities and the environment is part of the ""capital stock"" that is available for development and activities of the society. Some parts of this ""capital"" is not renewable. Consequently, in a broader view of economy, neglecting environmental effects bears the risk of a loss of capital stocks, consequently decreasing the economy and social welfare on the long term. What are the consequences of this new river basin view? The people are the driving part in the system. In general, people can only react rationally with respect to economy and environment, if they are informed. Knowledge is the basis for understanding processes and mutual interaction and at least informed people will understand and accept rational decisions based on assessment procedures. Besides information of the public an assessment procedure is the second column for decision making. The outcome of such an assessment is a ranking of treatment alternatives offered for a sediment problem. Such an assessment should not base on a single tool e.g. a cost calculation or LCA, because no tool covers all fields necessary to be considered (economy, environment, society). It must be recommended that a combination of tools (Costs, LCA, cost-benefit evaluation, risk assessment studies) should become routine before decisionmaking. European standards for assessing treatment and disposal alternatives should consider the present know-how about long-term effects (e.g. the life-cycle of sediments and products and effects on mobility and bio-availability of pollutants with time) and the differences between the results of biological and chemical methods applied for the same sediments. Thinking about assessment standards leads to the necessity of harmonizing those standards Europewide in order to avoid transport of sediments across boarders between regions and countries in Europe applying different standards. Looking at sustainability some benefits like the reduction of space consumption, climate or re-use of secondary material substituting primary resources are complicated to be evaluated. We will come closer to sustainability the more we have an overall or comprehensive model considering economic factors as well as the environment. The example of the European Guideline for Trading Emission Certificates (2003/87/EC) can be seen as a general approach how to combine economy and ecology in a way accepted from the society. So we recommend to conduct research in fields that provide us with parameters or better tools to evaluate goods like ""the landscape"", ""space consumption"", etc. useful to improve decision making. Accordingly, an integration of broader economic know-how into the assessment procedures is needed in order to evaluate benefits outside common budgets on to consider ""hidden costs"" and superior issues like source control or resource demands, which are not covered by the responsibility and budget of water and sediment management authorities today. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Consequently, pollutant emissions from nonroad sources now represent a greater proportion of overall emissions. In New York City, the majority of PM2.5 nonroad engine emissions are emitted by construction engines. PM2.5 is also a critical pollutant in the City's neighborhoods, some of which suffer from high levels of asthma. In the aftermath of the attack on the Twin Towers, air quality was of great concern, and the plans for many years of concentrated reconstruction efforts enhanced that debate. Federal agencies responsible for planing those efforts instituted both a clean construction program and an unprecedented detailed study of potential air quality impacts from construction. The City of New York responded by passing legislation aimed at reducing nonroad emissions from public construction projects, first in Lower Manhattan, and eventually throughout the City. The study of the Lower Manhattan projects and the mitigation measures implemented there set a new standard for analysis and emissions reduction programs for large scale construction projects in New York City. Large scale private construction projects are now following suit. The end result is an accelerated phase-in of tailpipe controls for reducing particulate matter emissions from construction engines, which would happen eventually through federal regulation of new engines and via state actions aimed at meeting the federal PM2.5 standards. Emissions reduction measures are now often recommended for large projects and may be required by law, depending on the situation. Emissions controls may reduce PM2.5 emissions from construction activities by as much as 90 percent. This translates into real-world benefits for local communities adjacent to large scale construction projects, and over time, may translate into region-wide air quality benefits.",,"Air quality; Construction industry; Emission control; Engines; Fuel economy; Laws and legislation; Pollution; Waste management; Air quality impacts; Construction activities; Construction program; Construction projects; Emissions reduction; Federal regulations; Particulate matter emissions; Public construction projects; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649132632

The EPRI-sponsored SEARCH (Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization) program has generated such data covering &gt;7 years at eight locations. The U.S. EPA Speciation Trends Network (STN) obtains nationwide coverage of similar data. SEARCH and STN share two sites in common, which permits comparison of their data in the context of source apportionment. The urban SEARCH monitoring stations in Birmingham, AL, and Gulfport, MS, are collocated with STN monitors. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the predictive strength of 48-month data sets (January 2002 through December 2005) from these SEARCH and STN monitors for PMF source apportionment calculations. The data used for the study include 24-hour measurements of PM2.5 mass, major soluble ions (e.g. sulfate, ammonium, and nitrate), elemental and organic carbon, and several elemental inorganic species analyzed by x-ray fluorescence (XRF) methods. While similar sampling and analytical methods are used by the two networks, there are method differences that require comparability analysis of nominally identical variables. These notably include particulate carbon fractions and volatile species (e.g., ammonium nitrate). The data quality analyses indicated that the data from both networks are of high-quality with each network having several ""species of choice"". Results from PMF indicate that six factors primarily contribute to the observed ambient PM2.5 mass in Birmingham, Alabama. These include (1) coal combustion/secondary sulfate aerosol, (2) motor vehicle/urban road dust, (3) crustal, (4) secondary ammonium nitrate, (5) iron-steel manufacturing, and (6) Zn-rich metal processing.

Identification of ""dangerous"" effects is partly subjective, but we find evidence that added global warming of more than 1 °C above the level in 2000 has effects that may be highly disruptive. The alternative scenario, with peak added forcing ∼1.5 W/m2 in 2100, keeps further global warming under 1°C if climate sensitivity is ∼3°C or less for doubled CO2. The alternative scenario keeps mean regional seasonal warming within 2σ (standard deviations) of 20th century variability, but other scenarios yield regional changes of 5-10σ, i.e. mean conditions outside the range of local experience. We conclude that a CO2 level exceeding about 450 ppm is ""dangerous"", but reduction of non-CO2 forcings can provide modest relief on the CO2 constraint. We discuss three specific sub-global topics: Arctic climate change, tropical storm intensification, and ice sheet stability. We suggest that Arctic climate change has been driven as much by pollutants (O3, its precursor CH 4, and soot) as by CO2, offering hope that dual efforts to reduce pollutants and slow CO2 growth could minimize Arctic change. Simulated recent ocean warming in the region of Atlantic hurricane formation is comparable to observations, suggesting that green-house gases (GHGs) may have contributed to a trend toward greater hurricane intensities. Increasing GHGs cause significant warming in our model in submarine regions of ice shelves and shallow methane hydrates, raising concern about the potential for accelerating sea level rise and future positive feedback from methane release. Growth of non-CO2 forcings has slowed in recent years, but CO2 emissions are now surging well above the alternative scenario. Prompt actions to slow CO2 emissions and decrease non-CO2 forcings are required to achieve the low forcing of the alternative scenario.",,"arctic environment; carbon dioxide enrichment; carbon emission; climate change; climate forcing; climate modeling; global warming; greenhouse gas; hurricane; methane; sea level change; Arctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248225807

In this region the conditions most likely to limit hydrocarbon degradation include cold and fluctuating temperatures, low moisture contents, low nutrient levels and alkaline pH.

The controlled addition of nitrogen and phosphorous sources and water increased bacterial counts of soil in all cases and resulted in a significant elimination of hydrocarbons: 32 % TPH in Case A after 7 months of treatment (from May to December 2005); 39 % TPH and 88 % PAH in Case B after 5 months (from October 2005 to February 2006) and 90 % of PAH after 3 months of treatment (from May 2005 to July 2005) were removed. In addition, we performed a comparative evaluation of natural attenuation, biostimulation and bioaugmentation (inoculation of bacterial strains) for bioremediation of PAH-contaminated soil in situ. Both, biostimulation and bioaugmentation promoted significant degradation (&gt; 90 %) of PAH after 6 weeks of treatment, whereas attenuation resulted in a reduced degradation rate (67 %). In conclusion, this study suggests that autochthonous bacterial communities from semiarid soils in Patagonia have the potential to degrade hydrocarbons after amelioration of unfavorable environmental conditions.

Hence this paper applies sensitivity analysis to the outcomes of simulations carried out with the ESP-r simulation program in order to identify the most relevant parameters in school design. This allows building designers to make informed decisions, without having to revert to modelling and simulation.

A common definition of soil is the surface layer of earth that supports plant life. Rhizosphere soil effectively forms a boundary layer between the roots and the surrounding soil. Plant roots grow into and through an extraordinary array of ""indigenous"" soil microorganisms. Community characterization is not always genotypic in nature, but may occur at different scales ranging from functional diversity to broader taxons to simple abundance. Functional diversity can also be estimated by measuring functional genes that play a role in ecosystem processes. In 16S rDNA analysis of the rhizosphere microbial community, phylogenetic diversity can be related to function only through conventional interpretations. Root-microbial interactions encompass a range of specificity from ""highly evolved"" symbioses (legume-rhizobium) to less specific associations (arbuscular mycorrhizas). Apparent symbioses are the most likely to develop host-specificity. Plant roots exude a large amount and a complex assortment of organic compounds into the nearby soil. A variety of biotic interactions occur in the rhizosphere that can affect the diversity and composition of the microbial community associated with roots. Global changes in climate and plant communities may further alter microbial communities with consequences for ecosystem process rates. Research since the 1990s has underscored the fact that understanding and quantifying the interactions among plants and soil microbes is essential for understanding both plant and soil microbial community ecology and the roles that these communities play in ecosystem function. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Through the Local Air Quality Management (LAQM) process, local authorities in the UK undertake a review and assessment of air quality and identify where health based objectives are likely to be exceeded. If relevant public exposure exists, an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) is designated. Following this an Air Quality Action Plan (AQAP) is developed by the local authority, in collaboration with statutory (and non-statutory) stakeholders in order to work towards achieving the air quality objectives through the implementation of relevant actions. A 'win-win' action can be defined as one that is likely to result in the reduction of pollutants of importance to air quality and climate change. Conversely some actions will result in a 'trade-off' i.e. where an action may benefit one issue but is detrimental to the other. To date 205 local authorities (i.e. 47%) have declared one or more AQMAs for different pollutants; predominantly NO 2 and PM10. The sources of these pollutants are commonly found to be transport, industrial and domestic related; the same sources that are primarily responsible for CO2 emission in the UK. Three case-study AQAPs (for various sources) illustrate the difficulties and intricacies of considering synergistic actions at the action plan development and implementation phases. Numerous opportunities, barriers and compromises are identified in order to effectively and resourcefully comanage and mitigate CO2 and LAQM pollutants while ultimately accruing cost effective environmental benefits.","Air quality action plans; Climate change; Co-benefit; Co-management; Local air quality management; Trade-off; UK","Air quality; Climate change; Health hazards; Particles (particulate matter); Air quality action plans; Local air quality management; Trade-off; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44349192035

The efficiency of quenching is strongly dependant on the nanoparticle size, the binding properties of the nitroxide, and the presence or not of a protective shell, ZnS in our systems. The shell reduces the quenching efficiency significantly only in the case of binding nitroxides, such as 4-amino-TEMPO. Downward quenching plots revealing bimodal quenching characterize the Stern-Volmer plots obtained for 4-amino-TEMPO. The slope characteristic of the low concentrations regime depends strongly on the presence of a shell. For example, for particles with a 2.4 nm core, emitting at 525 nm the concentrations of 4-amino-TEMPO required to reduce the emission to one half are 0.65 μM and 0.08 mM for core and core-shell nanoparticles, respectively. Surprisingly, in the high concentration regime, a single Stern-Volmer slope of about 4000 M -1 seems to accommodate all systems. We speculate that this value is characteristic of the exchange of TOPO ligands by 4-amino-TEMPO. © The Royal Society of Chemistry and Owner Societies.",,"cadmium selenide; nanoparticle; quantum dot; selenide; unclassified drug; article; binding affinity; comparative study; fluorescence spectroscopy; photochemical quenching; priority journal; steady state",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248164523

It’s free, uninterruptible and will be available as long as it is required. To use solar energy, however, the equipment required for capturing and converting it to useful heat or power must be purchased and installed. Essentially, with solar systems, you are prepaying for energy at a fixed rate over the solar system’s lifetime. This requirement to pre-pay energy presents a difficulty in comparing the economics or effective cost and/or savings of energy delivered by a solar system to the cost of conventional energy sources. The purchase and installation of a solar system to heat water or generate electric power essentially locks in the cost of the energy at a fixed price over the life of the solar equipment. Once a solar system is installed, the price of the energy delivered is locked in at a levelized or life-cycle cost rate based on the cost of the solar system installation, and its operating and maintenance costs over the life of the system which is between 10 and 25 years depending upon the type of system. This article illustrates a simplified approach for developing the effective cost of solar applications to the cost of conventional alternatives. The effective cost of solar water heating and photovoltaic (stand-alone and grid-connected) systems are determined to illustrate the methodology. Given the present uncertainty of the cost of fuel oil, natural gas and electric power, locking in the price of energy delivered by a solar system for heating water at two to five cents per kWh or $5.00 to $15.00 per million Btu is a good investment with or without the available tax credits, State and local incentives and/or environmental benefits. The economics of the photovoltaic systems varies significantly with the system type (stand-alone or grid connected) and utility rates and rate structure and is not as clear-cut as the solar thermal systems. It is something that should be given serious consideration. At the present time, the price of solar energy applications can be locked in at a 30% discount using the federal solar tax credit that is part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Additionally there may be other state and local incentives that may be available for solar. The environmental benefits that range from reduction in particulate emissions and CO2, that can earn Green Tags yielding income, to the positive image for marketing of being environmentally friendly, i.e. green hotels, encouraging ecotourism etc., also provide an intangible financial benefits for some businesses. The information that follows in this article is intended to provide a methodology for evaluating the cost of solar energy options available to facility and energy managers to enable them to be better able to evaluate and compare solar to other alternative energy applications. © 2007 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011468548

In order to uncover the 'missing sink"" that is responsible for the large discrepancies in the budget as we presently understand it calculation has indicated that measurement accuracy on the order of 1 ppm is necessary. Because typical column average CO2 has now reached 380 ppm this represents a precision on the order of ,25% for these column measurements. No species has ever been measured from space at such a precision. In recognition of the importance of understanding the CO2 budget in order to evaluate its impact on global warming the National Research Council in its decadal survey report to NASA recommended planning for a laser based total CO2 mapping mission in the near future. The extreme measurement accuracy requirements on this mission places very strong requirements on the laser system used for the measurement. This work presents an analysis of the characteristics necessary in a laser system used to make this measurement. Consideration is given to the temperature dependence, pressure broadening, and pressure shift of the CO2 lines themselves and how these impact the laser system characteristics Several systems for meeting these requirements that are under investigation at various institutions in the US as well as Europe will be discussed.","Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse; Laser; LIDAR","Column measurements; High precision; Laser absorptions; Laser systems; LIDAR; Mapping missions; Measurement accuracies; National research councils; Pressure shifts; Pressure-broadening; Space-borne; Temperature dependences; Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Earth atmosphere; Global warming; Greenhouses; Lasers; NASA; Optical radar; Planning; Remote sensing; Space optics; Measurements",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57649103877

Where responses or controls were absent, discussion has been provided. A significant finding concerns secondary ventilation design rates. Some mines were designing ventilation rates to meet the superseded Mines Regulation Act of 1989 which required 0.04 m 3/s/kW. The current Queensland Mining and Quarrying Safety and Health Regulation (2001) is risk based. In line with other jurisdictions, including New South Wales (NSW) and most Provinces in Canada, a minimum ventilation rate of 0.06 m3/s/kW is acceptable. However, this design ventilation rate will vary in practice depending on the diesel engines and controls. Dedicated ventilation engineers and technicians should be appointed to evaluate the effectiveness of the ventilation system. Personal exposure monitoring is required to confirm that exposure standards are not being exceeded. The primary control practice should be to reduce the emission at source. This can be ensured by purchasing low emission (Tier 2, Tier 3) equipment. In addition, the use of ultra low sulfur fuel (&lt;50 ppm) with electronic engine management systems will produce lower diesel particulate matter and lower diesel particulate-related components (Bagley et al, 2002). Diesel fuel with a low aromatic content such as Eromanga diesel fuel will also mean employees are exposed to lower levels of poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. These controls should be carried out in parallel with good maintenance practices. Preventative maintenance should be programmed and emissions be routinely tested, including both gaseous and particulate pollutants and compared against defined criteria. According to McGinn, 2002, there are a number of fundamental tools necessary to carry out preventative maintenance. These are outlined in maintenance guidelines and best practices for diesel engines in underground mining produced for the Diesel Emissions Evaluation Program (DEEP). An effective diesel emission management system needs to be fully integrated within the Safety and Health Management System. These requirements are further discussed in this paper.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78149322984

As with CHP systems, micro-CHP (micro-Cooling, Heating, and Power) system consists of power cogeneration system and thermally-activated components such as absorption chillers, water tanks, boilers, and air handling units. Although much work have been done on using steady-state models that follow load profiles to demonstrate the economic advantage of CHP systems, there has not been much work using dynamic simulation of CHP systems which include the transient response of the building along with the rest of the CHP components. This paper presents the results from the dynamic simulation of the micro-CHP system used to model the test facility at Mississippi State University (MSU) and discusses some important issues that were considered in obtaining a dynamic model. TRNSYS, a dynamic simulation program, is used as a simulation engine to evaluate the performance of the micro-CHP system with respect to transient heating, cooling, and electric power demand of the test facility. Details of the building model include geometric and material information, internal heat generation following the equipment and occupancy schedules, local weather information, and estimated infiltration of the test facility. The building model is connected to dynamic models of the power cogeneration system and thermally-activated components. In the test facility, a four-cylinder internal combustion engine with a 15-kW generator is operated to generate electric and thermal energy, and a 10-ton absorption chiller is used for space cooling.

This presentation focuses on LMCCCs environmental enforcement efforts, particularly ambient air monitoring and control of particulate matter. This program may be a model for future pollutant control efforts in urban and non-attainment areas. The redevelopment includes $20+ billion of construction within a 3.74-square kilometer area south of Canal Street during a 5-year period from 2006 through 2010. The Master Plan is intended to transform this largely business-oriented location into a mixed-use residential, business and tourist area. The LMCCC has been tasked to achieve environmental performance commitments (EPCs), primarily concerning dust, noise, vibration and traffic. The EPCs were partly based on EPA experiences during the Central Artery Tunnel Project (a.k.a. the Big Dig) in Boston. Findings in particulate matter (PM) toxicology over recent years and concern over dust from the collapse of the World Trade Centers also influenced EPC development. LMCCC established a neighborhood-scale air quality monitoring program (AQMP) with four stations, each with PMi0 and PM2.5 monitors and meteorology sensors. The stations send near real-time data to a restricted-access website to help assess if elevated PM concentrations are from construction activities versus other sources, such as rush-hour traffic. The website database generates automated e-mail notifications of alarm conditions. Personnel then perform fence line monitoring at construction sites upwind of monitoring stations that experience alarms. This rapid awareness of neighborhood environmental conditions aids enforcement of regulations, such as anti-idling laws and visible dust emissions. Additional measures to control PM include diesel particulate filters (DPFs) and Ultra-Low Sulfur Fuels (ULSF) for construction equipment. These control technologies are expected to see increased usage, especially in locations with non-attainment status for PM2.5.",,"Air pollution; Air quality; Commerce; Construction equipment; Construction industry; Dust; Environmental management; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental regulations; Fuels; International trade; Laws and legislation; Office buildings; Websites; Ambient air monitoring; Construction activities; Diesel particulate filters; Enforcement of regulations; Environmental conditions; Environmental enforcement; Environmental performance; Monitoring and control; Waste management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933524662

This landmark legislation requires the state of California to reduce its carbon emissions by approximately 25% by the year 2020. AB-32 states that global warming poses a serious threat to the environment of California. This legislation effectively ends the debate in California as to whether global warming is simply scientific speculation. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) require most proposed projects to evaluate their impacts on the environment and present feasible ways to offset their impacts. With growing public concern regarding climate change, and with the passage of AB-32, there is increasing pressure to address global warming within the context of CEQA/NEPA. The purpose of this paper is to outline the contents of AB-32 and explore how climate change can be addressed in CEQA and NEPA analyses.

The accurate measurements of the water isotopologues by remote-sensing techniques remains a challenge, due to the large spatial and temporal variations. Simultaneous profile retrievals of the main water isotopologues (i.e. H 216O, H218O and HDO) and their ratios are presented here for the first time, along their retrieved global distributions. The results are obtained by exploiting the high resolution infrared spectra recorded by the Interferometric Monitor for Greenhouse gases (IMG) instrument, which has operated in the nadir geometry onboard the ADEOS satellite between 1996 and 1997. The retrievals are performed on cloud-free radiances, measured during ten days of April 1997, considering two atmospheric windows (1205-1228 cm-1; 2004-2032 cm-1) and using a line-by-line radiative transfer model and an inversion procedure based on the Optimal Estimation Method (OEM). Characterizations in terms of vertical sensitivity and error budget are provided. We show that a relatively high vertical resolution is achieved for H216O (∼4-5 km), and that the retrieved profiles are in fair agreement with local sonde measurements, at different latitudes. The retrieved global distributions of H216O, H218O, HDO and their ratios are presented and found to be consistent with previous experimental studies and models. The Ocean-Continent difference, the latitudinal and vertical dependence of the water vapour amount and the isotopologic depletion are notably well reproduced. Others trends, possibly related to small-scale variations in the vertical profiles are also discussed. Despite the difficulties encountered for computing accurately the isotopologic ratios, our results demonstrate the ability of infrared nadir sounding for monitoring atmospheric isotopologic water vapour distributions on a global scale.",,"ADEOS; atmospheric chemistry; geographical distribution; interferometer; isotopic composition; monitoring system; spatial variation; temporal variation; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547469427

CARB is interested in developing opinions about the potential of this new European approach for emission determination and in exploring its utility for use in California. In this exercise, the use of various commercially available instruments for counting and sizing particles in the context of the PMP recommendations are explored. A single vehicle on a chassis dynamometer was exercised over steady-state and transient cycles. Multiple measurements of gaseous, mass, and particle emissions were collected in order to determine statistical significance. The PMP approach yielded particle emission measurements with higher precision and accuracy than the reference mass-based emission measurement. While commercially available fast multichannel electrometers are a significant advancement for convenient determination of the particle size distribution, they are not always appropriate for determining total particle counts. The thermally conditioned sample per the PMP protocol still contained a significant number of sub-20 nm solid particles, which can be counted without loss of accuracy with current instrumentation. Tunnel storage and release can lead to unexpected nucleation events even in the case where ULSD fuel is used. The use of aftertreatment devises to remove volatile material otherwise prevented the formation of a measurable nucleation mode. This work allows CARB to continue to explore issues related to the nature of the particles post PMP sampling, the toxicity of volatile, sub-20 nm particles, and the improved statistics of particle counting relative to mass weighing.

Box 1625, Idaho Falls, ID 83415-3860, United States","Hydrogen production technologies will provide a means through which nuclear energy can be used to reduce the nation's critical vulnerability on imported petroleum. Eventually, hydrogen may be a major transportation fuel through the use of fuel cells in automobiles. However, even today, the annual demand for hydrogen in the US is about 13 million tons, primarily for the production of fertilizers, for the upgrading of low quality crude oils and for the removal of sulfur to meet increasingly stringent environmental requirements. As we come to rely on poorer grades of crude oil and on the Athabasca oil sands, the demand for hydrogen in the petroleum industry will grow significantly. Average crude oils require 1 to 2 kg of H2 per barrel, heavy crudes 2-3 kg per barrel and the oil sands 3-5 kg per barrel. Today, 95% of our hydrogen is produced through the steam reforming of natural gas. Both the increasing price of natural gas and the need to reduce CO2 emissions will promote the nuclear production of hydrogen. The development of High Temperature Electrolysis (HTE) of steam for the production of hydrogen using nuclear energy has progressed through a series of experiments and analyses during the past year. The purpose of these experiments was to demonstrate the feasibility of using solid-oxide electrolytic cells to efficiently split steam into hydrogen and oxygen, while developing the economies of scale and long operating life needed by successful commercial devices. These tests have increased in scale from button cells through 10 and 25 cell single stacks and, most recently, to the testing of a dual stack containing 2 × 60 cells. The long-duration test of the ""Half-Module"" demonstrated the viability of the technology planned for the HTE Integrated Laboratory-scale (ILS) experiment. The ILS will eventually have three modules of four 60-cell stacks each. The Half-Module thus consisted of half of one of the ILS modules. The Half Module was fabricated at Ceramatec, Inc. in Salt Lake City and tested at their facility from June through September of 2006. The unit ran for 2040 hours, mostly at steady state except for minor interruptions due to power outages and testing of the stacks under a variety of current and voltage conditions. Hydrogen production was 1.21 normal m3/hour at the beginning of the test, dropping to 0.65 normal m 3/hour at the end of the test. Construction of the ILS experiment took place during the summer of 2007, with initial shakedown testing beginning on August 22 and the production of its first hydrogen at the end of September. Initially the ILS will have only one module (four stacks of 60 cells each) and will not have integrated heat recovery and hydrogen separation/recycle components. Eventually the ILS will include heat exchangers to recover the 800° C heat of the hydrogen and oxygen for use in heating the incoming water to steam. In addition, the ILS will incorporate condensation tanks or high temperature porous membranes for the separation of hydrogen from the residual steam. The residual steam and a small amount of hydrogen will be recirculated to the electrolytic stacks where the hydrogen will maintain reducing conditions at the nickel-cermet electrode. Another aspect of HTE research is the analysis of cell degradation mechanisms. The lifetime of the electrolysis cells is being limited by corrosion, transport of impurities into the electrodes and delaminations of the electrodes from the electrolyte. The HTE project is conducting progressively longer tests followed by post-test analyses to determine the causes and to find better formulations of the cell materials. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analysis and flowsheet modeling provide further insights into the operation of electrolytic cells. CFD is being used to determine the best ways to reduce thermal stresses over the area of the cells and to assure that the steam is properly distributed in our progressively larger stacks and the tubular cells. Flowsheet modeling is being used to model complete hydrogen production plants as driven by a variety of reactors. For about 800 hours during the Half-Module test (summer 2006), the stacks were operated in a co-electrolysis mode, which we are calling Syntrolysis. In the Syntrolysis mode, the stacks are supplied with steam and carbon dioxide, producing carbon monoxide and hydrogen (synthesis gas, or ""syngas""), which can be used in the Fischer-Tropsch process for the production of synthetic hydrocarbon liquids, such as diesel fuel, jet fuel, and synthetic lubricating oils. The synthesis of fuels from a variety of carbon sources in forward locations has the potential for easing fuel logistics' requirements for the military. In addition, the production of synthetic fuels through nuclear hydrogen is a means for reducing our civilian dependence on imported oil while continuing to use the existing liquid transportation fuel infrastructure.",,"Athabasca oil sands; Carbon sources; Cell materials; Cell stacks; Cermet electrodes; Computational fluid dynamics analyses; Crude oils; Degradation mechanisms; Dual stacks; Economies of scales; Electrolysis cells; Environmental requirements; Heavy crudes; High temperature electrolysis; High temperatures; Hydrogen production plants; Hydrogen production technologies; Infra structures; Integrated heats; Jet fuels; Life-times; Liquid transportations; Low qualities; Million tons; Nuclear hydrogens; Nuclear productions; Operating lives; Porous membranes; Power outages; Production of hydrogens; Recent progresses; Reducing conditions; Removal of sulfurs; Salt Lake cities; Steady states; Steam reforming; Syn gasses; Synthesis of; Synthetic hydrocarbons; Test analysis; Transportation fuels; Tubular cells; Voltage conditions; Automobile parts and equipment; Automotive fuels; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Cell membranes; Cells; Coal liquefaction; Computational fluid dynamics; Crude petroleum; Cytology; Degradation; Diesel fuels; Dynamics; Economics; Electric batteries; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Electrolysis; Electrolytic analysis; Electrolytic cells; Experimental reactors; Experiments; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Flowcharting; Fluid dynamics; Fuel cells; Fuel oils; Fuels; Gas fuel manufacture; Gas industry; Gas oils; Gas permeable membranes; Gas producers; Gases; Hydrocarbons; Hydrodesulfurization; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Landing; Metal casting; Natural gas; Nonmetals; Nuclear energy; Nuclear power plants; Oil sands; Organic compounds; Oxygen; Petroleum industry; Petroleum refineries; Petroleum transportation; Steam; Steam condensers; Steam engineering; Sulfur; Synthesis gas; Synthetic fuels; Testing; Waste heat; Water treatment; Well stimulation; Hydrogen production",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053656330

This paper outlines experience from the use of IM at the National Environmental Research Institute (NERI) within the two nationwide air-quality monitoring programmes for the Danish urban and rural environments, respectively. The measurements in these Danish monitoring programmes are used to determine actual levels and trends in pollutant concentrations and depositions of pollutants. The measurements are further used for process understanding, and for the development and validation of air-quality models. The results from the air-quality models are used in the interpretation of measurements, but they are also used to provide information about, for example, source apportionment. The model calculations are used to extend the geographical coverage of the monitoring, and to provide information about pollution loads at locations or regions that are not well covered by the limited number of measurement stations in the monitoring programmes. Finally, the air-quality models are applied to carry out scenario studies of future pollution loads, e.g. assessment of the effects of various emission reduction strategies. NERI operates and holds the overall responsibility for the Danish air-quality monitoring programmes. These monitoring programmes are designed to fulfil the Danish obligations in relation to the EU directives on air quality, as well as the Danish obligations in relation to the reporting of data to international organisations (EMEP, HELCOM, OSPARCOM, and WHO). The obtained results from the use of IM form the basis for the national assessment of the air pollution loads in relation to protection of the aquatic and terrestrial environment; in these assessments the use of IM plays a central role. © CSIRO 2007.","Air-quality measurements and models; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric deposition; Modelling (cycling and circulation); Temporal and spatial resolution in monitoring","air quality; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; environmental modeling; European Union; measurement method; pollution monitoring; pollution policy; rural area; urban area; Denmark; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247181217

In this paper, a spatiotemporal approach is taken to compare and validate model results from the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) with commonly used analysis and reanalysis datasets for monthly averages of temperature and precipitation in 1992-2000 and for a study area at 55°-65°N, 160°-110°W in northwestern Canada and Alaska. Objectives include a quantitative assessment of similarity between datasets and climate model fields, and identification of geographic areas and seasons that are problematic in modeling, with potential causes that may aid in model improvement. These are achieved by application of algebraic similarity mapping, a simple yet effective method for synoptic analysis of many (here, 45) different spatial datasets, maps, and models. Results indicate a dependence of model-data similarity on seasonality, on climate variable, and on geographic location. In summary, 1) similarity of data and models is better for temperature than for precipitation; and 2) modeling of summer precipitation fields, and to a lesser extent, temperature fields, appears more problematic than that of winter fields. The geographic distribution of areas with best and worst agreement shifts throughout the year, with generally better agreement between maps and models in the northeastern and northern inland areas than in topographically complex and near-coastal areas. The study contributes to an understanding of the geographic complexity of the Arctic system and modeling its diverse climate.","Algebraic map comparison; Climate modeling; Spatial data analysis","Algebra; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Geographical distribution; Map comparison; National center for atmospheric researches; Pennsylvania State University; Quantitative assessments; Spatial data analysis; Spatio-temporal approach; Summer precipitation; Terrestrial ecosystems; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77955959036

Previous studies of car ownership estimation have generally focused on accurate adherence to the track record, statistical signification, or model structure; however, there are problems in focusing on all these factors together. The purpose of our passenger car ownership estimation model with the Business as Usual scenario —JARI BAU Model—. JARI BAU Model is to estimate passenger car ownership by resolving these difficulties. Our passenger car ownership estimation model with the JARI BAU Model for the demand function is intended to provide information on the total passenger car ownership in Japan from the present time until the year 2030. This paper is unique in that it attempts to estimate car ownership solely on the basis of socioeconomic trends, without including the physical characteristics of automobiles such as fuel economy, vehicle age, or infrastructure development. The BAU model estimates 57.28 million passenger vehicles in 2010 and 61.59 million in 2030.

Treelines will not advance in a closed front parallel to the shift of any isotherm to higher elevations and more northern latitudes. The effects of varying topography on site conditions and the after-effects of historical disturbances by natural and anthropogenic factors may override the effects of slightly higher average temperatures. Moreover, the varying treeline-forming species respond in different ways to a changing climate. Forest advance upwards and northwards primarily depends on successful regeneration and survival of young growth rather than on increasing growth rates of mature trees. Every assessment of treeline response to future climate change must consider the effects of local site conditions and feedbacks of increasing tree population in modulating the climatically-driven change. Treeline-shift will influence regional and local climates, pedogenesis, plant communities, animal populations and biodiversity as well as having a considerable effect on economic changes in primary production.

From spring 2003 until autumn 2006, we monitored flowering and seed-production responses to free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) and 2°C warming in a species-rich, nutrient-poor southern temperate grassland, by using the TasFACE experiment. There were no effects of either FACE or warming on the proportion of species flowering in any year. Flowering, seed production and seed mass were not significantly affected by FACE, warming or their interaction in most species. Some species, however, did respond significantly to simulated global changes. These responses generally were not governed by life history, but there were two distinct trends. First, warming increased the proportion of the population that flowered in perennial grasses but not in other species types. Second, flowering and seed production of both perennial woody dicots responded strongly to the interaction of FACE and warming, with Bossiaea prostrata producing most seeds in warmed FACE plots and Hibbertia hirsuta producing the most in unwarmed FACE plots. FACE increased seed mass 4-fold in the perennial C3 grass Elymus scaber (P &lt; 0.01) but substantially reduced seed mass of the perennial C3 grass Austrodanthonia caespitosa (P &lt; 0.02) and the perennial forb Hypochaeris radicata (P &lt; 0.02), with the remainder of species unaffected. Our results indicate that warming and elevated CO2 had little effect on seed production in the temperate grassland ecosystem. The few significant affects there were, however, are likely to have substantial implications for community composition and structure. © CSIRO 2007.",,"biomonitoring; carbon dioxide; experimental study; flowering; grass; grassland; seed production; species richness; Austrodanthonia; Bossiaea; Dicotyledoneae; Elymus; Elymus scabrus; Hypochaeris radicata; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37149017416

The benefits of BIPV system mainly derive from energy cost savings, enhanced power quality and reliability, reduced environmental emissions, rebates, and other incentives. After collecting the empirical cost and energy saving data from Kao-Hsiung local BIPV system project, the paper evaluates the feasibility of the BIPV system now and the future prospect. The benefits of the illustrative residential include energy saving and reduced environmental emissions which can be identified. Using the discount rate and escalation rate of the energy price, the paper analyzed its effects on discounted payback years. The illustrative cases show that the saving-to-investment ratio of BIPV systems in Taiwan is about 19.5% without goverment's subsidy and 31.4 % with subsidy.

This paper presents a strategy for monitoring urban forest using Landsat TM/ETM+ (Thematic Mapper / Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus) imagery time series and calculating its ecological benefits. And the strategy is applied to the temporal analysis of the zone inside the 4th Ring Road in Beijing. The analysis consists of two key steps in: the first is to extract urban forest from Landsat images; the second is to calculate the ecological benefits of urban forest. The extraction of urban forest from Landsat imagery is accomplished implementing classification models, which are based on empirical relationships between forest coverage and the spectrum on Landsat imagery, and are generated using regression tree techniques. Quickbird images and field investigations are applied to generate classification models and to assess their accuracies. Subsequently, the ecological benefits calculation about urban forest is carried out introducing CITYgreen model. This paper mainly concerns carbon storage and the function in air pollution reduction.

In the former case we focus on the ground-state structure of sodium cluster anions which is obtained by solving the Kohn-Sham equations of density functional theory (DFT) in combination with an efficient genetic optimisation algorithm. The accuracy and efficiency of this approach is reflected in the electronic density of states of the lowest lying isomer showing excellent agreement with experimental photoelectron spectra. In the case of the carbon nanotubes (CNTs), the swelling and shrinking of the CNT paper due to electron or hole injection (bond strength induced actuation) has been studied. Experimentally, the charging of the tubes is caused by a small applied voltage and it is compensated by a electrochemical double layer formed in a surounding liquid electrolyte. Here we focus on models describing a singel nanotubes and the double layer within density functional and density functional based tight-binding band structure calculations. We show that the frequently used representation of the double layer by a jellium background reveals an unphysical dependence of the CNT actuation on the size of the computational box. As an alternative a cylindrical charge compensation, not suffering of this shortcoming, is suggested.",,"Computation theory; Density functional theory; Electrolytes; Electronic density of states; Electronic structure; Ground state; Nanoclusters; Nanosystems; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Sodium; Band structure calculation; Density functional based tight bindings; Density functionals; Electronic structure calculations; Ground-state structures; Kohn Sham equations; Liquid electrolytes; Photoelectron spectrum; Carbon nanotubes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84882986000

The dust is separated from the gas in venturi scrubbers by washing with water. The water is cleaned and recirculated, and the surplus water coming from moisture in the raw materials, is discharged to the adjacent fjords after further treatment. Emission figures show that the discharge of suspended solids, manganese, zinc and PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) have been reduced substantially over the last three decades as a result of process improvements and installation of state of the art environmental control measures. The two plants were the first world wide to install mercury cleaning of the off-gases from the furnaces. Mercury emission reduction has exceeded 90%. Concerning other environmental issues, such as utilisation of off-gases for energy recovery and chemical purposes, both plants have achieved good results.

However, there remain several technical challenges in transitioning liquid fuels into pure hydrogen fuel for fuel cell consumption: reforming the fuel to a useful fuel cell feed such as hydrogen or methane and reducing the sulfur levels from ppm to ppb concentrations. FuelCell Energy investigated a non-catalytic hydrodesulfurization technology based on the application of silent discharge plasma. Non-thermal plasma activates gas phase chemical reactions by creating a non-equilibrium (non-thermal) state, which can be used to selectively activate chemical reactions. This effort focused on identifying process conditions under which the silent discharge plasma would promote conversion of sulfur compounds to hydrogen sulfide.

In this study, we used the up-to-date GREET model to examine well-to-wheels emissions of six criteria pollutants (VOC, CO, NOx, PM10, PM2.5, and SOx) and greenhouse gases (GHGs) for nine selected vehicle/fuel systems - conventional gasoline vehicles, conventional diesel vehicles, E85 flexible-fuel vehicles (FFVs), gasoline hybrid vehicles, diesel hybrid vehicles, battery-powered electric vehicles, and H2 fuel-cell vehicles. In GREET, the data sources for emissions of the so-called well-to-pump stages are primarily the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) AP-42 and National Emissions Inventory documents. Emissions of vehicle operations (or the pump-to-wheels stage) are based on EPA's MOBILE and California Air Resource Board's EMFAC models. The results of this study show that compression-ignition direct-injection (CIDI) internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles have lower well-to-wheels emissions of the six criteria pollutants and GHGs than do spark-ignition (SI) ICE vehicles, as a result of either their improved fuel economy or lower emission rates during pump-to-wheel stage, or both. E85 FFVs can achieve moderate to significant reductions in well-to-wheels GHG emissions but increase well-to-wheels criteria pollutant emissions. Hybrid vehicles could achieve reductions in both criteria pollutant and GHG emissions compared to baseline vehicles through improved vehicle fuel economy and lower vehicle emissions. Electric vehicles could reduce well-to-wheels emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and CO, but increase PM10, PM2.5, and SOx emissions due to the large share of coal power plants along electricity pathways (especially for U.S. generation mix). On the other hand, electric vehicles could reduce urban emissions, except for SOx. H2 fuel cell vehicles could significantly reduce criteria pollutant emissions except PM10 and PM2.5, which come primarily from the process of H2 production and H2 compression.","Criteria pollutant emissions; GHG emissions; GREET model; Well-to-wheels analysis","Coal combustion; Direct injection; Electric power plants; Environmental Protection Agency; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Gasoline; Hybrid vehicles; Ignition; Internal combustion engines; Life cycle; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Pumps; Vehicle wheels; Vehicles; Volatile organic compounds; Waste incineration; Waste management; Wheels; Battery-powered electric vehicles; California Air Resource Board; GHG emission; Greet models; National emissions inventories; Pollutant emission; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Well-to-wheel; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649185585

Low-temperature, pre-mixed diesel combustion is presently of interest because it offers the ability to lower the engine-out emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). The need for lowering these two emissions is driven by tighter regulations enacted worldwide, especially the NOx limits in the United States. Reducing engine-out emissions eases the need for additional exhaust aftertreatment devices and their associated cost and mass. In this paper we will describe an experimental cylinder pressure-based control system and present both steady-state and transient results from a diesel engine employing a pre-mixed type of combustion. Data are presented showing engine operation with the control system enabled and disabled, highlighting the control effectiveness of the real-time cylinder pressure feedback.

The causes of this non-uniform alloying and its effects on mechanical properties were investigated in this study using mini-tensile specimens that were made of diffusion alloyed FD-0405 (Fe-4Ni-0.5Mo-1.5Cu-0.5C) powders. The fracture path and the microstructure observations indicated that the soft Ni-rich/C-lean areas at the periphery of the iron powder and in pore-rich regions are the main cause of the failures. With the addition of Cr in the form of 316L stainless steel powder or in the form of prealloyed base powders, the distribution of Ni and C became more uniform, as measured using an electron probe microanalyzer. As a result, the Ni-rich ferrite and austenite disappeared and more bainite and martensite were formed. A tensile strength of 1323MPa and a hardness of HRC39 were attained in the Fe-4Ni-0.5Mo-3Cr-0.5C compact that was sintered at 1250° for 1 hour, furnace cooled, and then tempered. This ultrahigh strength performance was attributed, in addition to the hardening effect of Cr and Mo, mainly to the more homogeneous alloying of Ni and C, which can be explained through thermodynamic analysis using the Thermo-Calc Program. When fine carbonyl iron powders were used as the base powder and the spray-dried process was employed, the mechanical properties were further improved. A tensile strength of 1.98GPa, a hardness of 45HRC, and an elongation of 3% were achieved in the Fe-8Ni-0.8Cr-0.8Mo-0.5C compact that was sinter-hardened during furnace cooling without any subsequent quenching treatment.

Changes in vegetation cover alter the capacity to absorb carbon dioxide and solar radiation from the atmosphere and influence the magnitudes of latent and sensible heat flows to the atmosphere. If happening at a larger spatial scale, land-use change can lead to significant local feedbacks like drought, flooding, soil erosion or shifts in local climate. Up to now only little was known about how typical ecosystems of the rain forest margin areas interact with the atmosphere. We present here results from a sub-program of STORMA (Stability of rain forest margins in Indonesia, SFB-552-B1), to describe the energy, CO2 and water fluxes between a larger tropical area and the atmosphere. Field measurements with the eddy correlation method showed that a Cacao agroforestry system (AFS) was a small source of CO2, whereas a tropical rain forest was a strong CO2 sink during the one year observation period. In addition, the rain forest evaporated much more water compared to the Cacao AFS. We applied a series of models to extrapolate the results from the field investigations to the region, including so-called SVAT models of differing complexity, and a simple PAR efficiency model to predict net primary production from regional meteorological and remote sensing data. In all cases, we discovered a large spatial variability in CO2 and water vapour fluxes. We investigated the sensitivity of the models to changes in climatic drivers or land-use parameters from the current to a more intensified agriculture. The selected land-use scenarios reduced carbon dioxide sequestration and total evaporation and increased sensible heat fluxes and thus surface temperatures. We conclude that there is still a lack of field observations to better understand and simulate the behaviour of tropical land-use systems. If the necessary detail on model parameter values, which characterise the differences between the land-use systems, is known, the existing model approaches are suitable to investigate consequences of land-use change to regional biogeochemical cycling, water utilisation and climate change. © 2007, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cacao agroforestry system; carbon dioxide fluxes; eddy correlation; energy fluxes; land-use change; montane tropical rain forest; regional modelling; remote sensing; SVAT model","Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Ecosystems; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Heat flux; Rain; Remote sensing; Tropics; Biogeochemical cycling; Carbon dioxide sequestration; Eddy correlation method; Field investigation; Net primary production; Spatial variability; Surface temperatures; Tropical rain forest; Land use",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108410164

The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and improved earthquake measures to maintain energy supply systems and a reliable energy supply have not been studied in sufficient detail. In the present study, we focused on emergency generators within buildings in urban areas and the surplus capacity of district heating and cooling (DHC) plants as unutilized energy sources. Combined heat and power systems (CHPs) can be used in both emergency situations and under normal conditions. Thus, we propose replacing emergency generators with highly efficient CHPs and networking them as a new method for organizing an energy supply system that contributes to increases in both eco-friendliness and the safety of the city in the event of earthquakes. We also discuss the surplus capacity of district heating and cooling (DHC) plants as parts of the network.

Leaves were sampled from five populations along a climatic gradient in Israel from mesic Mediterranean to xeric (and geographically peripheral) sites. Leaves of the xeric populations were ca. 25% smaller in size (length) than leaves of other populations. Leaf developmental instability (an indicator of stress) was examined using the measurement of leaf asymmetry (LA), estimated by the deviation from the origin of paired lateral leaflets and by the presence vs. absence of the terminal leaflet. LA was not correlated with the climatic (site) gradient and had the highest, though not significantly, levels in the intermediate ecotonal zone between the Mediterranean and the arid ecosystems. Male trees were 13% higher in LA than females. Density of two specialist gall-forming aphids varied with site but was not affected by plant gender. Gender-related developmental instability is discussed in relation to resource allocation in early spring. Because the study was limited to five populations further research is clearly needed. © Institute of Botany, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic 2007.","Aphids; Environmental stress; Fordinae; Gall; Gender; Leaf asymmetry; Peripheral populations","aphid; climate effect; developmental stability; environmental gradient; environmental stress; herbivory; leaf; plant-herbivore interaction; population dynamics; resource allocation; sex-related difference; tree; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Aphididae; Pemphiginae; Pistacia atlantica; Pistacia vera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-63149164996

The method was successful in both countries because of the availability of well-developed statistics, geographical information, and weather and water quality monitoring systems, and the accumulation of research data concerning the generation of N loads and the fate of N in soils. Comparison of environmental loads with the loads observed in river water at the outlet of each catchment revealed that: (1) the effect of changes in the environmental load in a catchment appeared almost immediately in the river water quality in Korea, but did not appear clearly even 10 years later in Japan; and (2) the strength of the attenuation appeared to be much lower in Korea than in Japan.

These data were used to develop a drive cycle that is representative of the fleet's residential refuse collection operation and can be used to aid in the development of propulsion and emission control strategies for refuse truck applications. The instrumented truck was operated in the fleet service for a period of 6 months and rotated through a number of different routes. The fleet operates on a wide variety of collection routes which were well suited for collecting vehicle operational data representative of a greater portion of the refuse collection industry in the U.S. The large database of information was analyzed by separating it into several categories representing different parts of refuse collection service. Each category was further analyzed by using multi-variate statistical analysis techniques, where the statistical metrics and distributions of individual microtrips were evaluated. Based on the analysis, the most representative microtrips from each category were combined to generate a driving cycle. The driving cycle presented in this work, in addition to the speed and time trace, also includes details of engine operation including power requirements and fuel consumption. Modal and transient analysis was performed on the whole and individual segments of the developed duty cycle. This data will serve as a basis for development of hybridization strategies for the hybrid hydraulic project and can also be used by fleets and truck manufacturers to better understand refuse collection operation.

In the present work, we studied the stability of these RMC structures using canonical Monte-Carlo simulations. Two different descriptions of the carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen interactions are used, both encompassing the bonding processes characteristic of carbon chemistry. The first approach is based on a bond-order potential while the second considers a tight binding model.

The effect of individual pollutants and the period(s) during pregnancy when pollutant levels are likely to have most impact on preterm birth is not clear. We evaluated the effect of prenatal exposure to six common urban air pollutants in the Sydney metropolitan area on preterm birth. Methods. We obtained information on all births in metropolitan Sydney between January 1, 1998 and December 31, 2000. For each birth, exposure to each air pollutant was estimated for the first trimester, the three months preceding birth, the first month after the estimated date of conception and the month prior to delivery. Gestational age was analysed as a categorical variable in logistic regression models. Results. There were 123 840 singleton births in Sydney in 1998-2000 and 4.9% were preterm. Preterm birth was significantly associated with maternal age, maternal smoking, male infant, indigenous status and first pregnancy. Air pollutant levels in the month and three months preceding birth had no significant effect on preterm birth after adjusting for maternal and infant covariates. Ozone levels in the first trimester of pregnancy and spring months of conception and sulphur dioxide were associated with increased risks for preterm births. Nitrogen dioxide was associated with a decreased risk of preterm births. Conclusion. We found more protective than harmful associations between ambient air pollutants and preterm births with most associations non-significant. In view of these inconsistent associations, it is important to interpret the harmful effects with caution. If our results are confirmed by future studies then it will be imperative to reduce Sydney's already low air pollution levels even further. © 2007 Jalaludin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air pollutant; air pollution; ambient air; article; Australia; birth; conception; controlled study; correlation analysis; female; first trimester pregnancy; gestational age; human; indigenous people; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; maternal age; maternal smoking; newborn; premature labor; primigravida; risk factor; seasonal variation; sex ratio; urban area; adolescent; adult; air pollutant; middle aged; pregnancy; prematurity; season; smoking; statistical model; urban population; Adolescent; Adult; Air Pollutants; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Logistic Models; Male; Maternal Age; Middle Aged; New South Wales; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Seasons; Smoking; Urban Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250813220

A set of 12 constraints, able to accurately model the dynamic evolution of the methane oxidation over a wide range of initial temperatures and pressures is proposed. Based on rational analysis of the important rate-limiting steps a further reduced set is obtained, which when is used in conjunction with RCCE is able to give excellent predictions for dynamic evolution of the system at low temperatures at different pressures. Some salient features of RCCE are explored and the RCCE method is proposed as a physics-based, rational alternative approach for the conventional detailed kinetics.

Climate change poses a growing challenge. Firstly Waternet is affected by the consequences of climate change, such as longer periods of drought and heavier bursts of rainfall. Secondly, the company also plays a role in causing climate change, as emissions from the Amsterdam water chain contribute to global warming. This paper aims to focus attention on mitigation as an inseparable part of adaptation-programmes. The Climate Footprint methodology is applied to the integrated Amsterdam water chain: from the point of withdrawing water from the surface/ groundwater water system for drinking water production, to the point of returning the purified wastewater to the surface water/groundwater system. In-between, the water is pretreated with chemicals, transported, purified by dune-filtration, again treated for drinking water quality, distributed over the area of Amsterdam, used in households and industries, collected from there by sewers and pumps, transported to purification plants and finally again treated with chemicals and purified to end with acceptable surface water quality. The whole process generates CO2-emissions in three different ways: • Sewage treatment transforms the remains of human food consumption into CO2. These emissions do not originate from fossil fuels, but from food. They remain in a short carbon cycle and do not contribute to global warming. In fact, the sludge remaining from the purification plant is an important energy source. • Transport and purification processes require energy; this results in direct emissions e.g. in the case of fuel or natural gas use, and indirect emissions in the case of electricity. • The use of chemicals and materials for construction, transport systems, and all other facilities and services to keep the system running does require suppliers of these goods and services to consume energy and thus causes indirect emission. An inventory of these three different types of emissions is made for the (about) 1990 situation, the 2004 situation, and prognosticated for the 2007 situation. The 2004 situation reveals a 0.16 ton CO2 equivalent emission per person. Compared to the worldwide 4 ton emission per person, this would mean a 4% contribution from the urban water system.

A redshift of the stimulated emission peak with increasing excitation intensity was observed in samples with barrier widths narrower than 350 Å, and the stimulated emission mechanism in these samples is found to be dominated by exciton-exciton scattering. In contrast, no redshifts were observed for the sample with a barrier width of 500 Å, and the stimulated emission in this sample appears to be dominated by biexcitons. Time-resolved spectroscopy measurements were also performed on samples with barrier width of 47 and 500 Å below the threshold of stimulated emission, and it was found that the exciton lifetime decreases with increasing exciton energy for both of the samples. With a ten times smaller barrier width in the 47 Å sample, the lifetime of high energy exciton is significantly shorter than that of the other sample, while the low energy lifetime becomes longer. This implies that with a narrower barrier width of the quantum wells the excitons move faster to lower energy regions. The narrower the barrier, the easier it is for excitons to move through the miniband. This freedom of movement increases the exciton concentration at low energies in localized areas in the wells. High exciton concentration made exciton-exciton scattering more probable and reduce the stimulated emission threshold value. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.",,"Band structure; Energy barriers; Excitation energy; Stimulated emission; Zinc compounds; Barrier widths; Excitation intensity; Redshifts; Time-resolved spectroscopy measurements; Semiconductor quantum wells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548604339

This rule makes the United States the first country in the world to regulate mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The Clean Air Mercury Rule will build on EPA's Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) to significantly reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants - the largest remaining sources of mercury emissions in the country. The Clean Air Mercury Rule establishes ""standards of performance"" limiting mercury emissions from new and existing coal-fired power plants and creates a market-based cap-and-trade program that will reduce nationwide utility emissions of mercury in two distinct phases. The first phase cap is 38 tons and emissions will be reduced by taking advantage of ""co-benefit"" reductions - that is, mercury reductions achieved by reducing sulfur dioxide (S02) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions under CAIR. In the second phase, due in 2018, coal-fired power plants will be subject to a second cap, which will reduce emissions to 15 tons upon full implementation. New coal-fired power plants (""new"" means construction starting on or after Jan. 30, 2004) will have to meet stringent new source performance standards in addition to being subject to the caps. EPA's modeling shows that CAIR will significantly reduce the majority of the coal-fired power plant mercury emissions that deposit in the United States, and those reductions will occur in areas where mercury deposition is currently the highest. The Clean Air Mercury Rule is expected to make additional reductions in emissions that are transported regionally and deposited domestically, and it will reduce emissions that contribute to atmospheric mercury worldwide.",,"Coal; Coal deposits; Coal fueled furnaces; Commerce; Emission control; Fire tube boilers; Mercury (metal); Mining; Nitrogen oxides; Power markets; Sulfur dioxide; Waste management; Atmospheric mercury; Cap-and-trade program; Clean air interstate rules; Clean Air Mercury Rule; Coal-fired power plant; Mercury depositions; New Source Performance Standards; Power generation industries; Fossil fuel power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933557039

Alternative fuels such as biodiesel, ethanol etc. have been quite promising in both aspects. Biodiesel reduces emissions significantly with an exception on oxides of nitrogen (NOx). The propensity for the production of NOx emissions while using biodiesel is an important problem that requires extensive research. NOx emission from a direct-injection diesel engine is mainly due to formation of thermal NO that is described by Zeldovich mechanism. Thus, studying temperature profile during biodiesel combustion can provide useful insight into the formation and destruction of NOx. The main objective of this work is to investigate the effect of blending biodiesel with diesel, ethanol and methyl acetate. This objective is achieved by obtaining thermocouple measurements and thermal infrared imaging of local flame temperatures of wick-generated open air flames. A relationship between blend proportion and relative flame temperatures was obtained. In addition, separate analysis of relative flame temperatures of different components of biodiesel was performed. In general, it was found that blending ethanol and methyl acetate tends to increase the flame temperature in comparison with straight diesel. It was also found that the saturated methyl esters result in greater flame temperatures in compare to unsaturated methyl esters.","Biodiesel; Blending; Flame; Flame temperature; NOx; Unsaturation","Energy demand; Flame temperature; Methyl acetates; Zeldovich mechanism; Combustion; Esters; Ethanol fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Biodiesel",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35649015763

It has been often observed that most disadvantaged groups suffer more severely these negative externalities, so generating environmental injustice. This paper tackles the diagnosis of the extent the negative externalities, derived from sulphur dioxide atmospheric pollution, unequally affect to the zones populated by the distinct income groups in Madrid, in order to check the environmental equity / unequity they could cause in two years, 1995 and 2005. To this end two data sources are used: income per capita by small spatial units and the pollution registered in the ground surveillance observatories. The later data, associated to point locations, have served as input to produce, by spatial interpolation, raster layers estimating the atmospheric concentration of the pollutant, and then a cross-tabulation between the income and the sulphur dioxide raster layers has been obtained to determine the relative level of affection suffered by each income group. Analysing the facts in two years allows to assess the output, in terms of environmental equity, of the policy promoting heaters modernization and the derived reduction in sulphur dioxide emissions. The method illustrates how GIS analysis can be effectively applied to diagnose geographical situations, and so to analyse public policies and to make spatial decisions taking into account the nowadays well established principle of environmental justice.","Atmospheric pollution; Environmental justice; Geographical information systems; Madrid; Urban environment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39449083210

Early mining operations concentrated on direct shipping ores, which are the result of post-depositional upgrading principally by deep weathering. As direct shipping ore reserves became depleted, the focus changed to the production of iron ore pellets from taconite. The post-depositional processes responsible for upgrading taconite are regional metamorphism, contact metamorphism and hydrothermal processes (Clout and Simonson, 2005). While these processes are important in iron ore genesis they can also contribute to liberation problems and in some instances reduced pellet quality (Han, 2004). Low-grade metamorphic mineral assemblages can negatively impact liberation and pellet quality. Low-grade iron formation may contain a suite of carbonate minerals including ankerite, dolomite, kutnohorite, siderite and magnesiosiderite. Variation in the distribution and composition of siderite and magnesiosiderite makes controlling the MgO content of pellets difficult. Carbonate minerals also require calcination in the pellet induration process, which requires additional heat to be added to the system, slowing down the induration process and reducing throughput. Prediction of carbonate mineralogy and carbonate mineral chemistry is an important goal of ore characterisation for pelletising properties. Contact metamorphism causes changes in mineralogy and grain size (Klein, 1973; Gunderson and Schwartz, 1962). Increasing the grain size of magnetite should improve its liberation characteristics. However, plant grinding targets may not allow the coarse-grained, more easily liberating magnetite ores to increase throughput and can actually result in decreased throughput due to recirculation. While magnetite and martite ores are well understood (Lukey, Johnson and Scott, 2007) late open-space filling microplaty haematite ores are not. These ores, while composed of similar minerals, have a unique genesis that results in fine grain size and complex textures that present liberation challenges and often make interpreting laboratory metallurgical test results more difficult.",,"Calcination; Carbonate minerals; Carbonates; Carbonation; Crystallography; Films; Grain size and shape; Hematite; Iron ore pellets; Iron ores; Lakes; Lithology; Magnetite; Metamorphic rocks; Mineralogy; Mining; Ore pellets; Ores; Oxide minerals; Pelletizing; Silica; Silicate minerals; Textures; Additional heats; Characterisation; Contact metamorphisms; Depositional processes; Fine grains; Grain sizes; Haematite; Hydrothermal processes; Iron formations; Lake superiors; Magnetite ores; Metallurgical tests; MgO contents; Mineral- assemblages; Mining operations; Ore geneses; Ore reserves; Pellet qualities; Recirculation; Space fillings; Minerals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049156781

Researchers have developed instruments for measuring safety climate and have established some degree of psychometric reliability and validity. The problem, however, is that predictive validity has not been firmly established, which reduces the credibility of safety climate as a meaningful social construct. The research described in this article addresses this problem and provides additional support for safety climate as a viable construct and as a predictive indicator of safety-related outcomes. Methods: This study used 292 employees at three locations of a heavy manufacturing organization to complete the 16 item Zohar Safety Climate Questionnaire (ZSCQ) [Zohar, D., & Luria, G. (2005). A multilevel model of safety climate: Cross-level relationships between organization and group-level climates. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(4), 616-628]. In addition, safety behavior and accident experience data were collected for 5 months following the survey and were statistically analyzed (structural equation modeling, confirmatory factor analysis, exploratory factor analysis, etc.) to identify correlations, associations, internal consistency, and factorial structures. Results: Results revealed that the ZSCQ: (a) was psychometrically reliable and valid, (b) served as an effective predictor of safety-related outcomes (behavior and accident experience), and (c) could be trimmed to an 11 item survey with little loss of explanatory power. Impact on Industry: Practitioners and researchers can use the ZSCQ with reasonable certainty of the questionnaire's reliability and validity.

These issues include: curbing CO2 emissions, coping with surging primary energy prices, complying with increasingly stringent national and local emissions restrictions, while striving to improve generation efficiencies. Uncontrolled carbon emissions from coal plants exceed natural gas fired alternatives by more than two to one due in large part to greater fuel carbon content and lower overall energy conversion efficiencies. In a carbonconstrained environment, power production from coal must realize improvements beyond incremental efficiency gains in order to have significant CO2 emissions reduction. Coal gasification and associated fuel process treatment units, provide the mechanisms inherently needed to effectively separate carbon components on a ""pre-combustion"" basis, leaving essentially carbon free hydrogen fuel available for combustion within the combined cycle power plant. Gas turbines will play a significant role in meeting this generation challenge, not only from a fuel flexibility perspective, but also in the area of CO2 reduction where combustion turbines will likely become the primary hydrogen energy conversion unit for the foreseeable future. Worldwide, GE gas turbines continue to demonstrate their proven, reliable performance on hydrogen bearing fuels, including installations with up to 95% hydrogen by volume. As the focus on pre-combustion carbon capture continues to grow, never has this experience with high hydrogen fuels been more relevant. Furthermore, GE continues to develop combustion designs not only to extend this experience to advanced gas turbine platforms, including FB syngas products, but also with an eye to reduce or eliminate diluent requirements for emission control. The ever-present focus on efficiency improvement and emissions reduction, combined with improved gasification processes, is anticipated to require advanced combustion system designs that can achieve low emissions at higher firing temperatures with minimal to no dilution for NOx abatement. These advanced combustion systems will extend the well-established benefits of pre-mixed combustion to the highly reactive high hydrogen fuel streams that will characterize a carbon constrained power generation market. This paper discusses the challenge of low CO2 fuel for advanced gas turbines with particular focus on high hydrogen combustion. The impact of using high hydrogen content syngas in terms of gas turbine fuel and accessory system designs is also discussed.",,"A-carbon; Advanced combustion systems; Carbon capture; Carbon content; Carbon emissions; Coal plants; Combustion turbine; Efficiency gain; Efficiency improvement; Emissions reduction; Firing temperature; Fuel flexibility; Gas turbine fuels; Gasification process; Hydrocarbon fuel; Hydrogen combustion; Hydrogen contents; Hydrogen Energy; Landscape changes; Large parts; Local emissions; Low emission; NOx abatement; Power generation markets; Power production; Pre-combustions; Primary energies; Process treatments; Reliable performance; Syn-gas; System design; Carbonization; Coal; Coal gasification; Coal industry; Combined cycle power plants; Conversion efficiency; Design; Emission control; Energy conversion; Fuel systems; Fuels; Gas bearings; Gas emissions; Gas generators; Gas plants; Gas turbines; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Leakage (fluid); Smoke; Turbomachinery; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-74949137018

The operating conditions of these new options span a wide range: system temperature can be as low as 70K or over 600K, system pressure varies from less than 100kPa to 35MPa, and heat loads can be moderate or can be measured in megawatts. While the intense focus placed on storage materials has been appropriate, there is also a need for research in engineering, specifically in containment, heat transfer, and controls. The DOE's recently proposed engineering center of expertise' underscores the growing understanding that engineering research will play a role in the success of advanced hydrogen storage systems. Engineering a hydrogen system will minimally require containment of the storage media and control of the hydrogenation and dehydrogenation processes, but an elegant system design will compensate for the storage media's weaker aspects and capitalize on its strengths. To achieve such a complete solution, the storage tank must be designed to work with the media, the vehicle packaging, the power-plant, and the power-plant's control system. In some cases there are synergies available that increase the efficiency of both subsystems simultaneously. In addition, system designers will need to make the hard choices needed to convert a technically feasible concept into a commercially successful product. Materials cost, assembly cost, and end of life costs will all shape the final design of a viable hydrogen storage system. Once again there is a critical role for engineering research, in this case into lower cost and higher performance engineering materials. Each form of hydrogen storage has its own, unique, challenges and opportunities for the system designer. These differing requirements stem directly from the properties of the storage media. Aside from physical containment of compressed or liquefied hydrogen, most storage media can be assigned to one of four major categories, chemical storage, metal hydrides, complex hydrides, or physisorption. Specific needs of each technology are discussed below. Physisorption systems currently operate at 77K with very fast kinetics and good gravimetric capacity; and as such, special engineering challenges center on controlling heat transfer. Excellent MLVSI is available, its cost is high and it is not readily applied to complex shape in a mass manufacture setting. Additionally, while the heat of adsorption on most physisorbents is a relatively modest 6-10kJ/mol H2, this heat must be moved up a 200K gradient. Physisorpion systems are also challenged on density. Consequently, methods for reducing the cost of producing and assembling compact, high-quality insulation, tank design to minimize heat transfer while maintaining manufacturability, improved methods of heat transfer to and from the storage media, and controls to optimize filling are areas of profitable research. It may be noted that the first two areas would also contribute to improvement of liquid hydrogen tanks. Metal hydrides are currently nearest application in the form of high pressure metal hydride tanks because of their reduced volume relative to compressed gas tanks of the same capacity and pressure. These systems typically use simple pressure controls, and have enthalpies of roughly 20kJ/mol H2 and plateau pressures of at most a few MPa. During filling, temperatures must be high enough to ensure fast kinetics, but kept low enough that the thermodynamically set plateau pressure is well below the filling pressure. To accomplish this balance the heat transfer system must handle on the order of 300kW during the 5 minute fill of a 10kg tank. These systems are also challenged on mass and the cost of the media. High value areas for research include: heat transfer inside a 35MParated pressure vessel, light and strong tank construction materials with reduced cost, and metals or other materials that do not embrittle in the presence of high pressure hydrogen when operated below -400K. The latter two topics would also have a beneficial impact on compressed gas hydrogen storage systems, the current ""system to beat"" Complex hydrides frequently have high hydrogen capacity but also an enthalpy of adsorption &gt;30kJ/mol H2, a hydrogen release temperature &gt;370K, and in many cases multiple steps of adsorption/desorption with slow kinetics in at least one of the steps. Most complex hydrides are thermal insulators in the hydrided form. From an engineering perspective, improved methods and designs for cost effective heat transfer to the storage media in a 5 to 10MPa vessel is of significant interest, as are materials that resist embrittlement at pressures below 1 OMPa and temperatures below 500K. Chemical hydrides produce heat when releasing hydrogen; in some systems this can be managed with air cooling of the reactor, but in other systems that may not be possible. In general, chemical hydrides must be removed from the vehicle and regenerated off-board. They are challenged on durability and recycling energy. Engineering research of interest in these systems centers around maintaining the spent fuel in a state suitable for rapid removal while minimizing system mass, and on developing highly efficient recycling plant designs that make the most of heat from exothermic steps. While the designs of each category of storage tank will differ with the material properties, two common engineering research thrusts stand out, heat transfer and structural materials. In addition, control strategies are important to all advanced storage systems, though they will vary significantly from system to system. Chemical systems need controls primarily to match hydrogen supply to power-plant demand, including shut down. High pressure metal hydride systems will need control during filling to maintain an appropriately low plateau pressure. Complex hydrides will need control for optimal filling and release of hydrogen from materials with multi-step reactions. Even the relatively simple compressed-gas tanks require control strategies during refill. Heat transfer systems will modulate performance and directly impact cost. While issues such as thermal conductivity may not be as great as anticipated, the heat transfer system still impacts gravimetric efficiency, volumetric efficiency and cost. These are three key factors to commercial viability, so any research that improves performance or reduces cost is important. Recent work in the DOE FreedomCAR program indicates that some 14% of the system mass may be attributed to heat transfer in complex hydride systems2. If this system is made to withstand 100 bar at 450K the material cost will be a meaningful portion of the total tank cost. Improvements to the basic shell and tube structures that can reduce the total mass of heat transfer equipment while maintaining good global and local temperature control are needed. Reducing the mass and cost of the materials of construction would also benefit all systems. Much has been made of the need to reduce the cost of carbon fiber in compressed tanks and new processes are being investigated. Further progress is likely to benefit any composite tank, not just compressed gas tanks. In a like fashion, all tanks have metal parts. Today those parts are made from expensive alloys, such as A286. If other structural materials could be proven suitable for tank construction there would be a direct cost benefit to all tank systems. Finally there is a need to match the system to the storage material and the power-plant. Recent work has shown there are strong effects of material properties on system performance , not only because of the material, but also because the material properties drive the tank design to be more or less efficient. Filling of a hydride tank provides an excellent example. A five minute or less fill time is desirable. Hydrogen will be supplied as a gas, perhaps at a fixed pressure and temperature. The kinetics of the hydride will dictate how fast hydrogen can be absorbed, and the thermodynamics will determine if hydrogen can be absorbed at all; both properties are temperature dependent. The temperature will depend on how fast heat is generated by absorption and how fast heat can be added or removed by the system. If the design system and material properties are not both well suited to this filling scenario the actual amount of hydrogen stored could be significantly less than the capacity of the system. Controls may play an important role as well, by altering the coolant temperature and flow, and the gas temperature and pressure, a better fill is likely. Similar strategies have already been demonstrated for compressed gas systems . Matching system capabilities to power-plant needs is also important. Supplying the demanded fuel in transients and start up are obvious requirements that both the tank system and material must be design to meet. But there are opportunities too. If the power-plant heat can be used to release hydrogen, then the efficiency of vehicle increases greatly. This efficiency comes not only from preventing hydrogen losses from supplying heat to the media, but also from the power-plant cooling that occurs. To reap this benefit, it will be important to have elegant control strategies that avoid unwanted feedback between the power-plant and the fuel system. Hydrogen fueled vehicles are making tremendous strides, as can be seen by the number and increasing market readiness of vehicles in technology validation programs. Research that improves the effectiveness and reduces the costs of heat transfer systems, tank construction materials, and control systems will play a key role in preparing advanced hydrogen storage systems to be a part of this transportation revolution.

It has graduated more than 3000 graduates since then. About 40% of them are still working in the nuclear fields in Taiwan and abroad. In the past ten years or so, due to the anti-nuclear environments and the current Government's policy, the enrolment of students has been very difficult. In 1997, the department decided to change to the current name to broaden the research areas into multi-discipline integrated systems including nuclear engineering as one part of the systems. Nevertheless, since the Kyoto Protocol has limited the emission of CO2 and in conjunction with the scarce and rising price of fossil fuel, the need for nuclear energy in Taiwan becomes inevitable and necessary. This fact is reflected from Figure 1. It is seen that the numbers of undergraduate students taking nuclear related courses have been increasing over the past seven years.

The scheme is based on a novel steam gasification process of low rank coals with calcined limestone where in-situ CO2 capture and steam reforming are performed in a single reactor. CO2 is separated reacting exothermically with CaO based sorbents, providing also the necessary heat for the gasification reactions. The produced gas is a H2-rich gas with low carbon or near zero carbon content, depending on the ratio of lime added to the process. The produced fuel gas can be used in state-of-the-art combined cycles where it is converted to electricity, generating almost no CO2 emissions. After being captured in the gasification process, CO2 is released in a separate reactor where extra energy is provided through the combustion of low rank coal. Regenerated CaO is produced in this reactor and is continuously recycled within the process. The key element of the concept is the high-pressure steam gasification process where CO2 is captured by CaO based sorbents and fuel gas with high hydrogen content is produced, without using additional shift reactors. Two optimised power plant configurations are presented in detail and examined. In the first case, pure oxygen is utilised for the low rank coal combustion in the limestone regeneration process, while in the second case fuel is combusted with air instead. Results from the equilibrium based mass balance of the two reactors as well as the power plant thermodynamic simulations, dealing with the most important features for CO2 reduction are presented concerning the two different options. The energy penalties are quantified and the power plant efficiencies are calculated. The calculated results demonstrate the capability of the power plant to deliver decarbonised electricity while achieving high overall electrical efficiencies, comparable to other technological alternatives for CO2 capture power plants. The Aspen Plus software is used for the equilibrium based mass balance of the gasifier and the regenerator while the combined cycle power plant cycle calculations are performed with the thermodynamic cycle calculation software ENBIPRO (ENergie-BIllanz-PROgram), a powerful tool for heat and mass balance solving of complex thermodynamic circuits, calculation of efficiency, exergetic and exergoeconomic analysis of power plants [1].

It is known, that the extinction of optical radiation visible and near IR spectra in the marine surface layer is determined mainly by scattering and absorption atmospheric aerosol. It influences on a dependence of spectral transmission and extinction both natural, and artificial light that is of interest for a wide range of problems, in particular for radiating problems at studying laws of climate formation , and for lines of the applications connected to the forecast of a signal power in coastal conditions at an estimation of EO systems characteristics. This is important to optical retrievals from satellite, remote sensing at environmental monitoring, backscatter of light to space (including climate forcing), cloud properties etc. In unpolluted regions the greatest effects on near shore scattering extinction will be a result of sea-salt from breaking waves and variations in relative humidity. The role of breaking waves appears to be modulated by wind, tide, swell, wave spectra and coastal conditions. These influences will be superimposed upon aerosol generated by open ocean sea-salt aerosol that varies with wind speed. The focus of our study is the extinction and optical effects due to aerosol in a specific coastal region. This involves linking coastal physical properties to oceanic and meteorological parameters in order to develop predictive algorithms that describe 3-D aerosol structure and variability.

Peonies have been reported to flower successfully in areas with 2-3 months of freezing temperatures. However, our studies revealed that they can bloom successfully in areas with cool temperatures, above freezing. In the north of Israel, some peonies flowered in April-May. It was realized that for successful commercial production, the peony has to be subjected to low temperatures during the winter and to moderate-warm temperatures in summer. The aim of the project was to evaluate the growth cycle of peonies in Israel and to study the effect of environmental conditions on flowering and dormancy. Periodical morphological studies revealed that flower bud initiation in the underground renewal buds began in late summer and continued until the plants shed their leaves and became dormant in November. Moderate temperatures are required following dormancy breaking when the flowers grow and develop. Higher growing temperatures cause flower abortion. The information gained from these studies has formed the basis for developing three practical methods for cut flower production of herbaceous peonies in Israel: (1) Plants are grown in containers whereby all necessary environmental conditions for optimal flower development can be provided. With this method a very early crop can be obtained from mid-January on; (2) Field-grown plants in uncovered greenhouses are exposed to ambient cold temperatures until they receive a certain number of predetermined chill units. They are then covered with plastic sheets, to raise the growing temperatures. Such plants flower about one month earlier than plants grown in an open field, in March-April; (3) Peonies are grown in open plots and in net-houses for cut flower production in April-May.","Chilling requirements; Florogenesis; Geophyte; Paeonia","Paeonia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70449457168

DESIGN AND METHODS: We present a review of the limited research available on health care for older AL residents and on building testable models of better ways to organize primary health care and other health services for AL residents. RESULTS: AL residents are frequently frail older persons who need good chronic care. The predominant care models today do not respond adequately to this challenge. Medical care for AL residents is currently practiced very much like that for persons living in the community. The potential for using the aggregation of patients has not been effectively tapped. We review some managed care models from other elements of long-term care to look for ways that might be adapted. However, the current funding approach emphasizes living settings rather than inherent client characteristics. IMPLICATIONS: A research agenda might include ways to improve communication between AL and medical providers and to get AL staff more actively involved in daily care. Research support might produce the data necessary to entice the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services into changing its current reimbursement policies to create a climate better suited to delivering good chronic disease care in AL facilities.",,"aged; aging; assisted living facility; elderly care; geriatric assessment; health insurance; human; long term care; methodology; practice guideline; primary health care; review; standard; United States; Aged; Aging; Assisted Living Facilities; Geriatric Assessment; Health Services for the Aged; Humans; Long-Term Care; Managed Care Programs; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Primary Health Care; Research Design; United States; MLCS; MLOWN",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-65849472510

The findings are quantitatively explained by a modal redistribution of spontaneous emission due to the modified local density of photonic states.

An illustrative example of a heating process with humidification is considered and the effects of air temperature and relative humidity at the inlet and exit, the temperature of steam used for humidification, and the dead state properties of exergy efficiency and exergy destruction are investigated. The results indicate that processes with low exergy efficiency and high exergy destruction have significant potential for improving performance. A parametric investigation shows that exergy efficiency and exergy destruction are very sensitive to air properties and dead state conditions. It is seen that the use of exergy in assessing HVAC&R systems can be highly advantageous, leading to technical advantages such as improved efficiency as well as environmental improvements through reduced emissions and economic benefits.

A variety of ANN-models have been developed to process and train a system with large scale climate signals for the summer precipitation spells. The summer monsoon is one of the most dynamic climate systems that controls rainfall variation in some Asian countries such as India and Pakistan and delivers a component of annual rainfall in these regions. The sum of rainfall during July, August and September is called summer monsoon rainfall. In order to quantify the effects of large scale climate signals on the precipitation in the study area, long-term records of SST (Sea Surface Temperature) and SLP (Sea Level Pressure) over Oman Sea, Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean have been examined. The SSTs over west coast of India as well as the SSTs over the Oman Sea shows a high correlation with monsoon rainfall in Iran. Also SLP over the Northern part of India shows a significant correlation with recorded rainfall at different points of the region. These signals can be used as useful predictors for monsoon rainfall at the southeastern part of Iran. The results show that considering a set of predictors developed in this study could significantly increase the accuracy of long-lead precipitation forecasting in the study area using ANN models. © 2007 ASCE.","Artificial Neural Network (ANN); Climate signals; Forecasting; Monsoon rainfall; Rainfall predictors; SLP; SST","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Forecasting; Neural networks; Rain; Sea level; Surface waters; Weather forecasting; Climate signals; Large scale climate signals; Monsoon rainfall; Precipitation forecasting; Rainfall forecasting; Sea surface temperature (SST); Summer monsoon rainfall; Summer precipitation; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088743710

We investigated VOC emissions from 19 controlled laboratory fires at the USFS (United States Forest Service) Fire Sciences Laboratory and 16 fires during an intensive airborne field campaign during the peak of the burning season in Brazil in 2004. The VOC emissions were dominated by oxygenated VOCs (OVOC) (OVOC/NMHC -4:1, NMHC: nonmethane hydrocarbons) The specificity of the PTR-MS instrument, which measures the mass to charge ratio of VOCs ionized by H3O+ ions, was validated by gas chromatography and by intercomparing in-situ measurements with those obtained from an open path FTIR instrument. Emission ratios for methyl vinyl ketone, methacrolein, crotonaldehyde, acrylonitrile and pyrrole were measured in the field for the first time.

In recent years the human health impacts have become the main concern, especially due to atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM). These changes in priorities required new modelling tools for supporting national and international policymaking. This paper describes the development of such a policy-supporting tool, the Finnish Regional Emission Scenario (FRES) model. The main features that are important to assess different environmental problems, including the interfaces to atmospheric dispersion models and the spatial scales of mapping effects, are demonstrated with several policy-support studies. The earlier cases concentrated on ecosystem impacts of acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone, mainly due to long-range transboundary pollution. The current emphasis on the health impacts of PM assesses both long-range and local contributions. The new PM modelling challenges include the need of the high spatial resolution of emission sources.","Emission models; Fine particles; Integrated assessment modeling; Nitrogen oxides; Sulphur dioxide","Air pollution; Eutrophication; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Emission models; Fine particles; Integrated assessment modeling; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44349084761

The powertrain types assessed include naturally-aspirated gasoline engines, turbocharged gasoline engines, diesel engines, gasoline-electric hybrids, and various advanced transmissions. Advancements in aerodynamics, vehicle weight reduction and tire rolling friction are also taken into account. The objective of the comparison is the potential of anticipated improvements in these powertrain technologies for reducing petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions at the same level of performance as current vehicles in the U.S.A. The fuel consumption and performance of future vehicles was estimated using a combination of scaling laws and detailed vehicle simulations. The results indicate that there is significant potential for reduction of fuel consumption for all the powertrains examined. More specifically, the current relative advantage of diesel over gasoline engines in terms of fuel consumption is likely to be reduced. Future turbocharged gasoline engines appear to have the potential to approach the fuel consumption levels of low emissions diesel engines. Hybrid electric vehicles will maintain a significant advantage over the other powertrains in terms of reduction of fuel consumption. This relative advantage is larger for urban than for highway driving.

The FR with S-CO2 gas turbine achieves higher cycle efficiency than conventional sodium-cooled FRs with steam turbines, eliminating problems of conventional FRs related to safety, plant maintenance, and construction costs. The S-CO2 FR consumes minor actinide elements produced in light water reactors as fuel, thereby reducing long-lived radioactive wastes and environmental loads imparted by long-term geological disposal. The recovered waste heat is used for methane and methanol production through fermentation of human and animal wastes in cities and farms. The methane and methanol are easily transported and can accommodate demand changes: they are useful as fuel of fuel cells, automobiles, and gas turbine power plants. The total energy utilization efficiency in electricity and heat is estimated to be higher than 85%, contributing to saving of energy resources and reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions.

Fluxes of total mass, organic matter (OM), carbonate, biogenic opal, and lithogenics showed definite seasonal changes. In particular, there was a steep gradient in export production from June to December 1993 at the studied sites along a transect at 175°E, while the gradient was quite uniform from January to April 1994. Annual mean total mass flux varied from 47.4 mg m-2 day-1 at the southernmost station (Site 6; 30°N) in subtropical waters to 207.7 mg m-2 day-1 at the subarctic station (Site 8; 46°N). The transition zone showed intermediate fluxes of 41.1 and 94.6 mg m-2 day-1 (Sites 5 and 7; 34°N and 37°N, respectively). Correlations between OM, carbonate, and biogenic opal fluxes suggest that siliceous plankton was mainly responsible for the OM flux via settling particles at the subarctic station (Site 8), while carbonaceous plankton was responsible at the subtropical station (Site 6). Compared with the mean particle flux at mid-latitudes in the Atlantic, the Pacific showed significantly high biogenic opal flux due to nutrient enrichment in Pacific surface waters. The injection of aerosol-derived iron from the Asian continent may play a role in enhancing primary and export production in this area. An interesting feature observed in this study area is that a significant time lag was present between the dust storm peaks in the Asian continent source region and peaks of lithogenic flux at Site 7. This time lag suggests that eolian dust is being transported in the following manner: atmospheric transport brings dust from the source region to the ocean, where it remains suspended in the upper layer of the Kuroshio Current and Kuroshio Extension for up to 2 months; the dust is then removed by incorporation into biogenic pellets or amorphous aggregates when primary production is active in the upper layers. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The scope of this project was NOx, SOx, Particulate Matter and mercury emissions, their impact and their management, with particular reference to the Hunter Valley and the Newcastle region of Australia. This research assessed a range of pollutant impact mitigation measures in collaboration with government, industry and community stakeholders. It inquired into: Current and projected levels of pollutant emissions in NSW; Environmental and social impacts from those emissions; Potential mitigation strategies and their costs and benefits; and Gauged which strategies are most effective and most acceptable to stakeholders from industry, government and non-government groups. Although Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) is commonly used in this field, it has notable flaws, especially in the conversion of complex sustainability considerations into monetary units. Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) was chosen instead, as a more progressive multi-disciplinary approach, which can assess a variety of options, on a quantitative and qualitative basis. This project examined the principle that active stakeholder engagement in research contributes to improved policy development, corporate strategy formulation and creates an informed community and NGO outlook. The dialogue enabled by this research process may also spin-off other important sustainability outcomes such as partnership development and a shared understanding of multiple stakeholder perspectives.

Box 40002, Khon Kaen, Thailand","Locals feed resources are prime importance for ruminants raised in the tropic particularly low-quality roughages and agricultural crop-residues. Manipulating rumen fermentation through treatment of roughage, concentrate and strategic supplementation with organic acids could improve rumen efficiency by maintaining higher pH, optimum ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N), thus reducing methane (CH4) and increasing microbial protein synthesis and essential volatile fatty acid (VFAs), for enhancing ruminant productivity in the tropics. The manipulation of rumen efficiency through the use of organic acids especially malate with local feeds would be an advantage. Indeed, organic acids potentially provide an alternative to currently used antimicrobial compounds by stimulating rather than inhibiting specific ruminal microbial populations. At the same time, local feed resources especially cassava chip could be used effectively at high level as an energy source for ruminants especially for beef and lactating cows. More recently, the combined use of concentrates containing high level of cassava chip with supplementation of sodium dl-malate and urea could improve rumen ecology and subsequent performance in dairy steers receiving urea-treated rice straw as a roughage. In addition, the high level of cassava chip in the diet resulted in increase population of bacteria and fungi, decreasing protozoal populations, and improving microbial protein synthesis and efficient microbial nitrogen supply in the rumen. Under these circumstances, malate was also effective in reducing the drop in ruminal pH normally seen 1 to 2 h after feeding a high-grain diet and improved cows performance efficiency. In summary, supplementation of organic acid like malate with local feed resources especially cassava chip or other carbohydrate sources with high rumen degradation would be a desirable alternative because there is no risk of developing antibiotic resistance or having unwanted residues appear in either meat or milk products as well as improving ruminal fermentation efficiency and productivity in ruminants in the tropics. © Asian Network for Scientific Information, 2007.","Cassava chip; Feed resources; Malate; Organic acids; Rumen fermentation; Ruminants; Tropics","ammonia; carboxylic acid; malic acid; methane; nitrogen; urea; volatile fatty acid; animal food; article; carbohydrate intake; cassava; cow; fermentation; nonhuman; protein synthesis; rumen microorganism; ruminant stomach; stomach absorption; stomach pH; tropics; Fungi; Manihot esculenta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846174284

Increasing temperatures worldwide have been blamed for numerous negative impacts on agriculture, weather, forestry, marine ecosystems, and human health. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that the primary GHG emitted in the U.S. is carbon dioxide (CO2), most of which stems from fossil fuel combustion [1]. In fact, CO2 represents approximately 85% of all GHG emissions nationwide. The other primary GHGs include nitrous oxide (N2O), methane (CH 4), ozone (O3), and fluorinated gases. Since the energy sector is responsible for a majority of the GHGs released into the atmosphere, policies that address their mitigation through the production of electricity using renewable fuels and distributed generation are of significant interest. Use of renewable fuels and clean technologies to meet energy demand instead of relying on traditional electrical grid systems is expected to result in fewer CO2 and CH4 emissions, hence reducing global climate change impacts. Technologies considered cleaner include photovoltaics, wind turbines, and combined heat and power (CHP) devices using microturbines or internal combustion engines. The Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP) in California [2] provides incentives for the installation of these technologies under certain circumstances. This paper assesses the GHG emission impacts from California's SGIP during the 2005 program year by estimating the reductions in CO2 and CH4 released when SGIP projects are in operation. Our analysis focuses on these emissions since these are the two GHGs characteristic of SGIP projects. Results of this analysis show that emissions of GHGs are reduced due to the SGIP. This is because projects operating under this program reduce reliance on electricity generated by conventional power plants and encourage the use of renewable fuels, such as captured waste heat and methane.

In order to develop and evaluate this model, first a base case was defined, which involves a building using a natural gas boiler for comfort heating and receiving electricity from a remote thermal power plant. For the base case, the rational exergy management efficiency, which is a measure of how much the supply and demand exergies match, is only 4%. In order to analyze the impact of increasing the rational exergy efficiency on carbon mitigation relative to the base case, three exergy and environment aware cases were considered. These cases were: the same building thermally linked to the power plant through a district energy system (Case One), the same building with a micro CHP using a natural gas internal combustion engine (Case Two), and the same building with a renewable energydriven electric power generator and a ground-source heat pump (Case Three). A detailed analysis of the carbon reduction potential of the three cases revealed that it is possible to realize a new CO2 reducing wedge in addition to the seven wedges that have already been identified by the Carbon Mitigation Initiative (CMI). Calculations show that Case Three may reduce the global emissions to about 4 Gton CO2/year by the year 2055 from the current value of 7 Gton CO2/year. Therefore, the eighth wedge may not only help to stabilize the current levels of emissions but also decrease it below the current level. This paper explains the rational exergy management model (REMM) and its emission projections and describes the three cases in detail. Results indicate the importance of rational exergy management for global sustainability and for secondgeneration green buildings and show that this rational exergy metric can manage a robust roadmap to curb CO2 emissions from buildings. © 2007 ASHRAE.",,"American society; Annual meetings; Built environment; Carbon mitigation; Carbon reduction; Comfort heating; Electric powers; Energy sourcing; Energy systems; Exergy efficiencies; Global sustainability; Heat pumping; In order; internal combustion; Management efficiency; management modeling; Micro-CHP; Supply and demand; Buildings; Carbon; Cobalt alloys; Cobalt compounds; Combustion equipment; Competition; Computer networks; Electric power generation; Electric power plants; Electric utilities; Electricity; Electroacupuncture; Energy resources; Gas industry; Gases; Heating; Industrial economics; Internal combustion engines; Magnetism; Management; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Natural resources; Power plants; Renewable energy resources; Thermoelectric power plants; Exergy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45749129494

Fully-captured runoff events were examined and the entire volume of runoff and particulate matter from each event was treated by the HS. The ability of the HS (in this case continuous deflective separation) to reduce particulate matter loads in rainfall-runoff was quite variable and was largely a function of the runoff granulometry and hydraulics. The HS was subject to highly variable hydraulic (flow rate) and hydrologic (duration, intensity) event characteristics, and the coupled variability of granulometry. The HS was cleaned after each event so that scour and discharge of previously captured particulate matter could be separated from event-based discharges. Given the variable clarification mechanisms of a HS, results demonstrated that a clean HS provided good separation capability for the coarse sediment fraction (> 75 μm), much less separation for the settleable fraction (25∼75 μm) and low separation capacity for the suspended fraction (1∼25 μm). Results consistently indicated that the mass fraction of sediment and settleable particles also increase compared to suspended particle fraction indicating a positive relationship between particle concentration and coarser particle size distribution (PSD). Such coupling and generation of coarser PSDs help explain the improved results at higher flow rates. Study results were representative of the flow and granulometry with the full cross-section of flow sampled and the entire gradation measured. Results indicate that the coupling of hydrology and particle transport influences particle size distributions (PSDs) in runoff flows. This study clearly demonstrates that performance by the HS was predominantly influenced by influent PSD far more strongly than hydraulics.

The resonance frequency was selected to force the coaxial air jet acoustically, because the resonance frequency is effective to amplify the forcing amplitude and reduce NOx emissions. When the resonance frequency is acoustically excited, a streamwise vortex is formed in the mixing layer between the coaxial air jet and coflowing air. As the vortex develops downstream, it entrains both ambient air and combustion products into the coaxial air jet to mix well. In addition, the strong vortex pulls the flame surface toward the coaxial air jet, causing intense chemical reaction. Acoustic excitation also causes velocity fluctuations of coaxial air jet as well as fuel jet but, the maximum value of centerline fuel velocity fluctuation occurs at the different phases of Φ=180° for nonreacting case and Φ=0° for reacting case. In addition, local flame extinction was observed and caused by high strain rate. Finally, acoustic forcing at the resonance frequency reduces the normalized flame length by 15 % and EINOx by 25 %, compared to the flame without acoustic excitation. © 2007 Combustion Institute.

However, it is difficult to clarify the mechanisms of emission reduction under such operating conditions by experiments alone because the mixture formation and combustion processes are very complicated. The main purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of boost pressure and EGR ratio on the combustion process and exhaust emissions in a direct injection diesel engine by means of a three-dimensional numerical analysis. The combustion processes under various conditions of boost pressure and EGR ratio in a research diesel engine have been numerically simulated using the authors' engine computational fluid dynamics code (GTT code). By comparing the calculated results with the experimental ones, it has been confirmed that the cylinder gas pressure, the rate of heat release, and the NO emission can be predicted reasonably well and the soot emission tendency can be predicted qualitatively. Furthermore, soot and NO formation characteristics have been examined under various EGR ratio and boost pressure conditions on the basis of φ-T (equivalence ratio-temperature) maps where the calculated local gas states in the combustion regions and the soot and NO peninsulas obtained by zero-dimensional numerical simulation have been plotted. © IMechE 2007.","Combustion analysis; Diesel engine; Emissions; Exhaust gas recirculation; Numerical analysis; Turbo charging","Computer simulation; Exhaust gases; Fuel injection; Numerical methods; Soot; Superchargers; Boost pressure; Emission reduction; Turbo charging; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250847535

For the correct delineation of tumors for radiation therapy (RT) using PET, the combined effect of all PET image degrading factors for realistic cases needs to be known. We investigate PET inaccuracy for a phantom with TC and attenuation varying non-uniformly in one direction. This 1D model enables determination of the positional, angular and statistical effects on the quantification accuracy. We simulated a cylindrical uniform TC phantom containing a non-uniform TC insert using the GATE (Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission) Monte Carlo code. The insert is made of thin parallel slabs with different TC, atomic composition and density. The phantom is simulated inside a validated model of the GE Discovery LS PET/CT scanner. The Software for Tomographic Image Reconstruction (STIR) was used to reconstruct the PET images, which were then analyzed by comparing the reconstructed to true TC recovery coefficients. Simulated images with and without attenuation (AC) and scatter and random events included and rejected were analyzed. The results showed that for strongly non-uniform attenuation and adequate statistics, very accurate attenuation, scatter and random corrections are needed to achieve accuracy better than 20% for most voxels, except close to regions with high gradient, where larger differences are seen. Insufficient scatter and random corrections lead to underestimation of the TC in regions with low attenuation. In such cases, tumors in the lung and close to the end of the axial FOV and with low statistics may not be seen. Reliable estimates of the quantification inaccuracy of 3D PET are needed if 3D PET is to be used for tumor segmentation and dose painting for radiation therapy. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Concentration (process); Germanium; Image enhancement; Image processing; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Imaging techniques; Medical imaging; Metal recovery; MOSFET devices; Oncology; Painting; Plastic bottles; Positron annihilation spectroscopy; Positron emission tomography; Radiotherapy; Random processes; Statistical methods; Thermography (temperature measurement); Tumors; 1-D models; Atomic compositions; Attenuation ,; Combined effects; Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission; Image degrading factors; Monte Carlo codes; Non-uniform tracer; Nuclear sciences; PET imaging; Quantitative accuracy; Random events; Recovery coefficients; Reliable estimates; Simulated imaging; Software for tomographic image reconstruction; Statistical effects; Tracer concentrations; Tumor segmentation; Validated model; Three dimensional",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48149105485

Upgrading of existing conventional TRs with modern new controls is still a quite popular means to improve the ESP collection efficiency, but it is better to use high-frequency switched HVDC supplies, because of reduced total cost and the improved ESP collection efficiency. There are several drivers for using high-frequency switched HVDC supplies: Greatly improved ESP collection efficiency, due to smooth DC and better control Reduced HVDC power cost due to lower mains power conversion losses Simplicity of installation - can sometimes even be made with ESP in operation With more than 1400 high-frequency switched HV supplies in operation world wide, power plants have gathered a sizeable experience in the use of such equipment. Compared with other ESP upgrade methods to reduce emission, high-frequency switched HVsupplies are a ""favorite"", especially from a cost-efficiency perspective. This paper provides experience gained from the long-term use of high-frequency switched HV-supplies and states that it is always profitable for the ESP owner to use this type of equipment.

Shell's strategy: to expand our alternative energies portfolio, while investing in advanced CO2 solutions in order to improve oui ability to manage emissions from our hydrocarbon business. Measures to manage future emissions will include developing new technologies to capture and store CO2 underground. The pursuit of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies allows Shell to play an important and leading role towards addressing the need for an increasing worldwide demand for energy, while at the same time dealing with the need to reduce global emissions. No single universal policy or technology will solve the CO2 challenge. Therefore, various CCS solutions will need to be considered within a portfolio of measures to reduce global CO2 emissions while assisting a transition towards a low-carbon energy future. Shell seeks to position itself as part of the solution to the climate change issue. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified C02 capture and storage (CCS) as the most promising for the rapid reduction of global emissions - by up to 55% by 21002. As the bridge to a more sustainable energy system, it is therefore a key solution for combating climate change - among a portfolio of solutions, including renewable energies, energy efficiency and biofuels In order to achieve deeper reductions in CO2 emissions there will need to be new technologies brought to the market to enable a 'Kyoto 2' type-agreement. Authorities such as the International Energy Agency, the European Union Commission for Research and the US Department of Energy predict that new technologies will include hydrogen fuels cells, clean coal technology, and storage of CO2 below ground - in deep saline formations or redundant reservoirs, or for enhanced oil recovery. Considerable attention is being focused on CO2 storage with the desire to reduce the cost of capture and storage below 25 $/t CO2. Shell has a special team working on the CO2 Capture Project (CCP) Joint Industry Project. For the CCP Shell carries out studies, manages projects and the team is involved evaluating opportunities for deployment of the technologies within Shell. Shell also provides the Vice Chairman for this initiative and has several key-players working on this project. CCP is an international collaboration among industry, governments, academics and environmental interest groups focused on developing technology for CO2 capture and geological storage. The CO2 Capture Team (CCT) conducts Shell's participation in the CO 2 Captare Project (CCP) and other external programs. CCT also works internally to apply external learnings and technologies within Shell businesses. Additionally, Shell's research and development funds and manages a separate CO2 storage program. Our goals are to: reduce the cost of capture by 60 to 80%, and demonstrate that geological storage can be secure. In addition to the CCP, Shell is involved in many other CO2 collaborations . A few of these are mentioned below: CO2CRC is a leading regional collaboration for capture and storage technology. Participants include international energy companies plus others from Australia and New Zealand. The Australian government helps with funding and organizational support. WESTCARB is a leading regional collaboration for infrastructure and demonstration. Participants include international energy companies plus others from the US West Coast. The US DoE helps with funding, including capital for an integrated demonstration. The IEA Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme is a unique collaboration of governments and industry. It produces definitive reports for the participants, and sponsors the premier conference on capture and storage. The reports provide primary input to the IPCC. Participants include 18 governments and 17 multi-national companies. CCT participates on the executive committee.

To avoid cooling effect, Gradual Internal Reforming (GIR) can be used. GIR is based on local coupling between steam reforming and hydrogen oxidation. The steam required for the reforming reaction is obtained from the steam generated by the hydrogen oxidation. It was demonstrated in previous studies that the cooling effect disappeared. However, with GIR, the risk of carbon formation is greater. To cope with carbon formation a new cell configuration is studied. This configuration combines a catalyst layer with a cermet anode, allowing GIR without coking. This study proposes simulations, using the CFD RC software package, of the behavior of a tubular SOFC using GIR. A thermodynamic study based on the partial pressure distributions in the cell is carried out to investigate the occurrence of carbon formation. The simulations indicate that, the risks of carbon deposition were strongly reduced if the new configuration is used. © The Electrochemical Society.",,"Carbon deposition; Carbon Formation; Catalyst layer (CL); Cell configurations; Cermet anodes; Cooling effects; Electrochemical Society (ECS); Hydrogen oxidation; Internal reforming; International symposium; local coupling; Modeling approaches; Solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC); Steam reforming; Tubular SOFC; Carbon; Cells; Cermets; Chemical oxygen demand; Computer software; Cooling; Direct energy conversion; Electric batteries; Electrochemistry; Fuel cells; Fuels; Gas fuel purification; Gas industry; Hydrogen; Nonmetals; Oxidation; Photoacoustic effect; Pneumatic control equipment; Reforming reactions; Risks; Software packages; Steam; Steam engineering; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45249111561

This method was applied to the study of soil organic carbon turnover in temperate grasslands. We tested the hypothesis that a low disturbance by grazing and cutting of the grassland increases the mean residence time of carbon in coarse (&gt;0.2mm) soil organic fractions. Grassland monoliths (0.5 × 0.5 × 0.4 m) were sampled from high and low disturbance treatments in a long-term (14yrs) grazing experiment and were placed during two years in the mesocosms. During daytime, the canopy enclosure in each mesocosm was supplied in an open flow with air at mean CO 2concentration of 425 μmol mol-1 and δ13C of -21.5±0.27‰. Fully labelled mature grass leaves reached a δ13C of -40.8 (±0.93) and -42.2‰ (±0.60) in the low and high disturbance treatments, respectively, indicating a mean 13C labelling intensity of 12.7‰ compared to unlabelled control grass leaves. After two years, the delta 13C value of total soil organic matter above 0.2 mm was reduced in average by 7.8‰ in the labelled monoliths compared to controls. The isotope mass balance technique was used to calculate for the top (0-10 cm) soil the fraction of 13C labelled carbon in the soil organic matter above 0.2mm (i.e. roots, rhizomes and paniculate organic matter). A first order exponential decay model fitted to the unlabelled C in this fraction shows an increase in mean residence time from 22 to 31 months at low compared to high disturbance. A slower decay of roots, rhizomes and particulate organic matter above 0.2 mm is therefore likely to contribute to the observed increased in soil carbon sequestration in grassland monoliths exposed to low disturbance.",,"carbon isotope; carbon sequestration; grassland; mesocosm; photosynthesis; soil carbon; soil organic matter; steady-state equilibrium; turnover; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547266316

Although experimental methods for determining protein structure are providing high resolution structures, they cannot keep the pace at which amino acid sequences are resolved on the scale of entire genomes. For a considerable fraction of proteins whose structures will not be determined experimentally, computational methods can provide valuable information. The value of structural models in biological research depends critically on their quality. Development of high-accuracy computational methods that reliably generate near-experimental quality structural models is an important, unsolved problem in the protein structure modeling. Results. Large sets of structural decoys have been generated using reduced conformational space protein modeling tool CABS. Subsequently, the reduced models were subject to all-atom reconstruction. Then, the resulting detailed models were energy-minimized using state-of-the-art all-atom force field, assuming fixed positions of the alpha carbons. It has been shown that a very short minimization leads to the proper ranking of the quality of the models (distance from the native structure), when the all-atom energy is used as the ranking criterion. Additionally, we performed test on medium and low accuracy decoys built via classical methods of comparative modeling. The test placed our model evaluation procedure among the state-of-the-art protein model assessment methods. Conclusion. These test computations show that a large scale high resolution protein structure prediction is possible, not only for small but also for large protein domains, and that it should be based on a hierarchical approach to the modeling protocol. We employed Molecular Mechanics with fixed alpha carbons to rank-order the all-atom models built on the scaffolds of the reduced models. Our tests show that a physic-based approach, usually considered computationally too demanding for large-scale applications, can be effectively used in such studies. © 2007 Kmiecik et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"amino acid sequence; article; audiovisual equipment; genome; molecular mechanics; Monte Carlo method; protein structure; chemical structure; chemistry; computer program; computer simulation; protein secondary structure; protein tertiary structure; time; protein; Computer Simulation; Models, Molecular; Protein Structure, Secondary; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Proteins; Software; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547620863

Considering the electric and transportation sector together, net emissions of VOC, NOx and SO2 decrease due to PHEVs. When assuming a minimum detection limit of 0.25 parts per billion, modeling estimates that 61% of the population would see decreased ozone levels and 1% of the population would see increased ozone levels. Mercury emissions increase by 2.4% with increased generation needs to meet PHEV charging loads, due to use of banked allowances. Primary emissions of particulate matter (PM) increase by 10% with the use of PHEVs due primarily to the large growth in coal generation assumed in the study, but in most regions, particulate matter concentrations decrease due to significant reductions in VOC and NOx emissions from the transportation sector leading to less secondary PM. Overall, the air quality benefits from PHEVs are due to a reduction of vehicle emissions below levels required by current regulation (due to their non-emitting operation in all-electric mode), and because most electricity generation emissions are constrained by existing regulatory caps. Any additional increase in the amount of all-electric vehicle miles traveled or further emissions constraints on the electric sector would tend to magnify these benefits.","Air quality; All-electric; Electric sector; Electricity; Emissions; PHEV; Plugin hybrid","All-electric; Charging loads; Coal generation; Current regulations; Detection limits; Electric power sector; Electric sector; Electricity generation; Mercury emissions; NOx emissions; Ozone levels; Particulate Matter; Parts per billion; PHEV; Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle; Plug-in hybrids; Primary emissions; Transportation sector; Vehicle emission; Vehicle-miles traveled; Diesel fuels; Electric drives; Electric generators; Electric vehicles; Electricity; Exhibitions; Fuel cells; Mercury (metal); Motor transportation; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Particulate emissions; Sulfur dioxide; Sustainable development; Air quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872023185

The maximum CO2 dilution ratio, defined as the ratio of the molar fraction of CO2 to those of air and CO2, was 0.1. The mixture was preheated up to 573 K and the maximum pressure was 1.0 MPa. Bunsen-type turbulent premixed flames of the mixtures were stabilized in a high-pressure chamber. OH-PLIF visualizations of the flames were performed. By analyzing the OH-PLIF images, turbulent burning velocity, mean volume of turbulent flame region, and mean fuel consumption rate were calculated. Results showed that the turbulent burning velocity, ST, normalized using laminar burning velocity, SL, became smaller when the mixture was diluted with CO2. When the turbulent flame region was defined as the region between 〈c〉 = 0.1 and 〈c〉 = 0.9, the mean volume of the flame region increased in the case of CO2 dilution. Moreover, the mean fuel consumption rate in the flame region decreased with increasing CO2 dilution ratio. This effect was stronger than the decrease in mass fraction of fuel due to CO2 dilution. The decrease in the smallest wrinkling scale of the flame front with increasing turbulence Reynolds number in the case of CO2 dilution was more significant than that in the case of no CO2 dilution, corresponding well to the scale relation due to turbulence and intrinsic flame instability proposed previously. These results, as well as the previously reported effects of the profiles of the heat-release region on combustion oscillation, imply that exhaust gas recirculation for high-pressure, high-temperature turbulent premixed flames is effective for restraining combustion oscillation of premixed-type gas-turbine combustors. © 2006 The Combustion Institute.

The resulting 2005 Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution (the Strategy) sets interim objectives for improvement of human health and environment through improvement of air quality up to year 2020. Need for specific measures at the community and the international level is outlined such as vehicle emission standards, shipping and the revision of the national emission ceilings directive. In parallel activities to support more effective implementation are being prepared. The Commission has jointly with the Strategy proposed a new Directive for ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe, which is currently in the co-decision process. It includes proposal for new PM2.5 environmental standards. Experience with the implementation of the first daughter directive 1999/30/EC is reflected in proposed flexibility to address compliance with existing limit values. The ambient air assessment provisions in the new directive principally follow the existing practice. It is expected that new modelling capacity, widespread problems of exceedance of certain pollutants such as NO2 and PM10 which requires extensive preparation of abatement measures, modification of provisions on demonstration of modelling uncertainty, and not at least development of new reporting system with further appreciation of spatial nature of air quality will significantly extend the use of modelling for the assessment of air quality under EU legislation. The Commission plans to facilitate harmonized and streamlined approach through the AIRMODE action of the JRC and by developing air quality assessment services under GMES. © 2007 Harmonisation within Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling for Regulatory Purposes, HARMO.

It owns and operates two large wastewater treatment plants in Southern California. Plant 1 is located in Fountain Valley and currently treats an average 85-90 million gallons per day (MGD) of wastewater. Plant 2 is located in Huntington Beach and currently treats an average 150-160 MGD of wastewater. The digester gas produced by the anaerobic digestion of wastewater solids is burned in internal combustion engines that power generators producing the electricity to run the plants. Under California's Air Toxics ""Hot Spots"" Information and Assessment Act (AB 2588), OCSD is required to prepare and submit air toxics emissions inventory for both plants and evaluate its health impact to surrounding residents and businesses. These tasks were performed in 2004-2006 by the District's Air Quality staff and their consultants - Malcolm Pirnie, Inc. from White Plains, NY. The air toxic emissions inventory included emissions from both - wastewater treatment processes and combustion sources. These emissions data were then used to conduct a health risk assessment (HRA) and develop a Strategic plan of reduction of toxic emissions and the corresponding health risk. It was established that combustion sources (digester gas fueled and Diesel engines, boilers and flares) are the largest sources of air toxic emissions, and the pollutants emitted by these engines (Formaldehyde, Diesel particulates) are responsible for the majority of health risk. The presented paper contains detailed information on the OCSD's air toxic emissions inventory, including source testing results and development of emission factors and modeling of the cancer and non-cancer acute and chronic health risks.

The CEOP Phase 2 science framework, based on new analytical tools, is constructed for making maximum use of opportunities and for addressing CEOP guiding goals, by modifying and adding to the Phase 1 overall science objectives established in the Water and Energy Simulations and Predictions (WESP) and the CEOP Inter-Monsoons Model Study (CIMS). In addition to the monsoonal region study that CIMS is undertaking, the water and energy cycle in semi-arid and cold regions, both of which are vulnerable and sensitive to climate change and global warming, are now being targeted in the framework of WESP. To address the natural and human-induced effects on the water cycle, aerosol-water cycle interaction in the monsoonal regions will now be investigated in the framework of CIMS. It is important to aggregate from information at a reference site scale and downscale from global and regional scales to a watershed scale for making usable information. To address these issues, a watershed hydrology study, including a downscaling study, is being established in Phase 2 as a focused activity that spans WESP and CIMS and provides linkage to water resources studies. Two cross-cutting activities, namely a CEOP analysis intercomparison project, and a project for impact analysis of extreme events for increased understanding of hydroclimate processes and improving model predictability, are being introduced to address certain basic aspects and to synthesize other elements that are common to the CEOP objectives. During the first two years of CEOP Phase 2, 2005-2006, CEOP has made efforts for accomplishing data collection and science targets for the CEOP Phase 1 and has prepared for establishment of a reference basin network in addition to reference site upgrading, improvement of the CEOP data system, and preliminary studies on the additional science targets. During the following four years, 2007-2010, CEOP plans to implement its Phase 2 enhanced observation period and address the CEOP Phase 2 science targets, simultaneously. CEOP will also take steps toward the establishment of the GEOSS in situ observation network, as well as data integration and an information fusion system for the water cycle, in an experimental way. At the same time, CEOP will receive benefits from GEOSS for accomplishing its own science objectives. In this manner, the CEOP Phase 2 observation and data integration system will make the transition into an element of the GEOSS operational framework. This holistic approach will generate shared scientific targets with existing scientific projects and programs in due course. CEOP will cooperate with and support these activities by contributing the two unique functions established in Phase 1 and working jointly to exploit the opportunity these tools provide. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We do this by making a simple econometric farm income model responsive to seasonal forecasts of crop and pasture growth for the coming season. The key quantitative innovation was the use of multiple and M-quantile regression to calibrate the farm income model, using simulated crop and pasture growth from 2 agroecological models. The results of model testing demonstrated a capability to reliably forecast the direction of movement in Australian farm incomes in July at the beginning of the financial year (July-June). The structure of the model, and the seasonal climate forecasting system used, meant that its predictive accuracy was greatest across Australia's cropping regions. In a second paper, Nelson et al.

A traditional design of experiments approach becomes very time consuming and costly if one wants to address DPF design, system integration, regeneration control strategy optimization and ash ageing assessment, due to the very large number of tests needed. The application of simulation tools provides a promising alternative and hence simulation is increasingly being used for the design of exhaust emission control systems. In a DPF many coupled physico-chemical phenomena occur over widely disparate spatial and temporal scales and the simulation approach should account for and exploit these features. This becomes possible with the introduction of certain defensible assumptions and/or simplifications to arrive at an accurate but computationally tractable DPF simulation approach, for the needs of industrial users. The present chapter summarizes the current state of the science and technology of DPF simulation, from the Aerosol & Particle Technology Laboratory (APTL), addressing consistent and rigorous refinements in a number of areas including: the aerodynamics at the filter and channel inlet, flow, filtration and reaction phenomena at the DPF material microstructure scale, and in coupling/interfacing DPF simulation with three-dimensional (3D) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes.

Most mathematical models, used by industry for screw compressor performance estimation and optimisation, are based on quasi one dimensional calculation of the governing flow equations in a control volume. Despite being fast and accurate for general compressor performance calculations, these do not take full account of flow losses induced in the compressor inlet and outlet ports although the effects of these are significant. Three dimensional fluid flow calculations take account of these phenomena but require significant time and effort to be performed due to the complex geometry handling procedures and large numerical meshes required. An alternative approach is to combine both methods in a single integrated procedure. This paper describes how a three dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics model of flow in the compressor ports has been integrated with a one dimensional mathematical model of flow in the working chamber through a common integral management system. By this means, solutions may be obtained faster than with a full 3D approach with results that are more accurate than from a 1D model. The transmission of the boundary conditions from one region to the other has been established through the user coding of a CFD system. The methods described are of considerable scope and can be applied, not only to screw compressors but also to any other type of twin rotor rotational machine with parallel axes, such as gear pumps, vacuum pumps and roots blowers. A comparison of measured and predicted pressure oscillations in the discharge port of an industrial oil injected compressor is given as an example of the use of this procedure. © IMechE 2007.",,"Boundary value problems; Calculations; Compressors; Computational fluid dynamics; Dynamics; Fluid dynamics; Functions; Modal analysis; Oil well production; One dimensional; Ports and harbors; Programming theory; Pumps; Three dimensional; 1d models; Alternative approaches; Analytical procedures; Complex geometries; Compressor inlets; Compressor performances; Control volumes; Discharge ports; Flow equations; Flow losses; Industrial oils; Integrated models; Management systems; Manufacturing costs; Noise emissions; Numerical meshes; Optimisation; Outlet ports; Parallel axes; Performance calculations; Pressure oscillations; Roots blowers; Screw compressors; Screw machines; Three dimensional fluid flows; Twin rotors; Working chambers; Mathematical models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149377154

In spite of this, there is hardly any geothermal energy facility in this country, and those few are operated on a less environmentally sound basis not injecting the 100% of the produced water back. No geothermal power plant facility exist in this country, moreover such technology can not be found in the entire Central Eastern European region. MOL is an integrated oil and gas group in Central and Eastern Europe and one of the largest company in the region in terms of sales revenues. MOL Group is committed to contributing to sustainable development: supporting research, innovation and environmental protection, promoting best practices and complying with regulations. In November of 2003 MOL decided to set up a team to develop a Geothermal Pilot Project to explore power plant opportunities offered by geothermal resources in Hungary. This team analysed potential geographical locations where the volume and heat of extracted water would be adequate for a geothermal power plant. The Pilot Project has been set up with investor partners. In March of 2006 MOL, Enex of Iceland and Vulcan Kft. (its owner is Green Rock of Australia) established a consortium in which MOL is the operator. According to MOL's present concept it is possible until 2012 to establish 3-4 geothermal power plants with 2-5 MW capacity. As a result, 10-15 MW power plant capacity and 100 GWh/year electric energy can be generated from geothermal energy. With such results further development is also possible in the years beginning in 2012. This concept meets with the National Renewable Energy Concept that is under preparation. The technical concept includes utilization of existing hydrocarbon wells in the South-Western part of Hungary for producing and reinjecting thermal water. The distribution of the existing 8000 hydrocarbon wells of Hungary is presented in Figure 1. However, the exact flow rate is yet unknown because the exploration drilling focused on hydrocarbons initially, therefore now thermal water production and reinjection tests are necessary. The potential wells are 2000-3300 m deep and the water temperature is expected to be above 125°C at wellheads. The Pilot Project well completions started in December 2006, well tests were performed early 2007. The location of the tests was in the South-Westem part of Hungary, near Iklódbördöce village. During the exploration two currently out-of-order hydrocarbon wells were converted into thermal water production or reinjection wells. One of the well-heads is presented in Figure 2. From the wells thermal water was extracted into 2000 m 3 pits near the wells. The construction of a pit is shown in Figure 3, the test production in Figure 4. Then the produced thermal water was reinjected back to its own aquifer through the same well. With this testing protocol, we obtained the data necessary for the construction and operation of the proposed geothermal power plant in terms of both the wells and the aquifers. From the data obtained the size and type of the technology to be installed on the geothermal energy can be determined. Based on the currently available data the output of the first geothermal power generating facility has to be above 1.5 MW in order to be profitable. Utilizing abandoned hydrocarbon wells, establishing an international consortium for thermal water exploration, the unusual depth, the fairly high temperature (in the European continent), the focus on power plant establishment highlight a new approach in Hungarian geothermal exploration. The MOL-Enex-GreenRock pilot project started a new segment in the Hungarian geothermal exploration history. The main characteristics of this new segment are: - deeper wells (2-4 km) - higher temperature(120-170 °C) - reinjection 100% of the produced thermal water into its own reservoir. Besides the technical activity the Project has some financial curiosities as well. Geothermal projects are not competitive with hydrocarbon projects, therefore all possible sorts of financial support and subsidy are inevitable. Return may be ensured by the weighted average takeover price of 24.76 HUF/kWh (13.4 UScents/kWh) applicable for electricity generated by the use of renewable energy resources and to a small extent the sales of the so-called residual heat discharged by the power plant to direct consumption customers. Obligatory takeover price for electricity produced from renewable energy is regulated by the provisions of the Hungarian Electricity Act, as it is shown in Figure 5. High productivity makes geothermal projects competitive among the renewable energies. Operating time is over 7000 hours/year. It means HUF180-200 million income per year. According to the calculations, breakeven point of a power plant project is 1.6 MWe plant capacity + 2 MWt thermal heat sales without any external support. The costs of the exploration phase (about 5 million USD) is necessary to confirm that the power plant is feasible at all (in case of successful exploration this amount is absorbed by the project). This is the main risk factor of the project. Key question in financial concept is the handling of this geological risk by financial method (Exploration Risk Guarantee). These are the reasons why the geothermal power plant project is exposed to high level of risk. In order to mitigate this risk an Exploration Grant Agreement has been signed with Worldbank-Global Environment Facilities. In case of the exploration fails because of low thermal water flow rate, Worldbank refunds a significant rate of the financial loss. The MOL-Enex-GreenRock Pilot Project finished its well completion and testing activity. Evaluation of the data is going on now. The Operator collected all measured information and provided the documents for the international consultant team that contracted to prepare the Feasibility Study. Based on the Feasibility Study partners will make decisions not only on the Pilot Project, but also on a middle-term program. Independently from the final result of the Pilot Project a Middle-term Geothermal Program is under planning with several projects that aims small-scale power plants as well as direct-heat technologies. This program can be a stable basis of the development of Hungarian geothermal energy industry.","Geothermal exploration; Hydrocarbon wells; Pilot Project; Power plant; Reinjection","Geothermal exploration; Hydrocarbon wells; Pilot Project; Power plant; Reinjection; Aquifers; Decision making; Electric generators; Energy policy; Energy resources; Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Extraction; Finance; Flow rate; Geothermal fields; Geothermal heating; Geothermal power plants; Geothermal prospecting; Geothermal wells; Heat pump systems; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogeology; Location; Losses; Natural gas well production; Oil wells; Organic compounds; Petroleum engineering; Planning; Power plants; Pumps; Renewable energy resources; Reservoirs (water); Resource allocation; Sales; Small power plants; Strategic planning; Sustainable development; Testing; Water resources; Well completion; Well testing; Wellheads; Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58449108588

Trailer refrigeration units (TRUs) are refrigeration systems typically powered by a separate diesel engine, and they are used to deliver fresh and frozen food products. The products can be very sensitive to temperature variation and maintaining the proper environment is very important. The diesel engines currently used to power the refrigeration system can contribute to high amount of local emissions at the loading warehouse. A promising future alternative is the use of fuel cell auxiliary power units (APUs). In this paper we have developed a MATLAB/Simulink based modeling of TRUs, and we have used the model to quantify the benefits of alternative power systems. The simulation model consists of an unsteady thermal modeling of TRUs that is coupled to the APU. For the diesel engine a fuel and emissions map is incorporated into the model. From our simulations it was observed that the duty cycle, energy consumption, and emissions are highly influenced by the ambient operating temperatures. Some of the most interesting results were observed when the ambient air temperature was very high. The second part of the simulation model consisted of fuel cell hybrid APU, which was also coupled to the TRU thermal model. From our simulations over typical duty cycles it was observed that the fuel cell hybrid system's energy efficiency was greater than the diesel engine; also, they have a great potential to reduce local emissions and noise which, is a great concern for TRUs. The fuel cell hybrid system performance was found to be dependent on component size and control strategy, and we have made a study of the important parameters, such as state of battery charge, fuel cell size, and storage capacity. A fuel cell system enables a new paradigm in TRU design, since an electrical powered system allows for the use of variable rpm electrical drives such as dc motors and scroll compressors. The introduction of these more efficient and flexible systems will allow for better temperature and refrigeration control in future systems.

Ethanol-diesel emulsion technique is used for the utilization of ethanol in diesel engines wherein ethanol is used without any modification. The performance, combustion and emission characteristics of a direct injection (DI) diesel engine for off-highway application were evaluated using ethanol-diesel microemulsions. The addition of ethanol to diesel fuel simultaneously decreases calorific value, kinematic viscosity and stability of fuel. Ethyl acetate was used as an additive/ingredient to keep the blends in homogeneous and stable state. Blends (D80/E13/EA07; D70/E17/EA13; D60/E23/EA17) were selected for engine experiments based on stability behavior and fuel properties. The results showed no significant power reduction in the engine operation with ethanol-diesel microemulsions. Although, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increased, improvement was observed in the brake specific energy consumption (BSEC). The thermal efficiency also improved significantly at lower loads. NOx and smoke emissions were reduced by 5-10% and 15-50%, respectively. UBHC and CO deteriorated especially at lower loads but improved at higher loads. From the combustion analysis, it was observed that the use of ethanol blended diesel fuel prolonged the ignition delay along with shortening of total combustion duration. Studies conducted at different injection pressures (200, 250, 300 and 350 bar) on different loading conditions showed that the higher injection pressure reduces CO and smoke emissions with respect to diesel fuel.

In fields such as mountain climatology, plant ecology and environmental studies, the estimation of the thermic action of the relief and the calculation of the radiative budget of the surfaces constitute an important prerequisite for any modelling work. GIS-based solar radiation models allow us to take into account, on a fine scale, the complexity of the interactions between the incident solar radiation (direct as well as diffuse) and the local topography. Such models provide rapid, costefficient and accurate estimations of radiation over large areas, while considering slope and aspect gradients, and shadowing effects. While GIS-based models predict the potential direct (and in some cases diffuse) radiation and are able to predict quite accurately the relative spatial variation, for a number of applications the actual and not the potential solar radiation is needed. This paper discusses the correlation between the modelled radiation and the actual recorded data and presents regression equations that can be used to convert modelled radiation for use in other environmental models that utilize field recorded solar radiation data. The impacts of different climatic conditions as well as seasons on the regression equations are discussed. Analysis of daily meteorological records spanning eight years for a number of stations around Australia show that the correlations are quite high (r 2 = 0.95) when the data is pooled and higher still (r 2 = 0.98) when seasonal effects are taken into consideration.","Direct radiation; Shortwave; Solar radiation modelling","Accurate estimation; Australia; Climatic conditions; Cost-efficient; Direct radiations; Earth's surface; Environmental model; Environmental studies; In-field; Local topography; Meteorological records; Plant ecology; Regression equation; Seasonal effects; Shadowing effects; Shortwave; Solar radiation data; Solar radiation model; Spatial variations; Climatology; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Solar radiation; Sun; Radiation effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865628695

The stimulus sensed is tissue PO2 and this can be estimated to be around 50 mmHg during arterial normoxia, falling to between 10-40 mmHg during hypoxia. The chemoafferent hypoxia stimulus-response curve is exponential, rising in discharge frequency with falling PO2, and with no absolute threshold apparent in hyperoxia. Although the oxygen sensor has not been definitely identified, it is believed to reside within type I cells of the carotid body, and presently two major hypotheses have been put forward to account for the sensing mechanism. The first relies upon alterations in the cell energy status that is sensed by the cytosolic enzyme AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) subsequent to hypoxia-induced increases in the cellular AMP/ATP ratio during hypoxia. AMPK is localized close to the plasma membrane and its activation can inhibit both large conductance, calcium-activated potassium (BK) and background, TASK-like potassium channels, inducing membrane depolarization, voltage-gated calcium entry and neurosecretion of a range of transmitter and modulator substances, including catecholamines, ATP and acetylcholine. The alternative hypothesis considers a role for haemoxygenase-2, which uses oxygen as a substrate and may act to gate an associated BK channel through the action of its products, carbon monoxide and possibly haem. It is likely however, that these and other hypotheses of oxygen transduction are not mutually exclusive and that each plays a role, via its own particular sensitivity, in shaping the full response of this organ between hyperoxia and anoxia. © 2007 Biochemical Society.",,"calcium; oxygen; potassium channel; animal; anoxia; audiovisual equipment; biological model; carotid body; histology; human; metabolism; nerve cell; oxygen consumption; pathology; physiology; pressure; review; theoretical model; Animals; Anoxia; Calcium; Carotid Body; Humans; Models, Anatomic; Models, Biological; Models, Theoretical; Neurons; Oxygen; Oxygen Consumption; Potassium Channels; Pressure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35248848916

Many mega cities in India such as Mumbai, Kolkata and Delhi have been considered industrial cities as well. Industries were considered as the main source of air pollution in all these cities from very beginning. Air pollution control needs were felt in these cities when way back in 1905, Bengal Smoke Nuisance Act was enacted. However, when situation became very grim, particularly in Mumbai, it was felt to stipulate rules for air pollution control. This paper presents the journey of about 25 years of Air Pollution Control and Prevention Act (1981) implementation, which included various actions and policy interventions leading to changes in air pollution scenario of Mumbai. This work was completed under a joint initiative of MPCB, NEERI and USEPA. Air pollution control issues in Mumbai started way back in 70's when its industrial area Chembur was called gas chamber. This area housed large industrial units such as fertilizer industry, three refineries and a power plant. Even before the Air Act of 1981, the air quality monitoring was initiated in Mumbai due to its very poor air quality and large scale concern about health impacts. Years of monitoring linked with health study made the authorities to implement various schemes for industrial emission control through technological changes, fuel shift as well as end-of-the pipe treatment leading to drastic reduction of pollution in this area. In the period of 1978-1987, air pollution levels were growing, however, in the latter part of 90's air quality has shown improvement, which could be attributed to various measures undertaken locally as well as nationally. Some of the important ones have been about the sulphur level reductions in all fuel types, introduction of natural gas in industries as well as transport sectors, age restriction of vehicles and tightening of vehicle emission standards. Owing to the commitment MPCB made subsequent to the BAQ 2004 (Better Air Quality Conference in Manila) as a national commitment, it has undertaken large scale attempts to bring up the policy interventions which have worked and given benefit of better air quality and health. Based on the study, it has also undertaken large-scale epidemiological study to develop long-term trends for air quality and health linkages. This would also facilitate the policy adoption for health care intervention.","Air quality; Fuel quality; Health valuation; India; Policy intervention","Air pollution; Air quality; Cost effectiveness; Crashworthiness; Emission control; Felt; Fuels; Industrial emissions; Natural gas vehicles; Pollution; Pollution control; Pollution induced corrosion; Smoke abatement; Waste management; Air quality monitoring; Epidemiological studies; Fuel quality; Health valuations; India; Policy intervention; Pollution control and prevention; Reduction of pollutions; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649158355

The decrease is projected to continue as newer vehicles penetrate the fleet. This is expected to happen although at the same time the traffic amounts increase. Traffic causes particle emissions also from other sources than exhaust. Such non-exhaust sources are brake wear, tire wear, and road abrasion. Additionally material deposited or relocated to the road surface can become suspended through traffic induced turbulence and tire shear. Studies indicate that currently there are no efficient abatement for non-exhaust particles. This paper presents the first results of a new calculation procedure for non-exhaust particle emissions from on-road traffic for the Finnish national integrated assessment model FRES (Finnish Regional Emission Scenario Model). Analysis of the suspension emissions shows that the use of emission factors that have been estimated for dry road conditions can lead to significant overestimations for total emissions. This analysis strongly indicates that a reducing factor due to moisture should be included in the emission calculations. This study has important implications to emission abatement policies.

The investors in the project can, in return, claim credits for the reduction in carbon (C) emissions and carbon sequestration. The purpose of this case study was to investigate the potential for carbon sequestration from such projects. The study covers afforestation with Scots pine on unforested land (burnt areas, cleared spaces, gaps, etc.) in the Povolgie region of Russia. Three scenarios were compared: (1) no afforestation (baseline scenario); (2) afforestation with pine, and carbon sequestration only considering above-ground tree biomass; (3) afforestation with pine, but accounting for carbon sequestration in all pools. On average, carbon sequestration in the above-ground tree biomass could be around 80 t C ha-1 during 50 years of pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) plantation growth with 54 t C ha-1 in equilibrium storage. A considerable amount of carbon will be bound in the lower layer of the pine forest stand (24 t C ha-1), which is usually underestimated in afforestation Joint Implementation projects, and wood-based products (35 t C ha-1). Sequestered carbon in equilibrium storage is allocated in the following proportions: 46% in pine stands, 21% in the lower level and 33% in wood-based products. To extend the carbon sequestration, harvested wood should be used to manufacture products for long-term use. The results indicate good potential for such projects in the investigated territory in a long-term perspective, in compliance with international costs for sequestered carbon. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.","Boreal forest; Climate change; Joint Implementation; Kyoto Protocol; Russian forests","Climate change; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Project management; Carbon sequestration; Joint Implementation; Forestry; Forestation; Forests; Greenhouse Gases; Pinus; Pinus sylvestris",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37149012644

Regardless of whether a person owns a car or not, they have an opinion as to who the worst polluters are and whether the situation is improving. Two of the most common beliefs voiced by motorists and policy makers alike are that: Vehicle emissions are inversely proportional to driver income ""Business as usual"" vehicle technology trends by themselves will solve everything But are these urban facts or fictions? This paper discusses the role that real world vehicle emission data can play to help answer these questions. Remote sensing was undertaken in Auckland, NZ in 2003 and 2005 to measure exhaust emissions of over 90,000 vehicles in ""real world"" situations. For each vehicle in the 2005 dataset, the owner's address was assigned a social deprivation index (SDI), based on census data, enabling a match between socio-economic and vehicle emissions. This database was used to indicate the potential implications, particularly for low income households, of policies which target high emitting vehicles. The results of this analysis show that vehicle emissions tend to be inversely proportional to owner income. Between 2003 and 2005, few new vehicle emissions management policies were introduced in NZ thereby enabling the opportunity to test the fleet emissions impacts of ""business as usual"" (BAU) technology trends alone. The 2005 data were compared to the 2003 data to quantify any observable reductions and establish which variables were most likely to be responsible. The results of this analysis show that BAU vehicle technology trends are, with the possible exception of NO, reducing vehicle emissions. However, it is not established, is whether the improvements are sufficient to overcome the increase in vehicle numbers and vehicle kilometres travelled.","Drive by testing; Exhaust measurements; Remote sensing device; Social implications; Vehicle emissions","Exhaust measurements; Remote sensing device; Social implications; Vehicle emissions; Air quality; Data structures; Environmental protection; Exhaust gases; Gas emissions; Ground vehicles; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053171489

The investigation site was situated in the centre of the Lena River Delta in Northern Siberia (72°22′ N, 126°30′ E). The study region is characterized by a polar and distinctly continental climate, very cold and ice-rich permafrost and its position at the interface between the Eurasian continent and the Arctic Ocean. The soils at the site are characterized by high organic matter content, low nutrient availability and pronounced water logging. The vegetation is dominated by sedges and mosses. The micrometeorological campaigns were performed during the periods July-October 2003 and May-July 2004 which included the period of snow and soil thaw as well as the beginning of soil refreeze. The main CO2 exchange processes, the gross photosynthesis and the ecosystem respiration, were found to be of a generally low intensity. The gross photosynthesis accumulated to -432 g m-2 over the photosynthetically active period (June-September). The contribution of mosses to the gross photosynthesis was estimated to be about 40%. The diurnal trend of the gross photosynthesis was mainly controlled by the incoming photosynthetically active radiation. During midday, the photosynthetic apparatus of the canopy was frequently near saturation and represented the limiting factor on gross photosynthesis. The synoptic weather conditions strongly affected the exchange fluxes of CO2 by changes in cloudiness, precipitation and pronounced changes of air temperature. The ecosystem respiration accumulated to +327 g m-2 over the photosynthetically active period, which corresponds to 76% of the CO2 uptake by photosynthesis. However, the ecosystem respiration continued at substantial rates during autumn when photosynthesis had ceased and the soils were still largely unfrozen. The temporal variability of the ecosystem respiration during summer was best explained by an exponential function with surface temperature, and not soil temperature, as the independent variable. This was explained by the major role of the plant respiration within the CO2 balance of the tundra ecosystem. The wet polygonal tundra of the Lena River Delta was observed to be a substantial CO2 sink with an accumulated net ecosystem CO2 exchange of -119 g m-2 over the summer and an estimated annual net ecosystem CO2 exchange of -71 g m-2.",,"air-sea interaction; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; eddy covariance; gas exchange; micrometeorology; moss; nutrient availability; organic matter; permafrost; photosynthesis; sedge; tundra; Arctic Ocean; Eurasia; Lena Delta; Russian Federation; Sakha; Siberia; Bryophyta; Carex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35349003671

Engine control strategies appear to be a powerful solution to address this issue. The problem is particularly complex since acceptable drivability must be maintained whilst at the same time reducing in-cylinder pollutant emissions and ensuring optimum conditions to attain high conversion efficiencies via exhaust gas after-treatment systems. The development of appropriate control strategies can only be achieved with an in-depth understanding of the engine behaviour, using experimental results and system numerical simulations. In this context, predictive combustion and pollutant emissions models, which are calibrated with experimental data, are particularly useful as they allow a wide range of parametric variations to be studied. This paper presents the development of a Diesel combustion model based on a Barba's approach [1]. This model can be applied to multi-injection, defining a pre-mixed combustion zone for the pilot injection and a diffusion combustion mode for the main injection. To assess the in-cylinder pollutant emissions, a mixing model based on the turbulent kinetic energy generated by the spray, is added to define a burnt gas zone in which post-flame chemistry including CO, NOx and soot formation can be computed. This model is first validated using CHEMKIN and 3D CFD results. Then, using experimental results, a 4 cylinders D.I. Diesel engine is calibrated on steady state engine operating conditions and coupled to an engine control to predict the evolution of pollutant emissions under transient conditions.

To help maintain an adequate speed of reaction compatible with life, these reactions are enhanced by carbonic anhydrase (CA) present in the chemoreceptor cells. The role of chemoreceptors in H+ homeostasis is the focus of this chapter. The peripheral chemoreceptors very readily sense CO2/H+ and stimulate ventilation in order to enhance CO2 exhalation. Central chemoreceptors are stimulated similarly but slowly, also resulting in increased ventilation. Altogether, this phase, assisted by respiration alone, can be defined as the acute response. However, the H+ left behind is excreted by the renal system, rather slowly (chronic phase) without any direct intervention by the chemoreceptors. Thus, respiratory and renal systems are integrated in the long run to maintain CO 2/H+ homeostasis. A consensus model of CO 2/H+ stimulatory response is as follows: CO 2/H+ stimulus → Cellular K+ current suppression → Cell depolarization → Voltage-dependent Ca2+ gate opens → Ca2+ influx andstore-operated Ca2+ release → [Ca2+] i rise → Neurotransmission → Instantaneous chemosensory discharge (acute effects like hypoxia). At the same time, ATP comes into play as a neurotransmitter, but experimental data suggest a complex mechanism of interactions. Spyer et al. (2004) proposed ATP as the key neurotransmitter, but that the CO2 response is not affected by PPADS (ATP antagonist) in in vitro preparation. Additionally, recent data from P2X2 knockout mice showed a normal response to CO2, suggesting that purinergic mechanisms are not involved in central chemoreception. However, this leaves out a role of CO2/H + sensing in the peripheral chemoreceptors. Turning to constancy of [H+] in the fluid matrix of the body at the body temperature, it remains a fundamental condition of life, a legacy of Claude Bernard. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

Here I present measurements and modelling of CX X-ray emission around comets, planets, and within the heliosphere (the cavity carved by the solar wind in the interstellar medium). This latter omni-directionnel emission is due to the interaction between solar wind ions and the flow of interstellar neutrals. It has now been found to be responsible for a large fraction of (if not all) the emission previously attributed to the Local Interstellar Hot Bubble (a 100 parsecs cavity around the Sun supposed to be filled with one million K gas).

However, due to computer limitations, it is very difficult to completely couple the fluid mechanics solver with the full combustion chemistry. Therefore, simplified chemistry models are required, and the topic of this research was to provide reduced chemistry models for CH4/O 2 gas turbine flow fields to be integrated into CFD codes for the simulation of flow fields of natural gas-fueled burners. The reduction procedure for the CH4/O2 model utilized a response modeling technique wherein the full mechanism was solved over a range of temperatures, pressures, and mixture ratios to establish the response of a particular variable such as chemical reaction time. The conditions covered were between 1000 and 2500K for temperature, 0.1 and 2 for equivalence ratio, and 0.1 and 50 for pressure. The kinetic times include the time to ignition, the time to equilibrium H2O formation, the time to equilibrium CO formation, and the time to equilibrium NO formation. The kinetic time models are given in Arrhenius type formulas as functions of equivalence ratio, temperature, and pressure; or fuel-to-air ratio, temperature and pressure. A single, global kinetics model was obtained for the entire range of conditions, and separate models for the low-temperature and high-temperature regions as well as for fuel-lean and rich cases were also derived. Predictions using the reduced model were verified using results from the full mechanism and empirical correlations from experiments. The models are intended for (but not limited to) use in CFD codes for flow field simulations of gas turbine combustors in which initial conditions and degree of mixedness of the fuel and air are key factors in achieving stable and robust combustion processes and acceptable emissions levels. The new model was applied to CFD simulations of a typical gas turbine burner with premixer with good results.",,"Combustion; Computer simulation; Fluid mechanics; Gas turbines; Mathematical models; Arrhenius type formulas; Combustion chemistry; Gas turbine engine; Kinetic times; Computational fluid dynamics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250870185

Measured concentrations across the airshed support DEQ assertions that mobile sources are a primary source of air toxics in the Portland airshed, and further, that those concentrations are fairly homogeneous. The data also shows local impacts from unique local sources that will have to be addressed in any airshed-wide emissions reduction planning process. Before DEQ begins the public planning process considerably more data analysis will be needed to clarify sources contributions. Dispersion modeling of 2005 emissions, with exposure modeling, risk characterization, and source contribution estimates will be integral parts of the technical analysis provided to the local advisory committee in Portland. Comparisons of the 2005 measured values to modeling estimates will determine whether models achieve credibility with the public and can be relied upon for strategy development, or must be further improved. Ultimately the concentrations measured in this study will be used as a baseline to track measured concentrations as emissions reduction efforts are implemented.

Usually, this mixture is expressed in particular by a combination of intake manifold pressure, measured locally, and fresh air flow measured at a substantial distance from the combustion chamber. As the amount of exhaust recirculation is subject to many disturbances and uncertainties, standard control approaches are not satysfying, especially during transients, and the emission targets are met essentially by reducing the dynamics of fuel injection by so called smoke maps. In this paper, we discuss the possibility to design an oxygen charge control which estimates the available oxygen amount in the intake manifold - after the mixture of fresh and recirculated exhaust gas - using an oxygen sensor. To reduce the effect of modeling errors or of bandwidth limitations, the comparison with the standard choice of variables is performed using data based multilinear models and an explicit MPC to compute the control signals.

DOE envisions increased use of gasification in the United States during the next 20 years. As such, the DOE Gasification Technologies Program, including the FutureGen initiative, will strive to approach a near-zero emissions goal, with respect to multiple pollutants, such as sulfur, mercury, and nitrogen oxides. Since nearly one-third of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are produced by coal-powered generation facilities, conventional coal-burning power plants, and advanced power generation plants, such as IGCC, present opportunities in which carbon can be removed and then permanently stored. Gas cleaning systems for IGCC power generation facilities have been effectively demonstrated and used in commercial operations for many years. These systems can reduce sulfur, mercury, and other contaminants in synthesis gas produced by gasifiers to the lowest level achievable in coal-based energy systems. Currently, DOE Fossil Energy's goals set for 2010 direct completion of R&D for advanced gasification combined cycle technology to produce electricity from coal at 45-50% plant efficiency. By 2012, completion of R&D to integrate this technology with carbon dioxide separation, capture, and sequestration into a zero-emissions configuration is targeted with a goal to provide electricity with less than a 10% increase in cost of electricity. By 2020, goals are set to develop zero- emissions plants that are fuel-flexible and capable of multiproduct output and thermal efficiencies of over 60% with coal. These objectives dictate that it is essential to not only reduce contaminant emissions into the generated synthesis gas, but also to increase the process or system operating temperature to that of humid gas cleaning criteria conditions (150 to 370 °C), thus reducing the energy penalties that currently exist as a result of lowering process temperatures (-40 to 38 °C) with subsequent reheat to the required higher temperatures. From a historical perspective, the evolution of advanced syngas cleaning systems applied in IGCC and chemical and fuel synthesis plants has followed a path of configuring a series of individual cleaning steps, one for each syngas contaminant, each step controlled to its individual temperature and sorbent and catalyst needs. As the number of syngas contaminants of interest has increased (particulates, hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl sulfide, halides such as hydrogen chloride, ammonia, hydrogen cyanide, alkali metals, metal carbonyls, mercury, arsenic, selenium, and cadmium) and the degree of syngas cleaning has become more severe, the potential feasibility of advanced humid gas cleaning has diminished. A focus on multicontaminant syngas cleaning is needed to enhance the potential cost savings, and performance of humid gas cleaning will focus on multi-contaminant syngas cleaning. Groups of several syngas contaminants to be removed simultaneously need to be considered, resulting in significant gas cleaning system intensification. Intensified, multi-contaminant cleaning processes need to be devised and their potential performance characteristics understood through small-scale testing, conceptual design evaluation, and scale-up assessment with integration into the power generation system. Results of a 1-year study undertaken by DOE/NETL are presented to define improved power plant configurations and technology for advanced multi-contaminant cleanup options.

However, since the flame temperature becomes too high, NOx formation in the furnace seriously increases. In this case reburning and selective non-catalytic reaction (SNCR) are useful technologies in reducing nitric oxide. In the reburning process, nitric oxide is diminished through injection of a secondary hydrocarbon fuel. Also, SNCR reduce the nitric oxide through injection of one or more chemical agents such as ammonia and urea solution. In this paper, an experimental study has been conducted to evaluate the hybrid effects of reburning and selective non-catalytic reaction on NOx reduction and also to examine heat transfer characteristics from various oxygen-enriched LPG flame. Experiments were performed in flames stabilized by a co-flow swirl burner, which was mounted at the bottom of the furnace. Tests were conducted using LPG gas as main fuel and also as reburning fuel. The effects of reburning fuel fraction, SNCR agent fraction and injecting location of SNCR agent were studied. The effect of oxygen enrichment ratio was also tested. The paper reported data on flue gas emissions, temperature distribution in furnace and various heat fluxes at the wall for a wide range of experimental conditions. In a steady state, the total as well as radiative heat flux from the flame to the wall of furnace has been measured using a heat flux meter. Temperature distribution and emission formation in furnace have also been measured and compared. NOx generation was observed to increase as increasing oxygen enrichment ratio, but due to its hybrid effects of reburning and SNCR, NOx concentration in the downstream has considerably decreased.","Hybrid reburning; NOx; Reburn; SNCR","Catalysis; Combustion; Fuels; Furnaces; Gas emissions; Heat transfer; Nitric oxide; Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; Selective catalytic reduction; Temperature distribution; Urea; Experimental conditions; Heat transfer characteristics; Non-catalytic reactions; NOx; Oxygen-enriched combustion; Reburn; Reburning; SNCR; Heat flux",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908491310

In particular, it is important to assure uniform spatial distribution of the PAC particles in the flow. Light extinction is a technique that have been used to measure soot volume fraction in postflame region of fuel/air premixed flames. Turbidity measurements involving light scattering have been used in many applications, mainly water clarity measurements. In this investigation, an optically accessible acoustic chamber is used to induce acoustic streaming phenomena, which creates suspensions of PAC particles. A photodiode measures the attenuation along the line-of-sight of a He-Ne laser beam directed through the suspension.

Operations resulted in a significant decline in TCE concentrations during the first year (from -500 μ/L to -100 μg/L). However, TCE concentrations changed little over the following two years of operation. Therefore, a two-year rebound study was undertaken in the spring of 2005 with the objective of assessing the contaminant concentration reduction within the pump-and-treat capture zone of the plume. TCE concentrations 16 months following shutdown suggest that TCE has reached equilibrium conditions between 150 to 250 μg/L. Therefore, enzyme probe evaluations to assess aerobic TCE cometabolism in field samples and laboratory studies evaluating the attenuation rate of TCE were conducted to determine the potential for monitored natural attenuation (MNA) to replace pump-and-treat as the medial zone remedy. Previous studies using enzyme probes demonstrated the potential for aerobic biodegradation of TCE in the distal zone (TCE concentrations between 5-1,000 μg/L) of the plume as part of the MNA assessment. These probes target the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) and toluene oxygenases, and provide direct evidence of an active enzyme in a sample. An enzyme probe analysis was performed at eight wells across the medial zone, and both the sMMO and at least one of the toluene oxygenases were detected in groundwater from all of the wells sampled. The sMMO activity was substantially higher (factor of approximately 3) in the medial zone compared to that measured in the distal zone. This may be due in part to ISB operation in the source area (TCE >20,000 μg/L), which produces high concentrations of methane, which is then transported to some parts of the medial zone. Contrary to sMMO, toluene enzyme activity, as measured by the probes, was generally lower in the medial zone compared to the distal zone. Toluene activity was variable (5% to 25% of the total cells) with the highest toluene oxygenase activity at the downgradient edge of the medial zone. In addition, laboratory studies were conducted to assess the attenuation rate of TCE and the corresponding enzyme probe response using groundwater from the site. The degradation rate of TCE was determined and normalized to enzyme activity, previously determined for natural populations in the field. Degradation rates were estimated for field populations based on contaminant concentrations and the number of microbial cells with active degradative enzymes. Contaminant half-lives were estimated. Together, these results indicate that aerobic cometabolic degradation of TCE is an active component of the biological community present in TAN groundwater in the medial zone. Evidence of positive enzyme probe analyses and estimation of a biological degradation rate will be used to determine a strategy for transition of pump and treat to MNA for the medial zone at TAN.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79551515174

HEVs show better mile per gallon (MPG) than conventional vehicles. As a new practical breakthrough to reduce air pollution and fuel consumption, particularly in urban areas, converting HEVs into plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) has been considered significant. PHEVs have a battery pack of high energy density and can run solely on electric power for a given range. The battery pack can be recharged by neighborhood outlet charger.

This second paper reports on his continuing research in the area of'Green Urbanism'1 Among the most significant environmental challenges of our time are global climate change, excessive fossil fuel dependency and the growing demand for energy-all likely to be major challenges of the 21st century and one of the greatest problems facing humanity. In this context, urban design and the fundamental principles of how to shape our cities has barely featured in the greenhouse debate. Much of the debate in related areas has so far circled around ideas about active technology for 'eco-buildings'. This is surprising, since almost half the energy consumed is used in cities and urban built-up areas, and given that avoiding mistakes in urban design at early stages could genuinely lead to more sustainable cities and less greenhouse gas emission. This article reflects upon practical strategies focused on increasing sustain-ability beyond and within the scope of individual buildings. The paper deals with cross-cutting issues in architecture and urban design and addresses the question of how we can best cohesively integrate all aspects of energy systems, transport systems, waste and water management, passive and active strategies, climatisation and so on, into contemporary urban design and improved environmental performance of our cities. It provides a context for a general debate about the regeneration of the city centre, and discusses how urbanism is affected (and can be expected to be even more affected in future) by the paradigms of ecology. The significance of the research is found in the pressing need for an integration of sustainability principles in the urban design process of cities in South East Asia and the general need for a sustainable city development. It will be of particular relevance to the rapid urban growth of developing cities that have, in the past, frequently been poorly managed. Research in sustainable urban design recommends increased harnessing of the energies manifested in the existing fabrics-for instance, through the adaptive re-use of former industrial (brownfield) sites and the upgrade and extension of existing building structures.

Conformer energies and equilibrium geometries have been calculated for neutral and cationic EB with the HF, UHF, B3LYP and the MP2 methods and different basis sets. In agreement with previous results the tail-to-chromophore orientation of neutral EB is orthogonal. This conformer is also the most stable structure in the cation, but a second local minimum in which all carbons lie in a plane (termed ""planar"" conformer) lays 325cm-1 higher in energy. R(1 + 1′)PI PE spectra were recorded by time-of-flight spectrometer with an energy resolution (ΔE) below 8 cm-1 and an absolute accuracy of ±10cm-1 for electron energies below 200 meV. Because the experiment starts in the orthogonal conformer and ionization is vertical, the recorded PE spectra show the cation ground state vibrations of this conformer. Beside benzene modes also low-energetic tail-to-chromophore modes are observed and assigned by DFT vibrational mode analysis. The differences of the calculated vibrational frequencies between the two conformers are comparable to the deviation between experiment and theory and a conformer assignment by comparison of theory and experiment would be difficult. R(1 + 1′)PI PE spectra recorded via selected S1 vibrations provide vibrational assignments for S 1, qualitative S1-D0 geometry changes, vibrational symmetries as well as internal vibrational redistribution dynamics in S1. Charge and spin densities of the neutral and cation were calculated to elucidate the problem of charge delocalization and electronic tail-to-chromophore coupling. © by Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag.","High-resolution photoelectron spectroscopy; Resonant two-photon ionization spectroscopy","Calculations; Chromophores; Ethylbenzene; Ground state; Isomers; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Photoelectrons; Photoionization; Photons; Positive ions; Quantum chemistry; Spectrometers; Ab initio and density functional calculations; Charge delocalization; Equilibrium geometries; High resolution photoelectron spectroscopy; Time-of-flight spectrometer; Two-photon ionization spectroscopy; Vibrational assignment; Vibrational symmetries; Vibration analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249028966

Simulation of present-day discharges is realistic provided that (1) the HadRM3H temperature and precipitation are corrected for biases, and (2) the potential evapotranspiration is derived from temperature only. Different methods are used to simulate discharges for the future climate: one is based on the direct model output of the future climate run (direct approach), while the other is based on perturbation of the present-day HadRM3H time series (delta approach). Both methods predict a similar response in the mean annual discharge, an increase of 30% in winter and a decrease of 40% in summer. However, predictions of extreme flows differ significantly, with increases of 10% in flows with a return period of 100 years in the direct approach and approximately 30% in the delta approach.

The existing well proven solutions might not be the most optimum ones in a world of fierce competition with other modes of transport. Wärtsilä is conducting continuous development to meet the demand for lower power demand and lower emission. In this strive, Wärtsilä has presented many novel propulsion solutions for ferries in the past years. This paper will present the latest result of this ferry propulsion development. By combining the good experience and very high propulsion efficiency of the podded CRP concept, with the advances in thruster technology and ship design, a new propulsion machinery concept has been made. The concept features a direct driven CP propeller and a contra rotating propeller behind it mounted on a pulling mechanical thruster. The machinery has been configured to keep the initial cost low by avoiding expensive electric pods and drives and by going to a simple mechanical drive of the fwd propeller with a large bore main engine. A novel machinery and cargo ramp arrangement has been developed to facilitate also very large main engines, which are too high to fit under the main deck. Both fuel consumption and thereby also exhaust emissions can be reduced by more than 10% with the new concept. In total, the new concept offers a very attractive solution economically that represents the state of the art in propulsion technology, while relying on well proven and reliable components. © 2007: The Royal Institution of Naval Architects.",,"Architectural design; Design; Drives; Electric drives; High energy physics; Ketones; Leakage (fluid); Machine design; Machinery; Mechanical drives; Propulsion; Ships; Solutions; Contra rotating propellers; Exhaust emissions; Greenhouse emissions; Initial costs; Large bores; New concepts; Power demands; Propulsion efficiencies; Propulsion machineries; Propulsion technologies; Reliable components; Ship designs; State of the arts; Ship propulsion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56149093582

The real time fuel consumption and vehicle traveling speed was measured and logged. The temperatures were measured along the exhaust pipe so as to monitor the thermal characteristics and efficiency of the catalyst. Two real world driving cycles were developed with different traffic conditions. One (WP cycle) was located in a quiet area with few traffic interference and the other one (HPL cycle) was in a busy area with more traffic variations. The test car was pre-warmed before each test to eliminate cold start effect. The driving parameters were analyzed for two real world cycles. The WP cycle had higher acceleration rate, longer acceleration mode and shorter steady speed driving mode and thus harsher than the HPL cycle. The CO, THC, NOx CO 2, benzene and other hydrocarbon emissions were higher for the WP cycle. The comparison with EU legislation shows that the CO and THC emissions from both real world cycles could meet the legislated limit but the NOx emissions from both cycle exceeded the legislated emissions when the engine was hot. The research analyzed the elements that affect urban traffic emissions and will be useful for a better traffic management to reduce emissions.

Exhaust gas and skin temperatures were also measured along the exhaust pipe of the instrumented vehicle, so the thermal characteristics and the efficiency of the catalyst could be monitored. Different turning movements (driving events) at the priority T-junction were investigated such as straight, left and right turns with and without stops. The test car was run until hot stable operating conditions were achieved before each test, thereby negating cold start effects. To demonstrate the influence of the junction and road geometry on tail-pipe emissions and fuel consumption, distance based factors were determined that compared the intersection drive-through measurements and uphill/downhill measurements with steady speed flat road runs. Fuel consumption was increased at intersections by a factor of 2∼4.1. CO, THC and NOx emission were increased by a factor of 1.8∼6.2, 2.5∼5.1 and 2.8∼7.5 respectively. Benzene emissions at intersections were also increased by a factor of 10∼20. The fuel consumption and emissions were lower and higher than flat driving for downhill and uphill driving, respectively. However, the combined uphill/downhill driving fuel consumption and emissions were notably higher than comparable flat road driving. Through fine-scale analysis of real-world driving profiles and tail-pipe emissions, this research makes a contribution to our understanding of the variability in driving parameters and emission production in urban areas. The results of this study will be useful in aiding the development of combined traffic/emission models for urban areas and developing optimal traffic management strategies to minimize emissions.

The industry consensus is that the Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) is the currently available technology for increasing propulsion system efficiency and decreasing pollutant emissions. However, HEVs operate much differently than conventional vehicles. Therefore, existing design techniques and guidelines developed for conventional powertrains do not apply well to hybrid vehicles. There is a need for training automotive technicians and engineers as well as educating students in this new and emergent technology of HEV.

However, the development of this market has been stymied by several factors, chief among them a tentative and dubious supply side. Land managers have been wary to enter the carbon market for three main reasons: high transaction and management costs, imperfect information, and a lack of institutional support. These factors have dissuaded potential suppliers from entering the market, even in the face of growing demand from governments and corporations looking to buy carbon sequestration services. As a nation with outstanding potential to capitalize on the global demand for carbon sequestration services, the Republic of Panama has much to gain from the maturation of a carbon market. In order to facilitate the growth of this market and stimulate the supply of carbon offset projects in Panama, policy mechanisms could be used by international, national, and local institutions to stimulate supply by providing financial, informational, and technical support to land managers. © 2007 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

IBr and BI3-based plasmas show no enhancement of the etch rate over pure physical sputtering under the same experimental conditions. Also, CH4/H2 -based discharges are attractive for dry etching of single crystal ZnO because of their non-corrosive nature.

The gases tested include pure CH4, N2, CO2, as well as N2 and CO2 binary mixtures. For pure gases, at the same pore pressure, permeability reduction was greatest for CO2 followed by CH4, and N2. When injecting N2 and CO2 binary mixtures, at the same pore pressure, permeability decreased with an increase of CO2 in the injected gas. When injecting N2 and CO2 mixtures, permeability was maintained by employing N2 within the mixture. The loading of coal surfaces with adsorbed gas at constant effective stress caused permeability reduction.

In this paper, we apply dynamic programming to identify optimized strategies for supplying hydrogen over time in Southern California. GIS-based traffic data are used to model the location and magnitude of hydrogen demand over time. Refueling stations arc sited based on the location of demand and the trade- off between convenience and costs. We use engineering/economic models to describe a variety of possible hydrogen supply options. Both onsite and central production technologies including biomass gasification, coal gasification, natural gas reforming, and water electrolysis are investigated. For central production routes, several delivery modes are analyzed including liquid and compressed gas trucks, and gas pipelines. These technologies compete with each other to meet an exogenously estimated hydrogen demand over time at lowest cost. At each time step over a specified transition period, the model uses a dynamic programming algorithm to select the best strategy for building up the infrastructure. We find that 1) hydrogen could be cost competitive based on region-specific spatial optimization; 2) the best buildup strategy for Southern California could be industry hydrogen in early stage, bridged by onsite natural SMR and followed by biomass central gasification and then coal gasification with carbon capture and sequestration; 3) the feasibility of CCS is critical in C02 emissions mitigation.

Some are associated with a lack of available tools to help understand the spatial and temporal dimensions of climate related problems, while others are associated with the limitations of existing structures and frameworks through which adaptation plans can be generated and delivered. The land-use planning system offers a number of options through which climate-related risks may be better managed, especially in urban areas. However, both land-use planning and the related process of urban design can just as easily adversely affect the nature and degree of impacts, effectively enhancing the impacts of climate change. The long-term nature of urbanization processes means that just like the climate system itself, the decisions that are taking place now will determine the response of the urban system in the future, making climate-conscious planning an urgent and important goal. This paper considers how a spatial risk assessment framework can help improve adaptation planning through providing relevant information to underpin the development of adaptation strategies related to land-use and spatial planning. The paper uses an example of adaptation to heat stress in a UK urban context (Greater Manchester) and shows how socio-economic as well as climate scenarios help to shape future patterns of risk. It ends with suggestions for how heat stress risk might be effectively tackled through considering existing policies which operate over conurbation as well as local scales.",,"climate change; climate effect; land use planning; risk assessment; spatial analysis; spatial planning; urban area; urban design; urban planning; urbanization; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33947240412

Particularly appealing is potential development of catalysts that could be used as direct, reforming anodes in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs). Current reforming catalysts such as Ni, however, suffer from two major problems: (i) carbon-induced deactivation and (ii) sulfur poisoning of the catalyst. We have utilized Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to study the surface chemistry of carbon atoms and carbon fragments on Ni. These studies demonstrated that there is a strong thermodynamic driving force to form sp2-bonded carbon networks. These extended carbon networks diminish the reforming activity of Ni. We have further utilized DFT to search for Ni-containing alloys that are more carbon-tolerant than monometallic Ni, i.e., that have a lower propensity to form the carbon networks. These studies have yielded a few promising alloy formulations. Subsequent steady-state reactor studies and multiple spectroscopic and microscopic studies validated the predictions of the DFT calculations.

By properly adjusting the pressure of reaction system, it is possible to suppress the occurrence of RWGS reaction and increase the selectivity of CH4/CO2 reforming. The intermediates, such as CHO and CH3 of CH4/CO2 reforming was observed by means of liquid-N2 for quenching technique and primarily confirmed a reaction step: CH3+ [O] = CHxO.

After analyzing one year data, Liu et al.1 suggest a new air quality index which includes the PM2.5 level into daily air quality warning system. In this paper, we have checked data on days with PM2.5 sub-index larger than 90 and find out that such episode can happen in either a windy or a stagnant sunny day. On windy days, high PM2.5 level occurs simultaneously with an increase of coarse-particles (particles with diameter between 2.5-10μm). Whereas, on sunny days, high PM2.5 level is associated with a higher level of ozone. Clearly, the mechanism that generates high loading of fine particles is different from one to the other. Furthermore, the analyses show that the occurring frequency of the dominant pattern varies both spatially and temporally and is clearly resulted from the synoptic air flow influence in accord with local emission and upstream inputs. In this extended abstract, we have analyzed the air quality data measured in Taiwan for a period of sixteen months when the level of PM2.5 has been monitored. Based on this dataset, we have proposed an air quality index system named as AQI-85 to include all species monitored. Further analyses on the environmental characteristics of Asian dust storms affecting days, local dust storm days and non-dust storm events indicate that the local photochemical production of secondary aerosols is crucial on affecting the general background fine particles levels, even during Asian dust storms affecting days. For both the Asian dust storms and local dust storm events, resuspected dusts from local river banks are important source for both coarse and fine particles at areas near Taitung and Tsinkan (check Fig. 1).",,"Air quality; Dust; Particles (particulate matter); Rivers; Waste management; Air quality indices; Air quality monitoring stations; Environmental characteristic; Extended abstracts; Monitoring instruments; Photochemical production; Secondary aerosols; Secondary production; Storms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933567246

The threshold field, corresponding to 10 mA cm2, was reduced 30% to ∼0.90 Vμm after attaching the particles. However, the particles deteriorated the stability of field emitters to some extent, especially in the high emission-current-density region of several A cm2. The maximum emission-current density was limited to a lower current region compared with field emitters without Ru O2. This can be explained reasonably by considering the vaporization of Ru O2 particles that frequently causes significant self-ion-sputtering during strong emission because of the large contact resistance between the particles and MWCNTs. This explanation was experimentally proved by measuring the reduction of field-enhancement factor with the elapsed-emission time. This reduction is quicker for emitters with Ru O2 than for emitters without Ru O2. Experimental data also show that the standard deviation of Fowler-Nordheim plots for field emitters can be used to judge their stability and lifetime-a value of ∼5× 10-3 suggests stable performance for our emitters. © 2007 American Vacuum Society.",,"Contact resistance; Current density; Electron emission; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Ruthenium compounds; Field emitters; Field-enhancement factor; Self-ion-sputtering; Nanoparticles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37149049922

Sponsored by the R.O.C. EPA, the present research aimed to investigate and quantify the GHG emissions from Environmental Sectors in Taiwan for the years 1990, 1994, and 2000-2004. The defined ""Environmental Sectors"" consist of landfilling, composting, waste transportation, wastewater treatment, night soil treatment, and solid waste incineration. The preliminary results were compared with that of the United States, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, and Korea. It was found that only the landfilling and the domestic wastewater treatment are the common sub-sectors that were listed both in the Waste Sector for the UNFCCC and in the Environmental Sector discussed in this study. The GHG national inventory report (NIR) of the five countries from 1997 to 2003 showed that the ratio of the Waste Sector to the total GHG emissions was around 1.67-3.29%, and was gradually declining. The GHG emissions from the Environmental Sectors were mostly estimated by following the default methodology in the IPCC Guidelines, except that of night soil treatment and waste transportation which were modified or newly developed. The GHG emissions from the Environmental Sectors in 2004 were 10,225 Kt CO2 eq. Landfilling (48.86%), solid waste incineration (27%), and wastewater treatment (21.5%) were the major contributors. Methane emission was the most significant GHG (70.6%) followed by carbon dioxide (27.8%) and nitrous oxide (1.6%). In summary, the GHG emissions estimated for the Environmental Sector in Taiwan provided reasonable preliminary results, which were comparable with the other authority data. The recommended mitigation plans include wastewater and solid waste recycling, CH4 recovering for energy, and waste reduction/classification.","Emission inventory; Greenhouse gas; Mitigation plan; Waste","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Environmental Protection Agency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Reclamation; Solid wastes; Waste management; Waste treatment; Wastes; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water recycling; Domestic waste water treatment; Emission inventories; Environmental sector; Methane emissions; Mitigation plans; National inventory report; Solid waste recycling; Waste transportation; Waste incineration",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933533136

One side effect of the ISC process is that the reactions emit significant amounts of CO2 at the production well. The potential of a hybrid ISC/CO2 flood process to minimize CO2 emission is demonstrated. It is possible to sustain the ISC process even with a low O2, high CO2 injection stream. The recycling of CO2 produced during the ISC process provides for a less carbon intensive recovery method in addition to a reduced energy requirement for compression.

Most results show that the concentration of nuclei-mode particles emitted increases with fuel sulfur content. A few studies further observed that fuel sulfur content has little effect on the emissions of heavily-used engines. It has also been found that primary dilution conditions can have a large impact on the size and number distribution of the nuclei-mode particles. These effects, however, have not yet been fully understood through transient testing, the method used by governments worldwide to certify engines and regulate emissions, and a means of experimentation which generates realistic conditions of on-road vehicles by varying the load and speed of the engine. This study investigates the effects of fuel sulfur content and primary dilution on the size distributions and number concentrations of particles emitted from a heavily-used diesel engine under both steady state and transient operations. The primary dilution was accomplished by a CFV-CVS, a system which maintains proportional sampling throughout temperature excursions and is designed for engine emission certification. The steady state results show reasonable agreement with previous studies, while the transient results show a large reduction of nuclei-mode particles with the use of ULSD compared to LSD during testing with the higher primary dilution.

These results suggest that a systematic underestimation of night time respiratory effluxes may be responsible for the high Amazonian carbon sink suggested by several previous eddy covariance studies. Large CO 2 fluxes from riverine sources or high respiratory losses from recently disturbed forests do not need to be invoked in order to balance the carbon budget of the Amazon.

The purpose of the present paper is to evaluate corrosion rates in metals used in electronic devices as a function of temperature, humidity and the concentrations of some air pollutants in order to predict the optimal conditions preventing or minimizing corrosion. Design/methodology/ approach - Atmospheric pollutants mainly sulphur oxides, penetrating through small crevices and holes into electronic plants in combination with climatic factors such as humidity and heat, promote corrosion. The corrosion rate of the five most used metals in the electronics industry: carbon steel, copper, nickel, silver, and tin, were studied gravimetrically as a function of variations in humidity, temperature and air pollutant concentrations from 2003 to 2005. The samples were exposed in an instrumented boot to indoor conditions and gravimetric measurements were performed together with measurements of the above-mentioned parameters. Mathematical simulation applying Math Lab software was carried out as well. The ternary diagrams for pollutants, temperature and relative humidity were applied as a useful tool to correlate these parameters in indoor conditions with the corrosion rate of metals applied in the electronics industry. Findings - The obtained results have shown that the presence of even small concentrations of air pollutants promoted corrosion processes when time of wetness conditions were reached. Practical implications - The study was carried out in order to minimize the corrosion losses of the electronic plants situated especially in Mexicali City located on a semi-desert zone in the Northwest of Mexico. Originality/value - This paper establishes the relationship of variations of pollutants concentration, temperature and the relative humidity with the corrosion rate of metals in indoor conditions in the electronics industry located in the semi-arid zone of Mexicali.

Acoustical measurements were taken and analyzed to determine the probable cause of the severe vibrations. It was determined that the best solution, considering time and cost, was to install two new thermal oxidizers. A request was also made to size the new TO's for increased plant capacity. Due to the required short turnaround time, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to assess the mixing and performance of the new TO design. The mixing performance was critical for combustion stability and VOC and CO destruction. A ""detailed kinetic reaction mechanism"" analysis was also performed to determine the emission levels of CO and NOx leaving the TO. This approach helped to ensure that reduced emission limit requirements could be met under the increased production capacity.

Far from dampening global development, lower energy bills accelerate it.Andthere's plentymorevalue to capture. The waste heat thrown away by U.S. power stations - a fifth more energy than Japan uses for everything - could be lucratively recovered and reused if ""combined-heatand- power"" were encouraged as it is in Europe. Converting coal at the power plant into incandescent light in the room is only 3% efficient. And around 20 huge power plants spew out CO2 just to run U.S. equipment that is turned off (Lovins, 2005). Why do such inefficiencies continue? Many economists, policy analysts, and politicians believe that the country has already captured its energy efficiency potential, and that (as a result) not much promise is left. For example, in their comprehensive assessment of 20 years of industrial energy efficiency projects, Anna Shipley and R. Neal Elliot (2006) conclude that ""a recurring theme offered by those opposed to the funding of industrial energy efficiency efforts has been that companies have already realized all the cost-effective industrial energy efficiency opportunities that exist."" Richard N. Cooper (2005) notes that ""there are many attractive ideas out there [for addressing energy challenges],"" including energy efficiency practices and small-scale renewable energy systems like wind turbines. ""But when one looks quantitatively at the possibilities for mobilizing them, it is clear that many can play only a niche role"" (p. 271).

A range of heat loss experiments were undertaken as part of the Stamford Brook housing field trial in Altrincham in the United Kingdom. Co-heating tests showed a large discrepancy between the predicted and measured whole house heat loss coefficients. Analysis of the co-heating results, along with internal temperature data, thermal imaging and a theoretical analysis indicated that the most likely explanation for the discrepancy was bypassing of the thermal insulation via the uninsulated party wall cavities. The data show that such a bypass mechanism is potentially the largest single contributor to heat loss in terraced dwellings built to the 2006 revision of the Building Regulations. A comparable convective heat bypass associated with masonry party walls was identified in the late 1970s during the course of the Twin Rivers Project in the United States, albeit in a somewhat different construction from that used at Stamford Brook. A similar effect was also reported in the United Kingdom in the mid 1990s. However, it appears that no action was taken at that time either to confirm the results, to develop any technical solutions, or to amend standards for calculating heat losses from buildings. Current conventions for heat loss calculations in the United Kingdom do not take account of heat losses associated with party walls and it is suggested by the authors that such conventions may need to be updated to take account of the effect described in this paper. In the final part of the paper, the authors propose straightforward solutions to prevent bypassing of roof insulation via party walls by for example filling the cavity of the party wall with mineral fibre insulation, or by inserting a cavity closer across the cavity in the plane of the roof insulation. Practical application: The heat bypass mechanism described in this paper is believed by the authors to contribute to a significant proportion of heat loss from buildings in the UK constructed with clear cavities such as those found in separating walls between cavity masonry dwellings. It is proposed that relatively simple design changes could be undertaken to eliminate such heat loss pathways from new buildings. In addition, simple and cost effective measures are envisaged that could be used to minimise or eliminate the bypass from existing buildings. Such an approach could give rise to a significant reduction in carbon emissions from UK housing. © The Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers 2007.",,"Heat losses; Housing; Infrared imaging; Structural design; Thermal insulation; Cavity masonry dwellings; Heat bypass mechanism; Roof insulation; Masonry construction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248549045

The spatial extent of the supercritical (SC) CO2 plume was studied as a function of grid spacing in both horizontal and vertical directions. The effects of convective instability on geologic sequestration of CO2 was studied by taking advantage of parallel computing using the code PFLOTRAN, a massively parallel 3-D reservoir simulator for modeling subsurface multiphase, multicomponent reactive flow and transport based on continuum scale mass and energy conservation equations. Grid refinement in the horizontal direction affected the rate of dissolution of CO2 into the aqueous solution because of density-driven instabilities resulting in fingering of the dissolved CO2. The simulations converged with grid spacing in the same order as predicted by stability analysis. The grid refinement in the vertical direction affected the spreading rate and extent of the SC CO2 plume and consequentially affected its rate of dissipation. The horizontal extent of the SC CO2 plume continued to grow as the grid spacing in z-direction was decreased.

This 188-species skeletal mechanism was first reduced by using directed relation graph, together with sensitivity analysis, resulting in a 78-species skeletal mechanism. An isomer lumping approach was then implemented to group isomers with similar thermal and diffusion properties into composite species, and reactions involving the grouped isomers were lumped accordingly. It was found that the intra-group fraction of the isomer concentrations in the composite species remains almost constant in a wide range of parameters such that the lumped reactions remain in elementary form. A 68-species mechanism was thus obtained by eliminating 10 species through isomer lumping. Forty-two unimportant reactions were further eliminated by comparing their contributions to the production rate of each species. Finally, 13 global quasi steady state (QSS) species were identified through time-scale analysis, resulting in the 55-species reduced mechanism with 283 elementary reactions lumped to 51 semi-global steps.

This is also true in the telecommunication applications, which has seen, in the last years, a remarkable increase in the number of installations present on the whole national territory - sometimes located in hardly reachable areas - and the relevant growth of energetic consumptions. The aim of this work is to optimize energetic consumptions for a radio-telecommunication apparatus, through the combination of different interventions, even more advantageous and efficient from the economical and environmental point of view. The work will explore the possibility of interventions which would use both the renewable energetic sources (e.g.: photovoltaic cells) and strategies in energetic saving and interventions for reducing emissions. This study will evaluate, from a technical and economical point of view, the feasibility of some solutions , by: Energetic auditing for a radio-telecommunication station in different functionality contexts (urban and rural areas, different periods in the year, different running charges, etc.); Verification - even through specific field measurements - of environmental emissions deriving from radio-telecommunications systems; Analyses in the interventions of efficiency and energetic saving (optimization of air conditioning consumptions, efficiency in the temperature control system, etc.); Evaluation and development of interventions and technical solutions based on the production of a part of the power energy used by radio-telecommunication apparatus, through the use of photovoltaic cells on the same infrastructures; Analyses of possible uses of further renewable sources (e.g. wind micro turbines or new alternative power based on fuel cells) generating energy usable from telecommunications power systems located in some parts of the territory not reached by the electricity net; Analyses of the social and environmental advantages in the introduction of technologies based on renewable sources for covering a part of the energetic radio-telecommunication installations' requirements.

These diagnostic methods must be rapid, specific, sensitive, and cost-effective. In 2006, our group demonstrated a successful lab-on-a-chip immunoassay using microsphere light scattering, which is essentially a one-step, automated protocol, on a reusable chip. In the past, this had been difficult due to the limitations of microfluidic mixing and false-positive readings of particle immunoassays in a chip environment. In this current study, we conjugated quantum dots (QDs) onto microspheres to enable multiplex assays as well as to enhance the limit of detection (LOD). We named this configuration ""nano-on-micro"" or ""NOM."" Upon radiation with UVlight (380 nm), a stronger light scattering signal is observed with NOMs than QDs or microspheres alone. Additionally, NOMs are easier to handle than QDs. Since QDs also provide fluorescent emission, we are able to utilize an increase in light scattering for detecting antigen-antibody reaction and a decrease in QD emission to identify which antibody (or antigen) is present. Two types of NOM combinations were used. One batch of microspheres was coated with QDs emitting at 655 nm and mouse IgG (mlgG); the other with QDs emitting at 605 nm and bovine serum albumin (BSA). A mixture of these two NOMs was used to identify either anti-mlgG or anti-BSA. NOM particles and target solutions were mixed in a microfluidic device and on-chip detection was performed using proximity optical fibers. Forward light scattering at 380 nm was collected. With the positive target, the scattering signal was increased. The LOD was 25 ng ml-1 (165 pM) with p&lt;0.05. Fluorescent emission (655 or 605 nm) was simultaneously collected. With the positive target, the emission signal was attenuated. Therefore, we were able to detect two different antibodies simultaneously with two different detection protocols. We believe this NOM bioassay has the ability to screen for and detect multiple antibodies with minimal sample processing and handling.","Immunoagglutination; Microfluidic device; Multiplex assay; On-chip detection; Quantum dots; Static light scattering","Antibodies; Antigens; Biosensors; Light scattering; Microspheres; Semiconductor quantum dots; Immunoagglutination; Microfluidic devices; Multiplex assay; On-chip detection; Static light scattering; Bioassay",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35649006106

The influence of the membrane-bound AAA+ protease FtsH on membrane and cytoplasmic proteins of Corynebacterium glutamicum was investigated in this study. For the analysis of the membrane fraction, anion exchange chromatography was combined with SDS-PAGE, while the cytoplasmic protein fraction was studied by conventional two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Results. In contrast to the situation in other bacteria, deletion of C. glutamicum ftsH has no significant effect on growth in standard minimal medium or response to heat or osmotic stress. On the proteome level, deletion of the ftsH gene resulted in a strong increase of ten cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, namely biotin carboxylase/biotin carboxyl carrier protein (accBC), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gap), homocysteine methyltransferase (metE), malate synthase (aceB), isocitrate lyase (aceA), a conserved hypothetical protein (NCgl1985), succinate dehydrogenase A (sdhA), succinate dehydrogenase B (sdhB), succinate dehydrogenase CD (sdhCD), and glutamate binding protein (gluB), while 38 cytoplasmic and membrane-associated proteins showed a decreased abundance. The decreasing amount of succinate dehydrogenase A (sdhA) in the cytoplasmic fraction of the ftsH mutant compared to the wild type and its increasing abundance in the membrane fraction indicates that FtsH might be involved in the cleavage of a membrane anchor of this membrane-associated protein and by this changes its localization. Conclusion. The data obtained hint to an involvement of C. glutamicum FtsH protease mainly in regulation of energy and carbon metabolism, while the protease is not involved in stress response, as found in other bacteria. © 2007 Lüdke et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"bacterial protein; biotin carboxyl carrier protein; biotin carboxylase; cytoplasm protein; glutamate binding protein; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; homocysteine methyltransferase; isocitrate lyase; malate synthase; membrane protein; protein ftsh; succinate dehydrogenase; succinate dehydrogenase a; succinate dehydrogenase B; succinate dehydrogenase cd; unclassified drug; anion exchange chromatography; article; bacterial growth; bacterium; carbon metabolism; Corynebacterium glutamicum; energy metabolism; gel electrophoresis; gene deletion; heat; membrane; nonhuman; osmotic stress; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; protein localization; proteomics; stress; wild type; Amino Acids; Bacterial Proteins; Carbon; Corynebacterium glutamicum; Cytoplasm; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Energy Metabolism; Gene Deletion; Membrane Proteins; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metalloproteases; Proteomics; Corynebacterium glutamicum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846925325

Water evaporates through open stomata, however, which is a detriment to plant function. Thus a plant will seek a stomatal aperture that balances its need for CO2 with its aversion to H2O loss. In order to visualize a particular leaf's stomatal aperture, an experimentalist injects the leaf with dye so that it fluoresces. Regions with a higher relative intensity that do not correspond to veins in the leaf then correspond to areas in which the stomata are closed and the darker nonvein regions to areas in which the stomata are open. A camera is used to collect the emitted light, and a fluorescence pattern is measured. Images are continually recorded as these patterns change with time, resulting in a video sequence. The goal of this paper is to segment one such video sequence into fluorescing and nonfluorescing regions. After preprocessing the video, we take a variational approach to the segmentation problem and solve the associated three-dimensional evolution equation using a semi-implicit numerical scheme. A fixed-point formulation of the method is presented as are results of the segmentation for actual leaf data. © 2007 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.","Image segmentation; Shape reconstruction; Variational methods","Plant leaves; Variational approach (IGC: E6); Video segmentation; Photosynthesis; Sugar (sucrose)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547126190

The urban built-up areas (population) of Shanghai increased by 16.1% (22.9%) from 2006 to 2015. This study aims to analyze the variations of tropospheric NO2 over Yangtze River Delta region and the impacts of rapid urbanization during 2006-2015. The results indicate that tropospheric NO2 vertical column density (VCD) of all cities in the study area showed an increasing trend during 2006-2011 whereas a decreasing trend during 2011-2015. Most cities showed a lower tropospheric NO2 VCD value in 2015 compared to that in 2006, except for Changzhou and Nantong. Shanghai and Ningbo are two hotspots where the tropospheric NO2 VCD decreased most significantly, at a rate of 22% and 19%, respectively. This effect could be ascribed to the implementation of harsh emission control policies therein. Similar seasonal variability was observed over all cities, with larger values observed in the summer and smaller values shown in the winter. Further investigations show that the observed increasing trend of tropospheric NO2 during 2006-2011 could be largely explained by rapid urbanization linked to car ownership, GDP, power consumption, population and total industrial output. Such effect was not prominent after 2011, mainly due to the implementation of emission control strategies. © 2017 SPIE.","Trends; tropospheric NO2; urbanization; Yangtze River Delta","Ecology; Ecosystems; Emission control; Remote sensing; Rivers; Sustainable development; Troposphere; Industrial outputs; Rapid urbanizations; Seasonal variability; Trends; tropospheric NO2; urbanization; Vertical column densities; Yangtze river delta; Nitrogen oxides",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038590202

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an appropriate methodology for assessing the sustainability of a wastewater treatment plant design. The present study used a LCA approach for comparing alternative wastewater treatment processes for small and decentralised rural communities. The assessment was focused on two energy-saving systems (constructed wetland and slow rate infiltration) and a conventional one (activated sludge process). The low environmental impact of the energy-saving wastewater treatment plants was demonstrated, the most relevant being the global warming indicator. Options for reduction of life cycle impacts were assessed including materials used in construction and operational lifetime of the systems. A 10% extension of operation lifetime of constructed wetland and slow rate infiltration systems led to a 1% decrease in CO2 emissions, in both systems. The decrease in the abiotic depletion was 5 and 7%, respectively. Also, replacing steel with HDPE in the activated sludge tank resulted in a 1 % reduction in CO2 emission and 1% in the abiotic depletion indicator. In the case of the Imhoff tank a 1% reduction in CO2 emissions and 5% in the abiotic depletion indicator were observed when concrete was replaced by HDPE. © IWA Publishing 2007.","Activated sludge; Constructed wetland; Life cycle assessment; Slow rate infiltration; Wastewater treatment","Activated sludge process; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Infiltration; Wetlands; Constructed wetland; Life cycle assessment; Slow rate infiltration; Wastewater treatment; carbon dioxide; polyethylene; steel; Activated sludge process; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Infiltration; Wastewater treatment; Wetlands; carbon dioxide; constructed wetland; design; infiltration; life cycle analysis; rural area; sustainability; waste treatment; wastewater; abiotic stress; activated sludge; air pollution control; building material; conference paper; constructed wetland; energy conservation; engineering; environmental impact assessment; environmental sustainability; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; rural area; sustainable development; technique; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; Ecosystem; Residence Characteristics; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Purification; Wetlands",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548261343

Biomass burning reduces carbon fixation in terrestrial vegetation, while soil erosion increases in burned areas. For these reasons, more sophisticated prevention tools are needed by local authorities to forecast fire danger, allowing a sound allocation of intervention resources. Various factors contribute to the quantification of fire hazard, and among them vegetation moisture is the one that dictates vegetation susceptibility to fire ignition and propagation. Many authors have demonstrated the role of remote sensing in the assessment of vegetation equivalent water thickness (EWT), which is defined as the weight of liquid water per unit of leaf surface. However, fire models rely on the fuel moisture content (FMC) as a measure of vegetation moisture. FMC is defined as the ratio of the weight of the liquid water in a leaf over the weight of dry matter, and its retrieval from remote sensing measurements might be problematic, since it is calculated from two biophysical properties that independently affect vegetation reflectance spectrum. The aim of this research is to evaluate the potential of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) in retrieving both EWT and FMC from top of the canopy reflectance. The PROSPECT radiative transfer code was used to simulate leaf reflectance and transmittance as a function of leaf properties, and the SAILH model was adopted to simulate the top of the canopy reflectance. A number of moisture spectral indexes have been calculated, based on MODIS bands, and their performance in predicting EWT and FMC has been evaluated. Results showed that traditional moisture spectral indexes can accurately predict EWT but not FMC. However, it has been found that it is possible to take advantage of the multiple MODIS short-wave infrared (SWIR) channels to improve the retrieval accuracy of FMC (r2 = 0.73). The effects of canopy structural properties on MODIS estimates of FMC have been evaluated, and it has been found that the limiting factor is leaf area index (LAI). The best results are recorded for LAI&gt;2 (r2 = 0.83), while acceptable results (r2 = 0.58) can still be achieved for lower vegetation cover density.","Equivalent water thickness; Fire risk; Fuel moisture content; MODIS; PROSPECT; SAILH","Biomass; Moisture; Remote sensing; Risk assessment; Vegetation; Equivalent water thickness (EWT); Fuel moisture content; Information retrieval",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149191377

The advantage of using non-thermal plasma for promoting chemical reactions is its energy selectivity: most of the electrical energy dissipated in the discharge is used to produce high-energy electrons, and not spent on heating the entire gas stream. Typical electron temperatures in these discharges are 2-10 eV, while the background gas remains close to room temperature. The high-energy electrons seldom collide directly with the pollutant molecules, however, they excite, dissociate and ionize the background gas molecules. Thus, chemically active species are generated, which in turn, react with the pollutant molecules and decompose them. Different types of electrical discharges will be discussed with respect to NOx removal: corona discharges, dielectric barrier discharges (DBD), dielectric packed-bed discharges, and microwave discharges. Two issues of utmost importance will be emphasized throughout this chapter, namely: energy efficiency/energy consumption and by-product formation. In order to improve the efficiency for NOx removal by non-thermal plasma, different electrode geometries and electrode shapes have been investigated. The effect of the discharge gap length and of structured electrodes or multipoint electrodes, which enhance the local electric field, will be addressed. The discharges can be operated in d.c, a.c. or in pulsed mode. Comparisons between those operation modes will be discussed, as well as the influence of voltage polarity, amplitude and frequency. In pulsed discharges, the effect of pulse width and pulse repetition rate on NOx removal will be considered. Other experimental parameters found important for NOx decomposition are the gas flow rate, NOx initial concentration, reactor length, etc. The gas mixture containing the nitrogen oxides is very important as well. Experiments and modeling carried out for N2/NOx mixtures, or with addition of O2, H2O, CO2 and hydrocarbons will be discussed. Typical hydrocarbon additives investigated are ethane, propene, propane, 2-propene-l-ol, 2-propanol, etc. As compared to the case without hydrocarbons, NO oxidation occurs much faster when hydrocarbons are present. The reaction paths for NO removal change significantly, in fact the chemical mechanism itself is completely different from that of without hydrocarbon additives. Another additive investigated extensively is ammonia, used especially in corona radical shower systems. The combination of non-thermal plasma and heterogeneous catalysis will be addressed as well. Single stage plasma-catalytic systems, with the catalysts placed in the discharge zone, and two stage systems, with the catalysts placed downstream of the plasma will be discussed. Single-stage reactors have the advantage of reactions on the catalyst surface with short-lived active species generated in the discharge.

Although the U.S. Navy has used cold ironing for decades at naval facilities around the world, its application in a commercial context is relatively new. This paper describes the process of design development and of securing building permits for a cold ironing system at Pier G Phase 2 Wharf in the Long Beach Harbor Department (LBHD) District, more widely known as the Port of Long Beach (POLB). The first step in designing the shore-to-ship power system at POLB involved developing design standards, since none were available for this type of commercial power supply system. The three main considerations were: establishing a ship voltage and electrical load standard for ships presently in service and those that will be in service 10-15 years from now; developing shore-to-ship electrical connection hardware; and designing system safety requirements. Subsequent design considerations included appropriate wharf structure and transformer/switchgear components. The permitting process was also unusual. The Permits Section of the Long Beach Building Department had never had plans submitted for a cold ironing system. Concerns were shared with the Plan Check Reviewers on the overall system, and operational standards were developed to ensure safe operating conditions for the cold ironing system. These extra steps in the permitting process were necessary to secure the building permits required to construct the project.

The study was carried out in ultrahigh vacuum using scanning tunneling microscopy, which allowed observation of the atomic structure of the film. It is shown that, on extended smooth regions of the Ir surface, a continuous graphite film with a regular arrangement of carbon atoms in a planar hexagonal lattice is formed. The orientation of zigzag carbon atom chains coincides with the 〈110〉 direction on the Ir surface. Structural defects of the (5, 7) configuration were revealed in the film. A comparison of the topographies of the film and the (111)Ir surface shows that the graphite layer smoothly (without discontinuities) flows over subnanometer topographical features existing on the Ir surface and that the distance between the graphite film and the metal surface in this case can reach 1 nm. © 2007 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954770598

The estimates were made by comparing, at each grid point, 50-year return values for the simulation periods of 1961-1990 and 2071-2100. The most significant predicted changes in the study area are in the extremes of maximum and minimum air temperatures. The increase in the extreme surface wind speed is mostly small. The 50-year return value for the precipitation amount in five days is predicted to increase by over 50% in many areas. The extreme snow water equivalent is predicted to decrease very significantly in most of the study area but increase in some highland areas. Very heavy snow fall will become generally more frequent. From the point of view of adapting structural design and community planning to climate change, the results suggest that the emphasis should be in the design practices in regard to flooding. The estimated changes in other structural design criteria are generally less significant or favourable.","Adaptation to climate change; Climate change; Extreme weather; Probabilistic design; Regional climate modeling; Risk management of structures","air temperature; climate change; climate forcing; climate modeling; design flood; extreme event; precipitation (climatology); probability; regional climate; return period; snow water equivalent; wind velocity; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57749168365

Therefore, their impact on the global and local pollution and on the use of natural resources should be minimized. To this end, an extensive fundamental and practical study was performed to evaluate the potential benefits of simultaneously co-optimizing the system fuel-and-engine using diesel as an example. It will be clearly shown that the still unused co-optimizing of the system fuel-and-engine (including advanced exhaust after-treatment) as a single entity is a must for enabling cleaner future road transport by cleaner fuels since there are large, still unexploited potentials for improvements in road fuels which will provide major reductions in pollutant emissions both in vehicles already in the field and even more so in future dedicated vehicles. The paper presents details of the approaches taken to co-optimize fuels and engines which were verified by practical engine tests by 5 independent European auto manufacturers. The results give clear guidelines to politics and oil industry for the imminent need for introducing clean fuels to enable a cleaner Diesel road transport.

The ligands were made by straightforward four-step synthetic procedures and purified with preparative RP-HPLC, after which they were used to prepare gadolinium(iii) and europium(iii) complexes. Relaxometric experiments were performed on the Gd(iii) complexes at 300 MHz, varying the pH of the solutions or the concentration of human serum albumin (HSA). It was found that when the pH of the medium was changed from neutral to pH 4 the longitudinal relaxivity of GdDO3A-ethylphosphonate and GdDO3A-propylphosphonate complexes increased by 50% and 60%, respectively. Diethyl esters of these complexes did not change longitudinal relaxivity in the same pH range but their transverse relaxivity increased upon binding to HSA. 31P NMR experiments on Eu(iii) complexes showed a change in the chemical shift of both acid complexes in the same region where the highest relaxivity changes were observed and proved the stability of the complexes in the investigated pH range, while no shift was observed for the diester complexes. Luminescence studies on europium(iii) complexes additionally supported observations obtained by NMR methods. The change in the form of the luminescence emission spectra, and the reduction in the q value upon addition of HSA proved the ternary adduct formation between the charge neutral diester complexes and HSA. Similarly, the change in the emission spectra showing a phosphonate bound structure at pH 7 to a species where the phosphonate oxygen is not coordinated at pH 4 in parallel with the increase of q value is supporting the hypothesis that the deprotonation of phosphonates is the main reason for the distinct relaxivity change from slightly acidic to the neutral solution media. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Characterization; Esters; Europium; Gadolinium; High performance liquid chromatography; Ligands; Luminescence; Purification; Synthesis (chemical); Ethylphosphonates; Macrocyclic moiety; Relaxometric experiments; Rare earth compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148987944

We examined a theoretical model that investigated the impact on nurse injuries (back injuries and needlesticks) of critical structural variables (staffing adequacy, work engagement, and work conditions) and further tested whether safety climate moderated these effects. Method: A longitudinal, non-experimental, organizational study, conducted in 281 medical-surgical units in 143 general acute care hospitals in the United States. Results: Work engagement and work conditions were positively related to safety climate, but not directly to nurse back injuries or needlesticks. Safety climate moderated the relationship between work engagement and needlesticks, while safety climate moderated the effect of work conditions on both needlesticks and back injuries, although in unexpected ways.

As PAN is formed by the oxidation of reactive hydrocarbons in the presence of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), it is a direct measure of the peroxyacyl radical levels produced from reactive organic emissions in the urban air shed. Carbon soot, known as black carbon (BC) or elemental carbon (EC), is a primary atmospheric aerosol species and is a good indicator of the levels of combustion emissions, particularly from diesel engines, in major cities. Mexico City is the second largest megacity in the world and has long suffered from poor air quality. Reported here are atmospheric measurements of PAN and BC obtained in Mexico City during the Mexico Megacity 2003 field study. These results are compared with measurements obtained earlier during the Investigación sobre Materia Particulada y Deterioro Atmosférico - Aerosol and Visibility Research (IMADA-AVER) campaign in 1997 to obtain an estimate of the changes in emissions in Mexico City and the effectiveness of control strategies adopted during that time. Concentrations of PAN in 1997 reached a maximum of 34 ppb with an average daily maximum of 15 ppb. The PAN levels recorded in 2003 were quite different, with an average daily maximum of 3 ppb. This dramatic reduction in PAN levels observed in 2003 indicate that reactive hydrocarbon emissions have been reduced in the city due to controls on olefins in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and also due to the significant number of newer vehicles with catalytic converters that have replaced older higher emission vehicles. In contrast, black/elemental carbon levels were similar in 1997 and 2003 indicating little improvement likely due to the lack of controls on diesel vehicles in the city. Thus, while air quality and ozone production have improved, Mexico City and other megacities continue to be a major source of black carbon aerosols, which can be an important species in determining regional radiative balance and climate.",,"aerosol; air quality; carbon emission; emission control; megacity; nitrogen dioxide; oxidation; ozone; peroxyacetyl nitrate; radiation balance; soot; traffic emission; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248230339

Flares are commonly used at landfills and POTWs to burn landfill gas and digester gas generated at the plants. Many owners and operators of these facilities are unaware that operation of combustion equipment such as a flare can trigger state air permitting and annual emission reporting requirements. Flares generate a relatively large amount of carbon monoxide (CO), a regulated pollutant. CO is the pollutant that usually exceeds regulatory thresholds. To confuse the situation further, each state enforces different thresholds. Owners and operators of a landfill or POTW should calculate plant emissions and determine their regulatory obligations. Ironically emissions from wastewater treatment systems and solids handling operations at POTWs do not usually exceed regulatory thresholds, even though emissions from these operations are subject to the most public scrutiny. Combustion of digester gas is the activity that typically creates air quality permitting requirements.

Additionally, Federal and state regulatory agencies scrutinize emissions to the air from wastewater treatment facilities. In each of these conditions, air permitting, emission reporting, or responding to regulatory agency requests for information, quantification of pollutant emissions to the air is required. Emission sources of concern at wastewater treatment facilities typically include gas combustion (e.g. digester gas flares or engines), material handling, and fugitive emissions from wastewater treatment operations. Quantification of emissions from combustion and material handling processes is relatively straightforward; emission calculations are typically performed using published emission factors, equipment manufacturer's guarantees, or facility specific stack testing results. Quantification of emissions from wastewater treatment units is more complex, with variability in influent composition and flow rate along with a wide variety of different treatment units each with its own emission characteristics. Typically, characterization of influent water composition and treatment unit parameters must be used with an emission model to quantify emissions from wastewater treatment units. There are several choices for modeling emissions from wastewater treatment units. Some of the more common choices include the WATER9 model, the TOXCHEM model, equations found in AP-42, or Pooled Emission Estimation Program (PEEP) emission factors. This paper provides a description of these models, a discussion of how they can be used, and considerations for model selection. © 2007 ASCE.",,"Air; Air pollution; Combustion; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Industrial water treatment; Materials handling; Reclamation; Different treatments; Emission calculation; Emission characteristics; Emission estimation; Equipment manufacturers; Regulatory agencies; Requests for information; Wastewater treatment facilities; Wastewater treatment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087586702

As a result, the global demand for natural gas has been projected to increase at an accelerated pace. Unleashing the economic potential of gas reservoirs in remote areas has received increased attention. This paper will focus on various aspects of building LNG plants in arctic regions, such as the North Slope of Alaska and Barent Sea Regions of North Europe. The hydrocarbon industry continues to gain construction and operational experiences in arctic regions. The most notable experiences to date are attributed to the oil production and gas re-injection facilities in the North Slope, and the trans-Alaskan pipeline systems. More recent examples of LNG plants in colder climates include the construction of LNG facilities on the Melkøya Island of Norway and Sakhalin Island of Russia, as well as the Norwegian Ormen-Lange Gas Development. The challenges of building LNG projects in the colder regions can be witnessed by significant cost overruns and schedule delays of the two recent LNG plant constructions on Melkøya and Sakhalin Islands. This paper will present a general description of challenges facing projects in the arctic region. These challenges are mostly related to remote pioneer locations, harsh environment, local regulations, availability of skilled labor, winterization requirements, and special environmental concerns. The offshore pipeline and facilities design offers challenging options that could have a significant impact on the design of the LNG facility. The paper also discusses the specific challenges in designing large LNG plants to capture the economies of scale. The recommendations of this work will serve as useful guidelines for future LNG projects in arctic regions.",,"Arctic regions; Arsenic compounds; Economics; Environmental regulations; Gas industry; Gas plants; Gases; Hydrocarbons; Injection (oil wells); Landforms; Natural gas; Offshore oil well production; Oil well production; Organic compounds; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Pipelines; Liquefied natural gas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51549108279

But the ambient air quality in even smaller cities and towns is deteriorating alarmingly and in some cases much worse. Indoor air pollution is one risk that we can do something about. In the last several years, a growing body of scientific evidence has indicated that the air within homes and other buildings can be more seriously polluted than the outdoor air in even the largest and most industrialized cities. Other research indicates that people spend approximately 90 percent of their time indoors. Thus, for many people, the risks to health may be greater due to exposure to air pollution indoors than outdoors. Indoor pollution sources that release gases or particles into the air are the primary cause of indoor air quality problems in homes. Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the home. High temperature and humidity levels can also increase concentrations of some pollutants. If too little outdoor air enters a home, pollutants can accumulate Unless they are built with special mechanical means of ventilation, homes that are designed and constructed to minimize the amount of outdoor air that can leak into and out of the home may have higher pollutant levels than other homes. However, because some weather conditions can drastically reduce the amount of outdoor air that enters a home, pollutants can build up even in homes that are normally considered leaky. A study of 100 kitchens was conducted in typical Indian kitchens at Jodhpur and Kota to assess the concentration of various air pollution parameters. The parameters were NOx, SO2, CO and particulate matter (SPM) and respirable particulate matter (RSPM). A regression analysis was then carried out between these parameters and volume of kitchen, opening area, and exhaust fan facility. It was concluded that the variation of the kitchen parameters have significant effect on RSPM only. © Enviromedia Printed in India.

A new generation of federal and regional codes on energy efficiency in buildings has taken effect in Russia. These codes, which mandate a reduction of at least 40 percent in energy consumption for heating, have led to the need for an increase of 2.5 to 3 times in thermal performance in new and renovated buildings. Since 2003 Kazakhstan and 2006 Ukraine have been explicitly following Russia's lead in moving to adopt and implement energy-saving building codes. As a result, a fundamental transformation has taken place, toward the production, sale, and use of energy-efficient construction materials and products, and changes in building design methods. Over the period from 2002 to 2006, the overall energy savings in Russia totaled more than 375 PJ. This has led to an almost 25.5-million-tonne reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. In the period from 2002 to 2010, the cumulative reductions are anticipated to rise to almost 1,200 PJ and more than 80 million tones of carbon dioxide in Russia alone. The paper describes these achievements and problems in implementation of these new systems and technologies.","Building codes; Building envelope; Energy efficiency; Residential buildings; Thermal insulation","Architectural design; Building materials; Carbon dioxide; Codes (symbols); Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Global warming; Intelligent buildings; Laws and legislation; Sustainable development; Thermal insulation; Building envelopes; Carbon dioxide emissions; Design innovations; Energy efficiency in buildings; Energy-saving buildings; Market transformation; Residential building; Thermal Performance; Building codes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902602955

The flue gas is recirculated into the combustion chamber to reduce the O2 concentration and to suppress the combustion gas temperature and the concentration of O2, so that NOx emission is significantly reduced. The fuel gas recirculation at high mixing ratio, however, may lead to unstable combustion of conventional fuels, methane or city gas. On the other hand, DME has, however, very high potential of applicability of the flue-gas recirculation even at high mixing ratio because of its high burning velocity and low ignition temperature. Combustion tests were conducted with laboratory-scale 11kW combustor. The maximum FGR ratio is 85% at the initial air ratio of 1.5 with preheated diluted air about 600K. The NOx emission reduced to 13ppm at 0%-O2, which corresponds to about 9% of NOx emission at FGR=0%. The stable combustion is sustained even in the low oxygen concentration by preheating diluted-air up to near the auto-ignition temperature of DME. Finally, an effect of the flue-gas recirculation on the NOx and CO emission is discussed with reference to the industrial-scale water-tube boilers.","Diffusion combustion; DME (Dimethyl Ether); FGR (Flue gas recirculation); Water-tube boiler","Combustion chambers; Ethers; Flue gases; Flues; Fuels; Gases; Industrial emissions; Methane; Mixing; Refuse incinerators; Tubes (components); Water tube boilers; Autoignition temperature; Combustion gas temperatures; Combustion technology; Diffusion combustion; DME (dimethyl ether); Flue gas recirculation; Fundamental characteristics; Ignition temperatures; Ignition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84908495074

Emission trading is thought to be an efficient measure to achieve the target level. In this study, we developed a simulation model of Japanese emission trading under the Kyoto Protocol and verified the feasibility of emission trading. The simulation model is based on a dual input-output model and GDP was maximized in the simulation with CO2 restrictions. We analyzed three cases ; Case 1 with free control emissions, Case 2 targeting the Kyoto Protocol by emission trading, and Case 3 assuming a more moderate restriction of emissions involving forest deposits. These simulations are based on data from 2000. As a result, the critical price was approximately five or six thousands yen per ton-CO2 in Japan. In addition, reduction in the gross CO2 emissions with only restrictions on emissions is very difficult. Therefore trading emissions permits are considered an effective measure to create incentives to reduce net emissions of CO2.. © 2007, JAPAN SECTION OF THE REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL.

It can be regarded as a kind of voluntary approach (VA). In preceding case studies, it was found that PCAs played a larger role in reducing sulfur oxides emissions than other policy instruments. To clarify the actual situations of PCAs, two questionnaire surveys were conducted. Upon analysis, it was found that PCAs were used differently by local governments of different scales and confirmed that traditional industrial pollution problems had been controlled to a large extent by PCAs. It is argued in this article that the difference between voluntary and mandatory instruments is the difference of their introduction process. Furthermore, the features of PCAs are investigated by comparing them with other policy instruments that differ from PCAs in this respect. It is concluded that the main strong points of PCAs are the ability to gain residents’ understanding of new locations and operations of business, the flexibility to adapt regulation to the financial conditions of businesses, and that they stem from their individuality of negotiation, conclusion, and implementation. Finally our study on PCAs is compared with other studies on VAs. There it is found that the incentive scheme to motivate businesses to conclude PCAs is different from what other studies found concerning VAs in other countries. © 2007, Springer Japan.","Environmental policy instrument; Local government; Mandatory approach; Pollution control agreement; Voluntary approach",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053941146

This method works well even when the overall reaction rate is controlled by reactant adsorption or when the interaction between adsorbed species is obscured in kinetic studies under steady-state conditions.

Our primary aim is to investigate mass-loss rate and molecular bands of these stars as a function of metallicity, by comparing AGB stars in several galaxies with different metallicities. These stars were observed using the Infrared Spectrometer (IRS) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope which covers 5-35 μm region, and the Infrared Spectrometer And Array Camera (ISAAC) on the Very Large Telescope which covers the 2.9-4.1 μm region. HCN, CH and C2H2 molecular bands, as well as SiC and MgS dust features are identified in the spectra. We find no evidence that mass-loss rates depend on metallicity. Carbon stars are strongly affected by carbon production during the AGB phase; primarily mass-loss of carbon-rich stars are driven by amorphous carbon dust grains, which explains the little metallicity dependence of mass-loss rate for carbon-rich stars. We found that C2H2 bands are prominent features at 3-15 μm among extragalactic carbon stars, which is not always the case for Galactic carbon stars. We argue that the difference is caused by systematically high C/O ratios in low-metallicity environments. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.","Stars: AGB and post-AGB; Stars: atmospheres; Stars: carbon; Stars: mass-loss",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449110102

The purpose of this paper is to draw together the common strands related to sustainable transport and to make recommendations for ministers and their advisers. In doing so, it concentrates on the barriers to achieving sustainability and the ways in which they might be overcome. The paper starts by considering definitions of sustainability and the underlying objectives that governments might pursue. It then considers the varying contexts within which these objectives might be pursued. It reviews the policy instruments that might be employed in achieving these objectives and reviews the barriers to their introduction. Finally, it offers a series of recommendations to governments on ways of overcoming those barriers. The issues raised are of concern to international policy makers. To focus discussion, the questions for ministers in the original version have been recast as issues that policy makers may wish to consider in their own contexts.",,"Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Mass transportation; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Sustainable transport; Travel policies; Public policy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40049085384

This, in turn, usually requires the implementation of new sensors and hardware which must subsequently be monitored by the on-board fault detection systems. The reliable detection and diagnosis of faults in these systems or sensors, which result in the tailpipe emissions rising above the progressively lower failure thresholds, provides enormous challenges for OBD engineers. This paper gives a review of the field of fault detection and diagnostics as used in the automotive industry. Previous work is discussed and particular emphasis is placed on the various strategies and techniques employed. Methodologies such as state estimation, parity equations and parameter estimation are explained with their application within a physical model diagnostic structure. The utilization of symptoms and residuals in the diagnostic process is also discussed. These traditional physical model based diagnostics are investigated in terms of their limitations. The requirements from the OBD legislation are also addressed. Additionally, novel diagnostic techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) are also presented as a potential method of achieving the monitoring requirements of current and future OBD legislation.

The co-electrolysis process allows for direct electrochemical reduction of the steam - carbon dioxide gas mixture, yielding hydrogen and carbon monoxide, or syngas. The process model has been developed using the Honeywell UniSim systems analysis code. Using this code, a detailed process flow sheet has been defined that includes all the components that would be present in an actual plant such as pumps, compressors, heat exchangers, turbines, and the electrolyzer. Since the electrolyzer is not a standard UniSim component, a custom one-dimensional co-electrolysis model was developed for incorporation into the overall UniSim process flow sheet. The one dimensional co-electrolysis model assumes local chemical equilibrium among the four process-gas species via the gas shift reaction. The electrolyzer model allows for the determination of co-electrolysis outlet temperature, composition (anode and cathode sides); mean Nernst potential, operating voltage and electrolyzer power based on specified inlet gas flow rates, heat loss or gain, current density, and cell area-specific resistance. The onedimensional electrolyzer model was validated by comparison with results obtained from a fully three dimensional computational fluid dynamics model developed using FLUENT, and by comparison to experimental data. This paper provides representative results obtained from the UniSim flow sheet model for a 300 MW co-electrolysis plant, coupled to a high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor. The coelectrolysis process, coupled to a nuclear reactor, provides a means of recycling carbon dioxide back into a useful liquid fuel. If the carbon dioxide source is based on biomass, the entire process would be climate neutral.

Governments expend massive public resources to provide the public with information; however, the impact of online information provisioning on actors' behaviors and the policy process remains poorly understood at the macro level. The transference of policymaking from the real world to the virtual requires institutional shifts, modernized information management strategies, and a digital state platform that supports Web-based policy activity. This study analyses policy information on the Web to understand how the hyperlinked organization of webpages, produced by real world, web-enabled policy communities, influences the structure and content of the Web's information supply. It is argued that governing on the Web requires new governing instruments that are designed to manage in technologically-mediated environment which means that governments will no longer simply manage bulk data, but rather govern dense networks of information to manage the information flow. This paper suggests that a centralized position in the network confers power, as actors that are nodal have more access to network resources, more opportunities for exchange and a greater influence on how information flows through the network. Using hyperlink analysis to study network structure and website connectivity this paper considers government nodality in six web-based policy networks including climate change, child tax benefit, foreign policy, equalization, peacemaking and rural health. This research suggests that while the Canadian government's policy making capacity is shaped by the extent to which the state is nodal in online policy communities, the state's influence may also be diminished in policy arenas characterized by higher level of internationalization. The findings do indicate however that the Canadian government's participation in virtual policy networks is significant, with the state operating as an important actor on the policy Web.","E-Government; Government nodality; Virtual policy networks; Web-based information","Climate change; Computer aided network analysis; Government data processing; Hypertext systems; Information management; Websites; e-Government; Government nodality; Information delivery; Information management strategies; Information supplies; On-line information; Policy networks; Web-based information; Public policy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84902436566

Deep subsurface brine reservoirs In geological sedimentary basins are possible sites for sequestration, given their ubiquitous nature. We used a mathematical sedimentary basin model, including full coupling of multiphase CO2-groundwater flow, heat flow, and rock deformation, to evaluate effects of CO2 Injection on fluid pressures and rock strain. We also analyzed residence times and migration patterns of CO2 in possible brine reservoir storage sites. Study areas Include the Ulnta and Paradox basins of Utah, and the Permian basin of west Texas. Regional-scale hydrologic and mechanical properties, including the presence of fracture zones, were calibrated using laboratory measurements and field data. Our initial results suggest that, in general, long-term (~100 years or more) sequestration in deep brine reservoirs is possible, if guided by robust rock mechanical and hydrologic data. However, specific processes must be addressed to characterize and minimize risks. In addition to CO2 migration from target sequestration reservoirs into other reservoirs or to the land surface, another environmental issue is displacement of brines into freshwater aquifers. We evaluated the potential for such unintended aquifer contamination by displacement of brines out of adjacent sealing layers such as marine shales. Results suggest that sustained injection of CO2 may incur significant brine displacement out of adjacent sealing layers, depending on the injection history, initial brine composition, and hydrologic properties of both reservoirs and seals. Model simulations also suggest that as injection can induce abnormally high fluid pressures, or overpressures. Results indicate that injection-induced overpressures may migrate, and effective stresses may follow this migration under some conditions, as will associated rock strain. Such ""strain migration"" may lead to induced or reactivated fractures or faults, but can be controlled through reservoir engineering.",,"Aquifers; Brines; Climate change; Climatology; Fracture; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Groundwater flow; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Marine pollution; Mechanical properties; Petroleum geology; Rocks; Sedimentology; Settling tanks; Aquifer contaminations; Brine displacements; Carbon sequestrations; Effective stresses; Environmental issues; Field datums; Fluid pressures; Fracture zones; Freshwater aquifers; Full couplings; Heat flows; Hydrologic datums; Hydrologic properties; Injection histories; Laboratory measurements; Land surfaces; Marine shales; Migration patterns; Model simulations; Over pressures; Permian; Reservoir engineerings; Reservoir storages; Residence times; Rock deformations; Sealing layers; Sedimentary basins; Study areas; Water injection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349118511

But it was only in the late 1960s and early 1970s that national governments moved to establish the environment as a significant area of activity. More comprehensive measures were introduced to control emissions. By the 1990s, it was suggested that growth and environment were not necessarily contradictory. And it was only a matter of time when ""sustainable development"" became a talk. Today, across the developed world, there is an elaborate network of institutions explicitly concerned with environmental management that extends from the central government to the local administrations. However, on a global perspective, environmental problems appear more serious. Gains from cleaner technologies are often overwhelmed by the growth of consumption. One way to understand our form of environmental governance is to place policy developments within the context of long-term societal evolution, where the functions and organization of the state are continually adjusted as the result of ongoing struggles among different societal forces over how the public interest is to be defined. Meanwhile, Canada needs to address the climate change issue by stabilizing and then reducing its burgeoning emissions. However, the challenge for this includes the problem of interdependence with the US, which is not interested in emissions control, the rapid expansion of production in the oil sands and the constitutional division of powers around energy making cooperations on climate change so difficult to secure.",,"climate change; emission control; environmental management; policy development; sustainable development; twentieth century; Canada; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34147123242

In this report, we compare the global transcript and proteomic profiles of wild-type and Gpa2p deficient diploid yeast strains grown on both rich and nitrogen starved maltose media. We find that deletion of GPA2 results in significantly different transcript and protein profiles when switching from rich to nitrogen starvation media.

Paleoclimatological evidence indicates that both Amazonia and the Brazilian coast were cooler and drier prior to ca. 7000 14C yr BP. In both regions, the forest was substantially reduced and the predominant vegetation was grass and shrubs as a result of climatic changes. These ameliorations permitted larger and more sedentary communities, but inherent limitations to intensive agriculture and dependence on wild protein sources placed a ceiling on population concentration throughout the lowlands. This study summarizes the evidence for paleoclimatological fluctuations and prehistoric cultural changes since ca. 13,000 14C yr BP (uncal.) separately for the Coastal Strip and the Amazon Basin. Both the climatological and cultural data indicate that these now distinct regions experienced long- and short-term environmental fluctuations during and since the Pleistocene that favored the emergence and perpetuation of similar general cultural configurations. The achievement of Holocene climatic conditions and stabilization of sea level ca. 5000 14C yr BP had major environmental consequences. It created an ecological barrier between Amazonia and the Coastal Strip and divided each region into a narrow aquatic zone and a large hinterland. Finally, it suggests that in contrast to other parts of the planet, Holocene climatic changes did not significantly improve the opportunities for agricultural intensification and associated cultural development. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The particle swarm optimizer, used here is one of these tools. However, applying it to the optimization of the S.I. engine for high efficiency and low NOx emission has shown the preference of ultra lean burn strategy combined with high compression ratios. For combined power, efficiency and emissions benefits, there are two restricting factors, limiting the applicability of this strategy, knocking and cyclic variability. In the ultra lean region, knocking is not an important issue but the variability is a major concern. This paper demonstrates the application of a variability model to limit the search domain for the optimization program. The results show that variability constrains the possible gains in fuel consumption and emission reduction, through optimizing cam phasing, mixture and spark timing. The fuel consumption gain is reduced by about 11% relative. Also the NOx produced is two times greater than for the non-constrained case previously reported.

The study has focused on (1) the drivers and barriers of the stakeholders that were responsible for project implementation and (2) the comparative performance of the source separation systems after their establishment. In The Netherlands the main drivers were water use reduction, combating sewer overflows and reduction of emissions. For the Swedish cases the main drivers of the involved actors were nutrient recycling, emission reduction and an active policy of the local government. The main barriers in all cases were higher investment costs and low experience with new sanitation approaches systems compared with the conventional system. Three of the sites showed a lower performance with respect to public health because effluent monitoring protocols for the grey water treatment systems were not in place or people could have direct contact with faeces. Lack of operation and maintenance is a cause of occasional failure for the grey water treatment systems, while the dominant failure reason for the urine separation systems was pipe clogging.

Typical DG sources include wind turbines, fuel cells, micro gas/diesel turbines, small hydro generators and photovoltaics. Currently most of these generation sources are optimized for local operation and thus the potential of DG that is both dispatchable and cost-effective has yet to be fully realized. One key technical challenge is the development of low-cost communications for remote telemetry and control of individual DG sources. Along with cost, other key communication system requirements are modularity, range and reliability. This paper presents a distributed generation communication system (DGCS) that is based on a wide area network (WAN) and local area network (LAN) topology and utilizes two variants of low-cost radio modems (RM) to satisfy the desired connectivity between the DG sites and a centralized control center. For the LAN, low-cost RMs operating in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency band offers point-to-multipoint scalability to multiple DG sites within a limited range. Integration of the ISM RMs with a cellular RM provides connectivity to a WAN or Internet thus providing longrange access to DG sites from any facility that has internet-access. Given the LAN scalability requirement, an ISM field programmable gate array (FPGA) channel simulator was developed to assess DGCS performance using channel impairments such as free-space path loss, multipath reflections, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), multiple access interference, and narrowband interference. This study provides the evaluation of two commercially available ISM radio modems and recommendations are made based on LAN requirements such as cost and performance given difficult channel conditions.

The objective of this study was i) to identify and quantify the sources that have caused or have contributed to these exceedances; and ii) to propose suitable emission reduction measures to comply with the future air quality standards (2010). We followed an integrated multi-disciplinary approach consisting of a detailed analysis of the PM10 data series, specific air quality measuring campaigns, air quality modeling and a thorough exploitation of the available expertise in emission reduction measures (including current BAT and BREF studies). The data analysis was based on 5 steps: 1) The pollution roses of the individual monitoring stations were analyzed. 2) The variation of the PM10 concentration in function of wind speed was assessed to determine whether we were dealing with a fugitive source of primary particles (e.g. mineral dust) or a source of smaller secondary particles taken up and dispersed by the ambient air flow (e.g. industrial combustion sources or traffic sources). 3) The temporal patterns of the potential sources were analyzed. 4) Specific measurement campaigns were organized in the neighborhood of the potential sources. This included mapping of PM10 concentrations and a detailed analysis of the chemical composition. 5) The (fugitive) PM10 sources were quantified by means of reversed modeling. Results for the individual monitoring stations showed that in almost all cases the exceedances could be attributed to local fugitive PM10 emissions on top of high background concentrations.

In the uncontrolled 'urban-sprawl' scenario, the urbanized area increases by almost 75%. For the 'satellitecity' scenario, where the urban development is controlled and directed to 5 five existing towns, the urban land use changes are increasing with 9%. A detailed analysis shows that the urban-sprawl scenario results in an exposure reduction of 5.7% due the movement of people from locations with high concentrations of particulate matter to locations with lower particulate matter concentrations. A reduction of 1.4% was found for the satellite-city scenario. The dominant driver of these exposure changes appears to be the population moving from the relatively polluted conurbation to less-polluted areas. © Springer 2007.","Environmental risk assessment; External costs; Health impacts; Integrated assessment; Land use; Ozone; Particulate matter; Urban air quality; Urban sprawl",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250752680

As a result of both known and potential health effects, a long list of environmental regulatory prohibitions restricting particulate matter (PM) emissions has developed over the years. The prohibitions have come largely in the form of air quality regulations that targeted reduction and control of PM from a wide variety of industrial sources. As industry prepares for further tightening of PM emissions rules, this paper addresses: 1) development and relationship between PM2.5 regulatory programs; 2) impacts to industry from applicable rules, requirements, and compliance dates; and 3) a methodology for planning to achieve compliance with competing, overlapping regulation.","Dispersion Modeling; NAAQS; New Source Review; Particulate emissions sources; Particulate matter; PM2.5; Regional haze; State Implementation Plan (SIP)","Air quality; Cardiovascular system; Health; Law enforcement; Particulate emissions; Regulatory compliance; Dispersion modeling; NAAQS; New Source Reviews; Particulate Matter; PM2.5; Regional haze; State Implementation Plans; Waste management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649138633

Reaction of 1 with sodium hydrosulfite affords the 1,4-reduced product, 3-piperidinylcarbonyl-1,2,4- trimethyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline (2), with low enantioselectivity, whereas sodium borohydride promotes 1,2-reduction, affording 3-piperidinylcarbonyl-1,2,4- trimethyl-1,2-dihydroquinoline (3) as the sole product in a moderate enantioselectivity. When 1 was reduced by the chiral NADH model compound, 2,4-dimethyl-3-(N-α-methylbenzylcarbamoyl)-1-propyl-1,4-dihydropyridine (Me2PNPH (4)), the regioselectivity and enantioselectivity of the reaction were significantly altered by the stereochemistry of 1 and 4.

Taking account of the emission reduction scenario agreed under the Gothenburg Protocol, the calculations were run to answer the question of whether this agreement suffices to allow recovery and prevent further acidification of Polish forests and to identify regions where further emission reductions are indispensable. To this end target load functions for the years 2030, 2050 and 2100 as well as the time of damage and a delay in forest recovery were calculated for all forest sites under consideration. The output of these calculations shows that in target year 2030 about 19% of the sites analyzed will be protected when deposition is not changed after 2010. This means that no deposition reduction is required in this target year. For target year 2100 the contribution of these safe sites increases to 20%. In the case of the main fraction making ca. 80% of the sites analyzed, target load functions exist and target depositions can be calculated for selected target years. For a portion of sites the target loads cannot be achieved even at the lowest back-ground depositions. This applied to 1.2% of sites for the target year 2030 and to 0.2% for 2050, while for 2100 it is not the case. Based on the constant deposition rates resulting from the Gothenburg Protocol, the recovery from the conditions of exceeding allowable soil chemical parameters is possible for 1.52% of sites, while damage may happen to about 10% of sites until 2100.",,"Computer simulation; Deposition; Forestry; Particulate emissions; Emission reductions; Gothenburg Protocol; Target loads; Soil pollution; Acidification; Deposition; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35448990899

Throughout the 30 years since the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution reported on the use of planning controls over air pollution, the UK government's position has been characterised by ambivalence: urging the use of planning powers to control pollution while warning them to avoid encroaching on the remit of other regulatory agencies. While the language of planning controls over pollution and the pollutants of most concern have changed over the years, the role of planning in mitigating pollution must now be understood within the context of adaptation to European environmental policy, to recurrent demands for deregulation and, above all, to the pursuit of sustainable development. The paper argues that inadequate weight is given to pollution prevention in determining planning applications because of central government's reluctance to allow local planning authorities to jeopardise economic development. It suggests that public and political endorsement of clarified environmental objectives, together with improved procedures, are essential if planning is to continue to adapt to play its full part in combating the effects of climate change.",,"legislative implementation; mitigation; policy implementation; pollution control; pollution policy; regulatory approach; sustainable development; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40549086642

More than one fifth of the energy use in Canada is used to condition air whether from the cold in much of Canada or provide cooling and heating where summers are hot and humid and winters are cold. To reduce greenhouse gases and improve housing affordability, this energy use needs to be reduced. In 1981, the Federal and Provincial governments understood that science was needed to inform building codes in relation to occupant health. Ventilation standards used in North America were developed during the late 19 th century from studies done mainly in schools. Modern studies of ventilation rate and health effects in public buildings indicate that relative risk for increased respiratory disease and absenteeism becomes significant around 14 L/s per person. Most of this work has been done in public buildings. In Canada, there has been interest in ventilation questions for residential housing in relation to comfort, disease transmission and relationships of ventilation to dampness and pollutants mainly derived from vehicle traffic as well as endotoxin. Considering new homes with heat recovery ventilators, occupants reported improvement over 1 year in the symptoms of throat irritation, cough, fatigue, and irritability in comparison with control new home occupants. Homes that have low per person ventilation rates, and, those that are air leaky are prone to dampness with the associated increased risks of asthma and upper respiratory disease. In the most under-ventilated homes in Canada (in the far north), increased infectious disease has been observed in infants. Lastly, both gaseous and particulate air contaminants infiltrate homes. This is affected by ventilation and other aspects of system design and appears to modulate allergic responses. New studies are needed on the effect of ventilation on health to prevent negative effects on population health consequent to changes in energy codes for residential homes.","Health; Indoor air pollution; Outdoor air pollution; Ventilation","Air contaminants; Allergic response; Built environment; Disease transmission; Energy code; Energy use; Far North; Future directions; Health effects; Housing affordability; Indoor air; Indoor air quality; Infectious disease; New study; Outdoor air pollution; Population health; Public buildings; Relative risks; Residential homes; Respiratory disease; Vehicle traffic; Ventilation rate; Building codes; Energy conservation; Health; Housing; Indoor air pollution; Public works; Pulmonary diseases; Sustainable development; Systems analysis; Vehicle transmissions; Ventilation; Ventilation codes; Waste heat; Health risks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863173796

Heavy hybrid propulsion system configurations range from partially hybridized, parallel architectures to full series hybrid electric power trains using battery only, ultracapacitor only or in combination. The opportunity to downsize bus power plants through proper sizing of the electric propulsion components facilitates significantly reduced emissions, particularly NOx and PM, and fuel economy gains on the order of 30% and higher. This paper surveys the developments in ultracapacitor only propulsion systems with the goal of categorizing energy storage system performance attributes. Of particular interest in this assessment: energy storage system state-of-charge (SOC) window, energy throughput, turnaround efficiency, cycling behavior and electrical and thermal stress levels.

To reduce the number of tests, a model with a very short computational time to simulate the engine in the whole operating range is needed; therefore the goal of this study is to provide the engine manufacturers with a simple physical combustion model to assist engine tuning and engine management system optimization, with the aim of predicting in-cylinder pressure evolutions and mean effective pressure (IMEP).

Following drainage, the developing tree stand influences methane (CH4) emissions by altering plant and microbial communities through water-level drawdown, competition for nutrients and shading. Therefore there should be a close correlation between tree stand volume and CH4 fluxes in drained peatlands. We used previously published material along with data collected in this research programme to assess the potential of tree stand volume as a tool for estimating CH4 fluxes for drained peatland forests, and to quantify this relationship under conditions prevailing in Finland. There was a clear negative exponential relationship between tree stand volumes and CH4 emissions. Sites with small stand volume emitted CH4 after drainage (up to 4 g CH4 m-2 a -1), while larger stands consumed it (up to 1 g CH4 m -2 a-1); the turning point from source to sink was about 140 m3 ha-1. Similar relationships were also found for undrained mires, although not as clearly as for the drained sites. Since drained peatland forests in Finland are generally rather young in drainage age and small in stand volumes, they are still estimated to emit CH4 to the atmosphere, although the rate has substantially decreased after drainage.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249014021

The evaluation showed reductions in air pollutants, mainly PM10, which would help avert a number of disease events and deaths, as estimated through dose-response functions of epidemiological studies on respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Valuation of the impacts using an environmental cost-benefit analysis considered operational installation, job generation, potential carbon credits, and health costs, with an overall positive balance of US$ 2.851 million. Adding the estimated qualitative benefits to the quantitative ones, the project's benefits far outweigh the measured costs.

Suitable use of natural light as an important factor in sustainability must always be considered in the design process. The Building form and aperture type are the most influential factors that affect interior conditions, energy consumption and energy cost in the buildings. Although there are many lighting experts, sustainability and urban designers, few of them are professional in the field that bridges the gap between these disciplines. So, I decided to conduct a research on the subject assessing the effect of exterior space on interior conditions. All the proposals I will introduce in this paper originated from simultaneously using my experience in light and daylight design and my knowledge as an architect in the field of urban and landscape design. The method I applied in this paper is trial and error that it is an empirical method for achieving defined goals. In this paper, simple forms and materials will be proposed for reducing illuminance in a 25 m2 room in the summer, in Tehran. And then, its effects in the winter are analyzed. All in all, the main goal of this paper is introducing a method that can be used in designing sustainable buildings, spaces and even cities. We can apply similar methods in sustainable urban and regional design to reach a greener world with a healthier environment. © 2007 WIT Press.","Day light; Exterior material; Interior illuminance; Landscape; Reflectance; Sustainability","architectural design; energy use; landscape planning; reflectance; sustainability; urban design; Asia; Eurasia; Iran; Middle East; Tehran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148955808

Tasna, cv. Arapsaci, and cv. Yedikule) from different commercial fields near Adana, Eastern Mediterranean Region of Turkey, had symptoms similar to those caused by Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. vitians (Xav) (Brown) Dye. Leaves of the infected plants were water-soaked, black and with angular lesions. When the lesions coalesced, defoliation of older leaves and large necrotic areas were observed. Nearly all plants in a 100 decares-field were infected. Disease incidence was approximately 100%. The dead area was papery in texture. Heavily affected lettuce plants were unmarketable. Bacteria consistently isolated from leaf spots formed mucoid and yellow colored colonies on yeast dextrose calcium carbonate agar (YDC). Eleven bacterial strains were purified and used for further studies. The strains were gram negative, oxidase negative and catalase positive. Fatty acid analysis identified the strains as Xav with similarity indices of 71 to 89 %. A reference strain of Xav (LMG 938) and all test strains reacted positively with Xanthomonas-specific monoclonal antibodies X1, X11, Xv 5, 6, 8 and 10, but not with MAbs Xv1, 15, 21, 30 in indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Pathogenicity of the strains was confirmed on 4 week-old lettuce plants (cv. Yedikule) by spray inoculating with 108 cfu/ml suspension of bacteria. Saline was used as negative controls. Inoculated plants and water-sprayed controls were covered with polyethylene bags for 24 hours in a climate room at 25oC, 70% relative humidity and 16-hour per day light period. Bags were removed and plants maintained in the climate room to observe symptoms. Bacterial leaf spots developed on inoculated plants in seven days, and leaf lesions similar to those observed in the fields. No symptoms developed on negative control plants. The bacterium was re-isolated from the inoculated plants and characterized as identical to the reference strain.

Recently, we have clearly demonstrated the generation of 1O2 in the reaction of lipid hydroperoxides with biologically important oxidants such as metal ions, peroxynitrite and hypochlorous acid. The approach used to unequivocally demonstrate the generation of 1O2 in these reactions was the use of an isotopic labeled hydroperoxide, the 18O-labeled linoleic acid hydroperoxide, the detection of labeled compounds by HPLC coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and the direct spectroscopic detection and characterization of 1O2 light emission. Using this approach we have observed the formation of 18O-labeled 1O2 by chemical trapping of 1O2 with anthracene derivatives and detection of the corresponding labeled endoperoxide by HPLC-MS/MS. The generation of 1O2 was also demonstrated by direct spectral characterization of 1O2 monomol light emission in the near-infrared region (λ = 1270 nm). In summary, our studies demonstrated that LOOH can originate 1O2. The experimental evidences indicate that 1O2 is generated at a yield close to 10% by the Russell mechanism, where a linear tetraoxide intermediate is formed in the combination of two peroxyl radicals. In addition to LOOH, other biological hydroperoxides, including hydroperoxides formed in proteins and nucleic acids, may also participate in reactions leading to the generation 1O2. This hypothesis is currently being investigated in our laboratory. © 2007 IUBMB.","18O-labeled oxygen; DNA hydroperoxides; Lipid hydroperoxides; Mass spectrometry; Near-infrared emission; Protein hydroperoxides; Singlet molecular oxygen","endoperoxide; hydroperoxide derivative; linoleic acid hydroperoxide; lipid hydroperoxide; nucleic acid; oxygen 18; protein; singlet oxygen; unclassified drug; chemical reaction; conference paper; high performance liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; near infrared spectroscopy; tandem mass spectrometry; Cell Membrane; DNA; Hydrogen Peroxide; Lipid Peroxides; Molecular Structure; Oxidants; Proteins; Singlet Oxygen",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248586577

The statistical properties of polarized emission hold information about the structure of magnetic fields in a large range of scales, but the contributions of different stages of data processing to the statistical properties should first be understood. We use 1.4 GHz polarization data from the Effelsberg 100-m telescope of emission in the Galactic plane, near the plane and far out of the plane. We analyze the probability distribution function and the wavelet spectrum of the original maps in Stokes parameters Q, U and corresponding PI. Then we apply absolute calibration (i.e. adding the large-scale emission to the maps in Q and U), subtraction of polarized sources and subtraction of the positive bias in PI due to noise (""denoising""). We show how each procedure affects the statistical properties of the data. We find a complex behavior of the statistical properties for the different regions analyzed which depends largely on the intensity level of polarized emission. Absolute calibration changes the morphology of the polarized structures. The statistical properties change in a complex way: Compact sources in the field flatten the wavelet spectrum over a substantial range. Adding large-scale emission does not change the spectral slopes in Q and U at small scales, but changes the PI spectrum in a complex way. ""Denoising"" significantly changes the p.d.f. of PI and raises the entire spectrum. The final spectra are flat in the Galactic plane due to magnetic structures in the ISM, but steeper at high Galactic latitude and in the anticenter. For a reliable study of the statistical properties of magnetic fields and turbulence in the ISM based on radio polarization observations, absolute calibration and source subtraction are required. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It has operated nominally and continues to return remarkable data relating to the thermal structure, chemical composition, and energy balance of the upper atmosphere. In 2006 NASA approved four more years of operation of SABER and the TIMED mission on which it flies. The SABER instrument measures temperature, pressure, ozone (two separate methods), carbon dioxide, water vapor, the Meinel hydroxyl emissions, the oxygen singlet airglow, and emission from nitric oxide. The wavelength span is from 1.27 to 17 micrometers. The altitude span is from 10 to 325 km, channel dependent. SABER has already provided unique data on the response of the upper atmosphere to solar and geomagnetic storms. The temperature data have been validated by a number of ground-based and in-situ or lidar data. Comparisons of ozone continue to be carried out against the state-of-the art photochemical models. Work is underway to use SABER data to evaluate the complete thermal, chemical, and radiative energy budget of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. In this paper we will take a look at emerging science issues to be addressed with this unique data set in the upcoming years. Already the SABER data are revealing the effects of the solar cycle on the heat balance of the thermosphere.

This paper describes recent (12-18 months in most cases) public policy tools that have been enacted in California to address the inter-linked public policy problems of the need to reduce greenhouse gases, air pollution, and petroleum dependence. These are primarily new State statutes and legislation, and new regulations. These may serve as models for other states (or other levels of government) to adopt in their own jurisdictions. These policy initiatives provide concrete opportunities for electric transportation and goods movement technologies, since these technologies provide greater benefits in these three policy arenas than most other alternatives. Industries that produce both on-road and non-road electric transportation and goods movement technologies should take advantage of the opportunities provided by these California initiatives. This paper describes eight recent California initiatives related to electric transportation and goods movement technologies: 1. AB 32: California Global Warming Solutions Act. 2. California Low Carbon Fuel Standard. 3. ""Green Ports"" Regulation. 4. Funding for Green Goods Movement - Prop 1B and SB 88 5. AB 118: Funding Source for Alternative Fuels and Vehicles. 6.

The experiments show that the presence of CO2 and a lower O2 concentration increase the ignition delay time but have no measurable effect on the time required to complete volatile combustion, once initiated. For the ignition process observed in the experiments, the CO 2 results are explained by its higher molar specific heat and the O2 results are explained by the effect of O2 concentration on the local mixture reactivity.

This could be assumed as an ideal win-win situation, but the reverse site of the medal is that the production of high-level nuclear waste outweighs this advantage.

The AAFC Program on Energy Cogeneration from Agricultural and Municipal Wastes was aimed at mitigation of greenhouse gases. Four projects were supported to help establish farm-scale demonstration plants for anaerobic digestion of hog and beef cattle manure to produce biogas for energy cogeneration, and concentration of nutrients in digested manure. A fifth project was supported for gasification of agricultural waste straw and sorted municipal wastes. The technical, economic, energy, and environmental benefits derived from the projects resulting from the collaborative efforts of industry, academia, and regional, provincial and federal government are discussed along with the feedback received from the project proponents on project implementation. For longterm sustainability of renewable energy projects, it is very important that the governments provide incentives in the form of tax subsidies, guaranteed low cost loans, and/or guaranteed minimum prices for ""green"" energy because a considerable capital investment is required to set up such facilities. Incentives comparable to those received by fossil fuel industry should be available to build plants that utilize agricultural and municipal wastes for energy generation. Without such incentives, further development and adoption of the technology would be delayed. With the recent government initiatives in support of renewable energy in both Canada and the U.S., the future looks very promising.","Agricultural straw gasification; Anaerobic digestion; Animal manure; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Renewable energy","Anaerobic digestion; Animals; Electric power generation; Emission control; Gasification; Greenhouse gases; Manures; Project management; Straw; Agricultural straw gasification; Energy cogeneration; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35649021642

For this purpose, titanium nitride was deposited on Si(100) substrates by reactive sputtering and the influence of low-energy carbon ion bombardment on the secondary electron emission yield of TiN:O coatings was studied. The composition and chemical bonds formed in the films after carbon ion implantation were analyzed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). XPS revealed the formation of both carbidic and graphitic bonds. N was displaced while Ti-C bonds were formed up to a limiting value of 0.103 for the carbidic carbon atomic fraction, beyond which a graphitic surface layer was deposited. The secondary electron emission yields for TiN:O were measured before and after low-energy CH n+ ion bombardment and air exposure, and after heating. Initially, the carbon ion implantation reduced the secondary electron emission yield. Then an increase in secondary electron emission was obtained when the excess graphitic carbon was deposited on the sample. On the other hand, subsequent thermal treatment at 700 °C of the carburized samples produced a further reduction of the secondary electron emission yield. The maximum yields are about 53% lower for thermal annealed films than for similarly treated previously measured as-deposited layers. A narrowing of XPS peak line shapes is observed as a consequence of the annealing away of structural and chemical defects in the near-surface region. In addition, secondary electron emission (SEE) yield curves were used in a simulation of multipactor discharge. Both experimental multipactor threshold tests and computer multipactor simulations indicate that SEE yield values for low primary-electron energies are the most influencing parameters on multipactor threshold. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.",,"Carbon; Chemical bonds; Deposition; Ion bombardment; Ion implantation; Reactive sputtering; Secondary emission; Titanium nitride; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Air exposure; Carbidic bonds; Carbon ions; Graphitic bonds; Thin films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250624530

For example, photochemical air quality models are playing an increasingly role because of their ability to integrate meteorology and atmospheric chemistry to evaluate the impacts of emissions changes. Such tools allow the analyst to conduct ""what if scenarios, but are highly resource intensive thus limiting ability to explore alternatives. An approach is needed that enables the rapid assessment of the impacts of different policy decisions and provides insights into the sensitivities of complex models. Response surface meta-modeling provides one solution to this problem. In this approach, a policy space of interest (such emission type) is defined and sampled according to a design of experiments methodology. The response surface meta-models fit to this data can be used to very quickly provide highly accurate estimates of the simulation model's response to changes in the policy space. This paper details the response surface meta-modeling approach and presents visualization software (Visual Policy Analyzer) developed by the authors, which enables analysts using commodity computers to interact with the meta-model in real time. Specifically the VPA has slider bar controls for each factor (e.g., emission type) in the policy space. The analyst moves slider bars to indicate the change from baseline levels and changes to the response surface are visually displayed. Response thresholds can be set to explore ways to meet goals. A case study will be presented using a meta-model of the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx)1 to explore the spatial response of ozone metrics to changes in emission levels of NOx and VOC from different source and region. The meta-model is calculated over a grid of about 34,000 grid cells with essentially real-time response on a laptop computer.

The rhizosphere includes plant roots and the surrounding soil that is influenced by plant roots. The carbon flux in the rhizosphere helps to support the rhizosphere food web function aimed to describe it in mathematical form. The exudates and sloughed root cells provide carbon for bacteria and fungi, which in turn immobilize nitrogen and phosphorous. The mathematical depictions of the food webs within the rhizosphere presented are based on the three types of food web descriptions presented by connectedness, energy flow, and interaction. Connectedness descriptions are based on observations of the species that are present and their feeding behaviors. The rhizosphere food web of the North American shortgrass steppe is described. The connectedness and energy flux descriptions reveal two patterns in the distribution of energy, nutrients, and biomass within the system. The relative dominance of the root, bacterial, and fungal energy channels is important to key processes and stability. The trophic interactions within the rhizosphere, particularly symbiotic mutualisms, affect plant growth and community structure aboveground. The empirical evidence on mutualism, coupled with the earlier discussion of nutrient enrichment afforded by the trophic interactions within the energy channels, illustrates clear connections among soil biota, plant growth, and community structure. Rhizosphere is best studied as a group of subwebs not only operating in concert but also possessing quasi-independent tendencies. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Large amounts of investment will be needed in the coming decades to meet the increase in demand for both the quantity and quality of electricity services, as well as to maintain and replace existing infrastructure that will be retired. Just how much investment will be needed and how much will actually be forthcoming will depend on a range of factors, including macroeconomic and population trends, prices, government policies, technology, and availability of capital. In a Reference Scenario, in which no new government policies are assumed, global electricity demand is projected to grow at an average annual rate of 2.5% through to 2030. The world consumes twice as much electricity in 2030 as it does today. Developing countries account for much of the increase in global demand, their electricity use more than tripling by 2030. OECD electricity consumption grows less rapidly. Even so, in 2030 the 1.3 billion people in the OECD area still consume more electricity than the 6.5 billion people in the developing world. Moreover, some 1.4 billion in the developing regions still lack any access to electricity - A mere 200 million less than today. Total cumulative electricity investment needs worldwide in the Reference Scenario amount to close to USD 10 trillion in year-2000 dollars over 2003-2030, equal to about USD 350 billion per year. More than half of this investment goes to transmission and distribution, with distribution taking the lion's share of overall network investment. Developing countries account for more than half of world electricity investment needs. China's needs will be the largest, exceeding USD 2 trillion. New investment is also substantial in North America and Europe. Attracting all this investment in a timely manner - especially in developing countries - may not be easy. In an Alternative Policy Scenario, which considers the impact of new government policies to curb demand growth and promote switching to cleaner fuels, world electricity demand and investment needs grow less rapidly in almost every region. World demand grows by 0.5 percentage points more slowly than in the Reference Scenario as a result of end-use energy-efficiency improvements. Total cumulative investment needs over 2003-30, at USD 8.3 trillion, are USD 1.5 trillion - or 16% - lower. Lower supply capacity requirements more than outweigh the higher capital costs in power generation that result from switching to nuclear power, renewables and distributed generation. Investment needs will be driven by demand growth. But it is not certain that all of the investment needed will be forthcoming whatever the rate of demand growth, such that some part of demand might go unmet. The main uncertainties surrounding the adequacy of electricity investment worldwide relate to the impact of market reforms, environmental constraints and access to capital. In general, the effects of the first two on investment are most uncertain in OECD countries. Policy makers are seeking to address concerns about the adequacy and timeliness of investment in both capacity and systems to ensure system reliability and an adequate quality of service in those countries by establishing a market framework that sends efficient market signals to investors. Access to capital - A minor issue in the OECD - is perhaps the biggest uncertainty facing non-OECD countries, especially those in developing regions. They are increasingly looking to the private sector to fund at least part of the investment needed to finance electricity projects, mainly because of constraints on public funding. Yet, obtaining sufficient private sector capital in many cases will be difficult, due to poorly developed local financial markets and an unfavourable regulatory and investment climate.

For lean-burn diesel engines, since it is not possible to use three-way catalytic converters, reducing NOX emissions is a difficult technical challenge. To respond to these strict regulations, an exhaust gas aftertreatment system was developed, featuring a lean NOX catalyst (LNC) that uses a new chemical reaction mechanism to reduce NOX. The feature of the new LNC is the way it reduces NOX through an NH3-selective catalytic reduction (SCR), in which NOX adsorbed in the lean mixture condition is converted to NH3 in the rich mixture condition and reduced in the following lean mixture condition. Thus, the new system allows more efficient reduction of NOX than its conventional counterparts. However, an appropriate switching control between lean and rich mixture conditions along with compensation for catalyst deterioration was necessary. As a result, this study established a method of regulating the supply of reductant to the catalyst by monitoring the air-fuel ratio of exhaust gases and the amount of intake air, and simultaneously realized a lower fuel penalty and emission cleanliness.

In this paper we suggest several important policy, planning, and management changes that should be made, regardless of the many uncertainties in predicting future fire regimes. Similar to how other natural hazards are addressed, a risk-based framework for fire-related decisions is crucial. Reintroduction of fire to fire-prone ecosystems, careful use of fire surrogates, and creation of new and flexible policies will be needed for successful ecosystem management. Growing incompatibilities between urban development and wildfire also require a serious reevaluation of urban planning and building in fire-prone locations to reach a sustainable coexistence with fire. Our future cities and communities must be less susceptible to wildfire damage, and the ecosystems upon which we depend must be made more resilient to further disruptions in fire regimes. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2007.",,"Ecosystem management; Fire regimes; Fire surrogates; Future climate; Natural hazard; Risk-based; Urban development; Wildfire damages; Ecosystems; Greenhouse gases; Urban growth; Fires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58849104546

Planning maintenance to minimise the down-time of the plant is a key cost factor. It is important to have the latest data as to the age and state of the components and parts at the time of plant shut down. Indeed, deciding on the best time to shut down the plant for maintenance can depend upon trends in these data. For steam pipes, the required ageing information is the creep strain rate. These creep strain data obtained at shut down provide key information as to the needed replacement of pipes to maintain reliable plant operation.

In this work, a screening life cycle assessment approach is applied to seven different incinerators, to compare the different plant technologies and identify the most relevant environmental impacts and processes. The characterization method used in the life cycle impact assessment step is Eco-indicator 99. The functional unit is 1 ton of waste input. As a first result, it can be noted that while the combustion systems are rather similar, the main variables are ascribable to gas cleaning options and efficiency in energy recovery, which result in quite different environmental performances. Among heavy metals, particular attention must be paid to Cd and As, due to their high toxicity, despite their low quantities. The impact due to dioxin emission is orders of magnitude lower than other contaminants (e.g., heavy metals). Furthermore, a catalytic system could be useful for a complete removal of organic contaminants and for a more effective abatement of nitrogen oxides.

To date, the method has been used to monitor the stratigraphy during drilling of horizontal wells in three fields on the UK continental shelf (Clair, Ross and Hannay), and in several cases heavy mineral data have been integral in deciding to amend well bore trajectories in order to remain within hydrocarbon-bearing zones, a process known as 'geosteering'. Heavy mineral analysis now has a positive track record for geosteering horizontal wells in a variety of depositional environments, from fluvial/aeolian to shallow and deep marine, and can therefore be genuinely considered as an alternative geosteering tool in circumstances where biostratigraphic methods have inadequate resolution. Heavy mineral data have been used in the decision-making process in a variety of situations, including whether to maintain angle, to steer up or to steer down, to sidetrack and to terminate drilling. Application of heavy mineral analysis at the well site requires establishment of a robust correlation scheme prior to drilling horizontal wells, using samples from offset wells adjacent to the proposed well track. Parameters used to monitor the geology during horizontal drilling include those conventionally used for reservoir correlation (principally, ratios of stable minerals with similar hydrodynamic behaviour), but other parameters have also proved useful in the particular circumstance associated with individual fields. For example, the abundance of unstable minerals is locally useful in the Clair Field, and ratios of minerals with contrasting hydrodynamic behaviour are useful in the Ross and Hannay Fields. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We report successful application of SOURCE software by MEBS, Ltd. to modeling these cathodes' emission. .LaB6 cathode is used in shaped-beam lithography tools, such as mask writers. Typically, LaB6 crystal is ground into 60 or 90-deg truncated cone shape with flat tip diameter of 30....70 μm (Fig. 1). (Figure Presented) In some cases, LaB6 cone is coated with anti-emission material(s), with only flat tip capable of emission. Computing thermionic emission in these cases poses a challenge, which is answered by SOURCE set of programs by MEBS, Ltd. When SOURCE computes emission, it does the following: - takes in work function, temperature, geometry, computes local E-fields, - based on outcome, it runs 3 emission models - Child-Langmuir formula for thermionic emission, extended Schottky formula for hot field emission, and Fowler-Nordheim formula for cold field emission, - chooses emission type with highest emission current density value, Jo, - finally, computes current density Js with Richardson-Duschman formula, and takes the smallest one between Jo and Js as the final emission current density. This algorithm allows for flexibility in dealing with sharp-cone, small-tip cathodes (Schottky boost), and with limited-emission area cathodes, where center and edge of emitting area exhibit different emission modes. SOURCE also works with emitters having non-uniform workfunction and temperature distributions. Besides emission, SOURCE computes gun optical parameters (cross-over size and location, beam divergence, brightness, aberrations) and allows to include a magnetic lens in the gun model. We have successfully applied SOURCE to modeling of various LaB6-based guns used in e-beam mask writers.

The gases corresponding to temperatures of 20-80 K and ≥ 80 K contain 75% and 25% of the total NH3 flux, respectively. These temperatures indicate that the dense molecular gas in the CMZ is dominated by gas that is warmer than the majority of the dust present there. A comparison of our observations with a CO survey by Sawada et al. (2001, ApJS, 136,189) shows that the NH3 emitting region is surrounded by a high-pressure region on the longitude-velocity (l-v) plane. Although NH3 emission traces dense gas, it does not extend over a high-pressure region. Therefore, the high-pressure region is less dense and has to be hotter. This indicates that the molecular-cloud complex in the Galactic center region has a ""core"" of dense and warm clouds that are traced by the NH3 emission, and an ""envelope"" of less-dense and hotter gas clouds. Besides heating by ambipolar diffusion, the hot plasma gas emitting the X-ray emission may heat the hot ""envelope"". © 2007.

However, further developments in this exciting area of science are unfortunately limited by the difficulties in obtaining high-resolution structural details of these molecules. For example, it is essential to understand the atomistic-level three-dimensional structure of a liquid crystalline molecule in order to understand its properties, which make them functional, such as the three-dimensional order/disorder, intermolecular packing/interactions and dynamics in different phases. Therefore, there is considerable current interest in determining high-resolution structures of functionally important liquid crystalline materials. While there are a number of physical techniques that have been used to obtain low-resolution structures, NMR spectroscopy has been the most powerful technique in providing atomistic-level resolution structures [1-3]. It is possible to obtain such high-resolution structures using X-ray crystallography if a high quality single crystal of the system can be obtained. However, it is extremely difficult to obtain single crystals of most functional molecules particularly in the most interesting nematic phase. Structures obtained in a crystalline phase of a material need not be useful to understand the molecular behavior in its nematic phase. In addition, crystal structures do not provide molecular dynamics information. Similarly, structures solved from solution samples of these materials using NMR experiments are also of limited use. Fortunately, solid-state NMR spectroscopy is capable of providing high-resolution molecular structure, dynamics, order/disorder and geometry in all non-isotropic phases (including crystalline, smectic, nematic and amorphous) of liquid crystalline materials even in a mixed state [3]. NMR spectral lines of non-isotropic solids are broader than that of isotropic solutions. The line broadening is mainly due to anisotropic chemical shift, dipoledipole and quadrupole (only for nuclei with spins ≥ 1) interactions [2, 4]. These interactions can be suppressed by performing magic angle spinning (MAS) [5, 6] experiments to provide ?esolution-like?f narrow spectral lines but without denaturing the sample [2, 4]. Multiple radio frequency pulses can also be used to suppress the dipole-dipole interaction [2, 4, 7]. In addition, spectral resolution can be enhanced by the detection of dilute nuclei like 13C instead of protons. However, this approach reduces the sensitivity of the experiment as 13C is a less sensitive nucleus as compared to 1H. To enhance the sensitivity, a cross-polarization (CP) experiment is performed to transfer the proton magnetization to 13C via 1H-13C dipolar interaction [8, 9]. A combination of CP and MAS are routinely used to record 13C chemical shift spectra of TLCs by decoupling protons. The isotropic chemical shift values obtained from high-resolution spectra are useful to identify the chemical groups in a compound and to further characterize its physicochemical properties [10.13]. We briefly mention about a recent solid-state NMR study on columnar mesophases of octa-alkyloxy tetrabenzo-orthocyclophanes (TBC) to show the usefulness of CPMAS applications [14]. Unlike most discotic mesognes, TBCs consists of a molecular core that is not flat and not even rigid and therefore it can acquire several flexible conformations as shown in Figure 3-1. The orthocyclophane core exists in a sofa conformation with the molecules stacked on top of each other to form columns. This study utilized 13C and 2H NMR experiments to characterize the reorientation of pseudorotation/rotation within the core of two homologs, namely TBC-9 and TBC-12. TBC-9 exhibits a single rectangular mesophase (Dr) while TBC-12 exhibits a low temperature Dr and a high temperature hexagonal columnar phase (Dh). Carbon-13 CPMAS spectra of solid and columnar phases of TBC-9 and TBC-12 obtained at various temperatures are given in Figure 3-2. The chemical shift frequencies and line shapes of the spectral lines are different for different phases. While the spectra of both compounds in the solid phase are similar, the spectral lines of TBC-12 are relatively less revolved. Unlike the spectra of other columnar mesogens where the motion in the mesophase significantly narrows the spectral lines, the spectral lines of TBCs are narrower for the solid phase than that of columnar phases due to the inhomogenous stacking of molecules in the columnar phase. The spectra consist of peaks from aromatic,-methylene and other aliphatic carbons. The spectra of solid phases in the aromatic region confirm the presence of a single sofa conformation. The mesophase spectra are consistent with a single sofa conformer that undergoes a slow pseudorotation in the NMR timescale. Use of higher magnetic fields (like 900 MHz) also enhances the sensitivity and resolution of an NMR experiment [15]. On the other hand, the chemical shift anisotropy (CSA) span increases with the magnetic field strength and therefore the sample has to be spun faster at the magic angle to suppress the line broadening CSA interaction. While spinning speeds up to 20 kHz are commonly used to obtain 13C CPMAS spectra of TLCs, it is now possible to spin the sample as fast as 75 kHz. Even though the suppression of line broadening interactions is essential for routine studies, CSA and dipolar or quadrupolar couplings are useful to understand chemical bonding, dynamics, order and geometry of molecules in solids. Studies have shown that multidimensional MAS techniques can be used to obtain high-resolution spectra that contain 'solution-like' spectra (constituting isotropic chemical shifts and scalar couplings) in one frequency dimension and 'solid-like' spectra (constituting CSA, dipolar or quadrupolar couplings) in other dimensions [16-19]. The measurement and analysis of these anisotropic interactions provides a wealth of information about TLCs [20]. Another approach to obtain high-resolution spectra of TLCs is to uniformly align the molecules in the magnetic field and use a CP experiment to record the chemical shift spectrum of S (less sensitive nucleus like 13C) spins by decoupling I (high sensitive nucleus like 1H) spins. Since TLC molecules in the nematic phase spontaneously align in the presence of an external magnetic field, high-resolution spectra can be obtained even though the phase of the material is not isotropic. This unique feature enables the measurement of NMR parameters like chemical shift, quadrupolar coupling and dipolar coupling, which can be used to determine the structure, order, dynamics and geometry of molecules in the nematic phase. However, overlap of these anisotropic interactions could lower the resolution of a 1D chemical shift spectrum; on the other hand, multidimensional experiments on a magnetically aligned static sample can be used to resolve the overlapping spectral lines as discussed below. For example, obtaining a high-resolution 13C chemical shift spectrum of a fluorinated compound is difficult without the use of simultaneous 1H and 19F decoupling, which is a technically demanding approach. C-F interactions lead to broadening of 13C spectral lines and therefore limit the measurement of C-F couplings. A recent study investigated the effects of 13C-19F dipolar couplings on the resolution of the 13C chemical shift spectrum of a fluorinated liquid crystalline compound in the nematic phase (Figure 3-3) [21]. This study demonstrated that using a suitable 1H decoupling pulse sequence it is possible to obtain high-resolution 13C chemical shift spectra and measure 13C-19F dipolar couplings in the nematic phase under static experimental condition. The efficacies of a CW (continuous wave), TPPM [22] and SPINAL [23] decoupling sequences were compared. As shown in Figure 3-3, SPINAL64 was found to provide superior resolution. Since C-F distances are known from the molecular structure, the measured C-F dipolar couplings and 13C chemical shifts can be used to determine the order parameters at each carbon site of the molecule in the nematic phase. Microscopic orders of liquid crystalline samples have been studied successfully using one-dimensional NMR experiments under static condition that provide 13C chemical shifts and quadrupole couplings in the 2H NMR spectra of 2H-labeled samples [24, 25]. It is also possible to perform experiments at various temperatures to characterize the dynamics of the system. The frequency, lineshape and relaxation are highly dependent on the phase of the sample. Multidimensional experiments on an aligned nematic phase sample can be used to measure these anisotropic interactions for various sites of a molecule, which can provide information on the relative orientations of chemical groups and therefore a high-resolution image of the entire molecule. Typically, 2H quadrupole coupling, 13C CSA, and 1H-13C dipolar couplings are used in such studies. However, in principle, 1H-1H dipolar couplings can also be used for a similar purpose. A direct analysis of a proton spectrum of a liquid crystalline sample, however, has been difficult, because the strongly coupled dipolar spin network causes splitting of individual proton resonances into complex multiplicities of resonance lines, resulting in a highly overlapped one-dimensional NMR spectrum. A successful analysis has usually been performed only after a reduction of the number of protons and a simplification of spin network by partial deuteration [26, 27]. © 2007 Springer.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889984317

As it can be blended in any proportion with mineral Diesel, and there are several reports which presented substantial reductions in emissions of unbumed hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulate in IC engines without reducing the output power significantly. The aim of this work was to perform an emissions and performance experimental analysis to evaluate and compare the use of Biodiesel obtained from different sources, Castor, Soy and Palm Oil, on a 30 kW regenerative gas micro turbine engine installed in the laboratories of the Federal University of Itajuba Unifei Brazil, at different power levels at steady state condition. All the fuels were characterized in terms of its viscosity and heat value, and the thermal performance and the emissions were measured. In all cases, it was performed a comparison between the obtained results with Biodiesel and Diesel. None of the fuels presented any problem related to atomization process in the related tests, and have shown no significant changes in performance of the microturbine reaching levels of around 26% of thermal efficiency. The minimum Heat Rate obtained at full load, was for the Biodiesel from Palm oil case, and the maximum was for Castor oil with a value 8.38% higher than when operated with Diesel In Addition, when measuring pollutants emissions in the exhaust gases, it was observed a slightly increment in CO and a reduction in NOx concentration.

Scenarios of future residential water demand account for population growth, climate change, housing type and demand side management, and compare these demands to licensed supply. Three case studies within the Okanagan Basin of British Columbia were chosen in order to assess regions of differing aridity, current water use, and community size: the Town of Oliver, City of Penticton and City of Kelowna water utility.

The supply and cost of oil, the ""hole"" in the ozone layer, and various forms of pollution have at times also caught the attention of legislators and government officials who shape our laws. The U.S. Department of the Interior was created in 1949, and the first federal clean air act was enacted in 1955. In 1970, President Nixon formed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the first celebration of Earth Day was April 22, 1970. States have also enacted various laws over the years in efforts to reduce pollution. In considering ways to achieve a cleaner environment, it is not uncommon for policymakers to use tax laws to encourage environmentally-friendly behavior as well as to discourage activities that harm the environment. Increased attention to climate change in the past few years has heightened attention on the need to change our practices that lead to greenhouse gas emissions. The tax law is frequently suggested and used as a tool for helping to change behavior and reach certain environmental goals. For example, tax credits are available for certain hybrid cars, favorable tax rules exist for the production of some biofuels, and a few countries, as well as Boulder, Colorado, impose a carbon tax to help address climate change concerns. This article focuses on tax provisions for encouraging sustainable, environmentally-friendly building practices, both residential and commercial. While the federal government and several states have energy-saving tax incentives for individuals, such as tax credits for installing solar energy devices in their homes, tax provisions applicable to builders is the focus of this article. The rationale for using the tax law for influencing environmental behavior is covered along with examples of some current federal and state tax rules pertinent to builders. Given the inherent complexity of taxation, there are many cautions to be exercised in pursuing the use of favorable tax provisions and these cautions are covered as well. Finally, this article explores what we might expect from legislators going forward as more state and local governments impose greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and the federal government considers its role in addressing climate change and energy sources.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953201626

Emissions were obtained by studying data about the main geometrical and flow features of the transport network in the area covered. Two mathematical models were integrated in the developed code, a flow and an emission model respectively. The flow simulation model determines, after a calibration according to the particular urban area in examination, the average vehicular speed on a single homogenous branch of a road network. So, when the average speed is fixed, it is possible to calculate the polluting emissions through the definition of an opportune emission model integrated in the code. The emission model is based on the CORINAIR methodology, implemented in the COPERTIII program (COmputer Programme to calculate Emissions from Road Transport) that, where necessary, has been modified according to experimental results, without distorting its basic philosophy. In conclusion, the calculation code allows for making choices in the transport field considering environmental sustainability aspects in the urban planning analysis, and it represents a good decision support system (DSS).","Air pollution; COPERT program; Corinair methodology; Decision support system; Duty vehicle; Emission factor; Emission model; Flow model; Urban road traffic","Decision support systems; Gas emissions; Ground vehicles; Particles (particulate matter); Street traffic control; Urban planning; COPERT program; Corinair methodology; Duty vehicles; Emission factor; Emission models; Flow models; Urban road traffic; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; conference proceeding; decision support system; road transport; traffic emission; urban area; urban planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849129979

In 2004, dry gas exports from the NCS totalled 77.7 billion scm1. The network is operated at very high pipeline pressure, up to 210 bar, and there are few booster stations along the way. Combined with the low ambient temperature, the high pressure provides the opportunity to store much gas in these long pipelines. A major challenge is to operate the pipelines at optimum inventory. This implies a delicate balance between high pressure and appurtenant high compressor energy consumption and environmental emissions versus lower pressure and the risk of loss in gas sales. A minimum quantity of gas is required in a pipeline for the initial pressurization of the system. The quantity is defined with an assumed pressure for each pipeline, and is known as linefill. Linepack is a quantity of gas in excess of linefill, which is necessary in order to make deliveries as requested and to provide operating tolerances, not least to cope with shutdowns upstream of the pipelines. A high linepack means higher pressure into the pipeline, but it also provides high flexibility and safety. In order to find the optimum inventory level, i.e. the total amount of gas in the pipeline, simulation in a pipeline simulation software and statistical analysis are used. For a given pipeline, the minimum inventory curve as a function of the steady state flow in the pipeline is found by the means of simulation. Historical flow rate values from the past two years are analyzed, and expected changes in the flow into and out of the pipeline are found by means of statistical analysis. On this basis, a recommended inventory curve is found for both the original and the increased capacity in the pipeline. The scope of the work is to increase energy efficiency and reduce environmental emissions by developing a recommended inventory level as a function of the flow in the pipeline. This paper reports on the analysis of one of the pipelines on the NCS. It describes the method used to analyze the flow/inventory level in the pipeline and the resulting recommended inventory curve. Furthermore the paper reports on experience from operation of the pipeline after implementation of the recommended curve.

Exhaust hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide can be removed with a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC). Although PCI normally utilizes a globally fuel-lean mixture, it is independent of equivalence ratio provided that local combustion temperatures are sufficiently low. A more fuel-rich PCI mode of operation could be useful in exhaust after-treatment strategies such as providing carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons for regeneration of a lean NO x trap (LNT). In a previous study, it was found that a rich PCI strategy deactivates a platinum-based DOC within seconds and may allow excessive harmful emissions to be passed into the environment. This study attempts to quantify the effects of different species representative of those found in rich PCI exhaust on a platinum-based DOC in a background of exhaust from an engine operating in a lean PCI regime. Excess carbon monoxide, propane, propylene, and methane were injected in varying concentrations while catalyst outlet temperature, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbon conversion were measured for a period of 200 s. Of the injected species, it is shown that propylene has the greatest deactivation effect on the catalyst followed by carbon monoxide, both in terms of time and concentration. Propane is found not to deactivate the catalyst even in very globally fuel-rich conditions whereas methane acts as an inert gas over the catalyst in the temperature range of interest. It is concluded from the study that high concentrations of carbon monoxide do not act alone in the poisoning process for the rich PCI condition. The presence of some partial oxidation products such as unsaturated hydrocarbons can also have an adverse effect on DOC performance. © IMechE 2007.","Carbon monoxide conversion; Catalyst deactivation; Diesel oxidation catalyst; Hydrocarbon conversion; Platinum; Premixed diesel combustion","Carbon monoxide; Catalyst deactivation; Hydrocarbon refining; Oxidation; Platinum; Carbon monoxide conversion; Diesel oxidation catalysts; Hydrocarbon conversion; Premixed diesel combustion; Diesel fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38449102746

Future UAV employment in the civilian areas of surveillance (pollution, natural risks prevention, fire prevention), monitoring (traffic control, environmental monitoring, earth observation) and communication relays becomes unavoidable. Many payload configurations may be used in UAV operations, but compared to systems working in other spectral regions (such as optical or infrared sensors), radar has the main advantage to be able to operate in all-weather condition. A concept of low-cost imaging Ka-Band radar is presented in this paper. This radar is integrated into under-wings pods that are fixed on a STEMME S10VT motorglider. This radar concept combines real aperture in the cross-track direction, by the antennas geometrical aperture, and synthetic aperture in the along-track direction, realized with the aircraft motion. Radar front-end uses FMCW technique which allows to reduce the power emission to a few Watts. In addition, the use of the millimeter band induces antennas size reduction, and makes possible the radar integration into pods. Thus, radar particularities are a low-size, a low-weight and a low-cost basis, making this radar suitable for future integration on board small vehicles, such as UAV. The radar definition and specifications will be detailed, together with the first results obtained on Fall 2006. Two ways of operating the radar will be presented: An application as vertical sounder, using horn antennas, and an application as SAR radar, using rectangular antennas. The two cases will be illustrated by samples of acquisitions results. The DRIVE radar has been developed and built to fly on board an UAV vehicle. Indeed, this radar is designed and will be used by ONERA as a UAV radar test bench. Current airplane used for testing applications is a STEMME S10-VT motorglider as the geometry of this airplane may be representative of a MALE UAV: wingspan is 23m large and weigh is about 900 kilograms.

Regional analysis of pasture dynamic patterns was conducted using highfrequency temporal satellite data and ancillary data to better understand pasture degradation under varied soil, environmental, and pasture management conditions in the state of Rondônia, Brazil. The 10-day normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) composite derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250-m resolution was used to characterize different grass phenological patterns for 32 counties in Rondônia between 2001 and 2003. Six pasture greenness classes showed that high greenness pasture classes dominated in young pastures, while low greenness pasture classes were least common. As pastures aged, the proportion of high greenness pasture classes decreased and the proportion of low greenness pastures increased, indicating a decrease in forage productivity over time in Rondônia. The magnitude of productivity decline depended on environmental constraints and land use systems. To refine this analysis, trajectories of pasture change were determined using spectral mixture analysis applied to Landsat time series data from 1988 to 2001 with the focus on two counties that show contrasting patterns of potential of grass production: Pimenteira, representing the ""degraded"" pasture category, and Governador Jorge Teixeira, as the ""productive"" pasture category. The results revealed a clear pasture degradation pattern in Pimenteira, related to low soil fertility and dry climate conditions, while Governador Jorge Teixeira, with better soil fertility and intermediate precipitation, did not show signs of pasture degradation through time.","MODIS; NDVI; Pasture greenness; Regional pasture analysis; Time series","Land use; Productivity; Radiometers; Regional planning; Soils; Time series; Time series analysis; Environmental constraints; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS; NDVI; Normalized difference vegetation index; Pasture greenness; Regional pasture analysis; Spectral mixture analysis; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67649504438

When calculating emissions from a dilution system, a correction is made to remove the effects of contaminants in the dilution air. The dilution air correction was explored to determine why this correction is needed, when this correction is important, and what methods are available for calculating the dilution factor (DF). An experimental and error analysis investigation into the standard and recently proposed methods for calculating the DF was conducted. Five steady state modes were run on a 1992 Detroit Diesel engine series 60 and the DF from eleven different equations were investigated. The effects of an inaccurate dilution air correction on calculated fuel flow from a carbon balance and the mass emissions was analyzed. The dilution air correction was shown to be important only for hydrocarbons, particulate matter (PM), and CO2. Only at idle was the dilution air correction of CO2 emissions significant. The propagation of error of the dilution factor by direct measurement of the exhaust flow and tunnel flow was found to have the lowest error. Fuel flow based on a carbon balance with no dilution air correction was shown to be the most accurate method (within 2.4% of the direct flow measurement) at high loads and the least accurate at idle.

Altogether seven vehicles were measured, two two-axle Euro 3 -class vehicles as references, three new two-axle Euro 4 -class vehicles and two new three-axle vehicles. The measurements were carried out on a chassis dynamometer, using three cycles describing actual driving. In addition to fuel consumption, exhaust emissions were also recorded for these vehicles. The differences in fuel consumption and operating expenses were after all smaller than first anticipated. In the case of the Euro 3 -class reference vehicles, the difference between the two vehicles was as high as 7.10%. For new two-axle vehicles the difference in fuel consumption, when simulating urban driving, is only 3.4%. Due to different technical solutions, the results were anticipated to be greater. In suburban driving although, the difference is at its most 11%. In the class of two-axle vehicles, lowest fuel consumption was measured for a SCR vehicle, whereas in the case of the two three-axle vehicles, EGR technology resulted in lowest fuel consumption. The measurements do not give an unambiguous answer to whether the EGR- or SCR-technology is preferable regarding fuel consumption. The contemplation is hindered by two factors. On one hand, the order of superiority depends on the driving cycle, on the other, the actual exhaust emissions do not match with expectations. The two EGR vehicles (same make) produced higher NOx -emissions than the manufacturer's Euro 3 -engine. The most fuel efficient SCR -engine is not truly Euro 4 -class what comes to NOx -emissions. Only two of the new vehicles, both with SCR technology, produce NOx -emissions genuinely matching their classes. Both fuel consumption and exhaust emissions have been observed in the study. In case exhaust emissions were completely disregarded, fleet decisions might be directed towards fuel efficient vehicles which after all do not reach the level of emission performance that reasonably could be expected.

In South Florida where major changes to the water resources infrastructure are being contemplated for facilitating the restoration of large-scale ecosystems such as the Kissimmee River Basin and the Everglades, consideration of climate variability on scales ranging from intra-seasonal to multi-decadal is extremely important in both water resources planning and regional operations. Correlations of hydro-climatology of South Florida to such global phenomena as El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation (AMO) have been investigated extensively. This paper provides an overview of the climatic indicators and the teleconnections that are significant for south Florida. In particular, the application of the research to develop regulation schedules for the operation of Lake Okeechobee as well as the real-time implementation of rules based on climate outlook are discussed.

The co-electrolysis process allows for direct electrochemical reduction of the steam - carbon dioxide gas mixture, yielding hydrogen and carbon monoxide, or syngas. The process model has been developed using the Honeywell UniSim systems analysis code. Using this code, a detailed process flow sheet has been defined that includes all the components that would be present in an actual plant such as pumps, compressors, heat exchangers, turbines, and the electrolyzer. Since the electrolyzer is not a standard UniSim component, a custom one-dimensional co-electrolysis model was developed for incorporation into the overall UniSim process flow sheet. The one dimensional co-electrolysis model assumes local chemical equilibrium among the four process-gas species via the gas shift reaction. The electrolyzer model allows for the determination of co-electrolysis outlet temperature, composition (anode and cathode sides); mean Nernst potential, operating voltage and electrolyzer power based on specified inlet gas flow rates, heat loss or gain, current density, and cell area-specific resistance. The one-dimensional electrolyzer model was validated by comparison with results obtained from a fully three dimensional computational fluid dynamics model developed using FLUENT, and by comparison to experimental data. This paper provides representative results obtained from the UniSim flow sheet model for a 300 MW co-electrolysis plant, coupled to a high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor. The coelectrolysis process, coupled to a nuclear reactor, provides a means of recycling carbon dioxide back into a useful liquid fuel. If the carbon dioxide source is based on biomass, the overall process, from production through utilization, would be climate neutral.",,"Biomass; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Carbon monoxide; Codes (symbols); Computational fluid dynamics; Coupled circuits; Dynamics; Electric generators; Electrochemistry; Electrolytic cells; Electrolytic reduction; Fluid dynamics; Gases; Heat resistance; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulic motors; Hydrogen; Liquid fuels; Metal casting; Nuclear energy; Nuclear propulsion; Nuclear reactors; One dimensional; Oxides; Paper sheeting; Phase equilibria; Process monitoring; Rate constants; Renewable energy resources; Systems analysis; Three dimensional; Carbon dioxide gasses; Carbon dioxide sources; Direct electrochemical reductions; Electrolysis plants; Electrolyzer; Experimental datums; Flow sheets; Gas shift reactions; Gas species; High temperatures; Honey wells; Inlet gasses; Largescale; Local chemical equilibriums; Nernst potentials; Operating voltages; Outlet temperatures; Parametric studies; Process flows; Process models; Specific resistances; Syn gasses; Three dimensional computational fluid dynamics; Electrolysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349130806

The two differing interpretations, conceptualized here as ‘outcome vulnerability’ and ‘contextual vulnerability’, are linked respectively to a scientific framing and a human-security framing. Each framing prioritizes the production of different types of knowledge, and emphasizes different types of policy responses to climate change. Nevertheless, studies are seldom explicit about the interpretation that they use. We present a diagnostic tool for distinguishing the two interpretations of vulnerability and use this tool to illustrate the practical consequences that interpretations of vulnerability have for climate change policy and responses in Mozambique. We argue that because the two interpretations are rooted in different discourses and differ fundamentally in their conceptualization of the character and causes of vulnerability, they cannot be integrated into one common framework. Instead, it should be recognized that the two interpretations represent complementary approaches to the climate change issue. We point out that the human-security framing of climate change has been far less visible in formal, international scientific and policy debates, and addressing this imbalance would broaden the scope of adaptation policies. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adaptation; Climate change; Mozambique; Vulnerability","climate change; environmental planning; environmental policy; local adaptation; policy strategy; vulnerability; Africa; Mozambique; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35348930415

During the course of the study, it became apparent that simultaneous environmental policies have created a fundamental ""catch 22"" situation for California's biogas industry. On one hand, California air quality regulations require distributed generation (DG) technologies to achieve aggressive emission limits for control of oxides of nitrogen (NOx). At the same time, California's Governor and Legislature have passed landmark legislation 2 calling for GHG emissions to be reduced by twenty-five percent to 1990 levels by no later than 2020. A ""catch 22"" occurs because while DG technologies, particularly biogas fueled technologies, can play a key role in reducing GHG emissions, NOx control technologies needed to meet the required NOx levels have not matured to commercial readiness. This requires project developers to take substantial risks on both the financial and technical front without the likelihood of recouping their investments. The result creates an impasse that potentially deprives California not only of forward progress in reducing GHG emissions but forestalls significant interim NOx reductions that could otherwise be achieved. However, the situation highlights a problem that extends beyond California's borders and the biogas industry: how to simultaneously achieve aggressive air quality targets while making significant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This paper presents the findings of an investigation into proposed NOx emissions limits for biogas to energy applications and how those requirements interact with policies to reduce GHG emissions.

REAS is the first inventory to integrate historical, present, and future emissions in Asia on the basis of a consistent methodology. We present here emissions in 2000, historical emissions for 1980-2003, and projected emissions for 2010 and 2020 of SO 2, NOx, CO, NMVOC, black carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC) from fuel combustion and industrial sources. Total energy consumption in Asia more than doubled between 1980 and 2003, causing a rapid growth in Asian emissions, by 28% for BC, 30% for OC, 64% for CO, 108% for NMVOC, 119% for SO2, and 176% for NOx. In particular, Chinese NO x emissions showed a marked increase of 280% over 1980 levels, and growth in emissions since 2000 has been extremely high. These increases in China were mainly caused by increases in coal combustion in the power plants and industrial sectors. NMVOC emissions also rapidly increased because of growth in the use of automobiles, solvents, and paints. By contrast, BC, OC, and CO emissions in China showed decreasing trends from 1996 to 2000 because of a reduction in the use of biofuels and coal in the domestic and industry sectors. However, since 2000, Chinese emissions of these species have begun to increase. Thus, the emissions of air pollutants in Asian countries (especially China) showed large temporal variations from 1980-2003. Future emissions in 2010 and 2020 in Asian countries were projected by emission scenarios and from emissions in 2000. For China, we developed three emission scenarios: PSC (policy success case), REF (reference case), and PFC (policy failure case). In the 2020 REF scenario, Asian total emissions of SO2, NOx, and NMVOC were projected to increase substantially by 22%, 44%, and 99%, respectively, over 2000 levels. The 2020 REF scenario showed a modest increase in CO (12%), a lesser increase in BC (1%), and a slight decrease in OC (-5%) compared with 2000 levels. However, it should be noted that Asian total emissions are strongly influenced by the emission scenarios for China.",,"anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548234228

In this study, we have carried out experiments in order to clarify the mechanism of the emission. The microwave is detected by heterodyne detection scheme at 22 and 2 GHz with an intermediate frequency bandwidth of 500 and 120 MHz, respectively. A nylon projectile is accelerated using a light-gas gun to impact a target. First, aluminum plates with ten different thicknesses ranging from 1 to 40 mm were used as a target, and microwave signals were detected. The experimental results are statistically analyzed assuming a Gaussian distribution of the emitted power. The standard deviation of pulse voltage is calculated to show the existence of two kinds of signals: sharp pulse and thermal noise. It is shown that the emitted energy and the dispersion have a relation with the extent of the target destruction. Next, nylon projectiles are impacted on different metals such as aluminum, iron, and copper. These results suggest that microcracks are essential to microwave emission. Finally, in order to clarify the mechanism of charging and discharging across the microcracks, the experimental results are compared with this model for the following factors: (1) the thermally excited electrons and the emitted power, and (2) the bond dissociation energy of target material and emitted power. The analytical results suggest that electrons are excited thermally and by transition from a crystalline state to an atomic state. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.",,"Aluminum; Bandwidth; Gaussian distribution; Heterodyning; Microcracks; Plates (structural components); Statistical methods; Gas gun; Hypervelocity; Microwave emission; Nylon projectile; Target plates; Electromagnetic wave emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547356058

The method is called Plasma-based Ion Implantation (PBII). Since mechanical objects commonly possess complex shapes, it may be difficult to coat DLC on them in a uniform manner. This non-uniformity in thickness has been studied in many papers, and it has been reported that it is improved by applying a pulse potential repeatedly to the coated material. A scratch test defined the local adhesion of DLC coated by PBII attached at several places to SUS304 thin plates in a trench-shaped cathode. It has been found that the adhesion increases in strength in the following order: the sides of the plates, the bottom of the groove in a trench, and the top of a trench.

This may interfere with microbial ferrous iron oxidation, which drives the oxidation of the target minerals. The kinetics of the oxidation process have been well studied for Leptospirillum and Acidithiobacillus species in tank systems. Although not directly comparable, kinetic parameters derived for tank systems do apply also for heap bioleach conditions. In the present study the effect of solution concentrations of Mg and Al as sulphate at individual concentrations of 0 to 10 g/L and combined concentrations 0 to 16 g/L each has been investigated in continuous culture using Leptospirillum ferriphilum. Increasing the concentrations of the salts increasingly depresses the rate of ferrous iron oxidation and also shifts the viable range more and more into the low potential region. Al significantly reduces the amount of carbon maintained in the reactor (assumed to be commensurate with biomass), whereas Mg actually enhances it at low concentrations. In both cases, however, the rate is always depressed.

The model is based on the light-use efficiency (LUE) concept, where NPP is calculated as a product of the amount of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) and a LUE-factor (ε) controlling the efficiency by which vegetation transforms photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) into biomass. The fractional APAR (FAPAR) is obtained by a linear transformation of 250 m normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Prior to the transformation, the NDVI time series were seasonally adjusted by fitting local asymmetric Gaussian curves to the data thereby minimizing cloud contamination and other noise factors such as BRDF-related variation. The APAR is then calculated as a product of FAPAR and incident PAR, where the latter is obtained from the ""Swedish Regional Climate Modelling Programme"" (SWECLIM). The LUE-factor is modeled as a daily function of temperature, latitude, and day of the year (DOY). The FAPAR dataset was validated against measurements of fractional intercepted PAR (FIPAR) that were carried out at Norunda experimental site in central Sweden (60°5′N, 17°29′E) between August and October, 2001. The calculated FAPAR time series are in good agreement with the measurements. The modeled NPP is evaluated against flux measurements carried out in Norunda 1997-1999. The determination coefficients obtained when comparing modeled with measured data are R 2 = 0.82 for 2000 (RMSE = 2.71 g C m -2 d -1 ), and R 2 = 0.68 for 2001 (RMSE = 3.57 g C m -2 d -1 ) (time series averaged every 10th day). © 2007.","FAPAR; Forest; LUE; MODIS; NPP; Scandinavia","Biomass; Data acquisition; Photosynthesis; FAPAR; LUE; MODIS; NPP; Forestry; Biomass; Data Processing; Forestry; Photosynthesis; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847313247

Within the United States of America (USA), the organization that sets regulations, coordinates an application for use, and provides authorization for federal government/agency use of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum is the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). In this regard, the NTIA defines which RF spectrum is available for federal government use in the USA, and how it Is to be used. The NTIA is a component of the United States (U.S.) Department of Commerce of the federal government. The significance of ITU regulations is that ITU approval is required for U.S. federal government/agency permission to use the RF spectrum outside of U.S. boundaries. All member nations have signed a treaty to do so. U.S. federal regulations for federal use of the RF spectrum are found in the Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management, and extracts of the manual are found in what is known as the Table of Frequency Allocations. Nonfederal government and private sector use of the RF spectrum within the U.S. is regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). There is a need to control ""unwanted emissions"" (defined to include out-of-band emissions, which are those immediately adjacent to the necessary and allocated bandwidth, plus spurious emissions) to preclude interference to all other authorized users. This paper discusses the causes, effects, and mitigation of unwanted RF emissions to systems in adjacent spectra. Digital modulations are widely used in today's satellite communications. Commercial communications sector standards are covered for the most part worldwide by Digital Video Broadcast - Satellite (DVB-S) and digital satellite news gathering (DSNG) evolutions and the second generation of DVB-S (DVB-S2) standard, developed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). In the USA, the Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC) has adopted Europe's DVB-S and DVB-S2 standards for satellite digital transmission. With today's digital modulations, RF spectral side lobes can extend out many times the modulating frequency on either side of the carrier at excessive power levels unless filtered. Higher-order digital modulations Include quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK), 8 PSK (8-ary phase shift keying), 16 APSK (also called 12-4 APSK (amplitude phase shift keying)), and 16 QAM (quadrature amplitude modulation); they are key for higher spectrum efficiency to enable higher data rate transmissions in limited available bandwidths. Nonlinear high-power amplifiers (HPAs) can regenerate frequency spectral side lobes on input-filtered digital modulations. The paper discusses technologies and techniques for controlling these spectral side lobes, such as the use of square root raised cosine (SRRC) filtering before or during the modulation process, HPA output power back-off (OPBO), and RF filters after the HPA. Spectral mask specifications are a common method of the NTIA and ITU to define spectral occupancy power limits. They are intended to reduce interference among RF spectrum users by limiting excessive radiation at frequencies beyond the regulatory allocated bandwidth. The focus here is on the communication systems of U.S. government satellites used for space research, space operations, Earth exploration satellite services (EESS), meteorological satellite services (METSATS), and other government services. The 8025 to 8400 megahertz (MHz) X band can be used to illustrate the ""unwanted emissions"" issue. 8025 to 8400 MHz abuts the 8400 to 8450 MHz band allocated by the NTIA and ITU to space research for space-to-Earth transmissions such as receiving very weak Deep Space Network signals.

Spatial aspects were assessed by conducting a survey of on-farm crop yields and using a computer model (QUEFTS) to predict maize yields from soil chemical indices. Temporal aspects were studied using time-series data (rainfall, temperature and crop yields). The study did not find a significant correlation between farmers' actual yields and QUEFTS predictions, and soil nutrients were thus not the only factors influencing maize yields in the study area. Other yield-reducing factors (climate and management) not accounted for in the QUEFTS model played a role. Grain yields of staple food crops were highly variable, fluctuating in time and space, and suboptimal. Particular aspects of rainfall (e.g. the short rains, for cowpeas and beans) were more important than mean annual rainfall in determining crop yields, and factors other than rainfall and soil fertility apparently played a role. The observed low grain yields, large yield gaps and high rainfall variability challenge the sustainability of these farming systems.

The program developed by the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection (NDEP) modifies the EPA ""Cap and Trade"" program described in the U.S. EPA CAMR. In addition, the Nevada CAMR Program will require electric power generation companies with coal-fired power plants to obtain a mercury operating permit to construct. Through the permitting process and beginning in 2010, NDEP will allocate annual mercury emission allowances to existing power plants based on projected actual emissions. Remaining annual allowances from the state budget will be maintained in a pool to be administered by NDEP. The pool will be used for new power plants, for incentive programs, and to support NDEP program needs or allowances that may be retired. The major objective of Nevada's CAMR Program is to encourage existing facilities to achieve EPA's New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for mercury, or better, and to encourage new facilities to go beyond the NSPS and install maximum achievable control technologies (MACT) or integrated gasification combined cycle technology (IGCC). The State will accomplish this objective by offering bonus emission allowances to new and existing facilities that install equipment or systems that reduce emissions to meet the NSPS. Bonus emission allowances will also be available to existing facilities that meet certain eligibility threshold levels spelled out in the NV CAMR. The Nevada regulation will affect new and existing coal-fired power plants in Nevada.

The ODH and POA reactions were generally first order in the hydrocarbon and zero to one half order in oxygen, while the competing combustion reactions were first order in both reactants. Experiments were performed in both a fixed bed reactor (FBR) and an inert membrane reactor (IMR), showing similar conversion. Selectivity to propylene and acrolein increased by 6 and 9%, respectively while decreasing the selectivity to CO2. These improvements in the selectivity supported the use of an IMR over a FBR for the ODH and POA reactions. The inclusion of a single IMR increased the selectivity toward acrolein and a dual-bed IMR further enhanced this effect. The dual bed IMR initially increased the selectivity to acrolein by 7%. The oxidation of isobutane to methacrolein through the intermediate isobutene follows similar kinetics to that of the propane to acrolein reaction network. Due to the similarity between these two reaction networks the methacrolein yield should be enhanced as in the case of acrolein in the partial oxidation of propane.

The pilot-scale CO2 sequestration experiment has been undertaken at the Nagaoka gas and oil field, in Niigata Prefecture, Japan and we conducted time-lapse cross-well seismic tomography to detect the spread of injected CO2. When super-critical CO2 spreads into porous media saturated with brine water, the seismic velocity always decreases, which is confirmed theoretically and experimentally. Therefore, CO2 flood area can be estimated from seismic tomography records before and after CO2 injection. However, the tomography records before and after CO2 injection include not only the variation due to CO2 flood, but also differences occurred from the location and property of sources and receivers and they result analysis errors. Thus, in this study, we applied the differential analysis to cross-well seismic tomography for reducing the difference due to measurement conditions and getting more accurate monitoring results. In the normal procedure, velocity differences are calculated after applying inversion processing to each record separately, but in this differential analysis, first forward modeling is applied using the velocity distribution inverted from one referential record, second the set of the first arrival time is obtained from the modeling result and finally the inversion processing is analyzed from the data set of the first arrival time added with the difference of travel-times from the referential record. In the result, we can have an analysis result in which the distribution of CO2 flooding is clearly identified along with a caprock under the inversion analysis with the constrained condition of no velocity enhancement. © 2007 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

Understanding the relationship between emissions and concentrations, and integrating meteorological data can be useful in developing strategies for reducing air toxic pollution. An evaluation of air toxics emissions and concentrations was conducted for two monitoring sites in the San Juan, Puerto Rico (PR) Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA) that participated in the 2005 Urban Air Toxics Monitoring Program (UATMP). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sponsors the UATMP to obtain air toxics measurements data to characterize the composition and magnitude of pollution across the United States. Air toxics monitoring data from the same sampling day were reviewed at these two sites to determine if there is a significant difference in concentrations from the upwind and downwind locations.

These reductases often show broad and overlapping substrate specificities and some well-characterized members, e.g., carbonyl reductase (CBR1) or NADPH-quinone reductase (NQO1) have protective roles toward xenobiotic carbonyls and quinones because metabolic reduction leads to less toxic products, which can be further metabolized and excreted.

Germencik, originally drilled for production in the mid-1980's, is now being fully developed with additional production and injection wells, and a 50 MW power plant. A 10-day flow test was completed to demonstrate that uninterrupted power generation could be accomplished with cost-effective scale inhibition. High total inorganic carbon concentrations of 2.0 wt.% CO 2 in the 200°-230°C single-phase reservoir liquid results in high flowing wellhead pressure and gas/steam ratio in the well bore, and CO 2 concentrations in high pressure steam of 20 wt.%. At power plant gathering system design pressures, scale deposition is relatively minor in the well bore, but severe in surface piping, with general calcium carbonate deposition rates exceeding 1.5 meter/year, and locally up to 88 meter/years, if appropriate mitigation techniques are not implemented. Application of PowerChem Geosperse 8466 polymeric inhibitor reduced calcium carbonate deposition by more than 99.9% over an eight-day application. Scale inhibitor must be injected below the depth of gas breakout to fully mitigate scale formation in the well bore, but feeding additional inhibitor at the surface is not necessary to prevent scale formation from the wellhead to the power plant.","Calcite; Calcium; Inhibitor; Scale; Silica","Calcite; Calcium; Calcium alloys; Carbonate minerals; Carbonates; Carbonation; Corrosion; Geothermal fields; Geothermal heating; Geothermal prospecting; Geothermal wells; Heat pump systems; Power plants; Precipitation (chemical); Pumps; Renewable energy resources; Scale (deposits); Silica; Steam power plants; Water injection; Wellheads; Calcium carbonate (CaCO3); Calcium carbonate deposition; Carbon concentrations; Flow testing; Geothermal development; High pressure (HP); Inhibitor; Injection wells; Mitigation techniques; Scale; Scale depositions; Scale formation; Scale inhibition; Scale inhibitors; Scale precipitation; System designs; Well bores; Wellhead pressure (WHP); Geothermal energy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58449099682

The data comes from data acquisition stations belonging to Automatic Monitoring of Air Quality and installed in the both Cieszyn and Cesky Tesin. The emergence of high concentrations of air pollutants depends on a number of meteorological factors as well as on dispersion parameters like thermodynamic stability or the mixing layer and environmental conditions. The relation between weather conditions and levels of air pollutants are nonlinear and usual descriptive statistics might be unreliable. The system analyzes the data using data mining as artificial neural networks, including a self-organizing Kohonen network with exhaustion and fuzzy sets.

In both polar and nonpolar solvents, photoinduced charge-separation (CS) processes in C60-nTV-Fc predominantly take place from the singlet excited states of C60 and nTV; this result was indicated by steady and time-resolved emission spectroscopy. In the case of C60-4TV-Fc, the CS state was indicated by the nanosecond transient absorption spectra. In C60-2TV-Fc, although the CS process was also confirmed by the fluorescence quenching in nonpolar and polar solvents, the lifetimes of the CS states were shorter than those of C60-4TV-Fc.

The governments of developed countries must take this into consideration when they design domestic environmental policies. In this paper, I examine the emission tax policy for Cournot duopolists that relocate to another country with no emission tax. Introduction of a strategic emission tax for interruption of relocation to a “pollution haven” was found effective. However, there is still the possibility that duopolists in developed countries will relocate abroad even if the regulator precommits the emission tax rate. As pointed out by Petrakis and Xepapadeas [2003], the regulator faces a regulatory hold-up problem when the set-up cost of relocation is sufficiently low and environmental damage is serious. Therefore, adoption of an emission tax should only occur when the set-up costs are sufficiently large. © 2007, JAPAN SECTION OF THE REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL.

Because of its known usage time frame, the presence of MTBE can help estimate the age of gasoline releases to the environment. However, because of its 'ubiquity, its presence can no longer be used to fingerprint, or differentiate, gasoline plumes in groundwater. Compound- specific stable carbon isotope analysis has recently become a method for differentiating MTBE sources and plumes affecting groundwater. In the present study, groundwater samples were collected from 20 monitoring wells located at two gasoline service stations in central New Jersey in an attempt to differentiate the dissolved gasoline plumes and possibly identify their sources. The δ13C values for each sample were determined and the impacted area for each plume delineated. As biological degradation of MTBE proceeds, the carbon isotope ratio (13C/12C expressed as δ13C) become heavier; petroleum- degrading bacteria preferentially assimilate the lighter 12C isotope, thereby enriching the residual MTBE in the heavier 13C isotope. The isotopic composition of MTBE at different locations demonstrated the varying degree to which MTBE had been altered by biodegradation. The δ13C values can also provide insight into the type of release and the magnitude of biodegradation. Two types of leaks occurred at the sites: a shallow piping leak and deeper leak from a tank system. δ13C values in the vicinity of the shallow leak were heavier revealing increased biodegradation in the soil, while δ13C values in the vicinity of the tank leak were lighter revealing the lack of biological degradation in non- aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) trapped beneath the water table. An assessment is provided where physical site characteristics responsible for petroleum weathering are considered in comparison to the calculated δ13C values.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79551541310

At 12,000 metric tons per day clinker and 4 million metric tons annual cement capacity, this massive greenfield plant is being built by Holcim in the United States along the Mississippi River in Ste. Genevieve County, Missouri. The uniqueness of this undertaking is not only the size, but also the strict efficiency goals and environmental regulations that will apply to the site development, construction, and operation. Preliminary evaluation of the Ste. Genevieve project began in the late 1990's, and Holcim ultimately underwent a six year process of reviews and permits involving eight federal and state regulatory agencies. With all permits finally in hand, Holcim awarded a contract in early 2006 to one supplier for all the main and auxiliary mechanical and electrical equipment as well as engineering services, training, and commissioning The focal point of the plant will be the single pyroprocess system with new generation clinker cooler and in-line preheater with low NO x and CO calciner. Furthermore, the supply of four (4) vertical roller mills has also reinforced this solution as the market standard for finish cement grinding. Because the plant will meet emission limits among the lowest permitted for any cement plant in the United States and the world, any environmental impact will be minimized. In addition, approximately 2200 acres (55% of the total property's acreage) will be preserved in its natural condition for the entire life of the plant. The success of the Ste. Genevieve project is based on the strong partnership and open relationship that has been developed between Holcim and the supplier. Start-up of the plant is scheduled for 2009. With a foundation of a sound technical solution and combined worldwide resources, this extraordinary project will no doubt be a source of pride for all parties involved. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Clinker production; Electrical equipment; Kiln line; Site development; Cements; Environmental regulations; Plant management; Production control; Project management; Kilns",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36349028545

The boundary between low emissions and an unstable combustor are narrower than ever. Hence, combustion instabilities have become a major design challenge as combustors are developed to run as lean as possible in order to achieve stringent emissions targets. These combustion instabilities can limit the operational envelope of the machine and are often responsible for damage to the gas turbine. Thus, preventing or controlling such conditions is the main focus of the design community. In order to lower the risk associated with combustion instabilities issues, a proper understanding of the design and acoustics of the combustion system has to be acquired early in the development stage. A damping strategy should be developed to mitigate risk in the event of unacceptably high dynamics. Combustion rig testing is crucial to a new combustor development program. Matching the acoustic environment of the combustion rig and the engine provide valuable insight into future potential combustion dynamics problems in the engine and provides valuable data to assist troubleshooting such issues on the engine. This work illustrates the ability of rig testing to be a valuable design and optimization tool in addressing combustion dynamics. Rig test data was used to successfully optimize subsequent engine combustion dynamics. The effectiveness of a damping system is also illustrated on the combustion test rig.

Different processes exist for the pretreatment of industrial wastewaters, depending on the composition and strength of the wastewater. Among the available pre-treatment technologies, catalytic wet air oxidation (CWAO) is a suitable technology for treatment of wastewaters containing high levels of refractory organic compounds that are not amenable to biological treatment, either as a complete treatment system by itself, or as a pre-treatment before biological treatment. Compared to conventional wet air oxidation, catalytic wet air oxidation offers lower energy requirements and much higher oxidation efficiencies [1]. Effluents from dying baths in textile industry are one of the most problematic types of wastewater generated by the textile industry. These types of wastewaters have very strong color and high COD concentrations, and impose serious environmental problems, both in terms of treatment and aesthetic concerns. Orange II (also known as Acid Orange 7) is one of the dyes that are produced in large amounts in the United States. It is commonly used in pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetics industries as well as in the textile industry, and it is not amenable to conventional biological treatment. This paper discusses the selection of an efficient catalyst for the catalytic oxidation of Orange II. The experiments were conducted in a one-liter batch stainless steel autoclave reactor, which is equipped with a stirrer, temperature and pressure controllers, gas introduction and vent lines, and a sampling port.

Between İnönü and Sivrihisar, the Eskişehir fault zone of the IEFS trends WNW, but east of Sivrihisar the IEFS changes its direction to NW-SE and splays out into four fault zones, named the Ilica, Yeniceoba, Cihanbeyli and Sultanhani fault zones and extends to south of Tuzgölü in the east. The NW-SE-trending Yeniceoba fault zone (YFZ), exposed between Günyüzü in the west and Yeniceoba in the east, controls the northern margin of the Kelhasan horst and the southern margin of the Yeniceoba basin. Along this fault zone two sets of superimposed slickenlines indicate older pure right-lateral strike-slip faulting and younger normal faulting with a right-lateral component. The NW-SE-trending Cihanbeyli fault zone (CFZ) is well exposed between north of Sülüklü in the west and Cihanbeyli in the east. It controls the southern margin of the Kelhasan horst, and is marked by fault scarps, triangular facets, alluvial fans and alignment of springs. Recent detailed field mapping and kinematic analysis along the fault planes between Pliocene lacustrine carbonates and younger fluvial clastic rocks has shown that the CFZ consists of a series of parallel normal faults. However, kinematic analysis of the fault slip-plane data indicates that the fault planes cutting the Pleistocene-Holocene clastic sediments of the Cihanbeyli Graben at the southeastern tip of the CFZ are normal faults with a minor sinistral component. The kinematic analyses of fault-slip data clearly indicate that the area experienced NNE-SSW extension. Recent horizontal terrace deposits cut by a series of steeply-dipping normal faults with minor strike-slip component in l̇lhanyayla, Damlakuyu, (Çorca) village and nearly 4 kilometres southeast of Insuyu village, which are located on the YFZ and CFZ, indicate that the activity of both CFZ and YFZ continues, controlled by NNE-SSE-directed extension, in the Quaternary. The distribution of earthquake epicentres supports this view and suggests recent activity along the fault zones.

Emissions from new coal-fired facilities have never been lower, but the permitting challenges for these facilities have never been so numerous. Two primary issues to be dealt with for regulatory review are PSD increment consumption and regional haze modeling in Class I areas. At the same time, with numerous projects of voluntary flue gas desulfurization installations and the implementation of the Best Available Retrofit Technology (BART) program, the number of emission reduction projects for SO2 is noteworthy, and this issue needs to be taken into account in the consideration of new project permitting evaluations. This paper reviews permitting issues dealt with on a variety of recent power plant permitting efforts with the Federal Land Managers on PSD increment and regional haze modeling. Among the issues discussed in the paper are: 1) Modeling procedures and emission rates used in PSD increment consumption calculations, 2) Whether CALPUFF is adequate for the task of regional haze impact calculations, 3) Adequacy of meteorological databases, 4) Visibility postprocessing methods, especially alternatives to FLAG, such as the BART approach, and 5) Consideration of techniques used in a cumulative regional haze modeling analysis.","CALPUFF; Coal-fired power plants; Federal land manager; FLAG; PSD class I; Regional haze; Visibility assessment","Air and Waste Management Association; Air quality modeling; CALPUFF; Coal-fired power plants; Federal land manager; FLAG; PSD class I; Regional haze; Visibility assessment; Air pollution; Air quality; Waste management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52049120859

The author discusses experience to date, gleaned collectively from a number of active projects for industrial facilities, as it pertains to both source-specific and statewide or regional assessments of visibility impacts for the BART analyses. There is also a discussion of the assessment of reasonable progress and the likelihood that the BART emission reductions will result in reasonable further progress toward the RHR goal of natural conditions by the first milestone in 2018.

The excitation light is linearly polarized and used to illuminate a microfluidic device containing 1 μL of Rhodamine 6G dye dissolved in ethanol. The detector is shielded by a second polarizer, orientated orthogonally to the excitation light. The resulting emission signal was detected by the organic photodiode down to a concentration of 10 nM.

Following the technology scaling trends, this request will continue to rise, thus increasing the electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated by electronic systems. The enforcement of strict governmental regulations and international standards, mainly (but not only) in the automotive domain, are driving new efforts towards design solutions for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC). Hence, EMC/EMI is rapidly becoming a major concern for high-speed circuit and package designers. The on-chip clock signals with fast rise/fall times are among the most detrimental sources of electromagnetic (EM) noise, since not only they generate radiated emissions, but they also have a large impact con the conducted emissions, as the power rail noise localized in close proximity of the toggling clock edges propagates to the board through the power and ground pins. In this work, we analyze the impact of different clock distribution solutions on the spectral content of typical onchip waveforms, in order to develop an effective methodology for EMC-aware clock-tree synthesis, which globally reduces the EM emissions. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into a typical design flow, and its effectiveness is demonstrated with experimental results obtained from the clock distribution network of an industrial digital design. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",,"Automobile electronic equipment; Clock distribution networks; Digital integrated circuits; Electric clocks; Electromagnetic pulse; Clock distribution; Clock distribution techniques; Clock tree synthesis; Conducted emissions; Electronic systems; Governmental regulations; International standards; Operating frequency; Electromagnetic compatibility",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37849022161

Due to increasing bypass ratios the fan area in aero-engines has become larger. This development is advantageous for the efficiency and the reduction of jet noise, however, it relocates the noise problem to the engine intake. In the presented work two different numerical approaches for solving the linearised Euler equations (LEE) will be compared. Their application to the case of sound propagation in the JT15D aero-engine intake will be presented. The fist method, also called the Chimera-technique, is based on overlapping structured grids which exchange data using high order interpolation. It employs the well-known high order Dispersion Relation Preserving scheme (DRP) for the spatial discretisation and an optimised Runge-Kutta Method for temporal integration. The second method is based on unstructured tetrahedral meshes and uses a new version of explicit one-step Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) Finite Element schemes allowing for arbitrary high order of accuracy in space and time as well as for time accurate local time stepping (LTS). Both high order methods are optimised for sound propagation and are capable of simulating complex geometries such as a scarfed nacelle intake including the spinner. The first objective of this work is to gain insight into the acoustic far field characteristics of an intake in the presence of a realistic mean flow. Furthermore, the influence of an asymmetrical shape of the inlet mouth will be studied. The second objective is to compare the different numerical methods with respect to their accuracy and computational efficiency, this being a major criterion for industrial application.",,"Complex geometries; Discontinuous galerkin; Finite element schemes; High-order dispersion; Local time stepping; Numerical approaches; Temporal integration; Unstructured tetrahedral meshes; Acoustic noise; Aircraft engines; Dispersions; Galerkin methods; Industrial applications; Noise pollution; Runge Kutta methods; Acoustic wave propagation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881454226

One of them is the use of gaseous fuels that are generated from the gasification of woods, namely syngas or wood-gas fuels, as full supplement fuels in spark ignition internal combustion (IC) engines. This fuel consists of nearly 40% combustible gases, mainly hydrogen and carbon monoxide (CO), while the rest is non-combustible gases. In the present work, a comparison between experimental and computed results is presented for a conventional natural gas, spark-ignited engine, fuelled with syngas instead of natural gas fuel. For the theoretical investigation, a computer model is developed that simulates the syngas combustion processes in a conventional natural gas, spark-ignited engine. The combustion model is a two- zone one, where the combustion rate of syngas fuel depends on the velocity of the flame front that forms around the area of the burning zone and then spreads inside the combustion chamber. The flame front development takes into account the history of pressure and temperature inside the chamber and the local composition, in order to estimate the flame velocity. An equilibrium model is used to determine the concentration of the chemical species involved, the extended Zeldovich mechanism is used to determine the concentration of nitric oxide (NO) and a CO kinetics scheme is used to estimate the CO emission. To validate the predictive ability of the model, experimental measurements are used from the operation of a multi-cylinder, four-stroke, turbocharged, spark-ignited engine fuelled with syngas fuel, with the measurements corresponding to various values of the air to fuel ratio (load). The experimental results are found to be in good agreement with the respective computed ones obtained from the computer model. Comparing the computed results when operating the engine with natural gas as against syngas fuel, a serious effect of the syngas operation on the cylinder pressure diagrams and the engine brake efficiency is revealed, for all test cases examined. Moreover, as far as pollutant emissions are concerned, the use of natural gas instead of syngas has a positive effect on both NO and CO emissions (reduction). © 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","carbon monoxide; emissions; hydrogen; performance; spark ignition engine; syngas fuel",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867927515

In the United States, there is currently a public policy debate over the use of coal to produce liquid transportation fuels to increase energy security and decrease dependence on imported petroleum and refined products. There are a number of challenges to be faced by a possible CTL industry, and one of the largest relates to the magnitude of carbon dioxide (CO 2) generated, from the synthetic fuel production as well as from the combustion of the synthetic transportation fuel itself. Co 2, produced by conversion of hydrocarbons to energy, primarily via fossil fuel combustion, is one of the most ubiquitous and significant greenhouse gases (GHGs). Concerns over climate change precipitated by rising atmospheric GHG concentrations have prompted many industrialized nations to begin adopting limits on emissions to inhibit increases in atmospheric CO 2 levels. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change states as a key goal the stabilization of atmospheric GHGs at a level that prevents ""dangerous anthropogenic interference"" with the world's climate systems. This will require sharply reducing CO 2 emissions across the globe and ultimately a fundamental shift in the way in which energy is produced and consumed. This paper provides an overview of the challenge posed by the magnitude of CO 2 that would be produced from a developing CTL industry. The status and costs associated with carbon dioxide capture and geologic storage (CCS) technologies are discussed as a means of helping to mitigate the CO 2 issue, along with remaining challenges that must be overcome for an emerging CTL industry to move toward maturity. However, even if CCS can be safely and successfully applied to CTL plants, CO 2 emissions will still likely be greater than conventional liquid transportation fuel production from conventional petroleum.",,"Anthropogenic interference; Atmospheric CO; Carbon dioxide capture; Carbon emissions; Climate system; Coal resources; Energy security; Fossil fuel combustion; Fuel production; Geologic storage; Hydrocarbon conversion; Industrialized nations; Liquid transportation; Refined products; Transportation fuels; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Carbon capture; Coal combustion; Coal transportation; Environmental regulations; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbon refining; Hydrocarbons; Industry; Liquids; Petroleum transportation; Synthetic fuels; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865501463

The industry is geared towards improving and evolving building products, processes, and esign techniques in order to constantly improve the environmental aspects in the new and renovated structures being built today. Passa Associates rchitect decided a number of years ago to pursue the sustainable route at a time when it was difficult to convince owners and contractors to break with the norm and institute sustainable principles in the buildings they were erecting. This article highlights some of the significant projects that they undertook and attempts to explain how the use of new technologies, constantly evolving sustainable design practices, and ground breaking ''green'' building materials with every new project can be reflected in the energy efficiency results that constantly improved with each new project. It is this desire to improve upon what's been done previously that is paving the way to a greener future. The calculations evolved through energy simulation software created a quantifiable system identifying how high performance energy efficient building can be achieved. This resulted in buildings with reduced green house gas emissions with the goal to grow into ''living buildings'' giving back energy when able. Two of the first energy efficient green projects by Passa Associates Architect (PAA) were elementary school projects for the Windsor-Essex Catholic District School Board (WECDSB). Our Lady of Mount Carmel Catholic Elementary School was completed in April 2004 and was determined to be 39.5% more efficient than the Canadian Model National Energy Code for Buildings (MNECB) while St. Christopher Catholic Elementary School was completed in August 2005 at 59.5% more efficient than the MNECB making it the most energy efficient elementary or high school in the Province of Ontario and fourth most efficient in Canada. These projects were followed by a Fitness Centre Addition to the University of Windsor in which the firm dealt with further complicated building encapsulation details utilizing techniques for daylight harvesting. The last project mentioned in detail is the renovation of an existing ''brownfield'' industrial hospital linen building for use as the Glengarda New Facility, a school for Glengarda Child & Family Services of Windsor, Ontario.

A new approach of synthesizing process from a mass, energy and entropy point of view has been developed (Patel et. al., 2006). This design approach can be utilized in the very early design stages and requires only simple thermodynamic data to effectively synthesize a process. This tool effectively sets targets for the overall process, determines the limiting variable (mass, energy or work) and allows one to scan all the various options easily. It can be shown that the mass, energy and entropy balance for an overall process are all linear and by employing a linear programming model, with the various constraints and a suitable objective function one can determine the feasible region for the overall chemical process i.e. the overall mass balance. We employ an example of co-generating hydrocarbon liquids and methanol (and heat) from a methane and/or coal feed. We will show that it is possible to determine an overall process which requires no energy or work input and does not produce carbon dioxide. Thus, in principle it is possible to design a zero-emissions overall process.

This approach is strikingly different from the plasma- or ion-beam-assisted PLD because the mean free path at this pressure is by far longer than the target to substrate distance. Thus, the electric field interacts with individual ionized species invoking ion acceleration and gas-phase reactions among different ionized species. These phenomena are clearly dependent on the laser wavelength (first, second, or third harmonic, λ=1064, 532, and 355 nm, respectively) used for the ablation. We found that the application of the electric field causes surface smoothing (the roughness decreases from about 1 to 0.4 nm) and faster deposition rate (from about 2 to 7 nmmin) for the second and third harmonics. In addition, the phenomena are less intense in the case of the first harmonic due to the low concentration of ionized species in the plume. In addition, in the case of PLD using λ=532 nm, the electric field improves the film's density (from 2.60 to 2.95 g cm3).

Governments around the world, including Canada's, are considering increasing mode share by rail as a way of reducing transportation emissions. To understand whether freight mode shift is a realistic means of reducing transportation emissions, an analytical model is needed that can predict the effect of government policy on mode split. This paper presents the findings of the first such model developed for the Quebec City-Windsor Corridor. The model itself is a stated preference carrier choice model of shippers in this busy route. The model was developed by using the results of a stated preference survey undertaken in fall 2005. The survey was designed explicitly to evaluate shipper preferences for the carriage of intercity consignments, particularly their preferences for carriers that contract the services of rail companies to carry these shipments via rail. The results of the study (a) show that shippers are mistrustful of using rail to move their consignments and (b) suggest that increasing rail's share of freight transport faces tremendous challenges.",,"Freight transportation; Greenhouse gases; Mathematical models; Intercity consignments; Transportation corridor; Railroad transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36549038490

In the automotive industry extensive research is being undertaken on the use of alternative fuels in internal combustion engines and on the development of alternative powerplants but often the long-term strategy and sustainability of the energy sources to produce these fuels is not clearly enunciated. The requirement to reduce CO2 emissions in the face of accelerating global warming scenarios and the depletion of fossil-fuel resources has led to the widespread assumption that some form of 'hydrogen economy' will prevail; this view is seldom justified or challenged. As oil and natural gas resources begin to deplete it is vital to consider how to exploit the remaining reserves more efficiently and how best to produce, distribute and utilise the fuel which may form the basis of the future energy economy. The paper discusses the origins of our dependency on fossil fuels and looks at issues related to the depletion of their resources and their effects on the global climate. Two possible long-term energy strategies are considered and the impact of these on the direction of future automotive fuels is considered. The issues involved with the provision of infrastructure for fuel distribution are assessed and the compatibility of this infrastructure with that required for fuelling future generation vehicles, including those powered by fuel-cells is discussed. The exploitation and limitations of biomass fuels are considered, in particular the use of alcohol-based fuels in internal combustion engines and their compatibility with future trends in engine technology to improve fuel economy are discussed.

A series of reference measurements were performed on a fixed route in Belgium in real traffic circumstances, including motorway, rural and city traffic. Three vehicles were used for the reference measurements: a passenger car, a delivery van, and a delivery truck. An on-board device recorded vehicle speed and GPS position on second-basis. The resulting speed profiles were used as input in the vehicle emission simulation programme VeTESS to estimate fuel consumption and emissions of certain vehicles driving according to these speed profiles. The goal of these calculations was to quantify the effect of preventing traffic jams. From the simulations it was concluded that a reduction in average speed does not necessarily lead to higher fuel consumption. Actually when average speed is reduced from speeds above 100 km/h down to 80 or 60 km/h, fuel consumption can even be expected to decrease. Of course traffic jams are more about low average speeds. The simulations showed that when average speed drops below 30 or 40 km/h, fuel consumption increases significantly. Emissions of NOx CO and HC also increase in this case. So concerning fuel consumption and emissions it is indeed worth the effort to prevent traffic jams and slow traffic and to improve the traffic flow. The role of traffic jam detection is very important to take measures to improve the traffic flow and this way save fuel and reduce emissions. © 2007 WIT Press.","Emission simulation; GPS recordings; Real traffic conditions; Vehicle emissions","emission control; estimation method; fuel consumption; GPS; motorway; simulation; traffic congestion; traffic emission; Belgium; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148951392

Rod-like (calamitic) mesogens can exhibit nematic as well as different smectic phases characterized by a layered structure. Disc-shape mesogens preferably form columnar phases of different type characterized by a 2D superstructure. In rare cases they can also form nematic phases. Nematic phases may be characterized as the simplest liquid crystalline phase which is distinguished from the isotropic liquid only by the long-range orientational order. It is possible to describe the spontaneous parallel orientation of the molecules in nematic mesophases only by the anisotropy of repulsive forces coupled with the isotropic part of the dispersion interaction [1, 2]. It does not exclude that in dependence on the molecular structure-especially for the formation of smectic layer structures or columnar structures-other intermolecular interactions can play an important role (e.g. polar forces, charge-transfer complexes, hydrogen bonds). But in addition, the interaction between chemically incompatible moieties [3] as well as special steric interactions can clearly influence the structural features of mesophases. Special steric interactions may occur, if the molecular shape strongly deviates from the classical rod-like (or disc-like) shape. Elongated molecules with bulky branches at the ends of the molecules, the so-called polycatenar compounds are well-known examples. These compounds are able to form not only nematic or smectic phases but also mesophases with 2D superstructure (columnar phases) or 3D superstructure (cubic, tetragonal, rhombohedral phases) [4, 5]. Another impressive example of a special steric interaction is molecules with a pronounced bent shape which are the topic of this chapter. Such substances were already synthesized by Vorländer et al. 1932 [6] and later by Akutagawa et al. [7], but it were Niori et al. [8] who discovered the polar properties of smectic phases formed by bent molecules. It was shown that due their bent shape the molecules can preferably be packed in bent direction giving rise to a long-range correlation of the lateral dipole moments, that means to a macroscopic polarization in the smectic layers. In the following the most important mesophases formed by bent molecules shall be briefly characterized. In the SmAP phase (P means polar) the molecules are arranged perpendicular to the layers like in SmA phases but they possess a polar packing (in bent direction) within the layer plane. Depending on the direction of the polar axes in adjacent layers the SmAP phase can behave ferroelectric (polar axes parallel) or antiferroelectric (polar axes antiparallel) which is indicated by the subscripts For A (SmAPF SmAPA). In most cases the polar packed bent molecules are tilted with respect to the layer normal. In analogy to the SmAP phase this phase is designated as SmCP which can either be ferroelectric (SmCPF) or antiferroelectric (SmCPA). But in addition, in the case of SmCP phases we have also to distinguish-with respect to the tilt direction-between synclinic or anticlinic interlayer correlation which is indicated in the phase symbol by the subscripts S or A after C. That means, four structural types of the SmCP phase are possible-SmCSPASmCAPA SmCSP F SmCAPF-which are schematically presented in Figure 1-1 [9]. Another aspect is of fundamental interest. The combination of director tilt and polar order leads to the chirality of smectic layers although the constituent molecules are achiral [9, 10]. As shown in Figure 1-1 two equivalent layer structures with antiparallel polar axes exist for a given tilt direction but these structures are mirror images from each other. In Figure 1-1 the opposite chirality is depicted by red or blue molecule symbols. In the so-called ""racemic"" states (SmCSPA, SmCAPF) the chirality alternates from layer to layer. In the ""homochiral"" states (SmCAPA, SmCSPF) the layer chirality is uniform within a macroscopic domain. In order to escape from the macroscopic polarization, SmAP as well as SmCP phases have mostly an antiferroelectric ground state (alternating polarization in adjacent layers) which can be switched into corresponding ferroelectric states (indicated by arrows in Figure 1-1). This switching (also the switching between the opposite ferroelectric states) usually takes place by the collective rotation of the molecules around the tilt cone like in SmCphase of calamitic compounds. It can be seen from Figure 1-1 that during the switching the chirality of the layers (red and blue, resp.) does not change. Another way to avoid bulk polarization in layered structures of bent molecules is to break the layers into 2D modulated structures which can be regarded as columnar structures where the layer fragments represent the columns. In many cases the columnar phases of bent molecules have a rectangular cell (formerly this Colr phase was also designed as B1, but there are also examples of an oblique lattice (Colob) [11-16]. It seems that the columns consisting of layer fragments are polar ones but the macroscopic polarization is avoided by an antiparallel alignment of the polar axes. It should be mentioned that further phases are formed by bent-core mesogens, which, however, have no relation to the subject of this chapter. Concerning the structure of the B3B4B5B 6 and B7 phases, we refer therefore to three reviews on banana-shaped liquid crystals [12, 16, 17] The assignment of the mesophases is based on different experimental techniques. Phase transitions are usually detected by calorimetry but also by polarizing optical microscopy. Textural features obtained by polarizing microscopy give first hints about the mesophase type. The most important method for the structural characterization is X-ray diffraction measurements. If possible these measurements should be performed on oriented samples. The polar properties are investigated by current response measurements, mostly using the triangular wave voltage method [18]. Information about the molecular dynamics can be obtained by dielectric measurements [19-21]. NMR spectroscopy allows the determination of the orientational order parameter by 1H splitting or 13C anisotropic shift measurements. Using the experimental order parameter the conformation of the bent molecules in the liquid crystalline state may be estimated by 13C NMR [22-25], 19F NMR [26] or 2H NMR [26-28]. The knowledge of the conformation (especially of the bending angle) is important to understand basic relationships between molecular structure and the mesophase behaviour. Since the discovery of the polar properties in smectic phases of bent-core mesogens in 1996 [8] chemists have synthesized a large variety of banana-shaped compounds with quite different structure. In most cases the chemical structure corresponds to the molecular design sketched in Figure 1-2. The molecules consist of at least five rings connected by the linking groups X, Y. The two legs are attached to the central part, which introduces the bending angle in the whole molecule. Mostly the bending angle of about 120 results from the 1,3-phenylene disubstitution, as shown in Figure 1-2. The central phenyl ring can be replaced by naphthalene or by six-or five-membered heterocyclic rings (e.g. pyridine, oxazole, oxadiazole). But also a short odd-numbered spacer consisting of one (-O-;-S-;-CH 2-;-CO-) or three single units (e.g.-CH2OOC-) can be used to introduce the bending angle. The terminal rings are substituted by long hydrocarbon chains in most cases. Aliphatic chains containing perfluorinated moieties or siloxane containing fragments increase the effect of microsegregation in the resulting mesophases. Polar as well as non-polar groups can be attached at the different lateral positions of the phenyl rings which is a successful way to create new phases and phase sequences in banana-shaped liquid crystals. It will be shown that the influence of lateral substituents is of great importance with respect to the subject of this chapter. More detailed information about the relationship between the chemical structure of bent-core mesogens and their mesophase behaviour has been summarized in some reviews [12, 16, 17, 29, 30]. In principle the molecular design to prepare banana-shaped liquid crystals sketched in Figure 1-2 works, but until now some essential questions could not be answered in a satisfying way. An important question is, for example: What are the structural preconditions of bent-core molecules to form definite phases with polar structure or polar structural fragments (""banana phases""). There are bent molecules which form only the classical mesophases of calamitic mesogens, that means nematic or smectic phases. On the other hand, there are bent-core compounds which are able to form nematic and/or smectic phases as well as ""banana phases"". This indicates that there is a more continuous borderline between bent-core and calamitic mesogens. © 2007 Springer.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70349777192

However, the incorporation of nitrogen results in lower photonuminescence intensity and wider line width as a result of increased non-radiative centers. In order to increase the efficiency of radiative recombination and hence reduce the laser threshold, a post-growth heat treatment has to be applied. Such kind of heat treatment results in a big blue shift due to interdiffusion and other effects. During growth, in order to incorporate nitrogen into InGaAs, the growth temperature is much lower than normal InGaAs growth. Large number of point defects is induced under such low temperature. This is the main cause of the interdiffusion at the interfaces of InGaAsN / GaAs QW. There are some other facts to cause the blue shift during heat treatment, such as local neighbourhood redistribution called short range ordered. In our study, different blue shift behaviors were clearly observed due to different blue shift mechanism. Post-growth heat treatment also affects the laser performance dramatically. Lower temperature treatment mainly decreases the absorption loss and higher temperature treatment improves the conductivity of the cladding layers. Different heat treatment also results in very different burn-in behavior. An optimized heat treatment will be concluded after the annealing discussion on laser devices. In order to assure longer emission wavelength as well as higher emission efficiency, many efforts have been tried and will be discussed in this paper.","Blue shift; Defect; Diffusion; Dilute nitride; Laser; Long wavelength; Photoluminescence","Heat treatment; Nitrides; Photoluminescence; Quantum well lasers; Semiconducting indium gallium arsenide; Wavelength; Blue shift; Dilute nitride; Emission wavelength; Long wavelength; Telecommunication",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42549118627

Both a - and c -type transitions are observed for the Ar-propane complex. The c -type transitions are much stronger indicating that the small dipole moment of the propane (0.0848 D) is aligned perpendicular to the van der Waals bond axis. While the 42 transition lines observed for the primary argon complex are well fitted to a semirigid rotor Hamiltonian, the neon complexes exhibit splittings in the rotational transitions which we attribute to an internal rotation of the propane around its a inertial axis. Only c -type transitions are observed for both neon complexes, and these are found to occur between the tunneling states, indicating that internal motion involves an inversion of the dipole moment of the propane. The difference in energy between the two tunneling states within the ground vibrational state is 48.52 MHz for Ne20 -C H3 C H2 C H3 and 42.09 MHz for Ne22 -C H3 C H2 C H3. The Kraitchman substitution coordinates of the complexes show that the rare gas is oriented above the plane of the propane carbons, but shifted away from the methylene carbon, more so in Ne propane than in Ar propane. The distance between the rare gas atom and the center of mass of the propane, Rcm, is 3.823 Å for Ar-propane and 3.696 Å for Ne-propane. Ab initio calculations are done to map out segments of the intermolecular potential. The global minimum has the rare gas almost directly above the center of mass of the propane, and there are three local minima with the rare gas in the plane of the carbon atoms. Barriers between the minima are also calculated and support the experimental results which suggest that the tunneling path involves a rotation of the propane subunit. The path with the lowest effective barrier is through a C2v symmetric configuration in which the methyl groups are oriented toward the rare gas. Calculating the potential curve for this one-dimensional model and then calculating the energy levels for this potential roughly reproduces the spectral splittings in Ne-propane and explains the lack of splittings in Ar-propane. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.",,"Dipole moment; Microwave spectroscopy; Molecular dynamics; Neon; Propane; Van der Waals forces; Internal motion; Neon complexes; Rotational transitions; Molecular structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148964430

Design/methodology/approach - The Organizational Model of Employee Persistence provided the theoretical framework for this longitudinal study. Responses to the Organizational Survey Managerial Integration were obtained from 528 managers in three randomly-selected retail organizations. Findings - By identifying and facilitating organizational behaviors that lead to a more integrative work climate, retail organizations might reduce costs associated with turnover. Managers' perceptions of integration (connectedness or engagement with the organization) based on their organizational experiences and relationships significantly explained turnover. Research implications/implications - The 54 specific items that comprise the construct, integration, can be used as baseline data. Other implications for research include further critique of the model and testing both within the USA and internationally; re-examination of the factor structure the instrument; adaptation to non-managerial populations and to non-retail settings; and structural equations modeling to determine directionality of the variables. Practical implications - Organizations might pay closer attention to the career development needs of their managers through formal and informal opportunities for career development. In addition, organizations might address issues associated with worklife balance. Originality/value - This study introduces a new model of employee turnover and the concept integration to the turnover literature.

These plumes were studied with the DLR (Deutsches Zentrum fuer Luft- und Raumfahrt) research aircraft Falcon which was equipped with an extensive set of in situ aerosol and trace gas instruments. Analyses by the Lagrangian dispersion model FLEXPART provided source regions, transport times and horizontal extent of the fire plumes. Results from the general circulation model ECHAM/MADE and data from previous aerosol studies over Central Europe provided reference vertical profiles of black carbon (BC) mass concentrations for year 2000 conditions with forest fire activities below the long-term average. Smoke plume observations yielded a BC mass fraction of total aerosol mass with respect to PM 2.5 of 2-8%. The ratio ofBC mass to excess CO was 3-7.5 mgBC (g CO)-1.

This suggests an efficient lifting of BC from forest fires to higher altitudes with only minor scavenging removal of particulate matter.

In the past decades the ""war frontier"" has been between the northern forests and southern plantations. More recently, new ""frontiers"" have opened due to new uses of wood such as bioenergy, which are increasingly competing with traditional wood uses - wood product and pulp industries - on limited raw material opportunities. In Europe this competition is already directly affecting to the market, pushing up the prices of wood raw material. In tropical countries the impact is more indirect, affecting through the competition for land, which can be used for both bioenergy crop and wood growing. The past development of pulpwood costs shows a convergence of regional cost levels. In high wood cost regions, such as Nordic Countries and Western Europe, the pulpwood costs have decreased trend-wise. In the fast-growing plantation regions, such as Brazil and Chile, the pulpwood costs have increased in the long term driven by input costs, yet, these regions will continue to retain their competitive advantage. The bioenergy expansion may represent a discontinuity to these trends, increasing upward pressures on regional and global wood prices. It will also influence on the competitive positioning of the regions from the fibre supply perspective, since the growth rate of bioenergy will differ between the regions. There are several factors which can help the global fibre market to mitigate the price pressures. There is still a lot of under-utilised land potentially available for wood/bioenergy crop plantations around the world. This includes land-use conversion from agriculture or putting unused land into sustainable production. There are existing wood resources that are underutilised, such as e.g. Russian forests or harvesting residues in Europe. There are large opportunities to improve the efficiency in wood supply logistics, which would improve the economic availability. There are also possibilities to combine sustainable wood production and carbon sinks, if the rules of the carbon game will change in the future.",,"Cost effectiveness; Crops; Paper and pulp industry; Raw materials; Wood; Bioenergy; Global fibre supply; Natural fibers; Farm Crops; Natural Fibers; Paper Industry; Wood",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34748921020

In contrast, a probability density function based assessment using daily climate model data provides a good basis for confidence in a model's ability to simulate the 95th rainfall percentile.

In order to reduce particulate pollutant emissions, a development program has been carried out based on a Euro 4 engine with a DPF technology. Currently, for Euro 4 compliance, SCR is the favoured technology. To avoid a completely new development, the Exoclean ™ DPF system was located after the SCR. Catalyst. The severe operating conditions and the location of the DPF necessitated the development of an active system based on the association of a DPF and a Fuel-Borne Catalyst. A Renault Trucks MD9 engine was used. This work was funded by ADEME (French Agency for Environment and Energy Management). Due to severe stop and go duty cycles and the interest to fit the DPF downstream of the SCR, this study shows the benefit of using an active DPF with an FBC to ensure full regeneration even at low temperatures. This study started with the optimization of the oxidation catalysts and fuel injection efficiency in order to get a sufficiently high exotherms in front of the DPF to trigger regeneration. In a second step, the impact of the FBC was investigated at different DPF inlet temperatures.

An algorithm for the synthesis of cooling networks was presented. The new method is based on an MINLP formulation that includes the capital costs of the coolers, the utility costs and the pumping costs. Within this formulation, the outlet temperature for the cooling utility was treated as an optimization variable. The superstructure is based on a stage wise representation that allows the bypass of either fresh or previously-used cooling utility as part of the solution strategy to get a network with the minimum cost. The relationship between the pressure drops and the film heat transfer coefficients for the streams provide a better estimation of the costs for exchangers and pumping units. Such relationships are subject to operational and geometric constraints of the units to get feasible designs. The model presented imposes an upper limit on the outlet temperature of each cooler for the cold utility to ovoid operational problems due to fouling conditions.

This approach generalizes upscaling methods which have been successfully used to perform reservoir simulations on geological (fine) scales. Typically, vugular porous media is described using both Stokes and Darcy's equations at the fine-scale. We propose the use of simplified model based on Stokes-Brinkman equations. Stokes and Darcy equations can be obtained from these equations by appropriate choice of parameters. Moreover, in the presence of damaged zones between vugular regions and Darcy regions, Stokes-Brinkman equations allow a seamless transition. The upscaling of fine-scale equations is addressed within homogenization theory. Appropriate local problems are solved to compute the effective permeabilities, which are further used for the simulations on the field scale. We present numerical results for homogeneous and heterogeneous background permeability fields. Our results show that the coarse-scale permeability field is greatly affected when the background permeability is heterogeneous. This is due to the fact that the high flow channels connecting some of the vugs significantly alter the upscaled permeability. We compare the coarse-scale pressure obtained from upscaled equations with the averaged fine-scale pressure. The results are in agreement which indicates that the upscaled models are accurate for practical purposes.

These strategies have increasingly included improving facilities and conditions for bicycle and pedestrian travel, as well as working to influence land use patterns to reduce vehicle travel demand. Correspondingly, within the past five to 10 years the public health sector has become increasingly interested in the relationships among transportation systems, community design, and physical activity. Their interest has been motivated by the rising incidence of health problems linked in part to sedentary lifestyles and the rising incidence of obesity. Health practitioners are promoting the concept of ""active transportation"" in which activity is integrated into daily routines through the opportunity to walk or bicycle to destinations. This confluence of interests is leading to the formation of partnerships involving the transportation and public health sectors that are resulting in important air quality as well as public health and transportation benefits. A survey found that at least 33 metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) and 16 state departments of transportation (DOTs) are now working, in some way, to explicitly address physical activity and related health issues. Examples of activities include: forming partnerships with public health agencies, establishing health and activity-related goals and objectives in long-range plans, and undertaking expanded programs to promote walking and bicycling. Agencies share knowledge and communications resources in support of mutual objectives, and have found strong public support for projects that create more walkable and bikeable communities. The resulting programs and projects contribute to multiple goals, help to improve public health by promoting physical activity, reduce vehicle emissions and thereby improve air quality, and reduce the need for expanded roadway capacity.",,"Air quality; Land use; Motor transportation; Public health; Traffic congestion; Transportation; Vehicles; Waste management; Active transportations; Congestion mitigation; Land Use Planning; Metropolitan planning organizations; Public-health agencies; State departments of transportations; Transportation agencies; Transportation system; Health",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933523867

Model simulations were performed with three emission scenarios: 2002 emissions, 2004 emissions, and a 'no control' scenario. The latter simulates conditions that would have existed in 2002 had new NOx emission controls not been imposed. All scenarios used 2002 meteorology. Controls lead to reductions of NOx emissions in 2002 and 2004 to roughly two thirds and one third of their 1997 levels, respectively. In response to these emission changes, the model predicted that maximun 8-h average ozone concentrations would have decreased from 3% to 8% between 2002 and 2004 given 2002 meteorolgy. The absence of control would have led to considerably higher ozone levels in most of the eastern U.S., with exceptions occurring in the vicinity of point sources, regions that would have experienced lower ozone levels thanks to a more intense titration process. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The region is not only the world's highest mountain region, but also its most populous. The wealth of the HKKH lies in an immense diversity of flora and fauna, as well as ethnic groups and languages. It is also an important source of water, energy, and biological diversity. Yet despite this rich diversity, in reality, the HKKH regions are exceedingly fragile. Each day, climate change, pollution, as well as exploitative mining and unsound agriculture practices, take a toll on mountain environments and the most vulnerable to these changes are the inhabitants of this region. Already, they are among the world's poorest, hungriest and most marginalized people. Sustainable development of these mountain regions is a challenging task because these areas have highly diverse and fragile ecosystems. The HKKH region is geologically the youngest mountain range giving rise to a high degree of natural hazards. Specific information on ecology, natural resource potential, and socio-economic activities is essential for sustainable development of this region. There is, however, a lack of sufficient knowledge of mountain ecosystems for the reasons of understanding of mountain specificities, the effort of International Center for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) has been to establish itself as a hub for mountain-specific knowledge, which will help in sustainable development. Among several programs ICIMOD is contributing to two important programs related to climate change: (1) glaciers and glacial lakes; and (2) trans-boundary air pollution. Glaciers and glacial lakes are the repositories of information for exploring Quaternary climate changes, as they remain sensitive to global temperature conditions. Rising temperature trends with climate change are much more pronounced in the higher altitudes causing the net shrinkage and retreat of glaciers, and the increase in size and number of glacial lakes. A number of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) have been reported in the region in the last few decades and many potential threats of more GLOF in the HKKH region have been identified, which may pose high death tolls in downstream populations, as well as destruction of property and infrastructure. Though mountains are often associated with clean air, they can receive contamination due to transport of pollution by winds. The Malè Declaration on Control and Prevention of Air Pollution and its likely Trans-boundary Effects for South Asia, and Project Atmospheric Brown Cloud (ABC) seek to find the nature of transport of pollution for informed decision-making to tackle trans-boundary air pollution through regional cooperation. Initial study has shown that aerosols have led to a large reduction of surface solar radiation during winter. This may affect agriculture, health, and the hydrological cycle; eventually contribute to climate change. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48349089379

However, lean premixed flames pose a greater risk of blowout. Studies on swirl and dump stabilized flames have shown that as a flame approaches blowout, distinctive precursors occur, such as pockets of localized extinctions and brief flame shape transitions to a thin 'tornado' configuration. For this study, both precursor types are detected using separate, dedicated optical sensors. Observations indicate that the tornado mode is part of the blowout process in a 127 mm long combustor and that a localized extinction precursor immediately precedes the tornado mode transition. Despite the causality, the statistics of tornado bursts and localized extinctions suggest a 'memory-less' Poisson process, where the occurrence of one event type does not influence the time until the next event of the same type. Localized extinctions have been used previously for blowout margin estimation, and are well suited for the purpose because the occurrence frequency increases with diminishing margin. However, the signals commonly used to detect localized extinction events are noisy due to the nature of the flame; thus, detection is prone to false alarms. Detecting tornado bursts, by comparison, is less ambiguous but such events occur too rarely for blowout mitigation applications. The shortcomings of both precursor detection methods can be addressed by combining observations of both precursor types in a meaningful manner. The presence of tornado bursts indicates that the flame is near blowout; this fact can be used to calibrate margin estimation routines based upon localized extinction. However, this approach would require two sensors since any one optical sensor cannot directly differentiate both precursor types. A single sensor approach can be developed whereby the causal relationship between the two precursor types is exploited. Local extinctions with longer duration times can potentially perturb the flame into an alternate flow configuration. The presence of these tornado 'triggers' manifest as an increase in the low frequency content of the chemiluminescence signal. A low pass filter with the appropriate cutoff frequency can differentiate between the tornado-triggering and benign, inconsequential localized extinctions. Therefore, the same signal that detects localized extinctions can be filtered to capably predict tornado mode shifts. This scheme will enable robust margin detection and minimize sensitivity to noise.

Unfortunately, it is largely untapped at present, in part because sunlight is a very diffuse energy source. Concentrating solar power (CSP) systems use low cost reflectors to concentrate the sun's energy to allow it to be used more effectively. Concentrating solar power systems are also well suited for large solar power plants that can be connected into the existing utility infrastructure. These two facts mean that CSP systems can be used to make a meaningful difference in energy supply in a relatively short period. CSP plants are best suited for the arid climates in the Southwestern United States, Northern Mexico, and many desert regions around the globe, A recent Western Governors' Association siting study [1] found that the solar potential in the U.S. Southwest is at least 4 times the total U.S. electric demand even after eliminating urban areas, environmentally sensitive areas, and all regions with a ground slope greater than 1%.While it is currently not practical to power the whole county from the desert southwest, only a small portion of this area is needed to make a substantial contribution to future U.S. electric needs. Many of the best sites are near existing high-voltage transmission lines and close to major power load centers in the Southwest (Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Phoenix). In addition, the power provided by CSP technologies has strong coincidence with peak electric demand, especially in the Southwest where peak demand corresponds in large part to air conditioning loads. Parabolic troughs currently represent the most cost-effective CSP technology for developing large utility-scale solar electric power systems. These systems are also one of the most mature solar technologies, with commercial utility-scale plants that have been operating for over 20 years. In addition, substantial improvements have been made to the technology in recent years including improved efficiency and the addition of thermal energy storage. The main issue for parabolic trough technology is that the cost of electricity is still higher than the cost of electricity from conventional natural gas-fired power plants. Although higher natural gas prices are helping to substantially reduce the difference between the cost of electricity from solar and natural gas plants, in the near-term increased incentives such as the 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) are needed to make CSP technology approach competitiveness with natural gas power on a financial basis. In the longer term, additional reductions in the cost of the technology will be necessary. This paper looks at the near-term potential for parabolic trough technology to compete with conventional fossil power resources in the firm, intermediate load power market and at the longer term potential to compete in the baseload power market. The paper will consider the potential impact of a reduced carbon emissions future.

The European Commission has set an objective of 10% of Natural Gas consumption for the transport sector by 2020. In a sustainable development view, both vehicle emissions and energy supply chain analysis from well to wheel must be addressed. Even if the main focus today is on CO2 emissions, it is interesting to evaluate the pollutant emissions of the whole Well to Wheel chain. Besides, as the potential of reducing pollutant emissions of vehicle (due to the improvement of engines and severization of norms), looking at pollutant emissions of the Well to Tank part of the chain could show the possible further improvements. Former studies exist, comparing Natural Gas to conventional and non conventional fuels. This paper presents in the first part results from major studies. Then the study conducted by IFP in partnership with AFGNV (French Vehicle Natural Gas Association) is highlighted. This study deals with a comparative Life Cycle Analysis of Natural Gas, diesel oil and gasoline fuels looking at the French and the European situation. For the ""Tank to Wheel"" study, new data for vehicle emissions have been used based on a French medium-class sedan vehicle, both measured and modeled. For the ""Well to Tank"" part of the study, a detailed modeling of the energy consumption and air emissions has been set along the whole supply chain. The results concern WTW non renewable energy consumptions, GHG emissions and local pollutant emissions. Local pollutant have a lower impact in the Natural Gas pathway than in the gasoline or diesel oil pathways. The relative contribution of upstream (well to tank) and downstream (tank to wheel) parts depends on the pathway. Finally a sensitivity analysis is presented and uncertainties are evaluated. The more sensitive parameters are losses during Natural Gas transport and energy consumption at different steps. As a conclusion, the potential GHG emissions reduction derived from the European objective of 10% contribution of Natural Gas in the energy mix for transport sector is investigated. Related GHG emissions reduction could reach 4,5 Mt CO2 equivalent in 2010 in France, which represents around 30% of target of the total GHG emissions reduction supposed to be achieved in France in the transport sector by 2010.

Climate change generates variation in ice and snow cove r phenology, thickness and texture that triggers a broad spectrum of physical,chemical and biotic responses (Quayle et al. 2002). Changes in community structure and dynamics caused by these environmental responses are early symptoms of an ecological impact of climate change. The simple character of Arctic and Alpine lake communities, with a small number of species arranged along few trophic levels, facilitates detection of such structural changes and permits detailed studies of dynamics. The sharp influence of climate and simple community structure, combined with the opportunity of tracking past ecological change using paleoecological records (Smol et al. 2005), make Arctic and Alpine lakes suitable ecosystems for an early, reliable assessment of ecological impacts of global climate change. Global climate change is expected to modify the range and phenology of many terrestrial and aquatic species (Parmesan and Yohe 2003). Projections of the future impact of climate change on biodiversity, based on species-area relationships (Rosenzweig 1995) and the assumption that climate determines present distributions, stress how climate induced range alteration will greatly enhance the risk of extinction for many species (Thomas et al. 2004). Meanwhile, range expansion and changes in phenology consistent with global warming scenarios are being documented for an increasing number of taxa (Root et al. 2003). The above assessments of ecological impact of climate change are mainly based on comparative studies from tropical and temperate regions, the focus of past research efforts. Evaluation of an impact of recent climate change on Arctic and Alpine communities must rely on evidence that is more sparse or indirect. Information needed for the extrapolation of climate impact scenarios in Arctic and Alpine systems is richer, for it includes data from lower latitudes and altitudes that may be assumed to reproduce relevant aspects of future environmental conditions. Arctic and Alpine lakes are characterized by an extended period of ice cover, cold water and low production. Warming results in anticipated ice melt and delayed ice formation (Magnuson et al. 2000), and in increased water temperature (Schindler 1997). The resulting prolonged ice-free season, stronger thermal stratification and enhanced nutrient resuspension are expected to increase lake production (Rouse et al. 1997). Further increases in production may derive from indirect effects of warming on external inputs of nutrients and organic carbon (Quayle et al. 2002). The above changes in environmental conditions may also shift the main contribution to lake production from benthic to pelagic (Korhola et al. 2002). Increased temperature and production will facilitate successful invasion and introduction of species adapted to warmer and more productive waters. The ecological implications of the above environmental changes, however, reach beyond range alteration driven by physiological limitations. Within a lake, a longer productive season protracts the active period of community members increasing the scope for ecological interactions and ecosystem engineering. By relaxing the physical and energetic limitations on demographic and interaction parameters, and by modifying the nature and structure of interactions, warming resets the internal machinery that drives community dynamics (Harrington et al. 1999, Schmitz et al. 2003). The above qualitative generalization is intended as a reference scenario for the following discussion of climatic impact on phenology and community dynamics of plankton, benthos and fish. The scenario invites some general considerations about impact on biodiversity. Medium term projections (year 2100) rank climate change as a main driver of future biodiversity loss in Arctic and Alpine freshwaters (Sala et al. 2000). Many of the cold stenothermal species populating these regions are relictual endemics that are forced into deep, cool waters of lakes in order to survive. Under warming, the deep refuges would gradually become unbearable due to the higher temperatures and lower oxygen concentrations. Loss of even a few endemic species will have a strong impact on regional diversity, considering that high altitudes and latitudes have relatively few species to begin with (Lomolino 2001, Willig et al. 2003). Empirical, hump shaped relations between productivity and species richness in lakes suggest that the expected increase in productivity will be followed by increased species richness (Rosenzweig 1995, Dodson et al. 2000). This does not contradict the expectation of higher exctinction rates given that recipient communities will experience substitutions by exotic species that are expanding their range. The rates of change in species composition and richness may also increase, due to higher propagule pressure. The latter effect is most likely in low latitude Alpine lakes, where the distance between different ecoclimatic regions is short and the species pool at lower altitudes is large. The scenario of a warmer, wetter climate that will increase ice-free season duration, water temperature and productivity of Alpine and Arctic lakes must be treated with caution. The magnitude and even direction of ecological response to climate change will depend on a variety of environmental conditions that were not addressed. Basin morphometry, hydrology, catchment and geographic position are all likely to affect the character of climatic impact and will be considered in more detail below. The literature reviewed includes assessment and prognostic studies of climatic impact on Arctic and Alpine lakes. As mentioned earlier, the evidence of recent ecological changes reported in these studies is seldom direct. Reviews of assessment studies dealing with climatic impact on lakes mainly refer to data collected in temperate regions (Schindler 1997, Straile et al. 2003). In the absence of direct observations, microfossil accumulations in lake sediments provide compelling indication of climate driven ecological change (Smol et al. 2005). Paleolimnological records may even allow the detection of changes in the intensity of ecological interactions, as in the case of fish predation on the planktonic prey Daphnia (Jeppesen et al. 2002).",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57449094927

The inverse approach is an alternative to statistical downscaling of global circulation model outputs, typically used in climate change studies. At the core of the inverse approach is a weather generator model that uses locally observed climate data, together with outputs from global circulation models, to generate an arbitrary long record of regional climatic conditions. A base case and two climate scenarios are produced by a weather generator, whose output is used as input into: (a) an event hydrologic model (for high flows); and (b) a continuous hydrologic model (for low flows). Changing hydrologic conditions are identified through frequency analysis for both flood and low flow hydrographs (obtained as outputs from hydrologic models). Changes in local water resources management practices, guidelines and design standards are recommended on the basis of the analysis of altered climates and their impacts on the hydrologic flow regime. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Hydrology; River basin projects; Climatic conditions; Frequency analysis; Hydrologic models; River basin; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38749124766

It is especially applicable to small communities of a just few people to a population equivalent (p.e) up to 4000. In this paper, biological nutrient removal using SBR technology in a single reactor is presented. Biological nutrient removal requires a sequence of anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic phases with multiple feeding events over one cycle. This filling strategy was adapted to enhance denitrification and phosphate release, using the easily biodegradable organic matter from the wastewater. In spite of using this feeding strategy, the organic matter concentration can be insufficient. The results show that biological nutrient removal was successfully achieved by using only one reactor, working with a low organic matter concentration in the influent (C/N/P ratio of 100:12:1.8). Nevertheless, when the C/P ratio was lower than 36 g COD·g-1 P-PO4, an accumulation of phosphate was observed. After that, the system responded quickly and returned to ideal conditions (C/P ratio of 67 g COD·g-1 P-PO4), taking only 15 days to achieve the complete nutrient removal. Furthermore, the operational conditions and the synthetic wastewater used conferred a selective advantage to polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) over glycogen accumulating non-poly-P organisms (GAOs) as shown by the FISH analysis performed. © IWA Publishing 2007.","C/P and C/N/P ratios; Nutrient removal; PAOs; SBRs; Step-feed strategy","Carbon; Denitrification; Phosphates; Removal; Wastewater treatment; Biological nutrient removal; Polyphosphate accumulating organism; Sequencing batch reactors; Batch reactors; carbon; nitrogen; organic matter; phosphate; Batch reactors; Carbon; Denitrification; Phosphates; Removal; Wastewater treatment; biological method; bioreactor; denitrification; nutrient; phosphate (organic); pollutant removal; waste treatment; wastewater; biodegradation; carbon source; chemical oxygen demand; conference paper; controlled study; denitrification; fluorescence in situ hybridization; nutrient content; organic nutrient; sequencing batch reactor; waste component removal; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biomass; Bioreactors; Carbon; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Water Purification",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248571556

This paper traces the history of contaminated gas production and explores the reasons why it has now become a focus for many countries. The paper also addresses the significant technical, commercial and safety challenges that face developments of contaminated gas fields. In many cases, fields with high CO2 contamination cannot be developed economically without the introduction of new technology to both reduce costs and the amount of energy required to separate CO2 from methane, and then sequester it safely below ground. For H2S contaminated gas fields, the challenges appear even greater. The extreme corrosiveness and toxicity of H2S requires the application of state-of-the art technology and operating procedures. There is simply no room for mistakes. sulfur management is also an issue that requires new approaches as planned developments will double globally traded volumes over the next ten year. The paper will outline the advantages and disadvantages of disposal options from blocking, Acid Gas Injection (AGI) and the application of new sulfur products such as sulfur cement (which is resistive to corrosive environments), enhanced asphalt (for hardwearing road applications) and sulfur fertilizer (with 15% greater yields). Indeed, the application of new sulfur technology has the potential to turn a global surplus of sulfur into valuable new products. With many hundreds of tcf of contaminated gas resources worldwide, there is no doubt the industry will rise to the challenge and develop these resources in an economic and safe manner. But it will require the application of radical new technology and an integrated approach across the full value chain. It won't be for the faint hearted.

Windmill pumps could be of interest under the CDM because they directly displace greenhouse gas emissions while contributing to sustainable rural development. This study aims to assess the maximum theoretical as well as the realistically achievable CDM potential of windmill pumps in India. Design/methodology/approach - To estimate the CDM potential of windmill pumps in case of electricity replacement (by the substitution of electric motor pumps) regional baseline(s) has been used whereas in case of diesel replacement (by the substitution of diesel engine pumps) the IPCC emission factor(s) has been used. The authors have analyzed the financial feasibility of five designs of windmill pumps at ten select locations in India to justify the financial additionality of windmill pump-based CDM projects. To analyze the future dissemination levels of windmill pumps logistic growth model has been used. Findings - The annual CO2 emissions mitigation potential through windmill pumps in India could theoretically reach five million tones. Under more realistic assumptions about diffusion of windmill pumps based on past experiences with the government-run programmes, annual CER volumes by 2012 could reach 13,000-46,000 and 0.07-0.3 million by 2020. This would require that the government sets the subsidy level for windmill pumps at a level that allows them to become viable with the CER revenue. From a macro-economic point of view, this makes sense if the sustainability benefits are deemed sufficiently high to warrant promotion of this project type. Originality/value - The paper illustrates the vast theoretical potential of CO2 mitigation by using windmill pumps for irrigation water pumping in India.","Energy; India; Irrigation works; Pumps","Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Pumps; Sustainable development; Wind power; Clean development mechanism; Greenhouse gas emission; Windmill pumps; Energy management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250718543

The duality of the issue makes the climate change policy often waver between domestic and international emphases. In the past one and a half decades, the central government emphasized mostly on responding to international pressure by participating in negotiations in international treaties. However, the nation, as well as the world, will probably benefit more by taking a more proactive attitude towards mitigation and adaptation to climate change. This paper described the current governance structure for climate change management in China and made concrete recommendations for its improvement. The most urgent recommendation is to improve the cooperation of current National Coordination Committee on Climate Change with authority for policy- making and to oversee climate change.

In the combined cycles, the topping cycle consists of a gas turbine, while the bottoming cycle is a steam cycle, utilizing the heat from MSW combustion. Comprehensive simulations were made to analyze the viability of the combined cycles and their thermodynamic advantages over conventional incineration of MSW. The results showed that the hybrid combined cycles could offer dramatically higher efficiency for power production and provide practical solutions to problems typically associated with MSW. The environmental impact has been examined and it is shown that the combined cycles could provide an effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The reduced catalyst yielded carbon monoxide as a product. The influence of the temperature was also investigated. At temperatures below the ignition point of the reaction, the catalyst was in an oxidized state. At temperatures above the ignition point, the catalyst was reduced.

Abatement costs are calculated with respect to a baseline, for which we have chosen the EIA forecast of the Annual Energy Outlook 2005. The emissions data are expressed as equivalent CO2, including CH4 and N2O; they also include upstream emissions, e.g. for fuel production. We also estimate the potential near-term emission reductions, as well as the uncertainties in abatement cost and reduction potential.

In CCS schemes, carbon dioxide is captured from anthropogenic sources and transported to suitable sites either for EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) or storage. Globally, the largest source of CO2 is from power generation, therefore the initial projects proposed for CCS in the UK are from power plant. There are various technologies for capturing CO2 from power stations, however the captured CO2 can contain significant amounts of impurities. The presence of the impurities in the CO2 stream has an effect on the requirements for pipeline transportation and can change such factors as the flow properties, the decompression characteristics and the solubility of water in the mixture. Although transport of CO2 by pipeline is not new technology, and has been implemented in the USA for over 30 years, the effect of these impurities is not fully understood. The UK is in the advantageous position of having natural sinks for CO2 available offshore in the North and Irish Sea, which can be used for either EOR or storage. Therefore CCS implementation in the UK will involve transport of anthropogenic carbon dioxide from power stations to offshore sinks. All of the current experience with CO2 pipeline transport has been onshore, predominantly from near pure natural sources and therefore this is also a new challenge. This state-of the-art review paper will: discuss the key technical factors presented by the transport of CO2 from power plant, including the effects of impurities on the design and operation of pipelines, compare and contrast the current experience of transporting CO2 onshore with the proposed transport onshore and offshore in the UK and identify the technical and regulatory challenges, present the results of initial modelling work to demonstrate the effects of the key variables on the development of a CO 2 transport system in the UK.

A good number of patented feed-gasifiers are commercially available. Once coal or other feed is gasified, the elemental sulfur is removed from syngas and, then it is possible to remove the carbon-dioxide (a greenhouse gas) as required by the upcoming local, state, and federal environmental regulations. Currently, the syngas with the carbon-dioxide is fired in the stationary combustion turbines (CTs) to produce power. IGCC process is, currently, the preferred choice over conventional thermal power production in regard to cleanup of fuel and significantly reduced contaminant emissions. The air permitting requirements include the review of: feed preparation and PM emissions; feed gasification and contaminant emissions; elemental sulfur recovery and SO2 emissions; options for carbon-dioxide recovery; syngas characteristics for combustion; CT design and combustion mechanisms; air contaminant emissions of CT; controlled CT emissions of nitrogen-oxides and carbon-monoxide gases using the SCR and oxidation catalysts, respectively; and, emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). However, the IGCC processes are being rigorously reviewed for the system integration and reliability, and significant reduction of air contaminant emissions (including the greenhouse gases). This paper included a review of IGCC air contaminant emission rates, and various applicable regulatory requirements, such as NSR (New Source Review), NSPS (New Source Performance Standards), and MACT (maximum achievable control technology). The IGCC facility's NOX, CO, SO2, PM, VOCs, and HAPs emission rates would be significantly low.

However, Method 9 was neither designed nor intended by the EPA to be used to determine the visible opacity levels associated with fugitive emissions. Maintenance of Department of Defense (DoD) weapon systems, battlefield training exercises and construction/demolition activities invariably lead to the generation of fugitive emissions. DoD reliance on Method 9 for certifying compliance with fugitive emissions opacity regulations leaves installations and their vital combat readiness programs vulnerable to unnecessarily restrictive regulatory oversight including environmental enforcement actions. Recently, the DoD, working in conjunction with the EPA and several western states, has embarked on a technology field demonstration program focused on evaluating the ability of the Digital Opacity Compliance System (DOCS) to reliably determine the visible opacity associated with fugitive emissions. The DOCS technology utilizes digital photographs taken by standard commercial-off-the-shelf digital cameras to determine visible opacity. The photographs are analyzed using an innovative yet simple computer algorithm that compares the differences in spatial color intensity between scenes with and without the presence of fugitive emissions to quantify the level of visible opacity. Using an industrial fog generator to produce fugitive emissions of variable density, a field comparison of the DOCS technology and Method 9 was conducted at Hill Air Force Base, UT. Results demonstrated that the two methods yielded mixed findings under turbulent wind conditions. In the first set of opacity measurements (i.e., taken at 30 foot off-set distance), the DOCS technology and Method 9-certified observers were found to generate opacity measurements that were statistically different and that, on average, indicated that the DOCS technology consistently yielded a higher opacity value. The fact that all three digital camera/Method 9 stations generated similar results suggests that the downwind location did not affect the performance of one method more than the other. To document the inherent variability of the individual test methods, the average standard deviation of the opacity measurements was estimated. At an off-set distance of 30 feet, all DOCS Camera/Method 9 opacity stations reported DOCS opacity measurements that were less variable than Method 9 opacity results regardless of down wind distance. As the off-set distance was increased, the variability and inconsistency in performance between the DOCS technology and Method 9-certified observers increased. Preliminary evaluation of the field data suggests that development of a fugitive emissions opacity method must take into account the impact of local climatic conditions (e.g. wind shear) on opacity determination. Moreover, method development must also balance the need to comply with prescribed regulatory protocols (e.g., maintaining sun's position to the back of the opacity observer) when determining the visible opacity associated with fugitive emissions.",,"Algorithms; Densitometers; Digital cameras; Electric equipment protection; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental regulations; Industrial emissions; Photography; Regulatory compliance; Testing; Video cameras; Waste management; Commercial off-the-shelf digital camera; Demonstration programs; Department of Defense; Digital photographs; Environmental enforcement; Inherent variability; Regulatory oversight; US Environmental Protection Agency; Opacity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933515789

An idealised model of biosphere-human interactions provides an example of a harvester system, and a model of plant and soil carbon dynamics exemplifies a processor system. The biosphere-human interaction model exhibits a number of features in accord with experience, including a tendency towards oscillatory behaviour which in some circumstances results in limit cycles. The plant-soil carbon model is used to study the effect of random forcing of production (for example by weather and climate fluctuations), showing that with appropriate parameter choices the model can flip between active-biosphere and dormant-biosphere equilibria under the influence of random forcing. This externally-driven transition between locally stable states is fundamentally different from Lorenzian chaos. A behavioural difference between two-component processor and harvester systems is that harvester systems have a capacity for oscillatory behaviour while processor systems do not.",,"biosphere; carbon cycle; model; nature-society relations; resource use; soil carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33847714746

The first hurdle is one of awareness. Many people simply do not pay attention to the issues involved in energy or environmental policy and so are unaware of many of the issues of concern relevant to climate policy. There is a relatively small informed audience for many policy questions. Researchers have concluded that fewer than one-fifth of the U.S. residents meet a minimal standard of civic scientific literacy. Given the low level of attentiveness to science or environmental issues among even highly educated members of the public, it is not surprising that many people have fundamental misunderstandings of the basic scientific facts. As part of its studies of environmental literacy, the National Environmental Education and Training Foundation (NEETF) has sought to develop a set of knowledge questions on basic environmental and energy facts. Not only science or technology but policy is also the subject of misunderstanding. Understanding the impact of information is critical for complicated technical questions that are subject to many misconceptions. Education clearly has a role to play.

The model estimates emissions in various forms, including those from wood products contained in Australia, encompassing both domestically produced (net of exports) and imported wood products. This estimate is the basis of Australia's National Greenhouse Gas Inventory report on wood products. The model can also estimate emissions from all (and only) wood products produced in Australia, and a third variant that presumes emissions from wood products at the time of harvest. The model represents a collaborative effort, involving relevant Commonwealth and state government agencies, industry groups and research bodies. The model uses available statistics on log flows from forest harvest and estimates of the carbon content of the various wood products processed (for example, sawn timber, plywood, pulp and paper and woodchips) to determine carbon inputs to wood products. The model uses estimates of the decay period of various classes of wood product to calculate the pool of carbon in wood products. Crosschecking with independent input data was done wherever possible to test the robustness of various input data used in the model development. The model is built in Microsoft Excel with all rate and age parameters easily accessed and varied for sensitivity testing using the @Risk software. Wood products in use are assigned to young-, medium-and old-age pools. Simulated losses of wood products from their service life occur from each of the young-, medium-and old-age pools. Material leaving service is either transferred to bioenergy, added to landfill, recycled or emitted to the atmosphere. Losses of carbon can also occur from the landfill pool. The recorded imports and exports of wood products are used to calculate emissions under two approaches. The first is from wood products produced in Australia (but not necessarily remaining within Australia), and the second from wood products stored in Australia (wherever they were produced). Further simulations, with and without consideration of storage and emissions from landfill, are then run for each approach. The results show that an accounting approach that presumes emissions from wood products at harvest over-estimates emissions to the atmosphere when compared with approaches that consider the service life of wood products. The storage of wood products in landfill is also significant. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Australia; Carbon; Flow; Forest products; Greenhouse gases; Lifespan; Models; Stocks","Australia; Carbon; Pulp; Statistical methods; Government agencies; Harvested wood products; Stocks; Wood products; Forest Products; Greenhouse Gases; Wood Products",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547190105

South of the present-day position of the Antarctic Polar Front in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean, biogenic opal is generally much more abundant in sediments during interglacials compared to glacials. To the north, an anti-phased relationship is observed, with maximum opal abundance instead occurring during glacials. This antagonistic response of sedimentary properties provides an important model validation target for testing hypotheses of glacial-interglacial change against, particularly for understanding the causes of the concurrent variability in atmospheric CO2. Here, I illustrate a time-dependent modelling approach to helping understand climates of the past by means of the mechanistic simulation of marine sediment core records. I find that a close match between model-predicted and observed down-core changes in sedimentary opal content can be achieved when changes in seasonal sea-ice extent are imposed, whereas the predicted sedimentary response to iron fertilization on its own is not consistent with sedimentary observations. The results of this sediment record model-data comparison supports previous inferences that the changing cryosphere is the primary driver of the striking features exhibited by the paleoceanographic record of this region.",,"biogeochemical cycle; climate modeling; core analysis; glacial-interglacial cycle; marine sediment; meridional circulation; Neogene; paleoceanography; paleoclimate; polar front; silica; time dependent behavior; Atlantic Sector; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547144186

Here we describe the ocean carbon cycle, which in its first incarnation is based around a simple single nutrient (phosphate) control on biological productivity. The addition of calcium carbonate preservation in deep-sea sediments and its role in regulating atmospheric CO2 is presented elsewhere (Ridgwell and Hargreaves, 2007). We have calibrated the model parameters controlling ocean carbon cycling in GENIE-1 by assimilating 3-D observational datasets of phosphate and alkalinity using an ensemble Kalman filter method. The calibrated (mean) model predicts a global export production of particulate organic carbon (POC) of 8.9 PgC yr-1, and reproduces the main features of dissolved oxygen distributions in the ocean. For estimating biogenic calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) production, we have devised a parameterization in which the CaCO3POC export ratio is related directly to ambient saturation state. Calibrated global CaCO3 export production (1.2 PgC yr -1) is close to recent marine carbonate budget estimates. The GENIE-1 Earth system model is capable of simulating a wide variety of dissolved and isotopic species of relevance to the study of modern global biogeochemical cycles as well as past global environmental changes recorded in paleoceanographic proxies. Importantly, even with 12 active biogeochemical tracers in the ocean and including the calculation of feedbacks between atmospheric CO2 and climate, we achieve better than 1000 years per (2.4 GHz) CPU hour on a desktop PC. The GENIE-1 model thus provides a viable alternative to box and zonally-averaged models for studying global biogeochemical cycling over all but the very longest (&gt; 1000000 year) time-scales.",,"air-sea interaction; alkalinity; biogeochemical cycle; calcium carbonate; calibration; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; chemical oceanography; data assimilation; deep-sea sediment; dissolved oxygen; Kalman filter; parameterization; particulate organic carbon; phosphate; remote sensing; three-dimensional modeling; timescale",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846606045

Over the past decade, a consortium of California air districts have developed and improved this model. URBEMIS, which is a free, public- domain software package, generates estimates of a project's construction, area, and operational emissions. The software can also be used to estimate mitigated emissions. URBEMIS is most often used to prepare project specific emission inventories needed for environmental impact reports and to comply with indirect source rules. The model allows users to quickly generate air emission estimates that would result from residential, commercial, and/or industrial land uses. The most recent update of the model allows the user to make daily and annual emission estimates of reactive organic gases (ROG), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxides (SO2), carbon dioxide (CO2) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) emissions (both exhaust and fugitive dust). URBEMIS allows the user to generate construction emissions for demolition, site grading, and building construction phases. Construction equipment associated with each phase is based on project type, size, and location. The model has recently been updated to use the California Air Resources Board's OFFROAD2007 model to estimate off-road equipment emissions. URBEMIS has also recently been updated to use the California Air Resource Board's EMFAC2007 model to estimate on-road vehicle emissions. URBEMIS also incorporates mitigation measures that adjust vehicle trips and trip lengths based on a project's smart growth characteristics. Such characteristics include the ratio of residential units to near-by employment, the presence of retail land uses, proximity to transit service, presence of bike and pedestrian facilities, transportation demand management options, and the project's parking supply. © 2007 by the Air & Waste Management Association.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Construction equipment; Crashworthiness; Environmental impact; Exhaust gases; Grading; Highway administration; Housing; Industrial emissions; Land use; Motor transportation; Nitrogen; Off road vehicles; Open source software; Sulfur dioxide; Building construction; California Air Resource Board; California Air Resources Board; Development project; Emission inventories; Mitigation measures; On-road vehicle emissions; Transportation demand management; Waste management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649178292

The ratio between particulate organic carbon (POC) and particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) of exported material was taken as an indicator of the impact of the biological pump on the oceanic uptake of atmospheric CO2. The results indicate that the biological pump is most effective in nitrogen-limited systems in which the availability of dissolved silica allows diatoms to play an important but not necessarily a dominant role within the plankton community. Accordingly, the biological pump can even be more efficient in oligotrophic systems than in eutrophic upwelling areas. A comparison with results obtained from other sediment trap experiments in the northern Indian Ocean reveals the highest annual mean POC/PIC ratios in the northern Bay of Bengal. The high POC/PIC ratios have been attributed to the impact of river discharges on the plankton community structure. The climate anomaly El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) seems to influence the efficiency of the biological pump in the northern Bay of Bengal via its impact on the precipitation rates and consequently on the river discharge. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis of rubber effluent showed that it contains N, P, K, Ca Mg, Fe Mn, Zn and slightly acidic. It was also observed that the effluent had a pungent odour and colourless. In the first cropping, soil pH, N, Ca, Mg, K Na, Na, Fe, Mn, ECEC and Exchangeable acidity increased while the P and % carbon were reduced compared with control. In the second cropping, all the nutrient elements were reduced further. In the nutrient content of Maize, N, P increased up to 200,0001/(30 kg ha-1) while Ca, Na, Mg, K increased up to 2000001 (60 kg ha-1). The trace elements content were not consistent. Similar trends were also recorded in the second cropping but the nutrient contents were reduced further. The N, P, K, Ca, Na, Al, Fe, Zn and Mn uptake were higher at 150,0001 (30 kg ha-1) while the Mg uptake was higher at 250,0001 (120 kg ha-1) At final harvest, 150,0001 (30 kg ha-1) was significantly (p&lt;0.05) better than other treatments including control in plant height, collar girth and leaf area.

However, the beneficial effects of incorporating tunnels as solutions in traffic flow problems must be weighed up against the potential adverse effects of air exhaust emissions from vehicles, both in-tunnel and ambient air quality effects on the surrounding community. Various systems can be applied to upgrade the quality of the environment around tunnels and roads by making use of technologies such as movement and control, purification, and control and measurement. Air exhaust emissions can be substantially reduced by a correctly designed ventilation system and a variety of other methods including tall ventilation exhaust stacks, filter dust collector systems, electrostatic precipitators or denitrification or a ventilation control and measurement system based on the traffic volume and the polluted conditions in a tunnel at any point in time. The effective dispersion, dilution and achievement of satisfactory ground level concentrations of key air quality parameters (CO,NO2 and particulates)for these exhaust gases is essential to ensure non-negative health effects on the surrounding community. The paper will identify and discuss the types and character of air emissions, controls, the efficiency of the various control measures and estimated costs of some systems. Progress has been made in the field of emission treatment technology and viable technologies are now available to remove suspended particles, nitrogen dioxide, some portion of other oxides of nitrogen, and hydrocarbon vapours from road tunnel exhaust air.","Air exhaust emissions; Air quality effects; Costs; Denitrification; Efficiency; Electrostatic precipitators; Filter dust collector systems; Road tunnels; Ventilation exhaust stacks","Constraint theory; Denitrification; Exhaust gases; Highway traffic control; Air exhaust emissions; Air quality effects; Road tunnels; Ventilation exhaust stacks; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44349143902

Very small gas turbines (ie. less than 10 kW) have been investigated periodically over the years, mainly for potential military use, but to date have not found a niche. This could well change with over 20 states now having instigated idling regulations that limit or prohibit heavy duty truck diesel engine idling. With emphasis on reducing emissions and noise levels this essentially implies that in the future a small APU will be required to provide the truck's stationary electrical needs and cabin climate control. While there will be several power source types vying for this potentially large market, a small gas turbine APU is viewed as having attractive features which include low emissions, low acoustic signature, vibration-free operation, compact and light weight package, obviates the need for oil lubrication and liquid coolant systems, ease of cold weather starting, immediate response, and the use of fuel from the truck tank. In this paper a small recuperated gas turbine APU concept rated at 5kW is discussed including component design considerations, layout features, engine performance, and target cost. The conservative design of the APU is based on the use of existing materials and state-of-the-art gas turbine technology, and is amenable to high volume automated manufacturing processes. A competitive cost is projected if the proposed APU of modular construction was fabricated in large quantities like the production of vehicular turbochargers in Europe.

The results suggest that mire formation, fire frequency and humidity are the most important forcing factors on millennial timescales. Mires produce humic acids that become available to the lakes, whereas fires may reduce the pool of carbon in the catchments, and humidity controls the transportation of allochthonous carbon into the lakes. Vegetation development and temperature as sole factors are of minor importance for the TOC concentrations in these lakes on a millennial timescale. Two of the sites indicate that liming and possibly fish introduction and rotenone treatment in recent time has led to increased TOC, color and pH in the lake water, and changed the diatom community composition to an assemblage that has never been present before. Given the predicted climate change scenario that suggests a more humid climate, expanding mires and less frequent fires, our paleolimnological data suggest that TOC concentrations can be expected to increase in boreal forest lakes in the future. Since super-saturation and emission of CO 2 from lakes is correlated to the TOC concentration of lake water, higher TOC concentrations may lead to increased emission of CO2 from lakes to the atmosphere.",,"charcoal; climate change; climate effect; community composition; concentration (composition); diatom; fire history; fish; Holocene; infrared spectroscopy; lacustrine deposit; mire; organic carbon; pollen; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden; Bacillariophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36248934254

Upfront capital costs, both truck-side and facilityside, were tracked along with operational cost savings due to reduced outlays for fuel and engine maintenance. This study estimated the emissions benefit of TSE and e-TRUs for the full spectrum of criteria pollutants - nitrogen oxides, diesel particulate matter and sulfur oxides - along with reactive organic gases, greenhouse gases and petroleum use. Results were estimated for three scenario years (2010, 2015, and 2020) and for two cases: an expected case, which assumes a natural level of market penetration, and an achievable case, which presumes the existence of aggressive public policies to support alternative transportation fuels. This study found that the adoption of TSE and e-TRUs results in cost-effective emission reductions for both pollutants and greenhouse gases due to their favorable life cycle economics. TSE in particular is estimated to offer environmental benefits at a net negative cost after accounting for fuel savings and reduced maintenance. Significantly, both TSE and e-TRUs are expected to be even more cost-effective in states that have not regulated diesel emissions as aggressively as California. At the same time, we believe that incentives to speed up the adoption of these technologies are warranted given a lack of consumer awareness of their benefits and the significant societal costs associated with the use of diesel engines.","Environmental impact; Heavy-duty vehicles; Lifecycle cost; Transport refrigeration units; Truck stop electrification","California; Capital costs; Consumer awareness; Cost saving; Diesel emission; Diesel particulate matters; Electric transport; Emission reduction; Engine maintenance; Environmental benefits; Fuel savings; Full spectrum; Heavy duty trucks; Heavy duty vehicles; Lifecycle costs; Market penetration; Societal costs; Sulfur oxide; Transport refrigeration units; Transportation fuels; Alternative fuels; Automobiles; Cost accounting; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Diesel engines; Electric drives; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Exhibitions; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Maintenance; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Refrigeration; Sulfur; Sustainable development; Truck transportation; Trucks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872021804

The overall objectives were to improve health and safety in a mining environment and reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) production in the Canadian mining industry. The study was conducted in a quarry located in Nova Scotia, Canada, with the objective of taking advantage of the higher accuracy and flexibility of electronic detonators towards improving blast efficiency and measuring its impact on productivity in a quarry environment and energy savings. Optimising the blast sequence was the first aspect to be considered before starting to look at designing bigger blasts and achieving productivity improvements, without creating additional environmental concerns, as the quarry's location was representing a challenge in itself in the surrounding community. The use of high-speed cameras (500 fps) was an improved means of analysing blast dynamics during the firing sequence. Seismic monitoring and linear superposition techniques were also applied to validate the sequences to be tested in all three specific geological areas. The combination of field measurements allowed to identify the optimal blasting sequences that would then be delivered accurately with the electronic initiation systems. The data from 12 blasts (six with electronic detonators and six with pyrotechnic detonators) carried out in three different geological formations (soft, medium and hard rock) showed that the electronic blasting technology could increase rock fragmentation by 15 to 20 per cent. A more uniform distribution of rock fragment size was also obtained. Blast improvements on downstream processes resulted in a five per cent productivity increase in rock excavation and transportation, a ten. per cent energy reduction in primary crushing and a 15 per cent increase in the primary crusher throughput. A prototype soft-sensor based on primary crusher data (eg energy consumption, throughput, feed and product size distribution) and a simplified computer process model were developed for online measurement of a rock operating work index. Furthermore, rock samples were collected and specimens were prepared in order to determine the tensile and compressive strength of the rock materials, evaluate the aggregate crashing work index and examine the development of micro and macro-fractures under binocular and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Blast-induced rock damage was evaluated at the end of the laboratory testing program. A reduction in rock hardness by about 30 per cent was observed after blasting. However, the impact of the blasting method (eg using electronic versus pyrotechnic detonators) on the induced rock damage was either absent or not perceptible within the measurement technique accuracy and the number of samples analysed.",,"Blasting; Compressive strength; Crushers; Crushing; Crystallography; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Excavation; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrial research; Lithology; Mineralogy; Mining; Mining machinery; Open pit mining; Productivity; Project management; Quarries; Rock mechanics; Rocks; Scanning electron microscopy; Silica; Silicate minerals; Strength of materials; Technology; Testing; Blast dynamics; Blasting technologies; Computer processes; Downstream processes; Dyno nobel; Electronic detonators; Electronic initiation systems; Energy consumptions; Energy reductions; Energy savings; Environmental concerns; Field measurements; Firing sequences; Geological areas; Geological formations; Greenhouse gasses; Ground controls; Hard rocks; Health and safeties; Linear superpositions; Measurement techniques; Mineral processing; Mining environments; Mining industries; Nova scotias; Online measurements; Open pits; Primary crushers; Product size distributions; Productivity improvements; Productivity increases; Pyrotechnic detonators; Reduction processes; Research projects; Rock damages; Rock excavations; Rock fragmentations; Rock fragments; Rock hardnesses; Rock materials; Rock quarries; Rock samples; Seismic monitoring; Soft sensors; Speed cameras; Sustainable energies; Testing programs; Underground minings; Uniform distributions; Minerals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049173231

They are expanded further than renewed. The construction and operation of built environment contribute to the environmental loads. Those who design and purchase building have little or no methods to asses the environmental impact of their actions. Thus, there is a need to study the impact of the building design to the ecosystem and finalize the design rule for Green Building. The qualification of a healthy built environment is judged with respect to several factors and of course parameters where one of them is how it is compatible to the environment with the ecology. Thus while designing a built environment conjoins two disciplines that is subject of architecture and that of ecology. To develop a green building and environmental building is a subject of applied ecology, where the designers understand the constitutions, organization and structure of ecosystems, and their impact of architecture are considered from environmental perspectives. By utilizing the concepts, methods and language of ecology, designers can create architecture that is very much embedded in the site and the surroundings. To asses on the compatibility of the building with the local or regional environment there should be some criteria for assessment, which implies the definition of building design criteria. If we establish the criteria that are based to our best scientific understanding of environmental capacity that we begin to develop a building stock that is sustainable. To do this one must quantify the linkage between the resulting environmental impacts and their cause in building production and use. This are not done in traditional building environmental impact assessment methods, which are based on qualification assumed negative impacts on man made inventions on the natural environment, typically using a code complaint reference building as a standard and improved upon. These indices lack on ecologically derived base line or standard of measure, under which sustainable development can be analyzed and compared with a universal basis. Using ecosystem services as a baseline, a duel-criteria frame can determine the sustainability. Evaluation may be done in terms of input and output. In the first case, the quantities absorbed/consumed from the ecosystem during built up process and in last case the emission from the building systems during operation and use. The input assessment can be defined in terms of mathematical equations considering the ecosystems input and output, are total land, materials, water and energy used. A term ecosystems productivity, i.e. a quantity for carrying earth's environmental carrying capacity will be taken as the reference scale. Those scale will dictate about the quantity of land required to absorb the waste of the materials and ecology from the building to eco systems. An ecologically derived baselines can be used to qualify both positive and negative impacts of buildings which will allow equal base lines of the vastly different types of projects depending upon their locations, types and sizes. The present paper will derive a tool to evaluate the effectiveness of the building design to the environment. The ecosystems service criteria use an objective to develop a shelter which consume low energy from the conventional sources, generate energy to meet its maximum demand, create a clean and safe environment. The details of the relative ecological impact of energy and materials in the built in environment as well as identification of effective strategies for reducing environmental impacts will be discussed in the text of the paper.","Assessment; Building; Eco-system","Assessment; Base line; Biological capacity; Building design; Building stocks; Building systems; Built environment; Design rules; Ecological impacts; Ecosystem services; Environmental capacity; Environmental loads; Green buildings; In-buildings; Input and outputs; Low energies; Material resources; Mathematical equations; Maximum demand; Natural environments; Negative impacts; Traditional buildings; Water and energies; Biological materials; Buildings; Design; Ecosystems; Energy conservation; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Indoor air pollution; Rating; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857469535

The European Union is currently following the same route to check the in-use behaviour of heavy-duty diesel vehicles. The current research programmes tend to demonstrate that both the instrumentation and the test methods are mature for gaseous emissions. For PM emissions, the development of portable PM instruments and their test protocols remain a complex challenge, as simultaneous progress take place in the engine after-treatment technologies and the official homologation procedures (the PMP programme in particular). The present paper discusses the current research strategy proposed in the EU for the development of an on-board PM test protocol. Case studies from the EU-PEMS project are presented. Portable commercial PM instruments are evaluated under controlled laboratory conditions (i.e. on reference test cycles) against reference laboratory instruments using a Euro III heavy-duty engine running on different fuels, including bio-fuel. Other supporting instruments, measuring real-time soot or the total PM composition, are also used. Under these test conditions, the study has demonstrated the equivalency between the tested portable technology and its laboratory counterpart. Another part of the work is to evaluate the applicability of the methodology for on-board testing: results and lessons learned from on board measurements conducted on diesel city buses on urban test routes are presented and discussed showing very good test-to-test repeatability. Issues, such as filter handling and conditioning on board, need particular attention for the adaptation of the test method to the future generations of vehicles.

Several systems are in the development stage and SAIPEM is participating in one of them. The tidal streams are predictable well in advance but are variable along the hours and the days. In order to determine how much energy can be produced during a year, a model has been written. It takes into account the local current characteristics and the astronomical evolution of the tide during a whole year. This model indicates how to select the nominal electrical capacity of the tidal turbine in order to optimize the energy cost of the scheme. The model teaches that a turbine located in a tidal race off the European coast has an equivalent number of producing hours of about 3000h per year as an average. In some locations, the site may be exposed to the swell in addition to the tidal currents. A tidal current turbine reacts almost instantaneously to the velocity variations, because the inertia of the turbine is small compared to the inertia of the water flow crossing the rotor. This results in power fluctuations of a single turbine, at least as long as the water velocity does not exceeds the nominal rating of the machine. Some examples are shown to illustrate the different cases. The local wave climate should be taken into account in order to correct the yearly production on a statistical basis. The potential influence of a strong swell may alter the maximum power predicted based on the sole astronomical parameters. Clusters of tidal turbines have also been studied. The detrimental influence of the swell can be mitigated through an optimum design of the turbine array. When the current is slow and the swell important, the cluster can even produce more energy than without the waves.

The most promising technology to reduce these pollutants turned out to be Lean Premixed (LP) and Lean Premixed Pre-Vaporized (LPP) combustion. However, serious problems concerning combustion-driven instabilities occurred with the implementation of the LP/LPP-concept. Today, prediction and systematic suppression of self-sustained combustion instabilities is an issue still unsolved, due to incomplete understanding of the physical feedback mechanism and the lack of models for dynamic flame response, i.e. frequency dependent characteristics of LP/LPP swirl flames. In that context, the purpose of the current paper is the establishment of a physical model to describe frequency dependent flame dynamics concerning burning velocity of steady-state premixed flames. Derived from that basic understanding, scaling laws for the prediction of unstable operation conditions will be established in dependence on main operation parameters such as thermal load, mixture temperature, air equivalence ratio and especially of fuel and operating pressure. Therefore, a new swirl-burner has been designed, offering the feasibility to choose the type of fuel, to adjust the swirl number for main and pilot burner and the burner exit geometry steplessly and to vary preheating temperatures, air equivalence ratios and thermal loads in a range of industrial relevance for gas turbine applications. To establish a periodical modulation of the mixture mass flow of the main L(P)P flame at the burner outlet sinusoidally in-time with well-defined frequencies and amplitudes, a pulsating unit was used. Using a mixing/ prevaporizing unit to create a time-independent and spatial homogeneous mixture of natural gas/ kerosene vapor and combustion air at the burner outlet, flame transfer functions of LP- and LPP swirl flames depending on main operating parameters were determined. The discussed results then lead to stability map for a given combustion system depending on the main operation parameters based on the knowledge of only one fully-described parameter combination leading to an instable condition. Based on this scaling procedure and confirmed by further experimental work the prediction of stability limits depending especially on the type of fuel, the swirl number and the operating pressure will be possible.

The simulations predict the local species and electron density distributions, as well as the three-demensional morphology and the growth rate of the deposit. Since the process occurs in a high vacuum environment, surface diffusion is considered as the primary transport mode of surface-adsorbed hydrocarbon precursor. The governing surface transport equation (STE) of the adsorbed species is derived and solved numerically. The transport, scattering, and absorption of primary electron as well as secondary electron generation are treated using the Monte Carlo method. Low energy secondary electrons are the major contributors to hydrocarbon decomposition due to their energy range matching peak dissociation reaction cross section energies for precursor molecules. The deposit and substrate are treated as a continuous entity allowing the simulation of the growth of a realistically sized deposit rather than a large number of cells representing each individual atom as in previously published simulations [Mitsuishi, Ultramicroscopy 103, 17 (2005); Silvis-Cividjian, Ph.D. thesis, University of Delft, 2002]. Such formulation allows for simple coupling of the STE with the dynamic growth of the nanopillar.

The scope of the work was to test two strategies for low emissions of harmful gases; lean burn operation and stoichiometric operation with EGR and a three-way catalyst. Most gas engines today, used in city buses, utilize the lean burn approach to achieve low NOx formation and high thermal efficiency. However, the lean burn approach may not be sufficient for future emissions legislation. One way to improve the lean burn strategy is to add hydrogen to the fuel to increase the lean limit and thus reduce the NOx formation without increasing the emissions of HC. Even so, the best commercially available technology for low emissions of NOx, HC and CO today is stoichiometric operation with a three-way catalyst as used in passenger cars. The drawbacks of stoichiometric operation are low thermal efficiency because of the high pumping work, low possible compression ratio and large heat losses. The recirculation of exhaust gas is one way to reduce these drawbacks and achieve efficiencies that are not much lower than the lean burn technology. The experiments revealed that even with the 25 vol% hydrogen mixture, NOx levels are much higher for the lean burn approach than that of the EGR and catalyst approach for this engine. However, a penalty in brake thermal efficiency has to be accepted for the EGR approach as the thermodynamic conditions are less ideal.

Box 330, Newcastle, NSW 2300, Australia","In Australia, a likely option for greenhouse gas mitigation is the sequestration of CO2 in the extensive coal deposits of Sydney and Bowen Basins in Eastern States of Queensland and New South Wales. While significant quantities of Australia coal could be mined in the decades to come, there would be still large volumes which are considered unmineable in the foreseeable future due to their low quality, great depths and the cost of mining. These resources are the main candidates for probable CO2 disposal in Australia. Furthermore Australian coal seams generally contain high volumes of gas; for example at depths of less than 150 m, gas contents range up to ~5 m3/t whereas at 700 m, contents are up to ~25 m3/t. Australian economic size coal seam gas reserves and ever increasing demand for natural gas has pushed the coal seam methane (CSM) production from almost nil in 1995 to some 80-90 PJ/y currently. CSM has become a major commodity in the Australian gas market with about 7% of total gas consumption now being sourced from CSM. Some of the CSM fields in Queensland have been now active for a decade. In these active CSM fields where gas production is diminishing, the injection of CO2 could enhance the recovery of methane while CO 2 can be sequestered in these seams. The gas adsorption capacity of numerous Australian coals has been measured. Based on these measurements and observation of naturally stored CO2 in Australian coal seams a storage capacity of 20 m3/t or higher can be achieved in these seams. A pilot project in Queensland (Fairview Power Project) is now in conception whereby methane is captured from coal seams in Fairview CSM filed, burnt to produce electricity while a third of produced CO2 is to be removed and sequestered in the same coal seams.",,"Australian coals; Gas adsorption capacity; Gas consumption; Gas productions; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Methane recovery; New South Wales; Storage capacity; Coal; Coal deposits; Gas adsorption; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Proven reserves; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877664688

The oil is heavy (12 oAPI) with high viscosity and low solution gas. Primary recovery has been inefficient, less than 2% of OOIP. Over the period of primary recovery, from 1961 to 1986, the reservoir underwent extensive pressure depletion from 1,800 psig to as low as 400 psig in some regions, with a related production decline from a peak of approximately 9,000 Bbls/day to 1600 Bbls/day. In March 1986, a CO2 injection pilot scheme in a 1200 acre area containing 33 wells was initiated in the west portion of the field. The gas injection was initially cyclic; ""huff and puff"" method was applied. Later, in 1988, the gas injection scheme was converted to a CO2 flood process. Later, the process was widespread to cover the whole field. A peak daily production rate 13000 STB/d was achieved in 1993 in comparison to what would have been less than 1600 STB/d without CO2 application. However, since 1995, the field has undergone a progressive production decline to recent levels at approximately 5,500 Bbls/day. Polymer gel treatments were carried out to increase the CO2 sweep efficiency and arrest the decline. Multilateral and horizontal well technology was also applied on pilot scale to reach the bypassed oil. WAG is applied widespread now. Current production is 7000 Bbls/day.

The model integrates the waste streams of mining industries in the Kola Peninsula in such a way that waste from one industrial operator becomes raw material for another. Using a counterfactual method, this article determines the eco-efficiency of the model between the years 1985 and 2005. A parallel study of the eco-efficiency of the actual system, i.e. in the absence of complex utilization, is then performed for the same time period. The study shows that complex utilization would indeed have yielded increased eco-efficiency, even though not all environmentally harmful emissions would have decreased. As a result of market collapse and the use of upstream pollution prevention together with traditional end-of-pipe technologies, however, the actual system shows net emission reductions similar to those modeled in complex utilization. It is suggested that in systems like the mining industry of the Kola Peninsula, with high production volumes and poorly developed environmental technologies, upstream pollution prevention together with traditional end-of-pipe technologies may prove more attractive than industrial symbiosis, despite the substantial increases in eco-efficiency of the latter. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

There is some consensus around its implementation; however, the imprecision of the SD concept causes worldwide debates regarding the diversity of adoption and understanding. In this context, the question is how we can shape the development process in order to make it capable of taking into consideration the local way of becoming sustainable. One recent attempt is the clean development mechanism (CDM) concept. This faces similar problems because the way in which the mechanism is used today does not fulfil its goal of assisting SD. Generally the mechanism is used only to meet the terms for emission reduction described in Article 3 of the Kyoto Protocol and does not contribute to the local society development. Consequently, it is necessary to develop a strategic plan for CDM's future implementation and repair its design failures by evaluating its current performance. An effective mechanism must integrate the socioenvironmental development concept into the implementation strategy. As a result, the new CDM must not only promote strict environmental sustainability, but also contribute to the reduction of poverty and social inequalities. This is because CDM will not be successful in the long term if it does not achieve the integration of social development with reduction of emissions. © 2007 WIT Press.","Clean development mechanism; Socioenvironmental strategic planning; Socioenvironmental sustainability","implementation process; mitigation; performance assessment; reduction; social development; strategic approach; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148966574

The increase in energy demand, combined with high natural gas and oil prices results in increased electric energy generation demand from the coal-fired power plants. This results in increased pollutant emissions, such as NOx, SOx, mercury, heavy metals and particulate matter. With mercury regulations pending and control technologies in the full-scale demonstration stage in the United States (U.S.), measurement of mercury (Hg) in combustion flue gas is of critical importance. The ability to accurately and reliably measure Hg is fundamental to demonstrating compliance when regulations are promulgated and, in the meantime, to ensuring adequate quantification of mercury removal during the demonstration and commercialization of the various mercury control technologies. Mercury monitors, currently commercially available in the U.S., were field-tested at a coal-fired power plant, firing bituminous coals with varying mercury content. In addition, Hg emissions were also measured by the sorbent traps.

Disposal CO 2 from stationary sources into subsurface has been suggested as a possible means for reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. However, much remains to be done in the issues regarding the safety and reliability of CO2 sequestration. In this study, we have developed a simulation code by using the mathematical model of multi-phase multi-component flow in porous media to analyze the flow dynamics in the subsurface. The equation of state for CO2 covering the fluid region from the triple point to supercritical region is employed to model the state of CO2 gas, liquid and supercritical state. The effect of CO2 dissolution in water on the injection behavior is taken into account by using Henry's law extended to CO2/water system. The simulation was implemented under several geological conditions including gas, liquid and supercritical state to analyze optimal injection condition. The injection pressure is lowered at the lower temperature condition and the higher hydrostatic pressure condition. The lower injection pressure may prevent the fracturing of the injection well and excessive permeation of CO2 in the reservoir. The CO2 dissolution is slightly lowering the injection pressure and the effect on the injection pressure is negligible under the realistic hydrostatic pressure and temperature condition. It has been demonstrated that the simulation code developed in this study may be useful to provide fundamental knowledge required for the design of CO2 injection. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.","CO2 dissolution; CO2 geological sequestration; Numerical Simulation; Supercritical CO2",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248172524

The USEPA surface emission isolation flux chamber (flux chamber) was used as the sample collection technology. This direct emission measurement technology was used to assess the flux of study compounds at multiple locations on significant or key sources found on flush-lane dairies in order to determine facility emissions and emission factors per source. The assessment included ammonia (amines), total hydrocarbon compounds, methane, volatile fatty acids (VFAs), alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, phenols, creosols, and semi-volatile organic compounds. Validation of VFA recovery from the chamber was recommended because: VFA recovery can be a surrogate for most other semi-volatile compounds found at dairies; VFAs have been reported as key compounds from feed lot studies; VFA have a low odor threshold; and VFAs were of particular interest to the regulatory community. Given the semi-volatile nature of VFAs and their affinity for surface interaction on sample collection equipment, the project included a validation study where the VFA recovery from the flux chamber was established. Determining the recovery of study compounds from the flux chamber is typically a straight forward process. A compressed-gas standard (primary standard) of the compound of interest is ordered from a specialty gas manufacturer, introduced into the chamber under controlled conditions into the chamber representing typical chamber operation, and the resultant chamber concentration or flux is compared to the known amount of standard addition establishing a 'percent recovery' for the technology, which includes recovery from the chamber, sample collection media, and the analytical system. Unfortunately, there are no standard gases available for VFA compounds, and, as such, validation of VFA recovery from the flux chamber included building, testing, and calibrating a VFA gas generator to be used as a calibrated, secondary standard. The purpose of this paper is to present the validation procedures used, including the design, construction, testing (calibration), and use of a VFA permeation tube-device for the determination of VFA recovery from the USEPA dynamic flux chamber. Four VFAs were selected for the study; acetic acid (dominant compound), butyric acid, propionic acid, and isobutyric acid. Calculations were performed using manufacturer data on the tubes, flux chamber flow rate, and target concentrations as input to the design of the permeation device. Four VFAs and two target levels were selected for the validation. After construction, the permeation tube device was calibrated so that a fixed gas flow though the device with varying water bath temperatures would generate the desired source concentrations that were introduced into the chamber. Validation testing included operating the permeation tube device generating source target levels, introduction of the source gas at low flow into the flux chamber simulating typical operation, measurement of the source gas flow and concentration into the chamber (known emission), and typical chamber operation and sampling using carbopac solid sorbent assessing chamber concentration or emissions. The analyses used included USEPA Method TO-17; thermal desorption and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry for lower level samples, and MODIFIED METHOD TO-8 HPLC/Impinger collection for some of the higher level samples. Sample collection was performed both directly from the chamber and from an eight foot length of 1/4"" diameter Teflon tubing simulating field sample collection. The recovery of target VFAs was calculated by comparing the chamber recovery of VFAs to the standard addition of VFAs. Permeation tube device specifications, operational conditions, and chamber recoveries for the standard compounds are presented in the paper, and the efficacy of using the USEPA flux chamber technology demonstrated.",,"Air and Waste Management Association; Air emissions; Area sources; Butyric acids; Compressed gases; Controlled conditions; Dynamic flux chambers; Emission factors; Emission measurements; Flux chambers; Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; Gas flowing; Hydrocarbon compounds; Isobutyric acid; Low flows; Operational conditions; Primary standards; Propionic acids; Quality measurements; Sample collection; Secondary standard; Semi-volatile compounds; Semi-volatile organic compounds; Solid sorbents; Source gases; Standard additions; Surface emissions; Surface interactions; Target levels; Teflon tubing; Total hydrocarbon; Validation studies; Validation testing; Volatile fatty acid; Volatile fatty acids; Water bath temperatures; Acetic acid; Acids; Aerodynamics; Air pollution; Air quality; Aldehydes; Amines; Ammonia; Anaerobic digestion; Arsenic compounds; Atmospherics; Chlorine compounds; Concentration (process); Desorption; Electronic equipment testing; Fatty acids; Flow of gases; Food products plants; Gas dynamics; Gas emissions; Gas fuel manufacture; Gases; Hydrocarbons; Ketones; Leakage (fluid); Methane; Organic compounds; Phenols; Secondary recovery; Sorption; Specifications; Standards; Surface chemistry; Targets; Technology; Thermal desorption; Tubes (components); Volatile organic compounds; Waste management; Recovery",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52049103862

Technology holds the key to addressing many environmental problems and achieving sustainable patterns of economic growth. In many cases, companies already have the appropriate technological solution. However, the technology may not be in widespread use because of market and systemic failures and cultural barriers. Examples of market failures are the lack of information about cleaner technologies. Examples of systemic failures are weaknesses in linkages among firms, universities, research and development (R&D) institutions, and others involved in developing, supplying and applying technology. Cultural barriers are caused by the differences in the way companies communicate and do business. This makes ""zero emissions"" a much needed approach. The Journal of Cleaner Production has devoted this special issue to ""Zero Emissions Techniques and Systems - ZETS"" in the production and the urgent issues surrounding, ""How to make sustainable companies become reality"". To document the state of the art in this field and to report progress are main goals of this issue. The objective of the planners of this special issue is to present perspectives, case studies and pedagogic initiatives from, academic, governmental, business, technical and financial sectors, as well as from NGOs from around the world. It is, however, evident that the term ""zero emissions"" still has different meanings and refers to different strategies and technologies. ""Zero Emissions Techniques and Systems"" are really a ""SYSTEMS"" aspect and not a sectoral approach. It develops more and more like a discussion about a mosaic.

Promoting the use of natural stone has therefore a great positive impact on the environment. However, the number of occurrences of bowing and expansion of marble and limestone panels has led to increased maintenance costs, significant safety risk, and negative publicity. The lack of knowledge of a solution to the problem of bowing marble has a large negative effect on the entire stone trade. In response, short-sighted and less durable construction solutions are used as an alternative, adding to the decreasing export figures and numbers of employees within the stone sector. The TEAM (TEAM=TEsting and Assessment of Marble and limestone) project addresses a problem with marble types, from several European countries, that display bowing on facades in both cold and warm climates. There Is, therefore a need to develop harmonized European standards for differentiating between marble that is susceptible to bowing and marble that Is not. Resolution No. 013, in May 1999 taken by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN), Technical Committee (TC) 246 Natural Stone states the urgent needs ""to develop a direct test method of the bowing risk for marble cladding products."" Thus, the project addresses the mandate for external wall coverings and the safety of panels. This paper serves to give a comprehensive overview of the main findings in the project. The main objectives were: To understand and explain the mechanisms of the expansion and loss of strength, probably the most important phenomena leading to degradation of marble and limestone clad facades. To prevent the use of deleterious marble and limestone by introducing drafts for European standards. To develop a concept for assessment of facades, including a monitoring system in order to predict strength development and improve safety and reliability. To analyze if surface coating and impregnation could prevent or diminish the degradation. To address quality control aspects in order to optimize the production conditions. The TEAM project consortium, representing nine EU (European union) countries, comprised sixteen partners representing stone producers and trade associations, testing laboratories, standardization and certification bodies, consultants, building owners and caretakers and producers of fixing and repair systems. A state-of-the-art report has been written and is based on an extensive compilation of more than 400 papers on marble and limestone deterioration dating from the late 1800s to 2006. A survey of about 200 buildings has given a clear picture of the extent of the problem in geographical, geological, and climatological terms. Detailed case studies of six buildings have resulted in a methodology for assessment of facades including monitoring system and risk assessment. Research both in the laboratory and the field were performed on a large number of different stone types from different countries and used in different climates. This gave the explanation of degradation mechanisms and led to the determination of the critical influencing factors. Two tests methods, Including precision statements: one for bowing [1 ] and one for thermal and moisture irreversible expansion have been prepared for submission to CEN TC 246. Repair techniques based on the use of surface coating and impregnation systems has been tested at laboratory and in the field. Positive side effects including increased durability and easier cleaning have been observed. Guidelines for production and product control have been proposed, and an instruction for stone sampling and description has been developed.

Proper adjustments for instrument biases require complete metadata, listing the location and instrument history for each station including dates of changes, but the best available metadata compilations have many gaps and uncertainties. Two methods to fill in missing metadata have limited success. First, ongoing efforts to obtain historical metadata by personal contacts have provided only a small amount of additional information so far, and it is known that much information is no longer available or was never preserved. Second, it is logical to attempt to identify transitions using the data itself by seeking discontinuities in station time series of temperature and moisture variables of research interest, but even though instrument-related discontinuities are definitely large enough to seriously contaminate trends, they are often not large enough to be distinguished from natural variations. This research uses variations of both methods, both to validate existing metadata and fill in missing metadata. First, an extensive search of peer-reviewed and nontraditional sources has uncovered a large amount of unexploited metadata. Second, and most importantly, an extension of the second method is to systematically examine time series of especially sensitive variables to identify instrument characteristics and changes at each station. These variables have little or no climatic interest but amplify instrument differences to show very consistent signatures of instrument types at documented stations. Similar signals at stations or in time periods where metadata is missing or inaccurate indicate the use of the same instruments. The combination of expanded metadata and systematic examination of sensitive variables leads to very reliable inferred metadata, including the timing of transitions. While examination of all data archived from the Global Telecommunication System back to 1973 is not complete, this approach is validated by producing complete metadata in regions which are transitioning to new instrument types, including the Russian Federation, India, Japan, China, and their Antarctic and ship stations. After this approach is used to develop complete global metadata, researchers will be able to use knowledge of the nature and timing of instrument changes to more confidently adjust for the effects of instruments on trends of atmospheric temperatures and other variables of research interest.",,"Atmospheric climate; Global telecommunication systems; Natural variation; New instrument; Personal contacts; Radiative errors; Radiosonde datas; Russian federation; Sensitive variables; Time periods; Atmospheric temperature; Instrument errors; Instruments; Moisture control; Radiosondes; Research; Time measurement; Time series; Metadata",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77949298939

The electronic engine control units (ECUs) have to perform more control tasks using new sensors and actuators, along with the corresponding self-diagnostics (OBD, on-board diagnosis). All this leads to continuously increasing demands on automated hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) test systems. HIL technology has advanced in parallel to the ECUs, and is today an indispensable tool for developing automotive electronics. This paper therefore aims to provide a comprehensive and state-of-the-art survey of HIL test systems for engine controllers. First of all, a brief introduction to the ECU's functionality is given. Then the sensor and actuator interfaces are described in detail together with the corresponding interfaces of the HIL simulator, and both hardware and software aspects are discussed. There follows a description of the real-time engine simulation models which are needed to close the control loop between the ECU and the HIL simulator. Finally, some typical HIL system configurations are shown to demonstrate today's breadth of applications. The last section looks at future development steps in HIL technology, necessitated by the current enhancements to ECUs.

Some of them may use inorganic or organic substances rather than light as energy sources. We refer to this group as chemotrophs in order to distinguish them from those organisms that use light as an energy source (phototrophs). Both chemotrophs and phototrophs are abundant in environments where one or more physical, or chemical parameters show values far from the lower or upper limits known for life. These ambient habitats are referred to as normal environments. When microorganisms succeed in adapting themselves to harsh niches they are referred to collectively as extremophiles (Seckbach 2004, 2006). We review arguments that militate in favor of microorganisms that in the past and present may have occupied other niches in the Solar System. Among the extremophiles we find representatives of the three domains of life (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya). Some of the possible candidates for life in the Solar System are the extremophiles including chemotrophs, especially sulfur-reducing bacteria (SRB). Another example of chemotrophs are the methanogens. Those microbes are capable of producing methane as a metabolic byproduct of the reduction of carbon dioxide, a process that is called methanogenesis. Searching for new forms of life (within the extraterrestrial regions) is the object of planning within the Cosmic Vision Program of ESA, in collaboration with NASA, and other space agencies. Indeed, sulfur traces on Jupiter's moon Europa detected by the Galileo mission have been conjectured to be endogenic, most likely of cryovolcanic origin, due to their non-uniform distribution in patches. The Galileo space probe first detected the sulfur compounds, as well as revealing that this moon almost certainly has a volcanically heated and potentially habitable ocean hiding beneath Europa surface layer of icy water. In this paper we restrict our attention to possible biomarkers that could signal on Europa the presence extremophiles in general and chemotrophs, especially the presence of sulfur reducers.","Europa; Extremophiles; Microorganisms; SRB; Sulfur metabolism; TSR","Astrobiology; Biomarkers; Earth (planet); Metabolism; Parameter estimation; Chemical parameters; Chemotrophs; Organic substances; Microorganisms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149102710

The study area (Kanamaru) is located in the northeastern part of Japan. It is in the foot of a mountainous region, with altitude of 150-310 m. Kanamaru has an average annual precipitation of 3000 mm and average temperature of 12°C. Cretaceous granite and overlying Miocene (16 Ma) sedimentary rocks are distributed around the drilling site. Twelve boreholes were drilled to get information of geological structure, lithology, rock chemistry, water chemistry, and hydrogeologic features in the area. Groundwater flow matches surface topology and flows southward from the northern end of the small ridge to the southern end of the Kuzuresawa stream. Stepwise decrease of the hydraulic head with increasing depth is one of the most important hydrogeological features seen at this study site. The depth of the zone with the largest drop of hydraulic head matches the paleo-weathered zone of the Cretaceous granite where most of the cracks are cemented with hematite. Chemical change in groundwater with increasing depth from the water table to 50 m in depth is characterized by increase of pH, EC, Ca++ and HCO3-, and decrease of DO, Eh, SO4-- and solute composition. Groundwater obtained from the shallower part of the sedimentary rocks has the major ion and a stable isotopic composition similar to those of the stream water. This suggests an important contribution of groundwater in the shallow part of the sedimentary rocks to the source of the stream water. Uranium concentrations of the water discharging from a nearby spring reach up to 6 ppb. Groundwater collected from boreholes at the depth of the uranium anomalous layer contains around 0.3 ppb U. If the removal rate is the same as the present rate, remaining time which is the time needed to remove all the uranium in the bedrock dissolved away is calculated to be 10 million years to 100 million years. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Most LPM combustion systems employ the swirling flow with a bluff body at the center to stabilize the flame. The flow recirculation region established downstream of the bluff-body brings combustion products in contact with fresh reactants to sustain the reactions. However, such systems are prone to combustion oscillations and flame flashback, especially if high hydrogen containing fuels are used. Low-Swirl Injector (LSI) is an innovative approach, whereby a freely propagating LPM flame is stabilized in a diverging flow field surrounded by a weakly-swirling flow. The LSI is devoid of the flow recirculation region in the reaction zone. In the present study, emissions measurements are reported for a LSI operated on mixtures of methane (CH4), hydrogen (H2), and carbon monoxide (CO) to simulate H2 synthetic gas produced by coal gasification. For a fixed adiabatic flame temperature and air flow rate, CH 4 content of the fuel in atmospheric pressure experiments is varied from 100% to 50% (by volume) with the remainder of the fuel containing equal amounts of CO and H2. For each test case, the CO and nitric oxide (NOx) emissions are measured axially at the combustor center and radially at several axial locations Results show that the LSI provides stable flame for a range of operating conditions and fuel mixtures.

The United States, unlike many other developed nations, does not regulate the emissions of GHG. In the absence of federal oversight, creation of GHG emission inventories is prudent for proactive GHG emitters. Such inventories can be used internally and/or externally to evaluate a company's GHG impact and associated financial risks, reduction opportunities, and many other opportunities. To begin a quality inventory, the WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol is recommended as a reference. The WRI document ensures creation of accounting and reporting principles that make a GHG inventory relevant, complete, consistent, transparent to all, and accurate. These items must be met and verified for the emissions inventory to accomplish the goals of public reporting, public and regulatory scrutiny, potential credit for early reduction actions, evaluation of financial impacts, and appropriate decision-making utilizing quality data. This is especially true if the U.S. develops regulations in the future. Creation of an inventory will allow leaders to take advantage of this voluntary opportunity and to join the global movement by beginning to address GHG emissions and their potential effect on global warming.","Emission inventory; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Kyoto Protocol; Voluntary program; WRI or WRI Protocol","Decision making; Global warming; Quality control; Waste management; Emission inventories; Emissions inventory; Financial impacts; Greenhouse gas protocols; Greenhouse gases (GHG); KYOTO protocol; Potential effects; Voluntary programs; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933528350

In addition to domestic pressure, Canada was putting political pressure on the United States to decrease acid rain.

The National Acid Rain Precipitation Assessment Program found that acid rain causes minor damage to crops and modest damage to aquatic life in acidified lakes and streams. Burtraw et al.

Second, participants were chosen based on a stratified, random sampling scheme; probability sampling is unusual in qualitative studies. Finally, the data are extremely rich-both mothers and fathers participated in unstructured interviews both individually and as a couple in each of the four waves. The TLC3 data are linked to a large quantitative data set, The Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Survey (FFCWS), which is representative of non-marital births in cities with populations greater than 200,000. From the FFCWS participant pool, individuals for the TLC3 study were chosen, using a stratified random sampling scheme in three of the FFCWS cities. The three cities, Chicago, New York, and Milwaukee, were chosen purposefully to capture a range of racial and ethnic diversity and differences in economic and policy climates. In Chicago, the included hospital serves a majority African American population, in New York a mostly Hispanic clientele, and in Milwaukee an economically and ethnically diverse population. In each city, FFCWS couples were eligible to participate in the TLC3 study only if they were romantically involved at the time of the birth, if the mother's household income did not exceed $75,000, if both mother and father lived in an accessible geographical area (to be accessible to interviewers), if the father was not in jail, if the child was living with at least one of the biological parents, and if both parents spoke English. As in the FFCWS, TLC3 oversampled unmarried couples: approximately one-third of the seventy-five were married and were included solely for comparison. Our main focus was on unmarried couples and some of the papers in this volume used only these couples. Once participants were stratified according to the outlined criteria, ninety-seven couples were randomly selected and then approached to participate in TLC3. In the end, seventy-five were successfully enrolled in the study-twenty-five in Milwaukee, twenty-five in Chicago, and twenty-five in New York City. Table 12.1 provides response rates for parents across all four waves, by interview type, and the number of social fathers who were interviewed. We use this term to refer to men who became one of the focal TLC3 mothers' cohabiting partner after wave one when the mother had broken up with the focal father. Although every attempt was made to interview the biological fathers of the focal children even after a breakup, when the mother had started living with a new man, social fathers were also solicited for interviews. Such data are important to understanding the processes families undergo when mothers and fathers repartner-such as parenting children who are not biologically one's own, negotiating with the biological parents who are no longer partners, and the impact this has on the relationship of the new partnership. Whenever possible, participants were interviewed both as a couple and individually. In waves two through four, if couples had broken up and were willing to be interviewed together about coparenting issues, interviewers did couple as well as individual interviews. If the mother had a new partner, interviewers attempted a couple interview with the new couple. The interviewers followed a structured interview guide so that they would address all areas of interest, but were allowed to vary the order of the questions, to probe, and to encourage open-ended responses. This allowed for a conversation-like flow between interviewees and interviewers. Rapport was generally high, and, whenever possible, the same interviewers were sent to the same couple or individual over waves. Interviews typically lasted between two and three hours and were audiotaped; in the third and fourth wave only they were also video recorded. From these recordings, a team of transcribers coded each interview verbatim, producing approximately two thousand pages for each couple across the four waves. A team of researchers, typically undergraduates, then coded each transcript using paper transcripts and then electronically sorted sections of text into topics. Coders placed all text from the transcribed interviews that pertained to the coding schema into the given category. Researchers developed some of the topics for coding directly from the interview guide prior to coding. However, there was also an inductive aspect to the coding; some topics appeared as important as coding progressed, and a decision was made to create a field for the topic. This transcription and coding process produced an extensive TLC3 database for researchers to use and analyze by topical category. Examples of the schema or category include: attitudes about marriage, how the couple handles their money, and how the couple divides the household labor. After transcription and coding the data were organized in Microsoft Access for management. Copyright © 2007 by Russell Sage Foundation.

Most SCR systems require injection of urea or ammonia into the exhaust stream. Residual ammonia present in vehicle exhaust can have deleterious effects on NOx analyzers using chemiluminescent detectors (CLD). Ammonia can poison converter catalysts in CLD NOx analyzers and may react with NO2 across the converter. Both of these issues lead to erroneous NOx measurements, as well as increased maintenance costs and downtime. This paper will describe the development and use of a low-cost, simple ammonia scrubber that can easily be integrated into sampling systems and requires little change in test cell maintenance procedures. Validation results show the scrubber to have capacity sufficient to last for a full day of testing of typical vehicles. Prototype vehicles with a large overshoot in ammonia injection require changing the scrubber more frequently. Data collected from validation tests show the scrubber to be better than 99% efficient in removing ammonia while not interfering with other gaseous measurements.

It has been shown repeatedly that the isotope anomaly is inherited from O3 via photolytically produced O(1 D) that undergoes isotope exchange with CO2 and the anomaly may well serve as a tracer of stratospheric chemistry if details of the exchange mechanism are understood. We have studied the photochemical isotope equilibrium in UV-irradiated O2-CO2 and O 3-CO2 mixtures to quantify the transfer of the anomaly from O3 to CO2 at room temperature. By following the time evolution of the oxygen isotopic compositions of CO2 and O 2 under varying initial isotopic compositions of both, O 2/O3 and CO2, the isotope equilibria between the two reservoirs were determined. A very strong dependence of the isotope equilibrium on the O22/CO2-ratio was established. Equilibrium enrichments of 17O and 18O in CO2 relative to O2 diminish with increasing CO2 content, and this reduction in the equilibrium enrichments does not follow a standard mass dependent relation. When molecular oxygen exceeds the amount of CO2 by a factor of about 20, 17O and 18O in equilibrated CO2 are enriched by (142±4)‰ and (146±4)%c, respectively, at room temperature and at a pressure of 225 hPa, independent of the initial isotopic compositions of CO2 and O22 or O 3. From these findings we derive a simple and general relation between the starting isotopic compositions and amounts of O2 and CO2 and the observed slope in a three oxygen isotope diagram. Predictions from this relation are compared with published laboratory and atmospheric data.",,"anomaly; atmospheric chemistry; carbon dioxide; isotopic composition; oxygen isotope; ozone; photochemistry; quantitative analysis; steady-state equilibrium; stratosphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846563408

Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) have become an essential and well established research tool to investigate the structure of turbulent flames, since they do not rely on any approximate turbulence models. In this work two complementary DNS codes are employed to investigate different types of fuels and flame configurations. The code π3 is a 3-dimensional DNS code using a low-Mach number approximation. Chemistry is described through a tabulation, using two coordinates to enter a database constructed for example with 29 species and 141 reactions for methane combustion. It is used here to investigate the growth of a turbulent premixed flame in a methane-air mixture (Case 1). The second code, Sider is an explicit three-dimensional DNS code solving the fully compressible reactive Navier-Stokes equations, where the chemical processes are computed using a complete reaction scheme, taking into account accurate diffusion properties. It is used here to compute a hydrogen/air turbulent diffusion flame (Case 2), considering 9 chemical species and 38 chemical reactions. For Case 1, a perfectly spherical laminar flame kernel is initialized at the center of a cubic domain at zero velocity. A field of synthetic homogeneous isotropic turbulence is then superposed and the turbulent flow and the flame can begin to interact. Various species can be used as an indicator for the flame front in a combustion process. Among them, the isosurface of species CO-2 at a mass fraction of 0.03 is retained here, since this value corresponds to the steepest temperature gradient in the associated one-dimensional laminar premixed flame. The results obtained have been post processed in order to study the interesting aspects of the coupling between flame kernel evolution and turbulence, such as straining and curvature impact on the flame surface area and local thickness. For Case 2, the instantaneous structure of a non-premixed hydrogen/air flame evolving in a turbulent flow and starting from an initially planar structure is investigated. Here again, the properties of the resulting turbulent flame are of high interest and will be visualized, defining the flame front in a classical manner for non-premixed combustion using a mixture fraction isosurface. Considering the context of this publication, the emphasis is clearly set on the post-processing and visualization of the DNS data, not on the fundamental issues associated with turbulent combustion. © 2007 The Visualization Society of Japan.","Direct Numerical Simulation; Post-Processing; Turbulent Flames; Visualization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47849091049

A consequence of this coupling are sections of the state space which exhibit either stable or unstable responses to perturbations. This paper exploits the characteristics of a previously validated 2-input 2-output control model of residual-affected HCCI to analytically determine the area of the state space which is stable to perturbation of either combustion timing or in-cylinder pressure evolution.

In addition to this distinctive characteristic, metals share several other typical physical properties, such as high thermal conductivity, density, malleability and ductility (Forstner and Wittmann 1979). Several nonmetallic elements exhibit one or more of these properties. And hence, the only feature that defines a metal unambiguously is the electric conductivity, which decreases with increase in temperature. There are, of course, elements in the periodic table, like boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic and tellurium, which show electric conductivity, but their electric conductivity is low, and it increases with the rise in temperature. These are termed metalloids (or half-metals) situated between metals and nonmetals in the periodic table (Forstner and Wittmann 1979). Metals constitute more than 50 % of the elements present in the earths crust; out of 110 elements known today 69 are metals, excluding the element of the trans-uranium series (Shaw et al. 2004). Their relative abundance, however, differ greatly at a region over the globe, and the region at which a metal is found in high concentration serves as the source of the metal. The variation observed is not only natural but also man-made; metals present in the earths crust are mined and extracted by the human beings to meet the requirement of their day to day life leading to their accumulation at some regions. Metals remaining present in high concentration in the earths crust do not pose any threat to the environment until the landmass of the region is used for agroindustry. This is because they remain tightly bound to their Lewis components as sulfides, oxides, or carbonates, as the case may be (see below), and the ore particles also remain tightly packed along with the particle of the soil, which makes them highly immobilized. It is only the mining of the ore, and subsequent uses of the extracted metals that lead to far and wide contamination of the environment. From the figures of the crustal abundance of important metals and their production per annum (Table 1), the magnitude of contamination or pollution by metals as a result of anthropogenic activities may be imagined. © 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892317994

In this study we assess the life cycle costs and environmental benefits of five promising electric transportation technologies in California - alternative marine power (AMP), also known as cold-ironing; truck stop electrification (TSE); transport refrigeration units (TRUs); electric forklifts, and plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs). We have developed a single cost-effectiveness (CE) metric that incorporates life cycle costs (e.g., operational costs) and environmental benefits, including reductions in criteria pollutant emissions, cuts in greenhouse gases, and reduced dependence on petroleum-based fuels. For each of the five technologies, we conducted a detailed life cycle assessment considering both the economics and environmental benefits of adoption. We tracked upfront capital costs on both the truck-side and facility-side, while including operational cost savings due to reduced outlays for fuel and reduced engine maintenance. We developed our CE methodology based on a survey of existing CE metrics for transportation applications, including the Carl Moyer program, the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy's Green Book, and previous TIAX work on California Assembly Bill 2076 (AB2076) We find that the adoption of all five electric drive technologies will result in cost-effective emissions reductions for both criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases due to favorable life cycle economics. In particular, TSE and PHEVs were estimated to offer environmental benefits at a net negative cost after accounting for fuel savings and reduced maintenance. We consider the metric outlined in this study as a potentially useful tool for public agencies seeking to identify promising alternative fuel technologies and directing public incentives toward their promotion. Considering the general lack of consumer awareness regarding the net costs (i.e., economic and environmental costs) of the internal combustion engine, the implementation of robust incentives will be crucial to speeding the adoption of technologies like the ones discussed here.","""Cost effectiveness""; ""Environmental impact""; ""Heavy duty vehicles""; ""Hybrid electric vehicles""; ""Life cycle analysis""","Alternative fuel technologies; California; California Assembly Bills; Capital costs; Consumer awareness; Cost saving; Electric transportation; Emissions reduction; Energy efficient; Engine maintenance; Environmental benefits; Environmental costs; Fuel savings; Global climate changes; Heavy duty vehicles; Life cycle analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Lifecycle costs; Pollutant emission; Public agencies; Alternative fuels; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Cost accounting; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Electric drives; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Exhibitions; Fuel cells; Fuel economy; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid vehicles; Internal combustion engines; Life cycle; Maintenance; Marine engineering; Pollution; Sustainable development; Technology; Transportation; Truck transportation; Trucks; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872038840

Fossil fuels, particularly crude oil, are confined to a few regions of the world and the continuity of supply is governed by dynamic political, economic, and ecological factors. These factors conspire to force volatile, often high fuel prices while, at the same time, environmental policy is demanding a reduction in greenhouse gases and toxic emissions. A coherent energy strategy is required, addressing both energy supply and demand, taking account of the whole energy life cycle including fuel production, transmission and distribution, and energy conversion, and the impact on energy equipment manufacturers and the end-users of energy systems. In the short term, the aim should be to achieve higher energy efficiency and increased supply from local energy sources, in particular renewable energy sources. In the long term, a hydrogen-based economy will have an impact on all these sectors. In view of technological developments, vehicle and component manufacturers, transport providers, the energy industry, and even householders are seriously looking at alternative energy sources and fuels and more efficient and cleaner technologies - especially hydrogen and hydrogen-powered fuel cells.

Some aspects of green design might even be said to be entering both mainstream practice and the wider public consciousness. There is an NAAB accreditation criteria focused on sustainability, and the actor Brad Pitt is a talking head for green building.1 The language of the various LEED rating systems has seeped into the vocabulary of most designers, and uncertain energy prices have given environmental concerns economic cachet. Even some of the more progressive planks of the green building platform are receiving significant support (though if only in principle so far) with both the National Association of Counties and the United States Conference of Mayors endorsing the greenhouse gas reduction goals of the 2030 Challenge. Yet, it still seems that a surprising number of clients remain unconvinced as to whether they should pursue green strategies in their buildings. Likewise, there remain many design professionals waiting for the right project with which to begin greening their practice. Both of these stances fundamentally misunderstand the place and scope of sustainability within the design disciplines. The call for designers to create environmentally progressive products, buildings, or cities is not a call for an applied style or set of technologies. Rather, it is a call for the application of an ethic that is integral to the process of design no matter the project, the style, or the client. It is an expanded understanding of context. Every project must now answer for its impacts on not only its immediate surroundings but also on the broader planet. We have passed the point when architects and designers can plausibly claim ignorance of these issues. To design in today's world and give no consideration to environmental issues is to act irresponsibly, and results in the creation of buildings that are obsolete before their time. So how does one begin? The issue of sustainability in design is certainly a vast and nuanced topic with each breakthrough in understanding seemingly leading to many new unanswered questions. A designer beginning on the road to a more sustainable practice will not address all relevant issues on his or her first attempts. Many pieces of the green puzzle are currently beyond the reach of everyday practice. It remains impractical for the average practitioner to develop a comprehensive understanding of the embodied impacts of all of the materials she or he uses, and renewable energy sources are far from being a choice that is easily justified on the typical project. In time, with advancing knowledge and technology, such strategies will become common practice. However, there are steps that any designer can take on any project to make it significantly greener.

The experimental protocol requires simultaneous measurement of intracochlear distortion products (DPs) and ear-canal otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) under tightly controlled conditions. To calibrate the intracochlear response to the DP, Allen-Fahey experiments traditionally employ invasive procedures such as recording from auditory-nerve fibers or measuring basilar-membrane velocity. This paper describes an alternative method that allows the intracochlear distortion source to be calibrated noninvasively. In addition to the standard pair of primary tones used to generate the principal DP, the noninvasive method employs a third, fixed tone to create a secondary DPOAE whose amplitude and phase provide a sensitive assay of the intracochlear value of the principal DP near its characteristic place. The method is used to perform noninvasive Allen-Fahey experiments in cat and shown to yield results in quantitative agreement with the original, auditory-nerve-based paradigm performed in the same animal. Data obtained using a suppression-compensated variation of the noninvasive method demonstrate that neither traveling-wave amplification nor two-tone suppression constitutes the controlling influence in DPOAE generation at close frequency ratios. Rather, the dominant factor governing the emission magnitude appears to be the variable directionality of the waves radiated by the distortion-source region, which acts as a distortion beamformer tuned by the primary frequency ratio. © 2007 Acoustical Society of America.",,"Acoustic wave propagation; Amplification; Gain control; Natural frequencies; Signal distortion; Emission magnitude; Frequency ratios; Traveling wave amplification; Amplifiers (electronic); article; auditory canal; auditory stimulation; calibration; cochlea; cochlear nerve; data analysis; distortion product otoacoustic emission; hearing; mathematical model; nonhuman; otoacoustic emission; priority journal; quantitative analysis; sensitivity analysis; sound transmission; Acoustic Stimulation; Animals; Cats; Cochlea; Cochlear Microphonic Potentials; Cochlear Nerve; Models, Theoretical; Organ of Corti; Psychoacoustics; Reproducibility of Results; Sound Spectrography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846687065

Equally, and perhaps even more important, is the complimentary workforce development need for the numerous well educated AND well trained technicians to staff our growing nuclear power industry. From an industry high of 14 Associate Degree Programs in 1978, the post-Three Mile Island (TMI) political climate saw this program dwindle to just a very few in 2006. In fact for all intent, there is only one functioning, successful, and TAC of ABET accredited program still actively providing a quality technician workforce - that being the Associate Degree Program at Three Rivers Community College in Norwich, CT. Partnering with Dominion Energy (specifically the Millstone Nuclear Power Complex in Waterford, CT), the Three Rivers nuclear program since its inception in 1983 has not only continued to provide an excellent technician entry level workforce regionally, but the program has received national recognition for the quality of its academic program, its recruitment of minority populations, the utilization of novel educational methods, and its scholarship assistance to deserving youth in the southeastern Connecticut region. The specifics of the general scholarship program have been reported on in prior CONTE conferences and the general level of financial support has not changed. Some 16-20 full scholarships are offered each academic year to new freshmen in the nuclear, electrical, mechanical, or environmental engineering technology degree programs. This paper will report on the practical work experience enhancements with expanded internship and co-op work opportunities that are creating an even better entry level technician. All scholarship program full time students are now offered a twelve week intensive internship position during the summer between their first and second academic year.

In addition, all summer internship students are offered work during periodic refueling outages. Upon completion of their final academic year and receipt of their degree, those recent co-op students are offered permanent employment as technicians within the Dominion Energy system.

Accordingly, the Japanese Government must reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 6% below the levels in 1990. The government has estimated that the carbon dioxide emissions in the transportation sector account for approximately 22% of the total emissions of Japan and increasing with the progress of motorization. In order to achieve the reduction target, the government has promoted modalshift policies in the transportation sector. This study aims to develop a simulation model to examine the effects of modal-shift policies on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from the automobile transport of freight in Japanese prefectures. The model has been applied to a hypothetical case in which the average rate of modal-shift increase 50% from the levels in 2000. The findings revealed that a marked reduction in carbon dioxide emissions is expected for freight transport between metropolitan and local regions.

However little has been published on appropriate potential range of actuation in this electrolyte. This information is clearly crucial for applications. Our particular interest is in disposable applications where a relatively small number of cycles are needed, and maximum strain is desired. The electrochemical degradation as a function of voltage is investigated by cycling the film between fixed voltages and measuring the charge transfer. The experiment was done on a glassy carbon substrate in order to reduce effects of change in resistance with oxidation state, preventing actuation. The dependence of charging on voltage and the rate of reduction in the extent of charging are measured. The voltage range for effective operation of the device was found to be -0.4 V to 0.8 V versus a Ag/AgCl reference electrode in order to achieve stable performance over at least 30 minutes. The mechanisms of degradation at potentials beyond 0.8 V appear to be the substitution of hydroxyl ions in the polymer backbone, as suggested in reports on degradation of polypyrrole in other electrolytes. An observed reduction in charge transfer rate at potentials lower than -0.4 V is consistent with a reduction in ionic conductivity at highly reduced states, as has also been suggested in the literature.","Degradation; Polypyrrole; Voltage range","Operating voltage; Voltage range; Charge transfer; Electric potential; Sodium compounds; Solutions; Polypyrroles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35048840205

Existing inventories indicate that solvent use constitutes the second-most important source of anthropogenic Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compound (NMVOC) emissions in Europe. The aim of this work is to examine the evolution of NMVOC emissions from solvent use in Greece for the years 1990-2005, as well as the changes in their composition. The methodology used involves the collection and elaboration of a large amount of statistical data, and is a top down approach (the calculations performed are based on national solvent mass balances). The resulting emission estimates provide improved knowledge for a sizeable portion of the NMVOC emissions on national level. Emphasis is placed on the NMVOC emissions composition, in order to get a quantitative picture of the contribution of each chemical compound to the total NMVOC emitted by the use of solvents in Greece. To this end, appropriate usage factors are determined for each solvent. Time-series of total emissions are presented for the period 1990-2005. The main results indicate that there is an increasing trend of total NMVOC emissions in Greece until 1995, but a decreasing one from 1996 to 2003. High values in 2004 and 2005 must be attributed to large construction projects of Athens 2004 Olympic Games. Moreover, the composition of solvent NMVOC has changed. White spirit and creosote contribution has decreased, that of solvents, such as methanol, styrene, ethylene glycol and toluene, has increased. © by PSP.","Greece; NMVOC emissions; Solvents","anthropogenic source; chemical composition; creosote; emission; emission inventory; smog; solvent; time series; top-down approach; volatile organic compound; Athens [Attica]; Attica; Eurasia; Europe; Greece; Southern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34848849891

Despite all the positive attributes of these megaprojects, they have little chance of actually alleviating road gridlock. In reality, massive spending on recent public transit megaprojects has failed to live up to expectations. In Toronto, despite spending over $1.3-billion on two new urban rail lines, it was reported that the share of all trips made by transit declined to 21% in 2001 from 26% in 1986. Shifting land-use and commuting patterns are a primary reason why rapid rail transit megaprojects have failed to either attract the expected level of passengers or reduce congestion.

Some have argued that these price increases are predominantly due to the passing through of the (opportunity) costs of freely allocated CO 2 emission allowances to the power sector, resulting in significant additional (windfall) profits for this sector. In some countries, this has resulted in a lively debate in which both politicians and major power-intensive users have suggested that the EU ETS induced increases in power prices and windfall profits should be addressed by means of adequate policy measures. The major purpose of the paper is to analyse a variety of options to address EU ETS induced increases in power prices and windfall profits, notably whether these options are effective and whether they have other (adverse) effects as well. First of all, however, a summary is presented of the estimated impact of the EU ETS on power prices and generators' profits, based on empirical research and model simulations of the wholesale markets in North-western Europe, particularly Germany and the Netherlands (Sijm et al., 2005 and 2006). Analysing trends in power prices on these markets for the year 2005 show that both peak and off-peak prices have increased substantially due to three causes: 1. Increases in fuel prices (notably when a gas-fired plant is the price-setting technology). 2. Pass through of (rising) CO2 costs of EU ETS allowances. 3. Other factors, especially growing capacity scarcities on the power market. stimates of the average pass through rates in Germany vary between 70 and 100 percent for the year 2005 as a whole. Based on these estimates, the share of CO2 cost pass through in total power price increases varies between 16 percent for gas-generated power in the Netherlands (peak period) to 57 percent for coal-fired power in Germany (off-peak), while the remaining part is due to fuel increases (in particular in the Netherlands) and growing scarcities on the wholesale markets (notably in Germany). When discussing EU ETS induced changes in generators' (windfall) profits), it is important to make a distinction between windfall profits due to: A. EU ETS induced changes in power prices, sales volumes and costs. B. Free allocations of CO2 emission allowances. For North-western European countries, model scenario estimates of windfall profits (in % of baseline profits) vary between -2 and 42 percent for the first category (A), between 10 and 46 percent for the second category (B), and between 8 and 88 percent for total windfall profits (A+B). In addition, empirical estimates of windfall profits (in absolute figures) vary between €300-400 mln/a for the Netherlands (based on a free allocation of 35 MtCO2/a to the power sector) and between €1200-1300 for the UK (based on a free allocation of 134MtCO2/a). Depending on one's perspective, induced increases in power prices and windfall profits (A and/or B) can be regarded as an (un)intended, (ir)rational effect of the scheme. As far as these effects are regarded as a problem to be addressed, several options can be considered, including: Indirect allocation of free allowances (i.e. to power consumers rather than power producers). Auctioning of emission allowances and recycling of auction revenues. Relative benchmarking or output-based allocation. Taxation of carbon emissions and recycling of tax revenues. Price regulation on the wholesale, retail power and or carbon market. Reducing CO2 allowance prices. Encouraging power sector competition Providing state aid to energy-intensive industries (IIEs). Promoting EII strategies such as energy saving, self generation or long term power price contracts. Border tax adjustments. Long term options such as global climate policy agreements or technological innovations. The paper discusses the above-mentioned options, notably whether they address the EU ETS induced increases in both power prices and generators' windfall profits (A and/or B) and whether they have other (unintended, adverse) effects or not. The major findings of this discussion are summarised in an overview table. In summary, the major conclusions of the paper are: Power prices in North-western EU countries such as Germany and the Netherlands have increased substantially during 2005, but only part (16-57%) is due to CO2 cost pass through, depending on the country, load period and generation technology considered. Generators' profits have risen significantly due to EU ETS induced increases in power prices and free allocations of CO2 allowances. There are hardly any policy options that address both EU ETS induced increases in power prices and windfall profits without adverse, socio-economic effects. However, as far as EU ETS induced increases in power prices and windfall profits are regarded as an issue or problem to be addressed, a combination of options could be considered, including auctioning of emission allowances (to sheltered sectors), recycling of auction revenues (particularly to power consumers), benchmark or output-based allocation (to sectors exposed to competition outside the EU ETS), reducing CO2 prices, and encouraging technological innovations. © 2007 IEEE.",,"Emissions Trading; Power prices; Windfall profits; Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Profitability; Reactive power; Industrial emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42649108712

A CHP project powered by LFG not only provides significantly better energy efficiency and cost savings, but it also achieves significant environmental benefits from using a locally produced, biomass fuel. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP) has supported the development of LFG energy (LFGE) projects for more than a decade. The LMOP encourages the development of LFGE projects in several ways. To achieve more LFG use, the program maintains voluntary partnerships with businesses, communities, and states. The LMOP provides information about LFGE opportunities in the United States and prepares preliminary feasibility studies for landfills and potential LFG users. The LMOP and the LFGE industry have achieved significant reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases, because LFG is approximately 50% methane and methane traps more heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, the most prevalent greenhouse gas. The collection and use of each ton of LFG methane is equivalent to the reduction of over 20 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. The LMOP maintains a landfill and LFGE project database (LMOP database), which classifies 16 LFGE projects as CHP. These projects range from a 120 kilowatt (kW) microturbine installation to a 12 megawatt (MW) cogeneration plant CHP LFGE projects can create additional environmental benefits by offsetting fossil-fuel-based electricity and steam or heating demands with a renewable fuel. In 2007, the existing CHP projects fueled by LFG will result in greenhouse gas reductions equivalent to preventing the use of approximately 1.3 million barrels of oil. In addition, using the waste heat from LFG-fired generators in a CHP configuration can improve project financial results by as much as 100%, increasing the feasibility of developing LFGE projects. LMOP offers real-world project experience and tools to overcome the barriers in CHP LFGE project development. © 2007 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011454585

Hydrocarbon, fatty acid, ketone and fatty alcohol fractions of the lipids were characterized in terms of their contents of homologous compound series and specific biogenic molecular markers. Particulate samples from the rural western United States have been analyzed and compared with samples from urban Los Angeles and remote areas over the Atlantic Ocean. The samples from rural sites contained predominantly vascular plant wax and lesser amounts of higher plant sterols and resin residues. Urban samples and, to varying degrees, some rural samples contained primarily higher weight residues of petroleum products. The loadings of hydrocarbons derived from higher plant waxes ranged approximately from 10 to 160 ng m -3 of air (for fatty acids, 10-100 ng m -3 and for fatty alcohols, 10-200 ng m -3). Higher molecular weight lipids (i.e. plant epicuticular wax, terpenes, etc.) from flora comprise a significant component of the organic carbon in rural aerosols.

The top-down modeling accounts for total emissions activity in the geographical area of interest. Road transport emissions are then calculated from the gasoline and diesel sales, or from vehicle miles traveled, data of a geographical area. These emissions are related to the magnitude of the associated air pollution source by means of an emissions factor that is obtained by laboratory measurement over a standardized driving cycle representative of vehicles under simulated typical operating conditions. A top-down emission inventory is then involved by assuming local emissions are proportional to some other variable that can reasonably be assumed to have a similar spatial disaggregation. The standard vehicle emission estimates, that are produced cooperatively by manufactures and government agencies, are not representative of the real world; therefore, an alternative approach for calcuLating mobile sources emission inventory needs to be developed to capture site-specific real-time GhG emission factors at the street level. We have developed a disaggregated emission factor model, MicroFacGhG, that is capable of simuLating virtually all real-world conditions. The MicroFacGhG model evaluation in the U.S. tunnels has shown very encouraging results. The MicroFacGhG model computes geographically resolved detailed emission data by modeling the traffic fleet on an individual length of road. Total emissions for a geographical area of interest are then obtained by summing contributions from individual road segments. This paper compares the mobile sources emission inventory for the City of Toronto based on the traditional top-down modeling approach with a bottom-up emission inventory prepared from the MicroFacGhG model and evaluates the advantages of the two approaches.","Bottom-up emission inventory; CO2 emissions; Emission modeling; Mobile sources; Top-down emission inventory","Automobile manufacture; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Highway administration; Mobile power plants; Roads and streets; Transportation; Vehicles; Waste management; Emission inventories; Emission model; Laboratory measurements; Mobile sources; Road transport emissions; Spatial disaggregation; Typical operating conditions; Vehicle-miles traveled; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649119283

In fact, these are the indicators of prosperity and progress today. However, unplanned industrialization and urbanization may lead to multifaceted environmental problems. Hence, in a developing nation like India, future industrialization and urbanization should be carefully planned to avoid any irreparable damage to the environment. As far as possible, air, being the lifeline, should be protected from the evils of pollution, as its quality depletion beyond a threshold limit may lead to serious health hazards to both man and livestock. Even, a possibility of change in the genetic make-up cannot be ruled out in case of spill over of nuclear materials. Despite this fact, a progressing country can avoid neither industrialization nor urbanization for its economic growth, which is triggered even at the cost of ecological imbalance. Therefore, the best way out appears today is to be an all-out effort to use such measures (engineering or biological), which can help in mitigation of ambient pollution. In this endeavour, various laws and policies have been framed to direct the industries and vehicle manufacturers to adopt new technologies to reduce the emission of pollutants from both stationary and mobile sources. In order to curb the menace of air pollution, mechanical collectors, fabric collectors, wet scrubbers, electromagnetic precipitators and fume incineration are often used to attenuate pollutant emission at source. But, as these devices are of mechanical nature, the possibility of their occasional failure cannot be ruled out. Moreover, engineering devices are very expensive, demanding a big budget which is itself a major problem in many cash-strapped industries. Alternatively, less efficient systems are, at times, used by many medium and small-scale industries, leading to the discharge of an alarming proportion of pollutants in the industrial pockets of our country. This situation demands our adequate attention for immediate remedial recourse. In fact, there is no device available, either mechanical or chemical, which can completely check the emission of pollutants at the source. Once the pollutants are released to the atmosphere, only the plants are the hope, which can mop up the pollutants by adsorbing, absorbing and metabolizing them from the atmosphere. Therefore, the plants role in the air pollution abatement has been increasingly recognized in recent years. Phytoremediation is an emerging eco-friendly technology, dealing with degradation, mitigation or stabilization of air, soil or water pollutants by plants (Macek et al. 2000; Garbisu et al. 2002 and Lasat et al. 2002). The main advantages of phytoremediation technology include; (1) it is an aesthetically pleasing and solar energy-driven cleanup technology (2) chances of environmental degradation, because of in situ application, are very less (3) a variety of environmental contaminants may be treated simultaneously and (4) it is a cost-effective technology, as cost involved in phytoremediation technology is 60-80% less than the conventional physico-chemical or mechanical technologies (Schnoor 1997). Despite of several advantages, this technology has also got some limitations like (1) it is a time consuming approach, as it may take several growing seasons to cleanup a site (2) plants after phytoremediation got loaded with toxic heavy metals or persistent chemicals that may pose a risk to wildlife or contaminate a food chain, and (3) accumulation of organic or inorganic compounds may lead to the formation of number of cytotoxic intermediates into plants or animals. Therefore, to prove the applicability of phytoremediation, there is a need to analyse the mass balance and metabolic fate of pollutants in the plant system (Morikawa and Erkin 2003). Most common air pollutants in the urban environment are sulfur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), suspended particulate matter (SPM) hydrocarbons (HC) and ozone (O3) (DAmato 1999). Out of which, SPM is of the greatest concern, as it contributes 50% to total air pollution (Fuller 1974) and causes respiratory disorders in human beings on prolonged exposure (Freer-Smith et al. 2004). Joshi (1998) carried out the monitoring of respirable suspended particulate matter (RSPM) and total suspended particulate matter (TSPM) in the core city area of Indore (Madhya Pradesh, India) and found higher RSPM and TSPM levels at about all the selected road intersections as compared to the prescribed standards of CPCB, New Delhi. NO2 and SO2 are the gases that contribute to acidic deposition in terrestrial ecosystem as dry deposited gases or in dissolved form in precipitation (Cox 2003). In aerosol form, they also impact visibility. NO2 is of particular nature, as it is a precursor of the formation of the photochemical oxidants, which directly impact health of human beings. Gaseous pollutants, such as SO2, NO2 and O3, have pernicious effects of varying magnitude on wheat, mustard, mung and palak plants, depending upon individual pollutant concentration, in combination, plant species and seasons (Rhode et al. 2002; Agrawal et al. 2003). © 2007 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80955146493

In order to accurately assess sustainable land management practices, the climate resources and the risk of climate-related or induced natural disasters in a region must be known. Land surface is an important part of the climate system and changes of vegetation type can modify the characteristics of the regional atmospheric circulation and the large-scale external moisture fluxes. Following deforestation, surface evapotranspiration and sensible heat flux are related to the dynamic structure of the low-level atmosphere and these changes could influence the regional, and potentially, global-scale atmospheric circulation. Surface parameters such as soil moisture, forest coverage, transpiration and surface roughness may affect the formation of convective clouds and rainfall through their effect on boundary-layer growth. Land use and land cover changes influence carbon fluxes and GHG emissions which directly alter atmospheric composition and radiative forcing properties. Land degradation aggravates CO2-induced climate change through the release of CO2 from cleared and dead vegetation and through the reduction of the carbon sequestration potential of degraded land. Climate exerts a strong influence over dry land vegetation type, biomass and diversity. Precipitation and temperature determine the potential distribution of terrestrial vegetation and constitute principal factors in the genesis and evolution of soil. Precipitation also influences vegetation production, which in turn controls the spatial and temporal occurrence of grazing and favours nomadic lifestyle.

The local intermolecular structure of the fluid was studied in terms of the calculated appropriate pair radial distribution functions. The estimated average local coordination numbers and mole fractions around the species in the mixture reveal the existence of local composition enhancement of ethanol around the ethanol molecules. This finding indicates the nonideal mixing behavior of the mixture due to the existence of aggregation between the ethanol molecules. Furthermore, the local environment redistribution dynamics have been explored by analyzing the time correlation functions (TCFs) of the total local coordination number (solvent, cosolvent) around the cosolvent molecules in appropriate parts. The analysis of these total TCFs in the auto-(solvent-solvent, cosolvent-cosolvent) and cross-(solvent-cosolvent, cosolvent-solvent) TCFs has shown that the time dependent redistribution process of the first solvation shell of ethanol is mainly determined by the redistribution of the C O2 solvent molecules. These results might be explained on the basis of the C O2 -C O2 and EtOH-C O2 intermolecular forces, which are sufficiently weaker in comparison to the EtOH-EtOH hydrogen bonding interactions, creating in this way a significantly faster redistribution of the C O2 molecules in comparison with EtOH. Finally, the self-diffusion coefficients and the single reorientational dynamics of both the cosolvent and solvent species in the mixture have been predicted and discussed in relationship with the local environment around the species, which in the case of the EtOH molecules seem to be strongly affected. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.",,"Binary mixtures; Computer simulation; Correlation methods; Ethanol; Molecular dynamics; Phase composition; Cosolvent mixtures; Local composition enhancement; Time correlation functions (TCF); Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34250770025

As a consequence, the depletion of stratospheric ozone observed over the last two decades has probably led to an increase in ambient UV radiation. An increase in UV at ground-level may induce a wide range of harmful effects like an increase in skin cancer, cataracts, a decrease in bio-mass production and crop yields, and suppression of the human immune system (UNEP 1999, 2003). Ozone depletion is probably related to the large scale emissions of halocarbons, among which the chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's), in the seventies and eighties of the previous century. The Vienna Convention in 1985 was the starting point for international policy agreements to protect the ozone layer by aiming at reducing the production and emission of ozone depleting substances, and by providing the framework for the restrictive protocols that were agreed upon later. The Montreal protocol in 1987 provided the first restrictive countermeasures and in view of the compelling evidence that ozone depletion occurred, this protocol was subsequently strengthened in several more restrictive Amendments. In the latest Amendments the production of the most potent ozone depleting substances is completely phased out in 1996. A longer phase out period is allowed for the developing countries. These countermeasures are expected to lead to a slow recovery of the ozone layer over the next century. To evaluate the consequence of ozone depletion in terms of health risks such as skin cancer incidence, the full source-risk chain has to be taken into account. The Assessment Model for UV Radiation and Risks (AMOUR) developed at RIVM, in collaboration with NOAA, Utrecht/Leiden University and KNMI, incorporates the various aspects of the source risk chain, including: the link between production and emission of halocarbons, and the resulting depletion of the ozone layer, the consequences of ozone changes for ambient effective UV doses and the corresponding skin cancer risks. The effects of the agreed countermeasures in terms of a recovery of the ozone layer, the (future) UV-radiation levels and their effect on the excess skin cancer risks associated with ozone depletion were previously analysed for the USA and Europe (Slaper et al., 1996). In line with other studies (UNEP, 1999) it was expected that a slow recovery of the ozone layer will occur with a return to 'normal' (1980) levels around 2050. Excess skin cancer risks, caused by ozone depletion, are in those scenarios expected to rise until 2050-2070. Slaper et al (1996) clearly showed the potential success of the countermeasures in reducing the future excess skin cancer risks associated with the chemical depletion of ozone. A limitation of the previous analyses is the basic assumption that ozone depletion is purely chemically driven, and that no interaction with climate change occurs. Thus, it is assumed that the ozone layer will return to the ""normal"" 1980-levels as soon as the active chlorine levels in the stratosphere reach the 1980 levels. However, in view of the ongoing climate change this assumption might well be too simple, and especially polar regions might play a crucial role in the future developments. This paper focuses on the possible effects of past, present and future developments in ozone depletion on UV-radiation levels and the skin cancer risks associated with these changes, using an updated version of the AMOUR-model with a first attempt to include possible effects of climate ozone interactions (Kelfkens et al. 2002). We provide an update of the previous analysis of skin cancer risks for various scenarios for ozone depletion in relation to countermeasures taken and possible effects of ozoneclimate interactions. Special focus is given to the role of climate and ozone changes in the arctic region on the future risks at mid-latitudes in densely populated areas in Europe.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84895254364

On March 1, 2006, San Joaquin Valley Unified Air Pollution Control District's (SJVUAPCD) Indirect Source Rule (ISR) went into effect. This new ISR rule requires land use developers to assess indirect motor vehicle emissions. If the indirect source emissions exceeded the threshold of significance, then the project applicant (i.e., land use developers) must take steps to reduce them, or pay mitigation fees to the air district. Under the new ISR program, applicants are required to use the URB EMIS model to calculate their project level impacts. The California Clean Act Air of 1988 (CCAA) requires air districts in areas with moderate, serious or severe air pollution to include in their air quality attainment plan provisions for developing an indirect sources control program. The CCAA also requires nonattainment air districts to achieve either a 5% reduction in ozone precursor emissions annually or adopt ""all feasible measures."" Because no region in California has been able to meet the 5% goal, most air districts accepted the fact that they must innovate any feasible control measures, including indirect sources, in their attainment plans. With the strong interests about the SJVAPCD ISR program, many other air districts in California are considering to include a similar ISR program for their plans. This paper will provide an overview of the Air Districts indirect source requirements and the current situation with the use of ""off-site"" mitigation fees to reduce emission attributable to the indirect source program.","Air quality; Indirect sources; Land use; Nexus; Off-site mitigation fees; Rough proportionality; Statement of overriding consideration; Transportation","Air pollution; Air quality; Crashworthiness; Land use; Pollution; Pollution control; Quality control; Transportation; Vehicles; Waste management; Air Pollution Control District; Motor vehicle emissions; Nexus; Off sites; Reducing emissions; Rough proportionality; San Joaquin Valley; Statement of overriding consideration; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649181580

To improve the waterquality a multi-purpose Field Margin Regulation was drafted for the Hoeksche Waard island in 2005. The regulation prescribes a crop-free strip, 3.5 m wide, alongside wet drainage ditches. The strip must be sown with mixtures of grasses, flowers or herbs. No crop protection chemicals or fertilizer may be used on the strips. A total length of approximately 200 km of buffer strip has now been laid. Besides reducing emissions, the buffer strips also stimulate natural pest control methods and encourage local tourism. Finally, the strips should lead to an improvement in the farmers' image. The regulation has proved to be successful. The buffer strips boosted both local tourism and the image of the agricultural sector. Above all, the strips provided a natural shield for emission to surface water, which will lead to an improvement of the water quality and raise the farmers' awareness of water quality and the environment. © IWA Publishing 2007.","Agricultural emissions; Buffer strips; Diffuse pollution; Functional biodiversity; Increasing motivation; Water quality","Agricultural chemicals; Agricultural runoff; Biodiversity; Farms; Water pollution; Water quality; Agricultural emission; Buffer strip; Diffuse pollution; Surface waters; agricultural chemical; fertilizer; surface water; Agricultural chemicals; Agricultural runoff; Biodiversity; Farms; Surface waters; Water pollution; Water quality; arable farming; biodiversity; buffer zone; pollution control; water pollution; water quality; agricultural management; agricultural waste; agricultural worker; article; environmental protection; land drainage; legal aspect; Netherlands; pest control; water management; water pollution control; water quality; Agriculture; Netherlands; Soil; Water Pollution; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547660728

However, the strategies being used to control emissions vary with factors such as coal type, existing control technologies and, of course, differences in national and regional legislation. In North America quantifiable reductions in mercury emissions are required and this will be achieved by a combination of emissions trading, fuel switching and advanced control technologies. For example, enhanced particulate control technologies such as COHPAC in combination with activated carbon or related sorbents are proving popular. The situation is different in Europe where the strengthening requirement for the installation of FGD on coal-fired units has meant that mercury emissions from coal combustion have been declining for over two decades. This decline is slowing and it is likely that a new mercury requirement for coal-fired plants may appear within the next five to ten years. Whether the approach taken in Europe will mirror that being taken in North America remains to be seen. It is possible that the legislation will be applied under the existing IPPC scheme and therefore be specified on a plant-by-plant basis.

The surface coverage of oxygen and nitrogen species as well as the oxidation state of Pt under simulated reaction conditions was studied by in-situ XPS. In a series of experiments with NO and NO2, the ratio of NO/NO2 played a critical role in determining the coverage of oxygen on the surface and the availability of empty sites for adsorption of O2, the proposed rate determining step in our L-H mechanism. The experiments showed why the product NO2 effectively inhibits the forward reaction rate by poisoning the surface with oxygen. Based on the kinetics and in-situ XPS results, large platinum particles resisted oxide formation due to the closed-packed structure and remained active whereas small particles which had a more open structure on average were more easily oxidized and became inactive.

The various viewpoints on additionality, assuredness, and permanence combined with outside political pressures will make the acceptance of offset credits from managed forests inconsistent at best. The general belief that a federal greenhouse gas program will happen in the coming years makes it imperative that the forestry community look to influence policy favorably in this regard. No other form of carbon offset project can produce a volume of carbon credits to mitigate climate change with all of the other positive ancillary benefits that managed forests provide society. Clean water, biodiversity esthetics, wood products, and recreation are just a few of the valuable co-benefits from forests that you will not find in agricultural sequestration projects, geologic sequestration, or methane gas capture. The potential for managed forests in this new ecosystem market is significant. New rule-set developments, such as the trend toward recognizing carbon stored in harvested wood products along with the rising prices for carbon credits are creating a significant investment and cash flow opportunity for some forest landowners.

The computations were performed using the SILAM dispersion modelling system based on a 3-D Lagrangian Monte-Carlo particle model, which can treat the aerosol size spectrum using either a bin or a modal approach. The emission data for Europe were obtained from the EMEP inventory for the year 2000, and a finer scale (5 km) emission inventory was compiled for the Fennoscandia region. The meteorological input data were produced using the numerical weather prediction model HIRLAM (the Finnish variant, version 5.2.1). The results computed up to date include primary aerosols; consisting mainly of black and organic carbon, mineral dust, sea salt, and sulphates. We have evaluated the numerical predictions against observational data of the EMEP measurement network, and the data of more detailed field campaigns that were conducted within the EU-BIOFOR project; these also include size-segregated aerosol measurements. The overall agreement of predictions and measurements is fairly good, although there are problems in predicting the secondary organic aerosol and natural dust. The Europe-wide results were also compared with the corresponding computations by the EMEP model, which has a resolution of 50 km. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In the analysis, the quantum electromagnetic radiation field is described by the dominant microcavity TE10 rectangular waveguide mode in the Coulomb gauge, and the instantaneous eigenstates of the Bloch Hamiltonian are utilized as the basis states in describing the Bloch electron dynamics to all orders in the constant external electric field. The results show that the spontaneous emission amplitude, when analyzed over many integral multiple values of the Bloch period, gives rise to selection rules for photon emission in both frequency and wave number with preferred transitions at the Wannier-Stark ladder levels. From these selection rules, the total spontaneous emission probability is derived to first-order perturbation theory in the quantized radiation field. It is shown that the power radiated into the dominant TE10 waveguide mode can be enhanced by an order of magnitude over the free-space value by tuning the Bloch frequency to align with the waveguide spectral density peak. A general expression for the total spontaneous emission probability is obtained in terms of arbitrary superlattice single band parameters, showing multiharmonic behavior and cavity tuning properties. For GaAs -based superlattices, described in the nearest-neighbor tight-binding approximation, the power radiated into the waveguide from spontaneous emission due to Bloch oscillations in the terahertz frequency range is estimated to be several microwatts. © 2007 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846406879

Methane is considered the second most problematic greenhouse gas emitted from anthropogenic sources (23) and its role in the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer (17) is uncontested. Worldwide, approximately 81 Tg methane per year are emitted from the gastrointestinal tract of domestic ruminants and an additional 7 Tg of methane per year originate from the manure of these animals (7). Related to total anthropogenic methane emission, this means that domestic ruminants are responsible for 25% of total anthropogenic methane emission (9). Methane production in the rumen not only represents an ecological but also an economic problem. It was estimated that methane formation during fermentation represents a loss of 7-10% of the ruminant's gross energy intake (15), depending on the level of feed intake, diet composition and apparent digestibility of dietary energy. According to Johnson and Johnson (8), cattle can produce 250 to 500 L of methane per day. There is still a great lack of quantitative data on the efficacy of mitigation strategies, particularly in tropical regions where a very high proportion of domestic ruminants are kept, due to the difficulties in measuring ruminal methanogenesis in conjunction with variations in feeding. Therefore, the purpose of the present chapter is to describe extensively different techniques suitable for quantitative measurement of methane emission from ruminants. These in vitro and in vivo techniques allow the estimation of the efficiency of strategies in mitigating ruminal methane formation. © 2007 IAEA.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84892338434

Another important change that takes place with increasing elevation is the reduction of in-lake colored dissolved organic carbon (cDOC) concentrations, which reflect the dominance of small and sparsely vegetated watersheds at high altitude. Concomitantly with the reduction in cDOC concentrations, there is a significant decrease in the UV absorption capacity of this carbon pool (i.e., reduced content in humic substances). The consequence of these qualitative and quantitative changes of cDOC is that most high-mountain lakes (with the exception of those fed by glacier streams) rank among the most UV-transparent aquatic systems, with UVB (290-320 nm wavelength) penetration depths of up to ca. 30 m. Climatic warming has been particularly pronounced in mountain regions. For example, in the northern Alps, the mean air temperature has increased by 1°C since 1985. Several environmental changes associated with climatic warming, such as glacier retreat and the timing, extent and duration of ice and snow cover, are already taking place in several mountainous regions. Alpine lakes are particularly sensitive to climatic variability because several crucial ecosystem processes are directly affected by those changes. Based on observational analysis, possible changes in alpine lakes are presented. On a short timescale, the decrease in the snow- and ice-cover duration will lead to an increase in UV stress on the ecosystem. However, on a longer timescale, the increase in mean air temperature could favor the development of terrestrial vegetation in the catchment, and result in an increase of cDOC export to alpine lakes, particularly to those located near the treeline. As a consequence, underwater UV transparency and UV stress on these ecosystems will be reduced. This scenario is supported by the finding that the alpine-nival flora in some mountainous regions, such as in the western Austrian and eastern Swiss Alps has moved upward in recent years. On the other hand, glacier retreat may cause turbid lakes to become more UV transparent. The magnitude of these changes will be more important for underwater UVB exposure levels than those expected from ozone reduction at mid-latitudes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, the divergence angle of the emitted laser beam from a planar microcavity with a micrometer-thick defect layer is generally very large because the localization of light in one dimension can not totally suppress the modes in other directions, and the cavity quality factor Q of such devices is low (∼100) and determined thoroughly by the reflectivity of the distributed Bragg reflector (DBR). Recently, we proposed a new cavity structure which was a hybrid cavity combining a planar photonic crystal microcavity and a two-dimensional random cavity defect layer [1]. In the new developed microcavity structure, photons inside the: hybrid cavity are trapped 3-dimensionally. Therefore, optical modes of the cavity were significantly reduced. Consequently, the laser threshold, divergence angle of emitted laser beam, and the spectral linewidth of the laser emission was substantially reduce d by two-fold confinement effects from transverse random cavities and vertical planar microcavity. In this paper, we demonstrated a wavelength tunable planar random microcavity laser. We used dye doped liquid crystal as the gain layer So that the defect mode position can be easily tuned by changing temperature. We reported a nearly single mode ultra-narrow linewidth laser emission from the optically pumped hybrid cavity structure. The 0.03 nm linewidth (corresponding to Q&gt;20000) is about two orders of magnitude narrower than that from a conventional planar microcavity. Tunable random laser emission was observed when the: environment temperature: was slightly increased. Fig. 1a shows typical spectra from a planar random microcavity at different temperatures. Two resonant modes corresponding to ordinary (λ o) and extraordinary light (λe) polarization could be clearly observed at 25°G. They shifted continuously when the temperature increased from 27 to 34°C, At 34.5°C which is over the clearing point of 5CB, birefringence disappeared, both λo and λe jumped to 613.4 nm, By carefully control the size of pumping area, the emitted laser was kept as single narrow linewidth lasing mode during the whole temperature tuning process. Fig. 1b plots together the temperature dependence of the calculated and measured resonant mode wavelength for ordinary and extraordinary light polarizations, the calculated results match well with the measured results.",,"Bragg cells; Crystal atomic structure; Crystal structure; Emission spectroscopy; Laser beams; Lasers; Light; Light emission; Light sources; Linewidth; Liquid crystals; Microcavities; Multiphoton processes; Optical data processing; Optical materials; Photonic crystals; Polarization; Pumping (laser); Random processes; Reflection; Semiconductor quantum dots; Soldered joints; Thickness measurement; Cavity quality factors; Cavity structures; Changing temperatures; Confinement effects; Defect layers; Defect modes; Divergence angles; Dye doped liquid crystals; Environment temperatures; Hybrid cavities; Laser emissions; Laser thresholds; Lasing modes; Measured results; Microcavity lasers; Microcavity structures; Narrow linewidth lasers; One dimensions; Optical modes; Optically pumped; Orders of magnitudes; Planar microcavities; Planar photonic crystals; Pumping areas; Random lasers; Resonant modes; Single modes; Spectral linewidths; Temperature dependences; Temperature tuning; Tunable random lasers; Laser beam effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48349129450

""We must therefore constantly ask,"" he continued, ""to what end? What kind of society are we trying to evolve when we make choices about energy technologies?"" Such a comment underscores a central theme of this book: namely, the seamless integration of energy and American society. Senator Nelson's questions sound even more provocative today, as the country consumes significantly more energy to secure a wider range of services now than it did in 1979. After all, what is more ubiquitous in modern society than energy? It powers our vehicles, lights our workplaces, produces food, enables the manufacturing and distribution of products, cools and warms our homes. Energy is, according to Nobel prize wining economist E.F. Schumacher ""not just another commodity, but the precondition of all commodities, a basic factor equal with air, water, and earth"" (Kirk, 1977, pp. 1-2). Thus, energy is something used, directly and indirectly, by every person in American culture. As an example of its omnipresence, consider one of the most widely consumed forms of energy - electricity. In 2002 the U.S. electricity industry possessed over $700 billion of embedded investment, making it the largest investment sector of the American economy (representing 10% of total U.S. capital expenditure). Annual sales of electricity for the same year were approximately $300 billion, close to 4% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). To generate this revenue, the electric utility industry consumed almost 40% of the country's energy and nearly 5% of its gross national product (Lovins et al., 2002, pp. 69-71; Masters, 2004, p. 107). On top of this complexity, the electric utility industry is regulated by 53 federal, state, and city public service commissions and more than 44,000 different state and local codes. During fiscal year 2003, 242 investor owned utilities operated about 75% of the country's total electrical capacity in addition to more than 3,187 private utilities, 900 cooperatives, 2,012 public utilities, 400 power marketers, 2,168 nonutility generating entities, and nine federal utilities. These organizations distributed their electricity through roughly 500,000 miles of high voltage transmission lines and an ever greater number of distribution lines (Palast et al., 2003). When grappling with these complex issues, the bulk of studies concerning energy and American society tend to focus on either assessing individual technologies or forecasting energy futures. Regarding the first approach, technology assessment, most of the recent policy briefs and books that address energy in America attack the problem within technologically and disciplinarily narrow boundaries. The Edison Electric Institute (EEI) and Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) tend to center purely on the economics of electricity supply and demand, while reports from groups like the Pew Center on Global Climate Change and the Natural Resources Defense Council emphasize the environmental dimensions of energy consumption. The National Academies of Science and Union of Concerned Scientists have produced insightful analysis of the security and infrastructure challenges facing the energy sector, while groups like the Alliance to Save Energy and the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy remain principally concerned with conservation and energy efficiency. Those that analyze particular types of energy supply - such as the Nuclear Energy Institute, American Wind Energy Association, the American Solar Energy Society, or the Combined Heat and Power Association - often confine their analyses to a limited range of technologies, rarely exploring how such technologies operate in society as a whole. This ""stove piping"" approach also carries over into the design and pursuit of the nation's energy research and development (R&D) - in all layers of government, academe, and industry. Integrative concepts that combine systems and cut across technologies, disciplines, and sectors of the economy are difficult to pursue. Developing sweeping novel concepts is an inter-disciplinary, complex undertaking that requires new partnerships and alliances and a broad understanding of technologies and markets. At the same time, the combination of concepts into more efficiently functioning systems could have large and positive implications for energy futures. For example, in a recent review of the U.S. climate change R&D portfolio, the lack of focus on integrated technologies was seen as a critical gap (Brown et al. 2006). Several illustrations of merged suites of technologies that have received limited attention include: • Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs): Integration of plug-in HEVs with the electric grid for both recharging and discharging power and to support utility peak-shaving could dramatically reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles if recharging is done principally with low-carbon forms of electricity such as nuclear or renewable resources. • Systems engineered urban planning and design: Land use can be designed to reduce travel requirements and foster the co-location of activities with common needs for energy, water, and other resources, resulting in greatly diminished requirements for transportation fuels; greenhouse gas emissions could be further reduced through the co-location of energy sources and carbon sinks. • Systems approach to integrated waste management: The energy used in waste management and the utilization of methane from landfill gases can be optimized through systems that involve product tagging and sorting to maximize energy recovery from waste, reuse and recycling as well as distributed waste processing (e.g., in homes, businesses, and industry) for conversion to power and fuels. • Water-energy nexus: Water and energy are inextricably bound together in today's society, and any future technologies that address one will likely impact the other. Ultimately, society needs more efficient use of energy to support water distribution and treatment, and more efficient use of water to support energy supply; these cross-linkages have gone largely unexamined. Thus, the need for new and creative approaches assessing the intersection of energy systems and society at large are almost as urgently needed as they are unlikely to occur in contemporary discussions about energy policy in the United States. The second popular approach taken by analysts concerned with energy and society is to perform technological forecasts. Reports from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and International Energy Agency (IEA) typically focus on estimating generation capacities, projecting fuel costs, and predicting the environmental impacts of particular energy technologies. For example, the paragon of excellence among these types of reports, the EIA's Annual Energy Outlook (EIA, 2005b), predicts the current and future technical potential for energy technologies, but does not anticipate expected policy changes or provide policy recommendations. As Amory Lovins (2005), director of the Rocky Mountain Institute, recently told senators, ""the Annual Energy Outlook is not fate; it is not a mandate that one must fulfill; and it absolutely does not illuminate the true range of national choice."" R. Neal Elliott (2005, p. 84) adds that ""the EIA needs updated modeling capability to reflect adequately [the new] market realities facing the American electric utility sector."" In other words, energy forecasts often assume the existing configuration of the industry, and thus restricts their consideration to a very narrow range of alternatives. For instance, such forecasting tools typically focus on averages and do not explore the underlying compositions that constitute such data, thereby overlooking the wide variations of submarkets and trends that can be hidden through the process of compiling statistics. Historian Theodore Porter (1995) notes that the process of such quantification has many flaws, including (but not limited to) the choice of samples, preservation of samples, control of reagents, methods of measurement, custody of samples, methods of recording data, training personnel, controlling bias, and the formation of categories. Sociologist Nikolas Rose (1991) adds that political judgments are implicit in the choice of what to measure, how to measure it, how often to measure it, and how to interpret the results. For example, in characterizing energy resources, the EIA uses categories of fuels such as coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear, and renewable resources. The omission of energy efficiency from this mix reinforces the perception that a megawatt saved (i.e., a ""negawatt"") is not as valuable as a megawatt generated. Quantification is no less arbitrary and subjective, in the end, than any other human activity. Yet, as a culture, we choose to lend ""numbers"" (and the reports that they constitute) immense power.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955724576

Most significantly are the two precursors, VOC's and NOx where typically two thirds of these emissions arise from vehicular and biogenic emissions. South African emission inventories traditionally focus attention on industrial emissions. It is postulated that local emission inventories, and photochemical modelling, is deficient in not fully including these two important emissions sources. Without which, it will be impossible to manage and mitigate ozone pollution in South Africa. Vegetation emission estimates currently utilise an outdated land use/cover file; a database which includes less than ten percent of local plant species; mostly USA and European emission factors, and ignores plant adaptation to local climatic conditions. Ideally a large-scale field study is required to establish local biogenic emissions augmenting the international data. A method to generate emission rates based on MODIS data is proposed. Similarly, acquiring sufficient local vehicular traffic data to enable accurate emission estimates is problematic. It is therefore critical to develop a GIS based top down approach to enable estimates of these essential emissions. In this study a regional GIS based framework is compared to satellite derived data from which it is concluded that remote sensing data yields better emission inventories with fewer resources. This is ideal for countries that do not have easy access to high resolution data that is normally required for detailed bottom-up emission inventory methodologies.","BVOC; Emission inventory; Fires; GIS; Land use; MODIS; NOx; NPP; Ozone; Photochemistry; Vehicle emission","Geographic information systems; Land use; Mathematical models; Ozone; Photochemical reactions; Emission inventory; Vehicle emission; Industrial emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44349155335

It is not clear how much, how fast, and where the climate will change, but it is becoming increasingly certain that there is a connection and that transportation is a major source of the GHG emissions. Transportation is the largest source of GHG emissions in the United States and is the sector where GHG emissions are growing the fastest. Despite a variety of political commitments around the world to reduce CO2 emissions, including the Kyoto Protocol, emissions continue to increase. The majority of GHG emissions occurs in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2), and most CO2 emissions are the result of the combustion of fossil fuels. No approach to climate change prevention can be comprehensive without a major focus on transportation. Opportunities abound to reduce transportation-related GHG emissions. Reductions can be realized even while increasing people's (and firms') access to goods and services. The opportunities include improved fuel efficiency, improved fuel and vehicle technologies, a more robust mix of transportation fuels, and demand-side strategies that improve the efficiency of the transportation system. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

This growth induced major shifts in the national nitrogen and ammonia balance, with feedstuff being imported from abroad and animal waste being used in excess in Dutch agricultural areas. Growing environmental responsibility, which was triggered by scientific observations on field-scale early-on, resulted in putting animal waste and ammonia on the political agenda. Governmental regulations were put in effect and research programs were set-up to develop techniques to measure and reduce ammonia emissions based on a scientific approach. Meanwhile, an inventory was made of the size of the animal waste problem. Additionally, the impacts on the environment were studied, as well as technical solutions to minimize the animal waste production were developed. This book aims to provide a full overview of all ammonia emission related aspects of animal husbandry in the Netherlands. Besides the background information as described above, it includes a technical and practical inventory of emission sources from cattle, pig, and poultry housings, followed by a listing of government approved housing systems and manure application techniques that have been measured according to standard protocols to quantify the on-farm decrease of ammonia emissions. For both traditional and low emission systems a list of emission factors is included. By presenting common practices in the Netherlands, this book also informs other EU countries about our ongoing insights regarding Dutch regulations, measurement protocols, abatement techniques and interpretation of measured farm-scale data to national emission values. In this way it will contribute to directing the development of livestock production throughout the EU member states towards a healthy and more sustainable future. © Wageningen Academic Publishers.

One of these, an 8-hole injector with 70° spray angle, provides significant reduction in NOX emissions at a given fuel-to-CO 2 conversion efficiency (i.e., an improved NOX-CO 2 trade-off) compared to the other, a 53° swirl injector. In contrast, attempts to enhance the NOX-CO2 trade-off using alternate charge-stratification strategies such as split injection and high intake velocity are shown to be less successful. The 8-hole and swirl injectors are also compared using the optical techniques of Mie scattering (spray visualization), laser-induced fluorescence imaging (fuel distribution measurement), and direct combustion imaging. The resulting data suggest two possible explanations for the superior performance of the 8-hole injector. First, some fuel leaving the swirl injector at the end of injection burns as a liquid, likely contributing to NOX emissions. In contrast, no liquid burning is apparent with the 8-hole injector. Second, fuel distributions measured by fluorescence imaging show that probability density function (PDF) statistics of equivalence-ratio distribution are similar for the two injectors, but the 8-hole injector produces smaller and more numerous fuel packets that could lead to lower local peak gas temperatures and therefore lower NO X emissions.

Such regulation will likely lead to a rise in electricity prices. Because electricity costs represent a major expense in operating HVAC equipment, higher prices will likely accelerate the pace of development of more efficient technology. The domestic HVAC industry is well set in its ways, so such efficiency improvements are likely to be incremental rather than the wholesale introduction of revolutionary new technologies. Examples of the sorts of incremental improvements that carbon dioxide regulation may drive include more-robust economizers and low-temperature heat pumps. Although economizers are required by code as an energy-saving technology, they frequently fail, which often results in large energy losses. The Eugene Water and Electric Board is pioneering the development of better economizers as well as better installation techniques. Heat pumps, which are capable of moving several units of heat for every unit of electrical input, also have the potential to cut energy consumption. However, their dependence on electric resistance backup heat has held back their diffusion into northern states. A few small manufacturers are pioneering the development of low-temperature heat pumps that are capable of operating under very cold conditions with little or no electric resistance backup. Both of these technologies require more research to improve reliability and drive down prices. Perhaps carbon dioxide regulation will make these technologies more attractive for investment by entrepreneurs as well as customers.",,"Cold conditions; Efficiency improvement; Efficient technology; Electric boards; Electrical inputs; Electricity costs; Electricity prices; Emerging technologies; Energy-saving technologies; Heat pumps; HVAC equipment; Incremental improvements; Installation technique; Low temperatures; Well-set; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Economizers; Electric resistance; Energy dissipation; Energy utilization; Heat pump systems; Heat resistance; Technology; Temperature; Air conditioning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867457809

Bombardier Transportation has equipped one bogie of a prototype LRV (light rail vehicle) for the public transportation operator RNV in Mannheim with a MITRAC Energy Saver. Outstanding feature is the daily operation of the energy storage unit in daily passenger service, and this even since September 2003. The experiences are very positive. The measured traction energy saving of approximately 30% confirmed fully the former calculations. Running the energy storage device on board of a tram brings additionally following benefits: • a dramatic reduction of the peak power demand • ""catenary free operation"" on several hundred meters without power supply from the catenary • catenary free city center by on board storage and recharging stations Applying the energy storage devices in Metro systems has a similar effect as in case of LRVs. However the savings distribution in the whole system will be a little bit different. Due to higher regeneration capability of metro systems the expected share of the train propulsion saving will be lower. It will be compensated by a considerable reduction of the line losses, especially for systems with low rated catenary voltages (600V or 750V). Very promising are energy storage applications in propulsion systems of Diesel-Electrical Multiple Units (DEMUs). These vehicles lack possibilities to use the braking energy of the train. Energy storage systems on board of DEMUs bring high fuel savings together with the corresponding emission reduction. On top of that the energy storage leads to a booster effect - extra power during acceleration from the storage, by adding the limited weight of the MITRAC Energy Saver.","Efficiency; Energy storage; Railway vehicles; SuperCapacitors; Traction application","Applications; Automobile electronic equipment; Automobile parts and equipment; Competition; Computer networks; Electric current collection; Energy storage; Flywheels; Fuel economy; Fuel storage; Grid computing; Leakage (fluid); Light rail transit; Locomotives; Photolithography; Power electronics; Propulsion; Railroad cars; Railroad rolling stock; Railroads; Rails; Vehicles; Efficiency; Energy saver; Railway vehicles; SuperCapacitors; Traction application; Energy conservation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-51049105014

With regard to livestock, N and C cycles are closely connected to livestock's role in land use and land-use change. Livestock's land use includes grazing land and cropland dedicated to the production of feed crops and fodder. Considering emissions along the entire commodity chain, livestock currently contribute about 18% to the global warming effect. Livestock contribute about 9% of total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, but 37% of methane (CH4), and 65% of nitrous oxide (N 2O). The latter will substantially increase over the coming decades, as the pasture land is currendy at maximum expanse in most regions; future expansion of the livestock sector will increasingly be crop based.

The biocover consisted of 50 cm pre-composted yard or garden waste placed over a 10-15 cm gas distribution layer (crushed glass) over a 40-100 cm interim cover. The biocover cells reduced CH4 emissions by a factor of 10 and doubled the percentage of CH4 oxidation relative to control cells. The thickness and moisture-holding capacity of the biocover resulted in increased retention times for transported CH4. This increased retention of CH4 in the biocover resulted in a higher fraction oxidized. Overall rates between the two covers were similar, about 2 g CH4 m-2 d-1, but because CH4 entered the biocover from below at a slower rate relative to the soil cover, a higher percentage was oxidized. In part, methane oxidation controlled the net flux of CH4 to the atmosphere. The biocover cells became more effective than the control sites in oxidizing CH4 3 months after their initial placement: the mean percent oxidation for the biocover cells was 41% compared to 14% for the control cells (p &lt; 0.001). Following the initial 3 months, we also observed 29 (27%) negative CH4 fluxes and 27 (25%) zero fluxes in the biocover cells but only 6 (6%) negative fluxes and 22 (21%) zero fluxes for the control cells.

The aim of the study was to analyze the relationships between regional and urban air quality levels and the modelled effectiveness of control measures in an urban area as a function of varying, horizontal grid resolution. The study should help to answer the question of how reliably regional scale model calculations can be used to compute air quality in urban areas. The RCG model was run at four different grid resolutions to assess the air quality in Berlin:1.A European scale grid resolution of 0.25° Latitude by 0.5° Longitude (i.e., nominally about 30-km);2.A national scale (Germany) grid having twice the resolution of grid #1 (i.e., approx. 15-km);3.A Federal State (Brandenburg) grid having 8 times the resolution of grid #1 (i.e., approx. 4-km) and,4.An urban (Berlin) grid having 32-times the resolution of grid #1 (i.e., approx. 1-km). High-resolution emissions data generated by the ""bottom-up"" approach were available for Berlin and Brandenburg. These emissions were used for grids #3 and #4. The European and German scale calculations on grids #1 and #2, respectively, were carried out employing the ""top-down"" TNO emissions inventory for Europe for base-year 2000 at the 0.125° lat. by 0.25° longitude resolution of grid #2. Because the emissions estimates of the two inventories differ substantially for the greater Berlin area, the local bottom-up emissions were integrated into the large scale TNO data base, thus, allowing the usage of harmonized emissions at all scales. A base run for each scale was carried out and compared with PM10 and NO2 observations taken within the area of Berlin. It turned out that model performance was best for the run with the highest grid resolution. As might be expected, the urban increment was strongly underestimated by the regional (grid #1) model resolution. The results of two emissions scenarios, a 50% reduction of all emissions and the CLE-scenario (Implementation of current legislation until 2010), clearly showed that the effects of a measure will be underestimated in urban areas if they are based on a regional scale model application. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

First investigations for the 80-year old dump Plessa in the Lower Lusatian mining district (East Germany) show evidence for active sulphate reduction. Mining dump waters from the Plessa site have pH values of 2.4 to 4.9 and pe values between 2 and 6. Measured sulphide concentrations range from 50 to 1200 μg/L. The influence of bacterial sulphate reduction on the development of sulphate concentrations in the dump waters is supported by increasing δ34S and δ 18O values with decreasing sulphate concentrations.

Models used to study this influence must demonstrate the credibility of their chemistry and transport in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UT/LS). Data sets from satellite and aircraft instruments measuring CO, O3, N2O, and CO2 in the UT/LS are used to create a suite of diagnostics for the seasonally-varying transport into and within the lowermost stratosphere, and of the coupling between the troposphere and stratosphere in the extratropics. The diagnostics are used to evaluate a version of the Global Modeling Initiative (GMI) Chemistry and Transport Model (CTM) that uses a combined tropospheric and stratospheric chemical mechanism and meteorological fields from the GEOS-4 general circulation model. The diagnostics derived from N2O and O3 show that the model lowermost stratosphere has realistic input from the overlying high latitude stratosphere in all seasons. Diagnostics for the LMS show two distinct layers. The upper layer begins ∼30 K potential temperature above the tropopause and has a strong annual cycle in its composition. The lower layer is a mixed region ∼30 K thick near the tropopause that shows no clear seasonal variation in the degree of tropospheric coupling. Diagnostics applied to the GMI CTM show credible seasonally-varying transport in the LMS and a tropopause layer that is realistically coupled to the UT in all seasons. The vertical resolution of the GMI CTM in the UT/LS, ∼1 km, is sufficient to realistically represent the extratropical tropopause layer. This study demonstrates that the GMI CTM has the transport credibility required to study the impact of tropospheric emissions on the stratosphere.",,"annual cycle; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; circulation modeling; data set; nitrous oxide; ozone; pollutant transport; remote sensing; resolution; stratosphere; timescale",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248569463

To survive at low T, microbes can reduce their cell size and their capsular polysaccharide coat thickness; they can also change their fatty acid and phospholipid composition. The unfrozen microsites, surrounded by ice, have limited gas exchange, which leads to the development of O2 deficiency thereby, favoring denitrification. Most of the studies exploring gas emissions from soil at low T have focused on the periods of soil thaw, when peaking emission rates can be observed. Finally, the T responses of N2O production and reduction rates might significantly differ among different soil types depending upon the composition of the microbial communities. The term ""halophile"" includes organisms that require NaCl or another salt for growth (""salt-resistant organisms"") and those which thrive in both non-saline and saline habitats. The chapter gives a description of halophilic environment. The aerobic halophilic Archaea of the family Halobacteriaceae are the halophiles par excellence. Extreme halophilic and non-salt-tolerant bacteria are found site-by-site at all salt concentrations in the soil.

The general consensus has been that the fractures tend to interfere with each other in producing the same hydrocarbon source. The rule of thumb for this practice is to place hydraulic fractures substantially separated from one another in a horizontal wellbore or in different layers in a vertical well. Another possibility is to place a subsequent hydraulic fracture perpendicular to the earlier hydraulic fracture at the same wellbore location so that production sharing only occurs near the wellbore. This is achieved by temporarily modifying the stresses in the formation using the first fracture immediately prior to creating the second fracture. It is understood that stress modification can be accomplished in two ways: in the linear elastic range, or in a nonlinear plastic region. This paper proposes the theory that fractures generated in the elastic range may not be effective for this procedure, and that primary efforts should be directed instead toward placement in the realm of ""far"" plasticity; all the way into the behaviorally fluidized sector. This paper will apply a modified Maxwell creep motion to a relatively homogeneous, soft- to medium-strength formation to maximize the reach of the second fracture and substantially improve production.

Hybrid electric vehicles (HEV's) were the first proposed solution to reduce energy consumption, however much additional improvement is necessary. Benefits of HEV's include a smaller internal combustion engine (ICE), the inherent efficiency of the electric motor at low speeds, and the reuse of the braking energy which have generated fuel efficiency improvements of ∼25%, a good start but a long way from solving the energy crisis. The long-term goal for automotive power systems is zero emissions and zero use of hydrocarbon-based fuels. The significance of successful demonstration of hybrid technology is the development of appropriate electric motors, optimization and control systems, regenerative braking systems, and identification of the limits of existing battery technology. These benefits can be extended by increasing the vehicle's energy storage capacity with batteries an order of magnitude larger and with the additional energy coming from the electric grid, ideally generated from non-carbon sources. Theoretical studies have suggested that a majority of American commuters could avoid the daily use of gasoline with such a system. A Ford Escape Hybrid was obtained from the City of Chicago to be used as a test platform for this concept. Initial goal was to double the expected 25 miles per gallon using lithium ion battery technology. After characterizing the vehicle's electric power needs, a battery was proposed, designed, and installed using a controller to regulate the pack output into Ford's existing motor drive system. Initial results show proof-of-concept via improved all-electric range and gas mileage. The patented thermal management technology developed by IIT Licensee All Cell Technologies LLC allowed the use of latest high-power lithium ion cells in this demanding application.

The nature of the linkages depends on the dimensions: economic, institutional or environmental, and on the scale. Differences are pervasive: adaptation and mitigation usually have different temporal and spatial scales and are mostly relevant for different economic sectors, so that costs and benefits are distributed differently. The article concludes that generally the global, regional and—in most countries—national potential of synergetic options to mitigate and adapt to climate change is relatively low, and both strategies should be considered as complementary. However, a few notable exceptions are identified in the land and water management and urban planning sectors, in particular in countries or locations where these sectors provide important adaptation and mitigation opportunities. What is the theoretically most efficient and least expensive mixture of adaptation and mitigation policies may not be a very urgent policy question. Instead, five pragmatic ways of broadening climate policy are suggested, while taking into account the linkages between adaptation and mitigation: (1) avoiding trade-offs—when designing policies for mitigation or adaptation, (2) identifying synergies, (3) enhancing response capacity, (4) developing institutional links between adaptation and mitigation—e.g. in national institutions and in international negotiations, and (5) mainstreaming adaptation and mitigation considerations into broader sustainable development policies. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Mitigative capacity; Policy formation; Sustainable development; Synergy","climate change; environmental policy; institutional development; integrated approach; international agreement; mitigation; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38549168651

The town of Zvecan and Mitrovica have been exposed for many years to the poisons emissions of the Zvecan stacks. Indeed, according to a crude estimate, about a ton of lead vapours were daily related to the atmosphere through the main stack Because of the imposing emissions, the KFOR Headquarters decided to stop in August 2000 the roasting plant activity at Zvecan. However, atmospheric transport of the emissions from the Zvecan plants provoked a serious heavy metal pollution of a vast area embarcing the Iber and Sitnica valleys: soils, air within a radius of at least 10 kilometers from the stacks are heavily polluted mostly for highly toxic elements such as lead and cadmium. The study employed microenvironment monitoring technique to access the exposure of suspended particulate and airborne lead at heavily trafficked urban roadside. A total of 25 roadside side in 8 districts were selected which covered the most urbanized and densely populated area.

Such considerations are gaining further importance in light of the growing realization of the serious environmental problems facing world communities and the resulting increasing sense of environmental responsibility. In this context, this paper discusses how both climatic conditions and specific characteristics of a site can significantly contribute to the goal of unplugging our dependency on conventional non-sustainable energy sources and supporting a healthier sustainable practice. The paper presents a methodology for the design of sustainable off-grid housing which aims to synthesize the qualitative aspects of housing design with the quantitative and performance-related considerations that need to be addressed in order to achieve these goals. This methodology involves a bio-climatic approach to design targeting reductions in loads, response to solar geometry, incorporation of passive heating and cooling systems, use of on-site water harvesting, use of photovoltaic technology for electricity production, and, when needed, integration of high efficiency auxiliary mechanical systems. This aims to demonstrate how the accumulative affect of the inclusions of these benevolent technologies can lead to sustainable off-grid housing. The paper focuses on ""off-grid"" housing as a means of demonstrating through design the necessary impact required by these systems so that an understanding of the extremes required from completely unplugging from conventional sources and systems may be illustrated. Demonstrating this more radical architectural response to accomplish off-grid housing will enable a better understanding for applying these principles and systems to larger developments, increased densities and differing housing typologies.

The C F2 Cl2 molecule and a cyclic water trimer (H2 O)3 were used as halocarbon and water cluster, respectively. The dynamics calculation of C F2 Cl2 showed that both C-Cl bonds are largely elongated after the electron capture, while one of the Cl atoms is dissociated from C F2 Cl2- as a Cl- ion. Almost all total available energy was transferred into the internal modes of the parent C F2 Cl radical on the product state, while the relative translational energy of Cl- was significantly low due to the elongation of two C-Cl bonds. In the case of a halocarbon-water cluster system, the geometry optimization of neutral complex C F2 Cl2 (H2 O)3 showed that one of the Cl atoms interacts with n orbital of water molecules of trimer and the other Cl atom existed as a dangling Cl atom. After the electron capture, only one C-Cl bond (dangling Cl atom) was rapidly elongated, whereas the other C-Cl bond is silent during the reaction. The dangling Cl atom was directly dissociated from C F2 Cl2- (H2 O)3 as Cl-. The fast Cl- ion was generated from C F2 Cl2- (H2 O)3 on the water cluster.

The spherical wiistite fine particle as fine iron ore was prepared to simplify the reduction rate analysis. Reduction temperature was varied from 1 373 to 1 573 K. As the result, fractional reduction of spherical wüstite by CH4 gas reached over 80% at 1573 K within 1s. From the cross section observation of the particle after reduction, it was found that the periphery of the wüstite particle was metallized by reducing reaction and un-reacted wüstite core remained inside. Therefore, it was indicated that the reduction progressed topochemically in this experimental condition. In the reduction rate analysis, it was found out that the reduction rate by CH4 was higher than that by H2 or CO. From the carbon concentration analysis, it was found that the phase of the metallic shell during reduction was not only solid state but also liquid state.

Kaolin is selected as the sorbent to absorb vapors of sodium compounds evolved from the coals. In the combustion experiments, the kaolin is physically mixed with coal. Two types of coal, which have the similar coal properties, are burned. Combustion tests are conducted, using an electrically heated drop tube furnace, to study effect of kaolin addition on the capture characteristics of sodium compounds. In order to elucidate fundamentals on transformation behaviors of sodium compounds during hydrogen-air combustion, chemical kinetic simulation by elementary reactions relating to sodium compounds is also performed, varying the reaction atmosphere. As a result, the kaolin can effectively capture the vapor of sodium compounds even during coal combustion. The capture efficiency depends on the coal type. The sodium compounds for the coals, which produce many fine particles with size of less than 1 μm, tend to be effectively captured by the kaolin. According to the kinetic simulation of sodium species, difference of the reaction atmosphere affects occurrence species of sodium vapor. In the combustion region, the sodium compounds become metallic sodium vapor in any reaction atmospheres due to occurrence of the reducing radical species.

One way to meet this objective is to introduce a constraint on household annual CO2emission (HACO2). However, behaviors that reduce CO2 emissions, may appear too expensive, or to worsen living conditions. Although the goal of controlling CO2 emissions is widely accepted, in practice it is not easy to reduce energy consumption. This paper develops a CO2 emission trading scheme (CETS) framework for households based on the definition HACO2. In this study, a city’s CO2 emission is assumed to be the sum of all HACO2. The CO2 constraint for a single household is determined by the city’s total CO2 emission reduction target. Multi-agent simulator is applied to clarify household behavior-selections under such constraint, and to find the effects of total CO2 emission within the urban model. Simulations are performed with CETS (Case 1) and without CETS (Case 2). Results indicate 1) Under a CO2 constraint, agents choose behaviors to meet the HACO2 constraint. Total CO2 emissions within the urban model decrease toward the pre-determined reduction target. 2) The CETS framework for household level is proved not only cost-efficient but also promotes the process of reducing CO2 emissions. 3) An agent that acts for self-benefit will not consider the completeness of the total target.

For this purpose, an artificial ecosystem, including crops, domestic animals, and human inhabitants, needs to be maintained in the CEEF for several months. As a preparatory study, two-week habitation experiments using the CEEF were planned in 2006. In the first habitation experiment, a CO2 separator was continuously operated with a cycle of 60-minute adsorption and 60-minute desorption periods in order to remove excess CO2 from the habitation room, and the maximum CO2 concentration of air in this room slightly exceeded 5000 ppm, which was identical to the maximum 8-hour exposure permitted for industrial settings. In the second habitation experiment, therefore, the duration of both the adsorption and desorption periods for the operation of the CO2 separator was shortened to 54 minutes in order to increase the cumulative number of adsorption periods per day. The approx. 10% increase in the cumulative number of adsorption periods per day resulted in a decrease of approx. 10% in the maximum CO2 concentration of air in the habitation room during the second habitation experiment. This result demonstrated how the improved operation of the CO2 separator contributed to maintaining the CO 2 concentration of air in the habitation room below the maximum 8-hour exposure permitted for industrial settings.

In addition, many leaders, including solid waste managers, who are not yet pressured from the outside, consider it prudent to account for their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and consider it a proactive measure to assess climate risks and opportunities and to show commitment to progress. Sources of GHG emissions in the solid waste management process include: waste transport vehicles, composting facilities, processing equipment, landfills, and waste-to-energy facilities. Over the past 25 years, the levels of GHG emissions have been reduced through technological advancements in waste-to-energy, environmental regulations such as the Clean Air Act, landfill gas capture and control, and the promotion of recycling and reuse. There are many opportunities for solid waste managers to further reduce their GHG emissions levels, including promotion of waste-to-energy facilities as part of a low-carbon solid waste management plan.

In situ aeration is an emerging means for remediation of abandoned landfills. It aims at an accelerated mineralization and stabilization of waste organic matter and thus reduces significantly the emission potential of the site. In order to prove the success of the technique, evaluation of the biological stability of the aerated material has been suggested. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) provides comprehensive information on the chemical composition of solid waste samples. Different stages of organic matter degradation are reflected by changes in the infrared spectral pattern. In the present study the feasibility of applying FT-IR for assessment of the stability of waste material derived from abandoned landfills and for in situ aeration process control was investigated. Waste samples derived in the course of pilot-scale and lab-scale aeration experiments were characterized by FT-IR (4000-400 cm-1, KBr-technique, transmission mode) and a set of conventional parameters describing biological stability. The occurrence of distinct indicator bands was correlated with chemical and biological waste properties using 206 solid waste samples. Visual spectra interpretation was found to be appropriate in proving a reduced emission potential of initially rather reactive waste (respiration activity over 4 days (RA4) &gt; 7 mg O2 g-1 DM) during aeration. Furthermore, cluster analysis was applied successfully to differentiate between original and aerated waste samples, even for rather stable material (RA 4 &lt; 7 mg O2 g-1 DM), when visual spectra interpretation was limited. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"organic matter; aeration; article; chemical composition; cluster analysis; environmental monitoring; infrared spectroscopy; landfill; municipal solid waste; priority journal; solid waste; statistical significance; Cluster Analysis; Environmental Monitoring; Refuse Disposal; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Waste Products",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33846115561

At this time, WTE is a major source of renewable energy, much larger than the combined wind and solar energies Methane emissions from the global landfilling of post-recycling municipal solid wastes (MSW) correspond to 4% of the anthropogenic greenhouse gases that are affecting adversely climate. MSW generation depends both on population growth and economic development and is expected to more than double by 2030. The only alternatives to landfilling of MSW are various thermal treatment technologies that use MSW as a fuel to generate electricity and heat. The dominant technology is controlled combustion of as-received MSW on a moving grate. In the period 2000-2007, this technology grew at the rate of about three million tons of new capacity per year. However, in the last two decades, novel thermal treatment technologies, such as Direct Smelting, Thermoselect gasification, and Circulating Fluid Bed have also been developed and hold considerable promise for the future. The global thermal treatment capacity now amounts to about 160 million tons per year and at the current annual growth of about 4 million tons, it will not have a significant impact on reducing landfill methane emissions by the year 2030. This will require a much greater global growth of thermal treatment capacity.

Many governments, however, have sustainable energy or sustainability strategies that place little emphasis on renewable energy. One reason is that despite acceptance of the concept of sustainable development as a concept, the reality is that economic growth remains the dominant policy objective of most governments and sustainability and sustainable development are such ill-defined concepts that lack of precise definition often confuses the debate. Climate change, however, is one issue for which the meaning over what is sustainable and what is unstainable has become clearer and the need to balance economic growth with reductions in greenhouse gas emissions has become urgent. The question of by when, by what means, by how much and by whom GHG emissions need to be reduced are now the critical questions. The question of the extent to which renewable energy is essential to the goal of reducing emissions therefore has become more pressing. Some governments continue to see renewable energy as an expensive and unnecessary option and that other, lower cost options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector exist. Western Australia makes an interesting case study as the State is experiencing rapid economic growth supported by rapidly increasing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Policies to date have focused on the fact that the state relies heavily on natural gas rather than coal and encourages the efficient use of energy. Western Australia's energy situation and greenhouse gas emissions strategies are reviewed in order to assess the extent to which this greenhouse gas reduction policy that has to date placed a relatively low emphasis on renewable energy is likely to be successful. © 2007 American Institute of Physics.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36849014230

The four CERES instruments (Flight Models 1 through 4) aboard Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra and Aqua platforms were instrumental in conducting lunar radiance measurement on a regular basis. Moon-reflected solar radiances were measured with the shortwave sensor while both moon-reflected solar and moon-emitted longwave radiances were measured using the total sensor. The CERES sensors performed lunar measurements at various phase angles ranging from four to ten degrees before and after each full moon phase. Additional measurements were also conducted during the lunar eclipse events. The resulting filtered radiances were normalized to the mean sun-moon distance and the mean earth-moon distance. The lunar radiances measured by the sensors from all CERES instruments for a period of January 2001 to June 2007 were analyzed and compared.

To our knowledge this is the first time this methodology has ever been used in this sector, or any similar sector. The Department of Environment and Conservation's (DEC) goal is to work with stakeholders in Western Australia's ISDV sector to develop a campaign to encourage voluntary behaviour change that simultaneously helps the sector to reduce costs and improve environmental performance. Its focus is on changing behaviours by attempting to understand why some people adopt sustainable behaviours while others do not. The initiative is investigating the barriers to, and benefits of, changing identified behaviours, and will assist or encourage those who have not adopted these behaviours to do so. Two particular behaviours that have been identified as appropriate targets for our efforts are: driving habits (for example, idling, braking, loads, route planning, vehicle speeds) and vehicle maintenance. A survey and some in-depth interviews of drivers and fleet managers of light commercial diesel vehicles (LCVs) and articulated trucks (ATs) has been conducted to find out how they drive and maintain their vehicles. Data from this market research will allow us to develop a pilot project to trial the program. Feedback from this pilot project will then allow us to design a more effective program for targeting a broader portion of the ISDV sector.","Leaving 3 mm (9 pt) space above and 7 mm (20 pt) space below; You can include up to two lines of keywords (for CD ROM search)","Data reduction; Diesel engines; Education; Project management; Market research; Stakeholders; Emission control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44349190223

However, availability of metals to organisms is not dependent on the total amount of a metal, which is present in the soil, but rather on how it is chemically bound within the soil. In the summer of 1999, 98 samples of topsoil were collected near traffic arteries and at playgrounds, at schools and at several single playgrounds in the centre of Oslo, Norway. At 24 playgrounds in the central districts, additional samples of sand from sandboxes were taken near playing facilities made of impregnated or painted wood. Besides the determination of the acid-soluble concentrations of seven trace metals, a sequential five-stage extraction was accomplished for all 122 samples. These five fractions (i.e. exchangeable, carbonate, reducible substrate, organic and residual) were analysed for As. At the 24 playgrounds, the acid-soluble concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in topsoil samples are higher than in samples of sand collected from the sandboxes. The differences in As concentrations between topsoil and sandbox samples are small. In all the topsoil samples, the concentrations of As exceed the norm value for polluted soil used by the Norwegian authorities. In the sandbox samples, 63% of the samples exceed this value. In the exchangeable, the carbonate and the reducible substrate fractions, As concentrations in the sandbox samples lie at a higher level than concentrations in topsoil samples taken at the same playground. Leaching of As compounds from impregnated and painted wood has probably caused elevated concentrations of this element. In the organic fractions, only one playground has a higher concentration in the sandbox sample than in the topsoil sample. In the residual fraction, only four playgrounds have As concentrations that are higher in the sandbox sample than the concentration in the topsoil. Despite the fact that concentrations in sand are lower than in topsoil, 15 of 24 sandbox samples contain more As than the norm value for polluted soil. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, the origin and subsequent geographical expansion of the C4 plants likely reflects a record of climate change. Multiple paleoatmospheric pCO2 proxies indicate a critical CO2 threshold was breached ∼30 Ma, that potentially selected for CO2-concentrating mechanisms to overcome photorespiratory stresses imposed on the basic C3 pathway. Details of the C4 pathway's earliest origins remain enigmatic given the paucity of the geologic record. Nonetheless, δ13C proxy records from paleosol carbonates, ungulate teeth, and plant-derived compounds indicate C4 plants likely represented an important component of plant biomass by the Early Miocene. Low CO2 levels appear to be a precondition for the development of the C4 photosynthetic pathway; however, comparisons of δ13C proxy records indicate that the timing Of C4 geographical expansion was not globally synchronous, and thus point toward more regional controls on the development of C4-dominated ecosystems. Terrestrial and marine records indicate that continental aridity and wind strength increased during the Late Miocene. These conditions would have likely increased fire occurrence and fire intensity leading to the clearing of large tree stands and the expansion of C4 grasses in warm-season precipitation regimes.

The project Saharan Mineral dust experiment (SAMUM) aims at investigating the properties of Saharan dust. Within this framework, a new regional model system was developed for simulations of the Saharan dust cycle and radiative effects. The model performance is tested for two Saharan dust outbreaks directed to Europe in August and October 2001. The importance of dispersion modelling in low wind conditions lies in the fact that such conditions occur frequently and are crucial for air pollution episodes. The classical approach based on conventional models, such as Gaussian plume or the K-theory with suitable assumptions, are known to work reasonably well during most meteorological regimes, except for weak wind conditions. A steady-state mathematical model for dispersion of contaminants in low wind conditions that takes into account the along-wind diffusion is proposed. The solution of the advection-diffusion equation for these conditions is obtained applying the Laplace transform, considering the planetary boundary layer (PBL) as a multilayer system. The eddy diffusivities used in the K-diffusion model were derived from the local similarity and Taylor's diffusion theory. The eddy diffusivities are functions of distance from the source and correctly represent the near-source diffusion in weak winds. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Most states and territories in Australia require these heaters to be compliant with the Australian/New Zealand Standards AS/NZS 4012 and 4013. These standards specify a test method for determining particle emissions and a maximum allowable particle emissions limit. The test is conducted under carefully controlled conditions that prescribe fuel weight, fuel type, fuel loading geometry and length of burn cycles. The method was based on the premise that, with proper instruction, householders would operate woodheaters in accordance with sound operating principles. However, the test does not account for a range of variables associated with in-service operation, such as the premature turn-down of primary air controls and overnight smouldering, with recent studies suggesting that the standard test does not fully reflect in-service performance, particularly for low-emission woodheaters. The joint Australia/New Zealand Standards committee (CS-062) dealing with woodheaters recognised the need for the Standards to better reflect the in-service performance of woodheaters and to drive further reductions in in-service emissions. To this end, CS-062 established a subcommittee, with representation from governments, the woodheater industry and the scientific community, to develop improved woodheater standards that will address current deficiencies. This paper presents the progress to date of the sub-committee and presents a working model of how governments, industry and the scientific community can work together to achieve environmental goals.","Emission factors; Particles; Standards; Woodheaters","Air pollution; Environmental protection; Heating equipment; Particulate emissions; Fuel loading; In-service operation; Particle emissions; Smouldering; Standards",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44349174288

An earlier study from IFP has shown that CNG has a considerable potential when used as a fuel for a dedicated downsized turbo-charged SI engine on a small urban vehicle. To take further advantage of CNG assets, this approach can be profitably extended by adding a small secondary (electrical) power source to the CNG engine, thus hybridizing the powertrain. This is precisely the focus of the new IFP project, VEHGAN, which aims to develop a mild-hybrid CNG prototype vehicle based on a MCC smart car equipped with a reversible starter-alternator and ultra-capacitors (Valeo Starter Alternator Reversible System, StARS). The unfolding of this project has involved and will involve several interesting and challenging issues from an engine control point of view, such as mastering the automatic manual transmission (AMT) control system and integrating a new power source, with its new functions, into the torque-oriented engine control structure.

This approach has reflected a belief that travel and land use strategies, the key alternatives to fuel and technology approaches, would be largely ineffective because of an intractable desire for ever increasing automobile use, particularly in the United States. With most transportation agencies facing the need to focus on aging infrastructure programs, the option of building more roads faster is not only unlikely but also impossible. The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) has recently faced the reality that the traditional approach of trying to widen existing roads or build new roads in response to congestion is not working. This is the case not only in New Jersey but also in other parts of the country. This chapter discusses a new approach adopted by NJDOT for dealing with congestion and reducing vehicle miles traveled (VMT).

Centennial St., Zeeland, MI 49464, United States","Key requirements for state of the art industrial gas engines are high engine thermal efficiency, high engine brake mean effective pressure (BMEP), low NOx emissions, and acceptable spark plug life. Fundamentally, as engine thermal efficiency and power density increase, along with the requirement of reduced NOx emissions, the pressure at the time of ignition increases. This results in a higher spark breakdown voltage that negatively affects spark plug life. This problem is resolved with a smaller electrode gap and high spark energy to overcome quenching effects during ignition kernel development. High flow fields in the spark gap region are required to assure the spreading of the discharge, which reduces the rate of electrode erosion. In addition, these high flow fields overcome mixture inhomogeneities by developing large ignition kernels. These large ignition kernels, inside the prechamber spark plug, produce high velocity flame jets into the main chamber enhancing combustion, which results in thermal efficiency gains at lower NOx levels and higher BMEP. The advanced combustion system solution discussed in this paper is the combination of high-energy ignition and a prechamber spark plug with flow fields at the electrode gap. Future developments include improved ion signal quality detonation detection resulting in additional gains in thermal efficiency.

Based at least in part on this increased attention, the Ohio EPA issued a Major Source Permit to Install (PTI) that contained a first-ever mercury emission limit for a coking operation in the United States in June 2004. This nonrecovery coking mercury emission limit was equivalent to 95% control based on USEPA research on mercury removal by spray dryer absorbers (SDA) and high-efficiency fabric filter baghouses operated at coal-fired utility boilers. This paper discusses the technical and air emission differences between non-recovery coking operations and coal-fired boilers that indicate mercury emission control from SDA and fabric filter systems at these operations would be expected to vary significantly. Following this discussion, an analysis will be presented of the results of mercury emission testing conducted at two operating non-recovery coking operations in 2006. This analysis indicates that waste gas mercury removal efficiencies associated with SDA and fabric filter baghouse emission controls at non-recovery coke operations may range from 16% to 30%. These emission test results also indicate that traditional mercury-specific controls such as activated carbon injection may not be as effective in mercury removal at non-recovery coking operations as previously expected.

In Asia, this market is still in an embryonic state (but should result as gigantic), while tomorrow the USA could become 'The Market'. Diesel technology is an important issue for the carmakers, because it emits noticeably less 'Greenhouse gas' than its gasoline counterpart. Compliance with the EuroIII standards (2000) forced the fitting of Diesel oxidation catalysts (DOC) in the exhaust line [for the after-treatment of unburnt hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO)]. Additionally, the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) was adapted to reduce the engine-out emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx). Under the EuroIV regulation (2005), the Diesel Particle Filter (DPF) emerged and is necessary for the 'heavily loaded' applications. Renault plans to make a CSF offer for all the diesel product range. This system enables to treat nearly 100% of the particle matter (PM, soot). When loaded, the DPF requires a regeneration phase to burn the accumulated soot. This regeneration is mandatory to keep not only the engine performance and reliability, but also the DPF reliability itself. The main drawbacks of this regeneration are the dilution of 'post injected' fuel in engine lubricant, leading to reducing the lubricant draining interval; the fuel over-consumption and the risk of forced vehicle immobilizations (for example, filter clogging under city driving conditions). The actual issues of EuroV standards aim at optimizing engine's design to decrease the engine-out NOx emissions in order to avoid the need for 'expensive' after-treatments in the exhaust line. Only some 'heavily loaded' applications would need such NOx after-treatment. Today, two major technological ways of NOx treatment are identified: the NOx Trap and the selective catalytic reduction with ammonia (SCR-NH3). After an adsorption period (during which the system traps the NOx), the NOx Trap requires a regeneration phase (in fact a rich incursion with HC and CO injections) enabling the reduction of accumulated NOx. As for the DPF, the engine combustion strategies carried on imply an increase of fuel diluted in engine lubricant, but also supplementary unburnt HC emissions, which could jeopardize the compliance with EuroV standards. This after-treatment system is also poisoned by sulfur (present in fuel and in engine lubricant) and must be recurrently desulfated (these desulfations are more severe than regenerations, rising concerns about the engine reliability, the fuel over-consumption and the emitted HC). In spite of these efforts, a part of sulfur adsorption on the NOx Trap active sites (normally dedicated to NOx storage) becomes irreversible and a slow process of system degeneration has to be addressed. The SCR-NH3 is a continuous process for NOx treatment and shows very efficient treatment efficiency. But this technology needs to put in the vehicle an additional tank for the urea storage. Moreover, this technology is constrained from an architectural point of view because two DOCs are necessary before and after the DeNOx catalyst to hydrolyze urea and form ammonia and to prevent the NH3 release in the exhaust line. In the challenge for preservation of the Environment, the European carmakers favor Diesel, which must comply with the most stringent standards constraints. The real key point for the future is, on the one hand, the improvement of DPF regeneration phase and on the other hand, but as first priority, the development of alternative NOx after-treatment technologies reliable on a long period. End of Abstract Nowadays, the Diesel vehicles market in Western Europe keeps growing. Diesel technology is of interest for car manufacturers because the 'Greenhouse gas' emissions are noticeably lower with Diesel than with gasoline (do not forget the ACEA1 commitment for 2008: 140g/km of C02 for the new cars sold in European Union). A major issue for the Diesel vehicles is to clean-up HC, CO, NOx and soot particles released by the engine at a minimum cost. The evolution of Diesel standards will be discussed and the constraints and limits of Diesel after-treatment systems put in series or in development will be clarified (in particular, those dealing with NOx conversion and soot particles removal). © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

It will reinforce Charlotte's existing water main system by allowing larger volumes of water into the system and allow the city to serve the rapidly growing southwest areas of Mecklenburg County.

The superb spectroscopic performance of XIS on-board Suzaku brought a tight constraint of the spectrum of the Arches X-rays. We found that the spectrum consists of a thermal plasma, a hard power-law tail, and two Gaussian components. The plasma component with a temperature of ∼2.2 keV is established from highly ionized Ca XIX and Fe XXV Ka emission lines as well as the lack of Fe XXVI Ka line. The two Gaussian lines represent the KQ and Kβ lines from iron at lower ionization stages at ∼6.4 keV and ∼7.1 keV. Both the line centers and the intensity ratio of these two lines are consistent with the neutral iron. The hard power-law tail with a photon index of ∼0.7 was found to have no pronounced iron K edge feature. In comparison with ACIS spectra constructed separately for point-like and diffuse emission by using the unprecedented spatial capability of Chandra, we conclude that the thermal component is from the ensemble of point-like sources plus thermal diffuse emission concentrated at the cluster center, while the Gaussian and the hard tail components are from the non-thermal diffuse emission extended in a larger scale. In the band-limited images of the XIS field, the distribution of the 7.510.0 keV emission resembles that of the 6.4 keV emission, including the local excess at the Arches cluster. This strongly suggests that the power-law emission is related to the 6.4 and 7.1 keV lines in the underlying physics. The full discussion can be found in Tsujimoto et al. [M. Tsujimoto, Y. Hyodo and K. Koyama, Publ. Astron. Soc. Jpn. 59 (2007), S229]. For point-like X-ray emission, three Arches sources are exceptionally bright among cluster members. The brightest spectrum of them requires two temperature plasma with an extinction of 2×1023 cm-2. The estimated hard-band luminosity of ≈1035 erg s-1, which is brighter than any known stellar sources in our Galaxy, might be a consequence of colliding wind shocks with an extreme mass loss rate (∼10-4 M⊙ yr-1) indicated from near-infrared and radio continuum observations.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41149117603

The hard power-law tail with a photon index of ∼ 0.7 was found to have no pronounced iron K edge feature. Compared with the published Chandra spectra constructed separately for point-like and diffuse emission, we conclude that the thermal component is from an ensemble of point-like sources plus thermal diffuse emission concentrated at the cluster center, while the Gaussian and the hard tail components are from non-thermal diffuse emission extended in a larger scale. In band-limited images of the XIS field, the distribution of the 7.5-10.0 keV emission resembles that of the 6.4 keV emission, including local excess at the Arches cluster. This strongly suggests that the power-law emission is related to the 6.4 and 7.1 keV lines in the underlying physics. We discuss two ideas to explain both the hard continuum and the lines: (1) X-ray photoionization that produces fluorescence lines and the Thomson scattering continuum and (2) non-thermal electron impact ionization of iron atoms and bremsstrahlung continuum. However, whichever scenario is adopted, the photon or particle flux from the Arches cluster is too low to account for the observed lines and continuum intensity. © 2007.

The garage reportedly exhibited numerous signs of deterioration, such as excessive deflections of the decks at bay midspans, extensive concrete cracking, concrete spalling, etc. The results of the structural analyses indicated that several negative-moment slab regions were deficient to support the design loads. The amount of overstressing was up to 50% in some areas. The structural analysis considered as-built conditions and showed that deficiencies were predominantly due to misplacement of the negative-moment steel reinforcement.

The soundness of the concept of gas-gas displacement for enhancing gas recovery was investigated via laboratory investigations, compositional modeling and economic analyses. Paramount Resources is field testing the concept in their GRIPE Project in the Athabasca region of Alberta, to enhance production from a gas bearing stratum overlying the oil sand interval. This paper is a part of a series of papers presenting results of EGR research conducted over a four year period (2003-2006). The main targets were volumetric (closed) reservoirs, in advanced phases of exploitation. Results of basic research on methane displaced from core samples by pure gases (pure CO2 or pure N2), as well as flue gases (mixtures of CO2 and N2) and a CO2/SO2 mixture, are presented. A series of 13 gas/gas displacement tests in 30cm-long, 4cm diameter, Berea cores were conducted at a temperature of 700C and a pressure of 6,200 kPa. Most of the tests were conducted in the presence of connate water, while others were conducted without connate water (dry cores) to confirm and bench mark the results by other investigators. The tests on consolidated cores showed that for pure nitrogen and pure CO2, used as the displacing medium, the recovery was comparable. In case a mixture of CO2 and nitrogen displaced the natural gas, it was observed that there was a delay in CO2 breakthrough, associated with a period when only a mixture of methane and nitrogen was produced. This is so because solubility of CO2 in connate water is considerably higher than that of nitrogen. This directly leads to a higher gas recovery due to a longer exploitation period, given the fact that up to 20% nitrogen can be tolerated in the produced stream, as opposed to only 1% for CO2 case. For this period of methane and nitrogen production, there are no operational problems associated with the corrosive nature of CO2. EGR by gas-gas displacement is seen as a promising way of prolonging the productive life and economic recovery of many depleting volumetric gas reservoirs. © 2007 Petroleum Society of Canada.",,"Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Gasoline; Methane; Mixtures; Natural gas; Nitrogen; Oil bearing formations; Oil sands; Petroleum reservoirs; Recovery; Athabasca regions; Compositional modeling; Economic recovery; Enhanced gas recoveries; Gas displacement; Laboratory investigations; Natural gas reservoir; Operational problems; Gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085851071

The recent boom in ethanol investment and production can be considered as an unintended consequence of an ethanol subsidy keyed to $20 crude oil and fixed at 51 cents per gallon combined with oil surging to $70/bbl. Thus, in the 2005-07 period, ethanol was extremely profitable inducing substantial new investment. For the future, different political action groups and political figures propose renewable fuels targets or standards ranging from 35 to 100 billion gallons per year. To achieve anything like these levels, it is likely that the current policy set will need to be reconsidered. In addition to the current policy, this paper considers using a subsidy tied to the energy security gains and greenhouse gas emission reductions provided by renewable fuels, subsidies targeted specifically at cellulose ethanol, and different versions of a renewable fuel standard such as the one passed by the US Senate. It is clear that we must develop a better understanding of the consequences of these alternative policy pathways. Copyright © 2007 The Berkeley Electronic Press.

In addition, many of the plant taxa reported from the early Cainozoic of Arctic areas cannot currently be placed within extant taxa below the rank of families. This makes it difficult to estimate various aspects of palaeoclimate using quantitative approaches. In the present paper four different quantitative palaeobotanical methods are used to estimate palaeoclimate parameters for three floras from the early Palaeocene and the middle Eocene-early Oligocene of Spitsbergen. The methods used are: 1) the Coexistence Approach based on the nearest living relative (NLR) method, 2) leaf margin analysis, 3) the multivariate Climate-Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP) based on leaf physiognomy of modern vegetation mainly from North America and East Asia, and, 4) a recently developed mulitvariate leaf-physiognomical approach based on modern European vegetation. Because most NLRs could only be determined with a low taxonomic resolution the Coexistence Approach estimated rather wide ranges for temperature and precipitation for most of the floras investigated. Leaf margin analysis for the Lower Paleocene Firkanten Formation produced an estimate for mean annual temperature (MAT), which is in agreement with other proxies and previous interpretations, but estimates for both Eocene formations appear to be too low. CLAMP produced temperature estimates that are in fairly good agreement with previous palaeoclimatic interpretations for the Palaeogene of the Arctic, as well as most CA estimates. Although estimates for the length of the growing season (GSL) are more or less in accordance with what can be expected for polar regions, estimates for growing season precipitation (GSP) may be slightly too low, especially for the Eocene - Oligocene floras. The European leaf physiognomic approach (ELPA) produced temperature estimates that are consistently lower than all other methods, as well as independent proxies. Accordingly, GSL estimates are rather low and GSP estimates are even lower than those obtained with CLAMP. All methods point to a cooling trend from the Paleocene to the middle/late Eocene - early Oligocene. Such a cooling trend is in agreement with independent data on global and regional climate development during the Palaeogene. In general, leaf physiognomic methods may be taphonomically biased towards specific leaf types and several authors have argued against the use of leaf physiognomic methods calibrated with data from modern vegetation, which cannot be considered a potential analogue for polar forests from the Palaeogene of the Arctic. Nevertheless, our results indicate that only CLAMP, and with some restrictions also CA, seem to be able to produce quantitative estimates for selected palaeoclimate parameters for the Palaeogene of Spitsbergen.","Arctic; Coexistence Approach; Leaf physiognomy; Palaeoclimate; Palaeogene; Spitsbergen","arctic environment; coexistence; estimation method; flora; fossil; leaf; multivariate analysis; Oligocene; paleobotany; Paleocene; paleoclimate; paleotemperature; proxy climate record; quantitative analysis; regional climate; Arctic; Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38049055245

Both technologies have been developed simultaneously and are used widely in Europe. In the United States, however, WTE is used principally for the generation of electricity. The advantages of district heating using WTE plants are: overall fuel conservation, by increasing the thermal efficiency of WTE, and overall reduction of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere. The purpose of this study was to examine the current situation of district heating in the U.S. and determine the potential for applying DH to existing WTE plants. A preliminary evaluation was conducted of DH application at two WTE facilities in Connecticut: the Wheelabrator Bridgeport and the Covanta Preston facilities. Using a Canadian methodology, the minimal distribution heating network costs for Bridgeport were estimated at about $24 million dollars for providing heat to a surrounding area of one square mile and the DH revenues at $6.8 million.

The main part is dedicated to compare the cities index values using different time scales (hourly, daily or annual) and for two types of exposure thanks to a background and a traffic index. In addition, space is offered to cities for presenting themselves according to a common template, providing background information on their specific air pollution situation and associated reduction measures. Participating is easy: cities upload their data through ftp and the indices calculations are automatically made. The Website provides a dynamic picture of the air quality and is updated each hour enticing viewers to make repeated visits. However, participation with only a daily update or with yearly data is feasible as well. The indices and the Website do not aim to replace more targeted local information. Their value added is to provide, for the first time, a European and comparable picture of the air quality in near real-time easily accessible through a common platform and presentation of the results.","Air quality index; European platform; Public information; Website",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77956978724

Sandwiching a La2Û3 capping layer between the gate and the dielectric leads to a work function reduction These work function shifts are interpreted on the basis of the electronic density distribution at the interfacial region. © The Electrochemical Society.",,"Calculations; Carbon; Electronic properties; Hafnium oxides; High-k dielectric; Logic gates; Tantalum; Tantalum compounds; Work function; Capping layer; Dielectric capping layers; Effective work function; Electronic density distribution; First-principles calculation; Function values; Interfacial region; Processing condition; Dielectric materials",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45249108211

In this study, we review issues related to the use of terrestrial forestry activities to create CO2 offset credits. To gain a deeper understanding of the confusing empirical studies of forest projects to create carbon credits under Kyoto, we employ meta-regression analysis to analyze conditions under which forest activities generate CO2-emission reduction offsets at competitive ""prices."" In particular, we examine 68 studies of the costs of creating carbon offsets using forestry. Baseline estimates of costs of sequestering carbon are some US$3-$280 per tCO2, indicating that the costs of creating CO2-emission offset credits through forestry activities vary wildly. Intensive plantations in the tropics could potentially yield positive benefits to society, but in Europe similar projects could cost as much as $195/tCO2. Indeed, Europe is the highest cost region, with costs in the range of $50-$280 per tCO2. This might explain why Europe has generally opposed biological sinks as a substitute for emissions reductions, while countries rush to finance forestry sector clean development mechanism projects. In Canada and the U.S., carbon sequestration costs range from a low of about $2 to nearly $80 per tCO2. One conclusion is obvious: some forestry projects to sequester carbon are worthwhile undertaking, but certainly not all. © 2007 G.

The process of changing the interrelated public and private services, systems and infrastructures is becoming more and more complicated and less predictable. Together with the increased scaling, the convergence of utilities and the growing number of parties and techniques involved, the end users (consumers) subjective dependence (heteronomy) has increased. This asks for a simplification of the processes, products (or rather, services). A larger concentration on integral provision of services, or, in other words, the supply and management of integral packages, offers possibilities. This seems to be reinforced by the ongoing liberalization processes. This paper will focus on an innovative concept of integrated decentralised technologies for wastewater and organic waste treatment with energy and nutrients recovery. The concept is called Sustainable Implant (SI). Principally, the concept is based on a small-scale biogas installation (with treatment of blackwater and organic waste), Combined Heat Power (CHP) and accompanying closed glasshouse with hanging gardens. These hanging gardens are situated in a non-ventilated space with heat (and water) recovery, heat/cold storage (in an underlying aquifer) and with injection of the surplus CO2 of the biogas plant. The SI will be realized as a part of this semi-public building and has an interconnecting role between both district and building, inhabitants and visitors. The system layout and the dimensioning backgrounds are explained in this paper. Additional emphasis is put on maintenance, conservation and administration of the integrated whole, and the possible consequences for the district and its inhabitants.","Anaerobic waste treatment; Decentralisation; Local reuse","biogas; combined heat and power; convergence; decentralization; liberalization; recovery; recycling; service provision; waste treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849185252

This paper focuses on the integration of a 'combined waste (wastewater)/energy system' for an urban neighbourhood (the deep green district 'EVA Lanxmeer' in Culemborg, the Netherlands) integrated in a semi-public building: the 'EVA Centre'. The district consists of 250 houses (partially under construction), offices and a 'City farm'. The district is situ- ated in an ecologically sensitive area, because it concerns a drinking water extraction and retention area. Essential is the integrated approach, closing cycles of nutrients, water and carbon and integrating energy generation and waste manage- ment through cascading qualities and use of the concept of exergy. An innovative mixture of 'red and green' development is presented (urban agriculture). The design of the district and the EVA Centre is mainly based on permaculture and or- ganic design principles. Principally, the concept of combined decentralized systems is based on anaerobic digestion (with treatment of 'black waste water' and organic waste/garden &amp; park waste), Combined Heat Power (CHP). An accompanying closed green- house, designed as a four storey high double skin façade of the semi-public building, with integrated wastewater treat- ment for parts of the wastewater flows based on the Living Machine concept is added for educational purposes. In this vertical green house with 'hanging gardens' heat (and water) recovery and use of the surplus CO2 of the biogas plant takes place, together with heat/cold storage in an underlying aquifer. The concept is called 'Sustainable Implant' (or in short: S.I.). The S.I. will be realized as a part of the EVA Centre and has an interconnecting role between both residential district and EVA Centre, inhabitants and visitors. Especially the social context concerning the people living in this urban neighborhood, the role of the S.I. and the City- farm(er) will be explained.

In our research we focused at an extreme situation and utilized human's own ultra-weak light for radiation. Human photon emission was studied after dark-adaptation utilizing a sensitive, cooled, moveable photomultiplier system. Data showed that palm and dorsum of the hands showed most emission. Human light was reflected by a red color filter in close proximity but not touching the body of the dark-adapted subject. Photon emission from the palm was recorded before and after the filter was placed at 3 cm from the skin between the palm and the photomultiplier. After removing the filter the photomultiplier recorded increased emission compared to emission prior to exposure. The effect faded away in 7 min. To study whether this effect is only local, photon emission of the hand dorsum was recorded and the filter was placed 3 cm below the palm. Such exposure also resulted in increased emission that faded away. In this protocol, photon emission of the dorsum was also recorded during the period that the palm was exposed to the filter. Photon emission increased immediately after positioning the filter. As a first step to an explanation we discuss recent studies on the optical properties of human photon emission. The photon signal has non-classical features and is well described by the photon signal in a coherent state. It is hypothesized that the human photon field carries information on the chemical reactions in the physiologic state.","Color filter; Human body; Photon counting; Spatial emission pattern; Ultra-weak photon emission","Light emission; Optical properties; Photomultipliers; Photons; Physiology; Skin; Color filters; Human body; Photon counting; Photon emission; Spatial emission pattern; Ultra-weak photon emission; Light",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548258409

A joint approach would be advisable, not only on the content side, as the presented concepts differently fulfil the requirements of regional planning, but also on the organisational side, in terms of coordinating efforts and allocating personnel, time and financial resources. However, all four concepts seem to lack two aspects: First, a project must meet the needs of the residents and fit their regional and personal identities in order to get them involved, and second, most development projects need clear monitoring structures.

Most frequent in the evening and early morning hours, these, typically cyclonic, eddies are often responsible for fog in the Santa Cruz California area.

To make the human space colonisation a fundamental step is represented by enabling technologies to exploit local resource, limiting a periodical refurbishment from Earth. Here a possible technological demonstrator mission is deeply analyzing taking care of any possible technological and design trade-offs. Firstly the selection of the material to be treated is presented, based on the analysis of the available resources on our satellite. As a second step the different methods of extraction are compared and the process of oxygen manufacturing is proposed as the most important element to both support life and supplying fuel for propulsion applications. Oxygen manufacture can be obtained thanks to different processes such as the hydrogen reduction of ilmenite, molten silicates electrolysis, pyrolisis and carbothermal reduction of anorthite. The last has been selected for the presented design as it offers the best compromise in terms of feasibility and innovation. The Malapert Mountain turned out to be the zone with the best-suited superficial soil composition to collect the anorthite, having a smooth morphology, quite good light exposition too. The requirements the ISRU technological demonstrator has been design include the production of 3-5 kg oxygen within 6 months. Moreover, the exploitation of a European launcher such the Ariane 5 is has been posted. As a consequence, strong limitations on launcheable mass and ISRU dimensions must have been taken into account while sizing. Five modules - each of which has been preliminarily designed - compose the overall plant. To better understand and analyze the feasibility and the process effectiveness the dynamic model of the entire plant has been implemented. The dynamic modelling of the ISRU demonstrator helped in refining the preliminary design of the modules and to simulate different operational mode of the plant itself. The ISRU architecture includes the following modules: 1. a Beneficiation modulus, whose aim is the selection of fine particles of anorthite from other species in order to satisfy reactor requirements; 2. a Reactor, the core of the system, i.e. the chamber where the reaction of reduction with methane takes place and monoxide and hydrogen are produced; 3. a Reverse Steam Reforming chamber, where water and methane are obtained from monoxide an hydrogen, coming from reactor and tanks where a surplus of hydrogen is stowed; 4. a Water Electrolysis modulus, where oxygen and water are produced from water; 5. a Power Generation system, which provides required power to every unit thanks to solar panels and fuel cells. A previous research and study in the field of analogous applications on Earth and Moon was followed by a thorough analysis to define the best configuration, in terms of dimensions and dynamic respond, which fitted in with mission requirements. Dynamic simulation needed the identification of mathematical model, capable of describing behaviours of every system. Thanks to this operation a numerical model was built in Matlab/Simulink environment. A parametrical analysis was conducted: this allowed to define running performances of every system and to describe different situations, such as non-optimal or critical working conditions. This part of the study involved an important contribution to dimensional statements and it could be a starting-point to improve reliability. The result of the dynamic analysis was the creation of a dynamic model library which represents and describes every single modulus of the unit, whose elements can be interfaced to simulate the behaviour of the entire unit. This kind of approach to the problem allowed us to create completely parametrical elements of the library, applicable to bigger-size systems, flexible because they can be interfaced in many ways to solve different configurations, and integrable with external components.",,"Carbothermal reduction; Concentration (process); Design; Dynamic analysis; Electric batteries; Electrochemistry; Electrolysis; Fuel cells; Hydrogen; Methane; Modal analysis; Moon; Nonmetals; Oxide minerals; Oxygen; Reaction kinetics; Silicate minerals; Silicates; Solar energy; Solar system; Steam engineering; Water resources; Water tanks; Ariane 5; Design trades; Different processes; Dynamic simulations; Enabling technologies; Europeans; External components; Fine particles; Generation systems; Hydrogen reductions; In-situ; Manufacturing is; MATLAB/Simulink; Mission requirements; Numerical models; Operational modes; Parametrical analysis; Preliminary designs; Process effectivenesses; Propulsion applications; Soil compositions; Solar panels; Steam reforming; Water electrolyses; Working conditions; Dynamic models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55649103002

H9R 1G6, Canada","Many neurodegenerative diseases are related to an abnormal expansion of the CAG trinucleotide that produces polyglutamine segments in several proteins. However, the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative states is not yet well understood. Thus, to evaluate the molecular mechanisms leading to those diseases, suitable research tools such as synthetic polyglutamine peptides are required. The synthesis and purification of such peptides are usually difficult because of poor solubility, which leads to low coupling and/or deblocking reactivity. After exploring many synthesis, solubilization and purification approaches, a protocol allowing the production of polyglutamines in good yield and high purity was developed. With this protocol, peptides of 10-30 glutamine residues were synthesized using a linear solid-phase strategy combined with a maximal side-chain protection scheme using fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry. After cleavage of the peptide from the polymeric support, the crude material was treated with glacial acetic acid and lyophilized. This treatment significantly improved the solubility of the polyglutamine peptides thus allowing their dissolution in aqueous conditions and purification through reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. These solubilization and purification conditions led to the formation of N-pyroglutamyl peptide derivatives that were easily isolated. These N-pyroglutamylated compounds also appear as useful research tools because data from the literature suggest that N-terminal modification of polyglutamine segments might play a role in their pathogenic properties. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Aggregation; HPLC; Neurodegeneration; Peptide; Polyglutamine; Purification; Pyroglutamyl; Solid-phase synthesis; Solubilization","Agglomeration; Amines; Molecular structure; Neurology; Purification; Neurodegeneration; Polyglutamine; Pyroglutamyl; Solid-phase synthesis; Solubilization; Peptides; acetic acid; carbonyl derivative; fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl; n pyroglutamyl peptide; peptide derivative; polyglutamine; unclassified drug; amino acid synthesis; article; chemical modification; freeze drying; molecular mechanics; peptide synthesis; protein degradation; protein purification; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; solid phase synthesis; solubilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-35048883487

And although many scientific uncertainties remain as to the extent and nature of climatic changes over time, ""there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change"". As a result, many energy, economic, and environmental policy changes are happening. In the U.S., almost half of the states have now adopted the ""Renewable Portfolio Standard"" (RPS). In a short amount of time, the RPS has diffused as the de facto U.S. public policy to reduce carbon emissions from power generation, which is the source of 40% of U.S. CO2 emissions. A RPS is an energy policy that requires retail sellers of electricity in a state to procure a percentage of electricity from renewable sources. The RPS is one of several market-based approaches that have emerged as primary policies to reduce CO2 emissions. The other two market centered policies are ""Cap and Trade"" and ""Carbon Fees."" Due to the proliferation of the RPS, and a preference for market-based solutions to reduce CO2 emissions, it is now very likely that a national RPS will be passed by Congress. A very limited amount of research has appeared on the policy process and distribution of, and the rationalization for, the RPS. Why do some states choose to adopt a RPS and others increases renewable energy resources in an efficient way not? Indeed a better understanding is needed of the state RPS, as a national RPS is debated and likely adopted. This research examines the fast-paced diffusion of the RPS as a policy innovation, with a general hypothesis that the primary rationale for the RPS is state economic gain. This original research uses multivariate logit analysis and in-depth case studies to examine the reasons for, and the diffusion and the adoption process off, the state RPS. The theoretical basis for this paper is a general theory of countervailing interest group pluralism explaining the RPS policy ""push"", with a complement of policy ""pull"" from a rational process policy makers use to promote the RPS for state economic gain (self-interested actors, competition, and a relatively open market) - diffusion of policy innovation being the means.",,"Adoption process; Anthropogenic climate changes; Cap and trade; Carbon emissions; Climatic changes; CO2 emissions; Economic gains; Environmental issues; Environmental policy; General theory; Market-based approach; Open market; Policy makers; Policy process; Portfolio standards; Renewable portfolio standard; Renewable sources; Scientific uncertainty; Theoretical basis; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Commerce; Diffusion; Electric power generation; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Group theory; Marketing; Multivariant analysis; Renewable energy resources; Research; Sustainable development; Environmental protection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867841153

As a large river in a semiarid region, the Rio Grande experiences large variability in flows and solute concentrations due to riparian evapotranspiration, aquifer recharge, and upstream contributions. In order to characterize biogeochemical processes in this setting, surface water and groundwater from the shallow alluvial aquifer between the river and a parallel drain ditch were sampled from 1 to 13 m depth, including high-resolution multilevel sampling near the fluctuating water table, at a representative site on the middle Rio Grande. The zone of intermittent saturation is a region, ~50cm in vertical extent at this site, in which the water table shifts in response to changes in river level and riparian evapotranspiration. Sediment extractions of iron and manganese oxides indicate that these solids are more prevalent in the zone of intermittent saturation, where oxic-anoxic cycling occurs. River water chemistry varies with time, strongly influencing influent waters to the alluvial aquifer. This chemistry evolves significantly in the ~100 m from the river to four wells. River concentrations of dissolved oxygen (mean 6.9mg L-1) and nitrate (mean 2.8mg L-1) are reduced to near zero in the shallower wells (1-3 m depth), but are less reduced from the river in the deeper wells (5-13 m depth). Mn and Fe increase from near zero in the river to maximum concentrations from 1 to 3 m depth (mean 1.0mg L-1 and 2.1mg L-1, respectively), with lesser increases at 5 and 13 m depth. Sulfate concentration decreases relative to chloride in many samples, especially from 1 to 3 m depth, most likely due to sulfate reduction. Overall, patterns in water and sediment chemistry indicate that waters in the region of the shifting water table are more evolved from the river via terminal electron-accepting processes than deeper waters, including aerobic respiration, denitrification, manganese oxide reduction, iron oxide reduction, and sulfate reduction. This implies that a greater extent of organic carbon metabolism occurs at shallower depths. The influence of sulfate reduction on organic carbon oxidation is facilitated by sulfate concentrations of river water that varied from 31 to 83mg L-1 during the study. These results illustrate that sulfate reduction may constitute a significant portion of organic carbon metabolism in higher-sulfate shallow alluvial aquifers associated with freshwater rivers. Biogeochemical processes in the shallow alluvial aquifer depend on the river for solute inputs, and may in turn influence large-scale river chemistry. © 2007 Geological Society of America.","Alluvial aquifer; Biogeochemistry; Redox; Rio grande; Terminal electron-accepting process; Zone of intermittent saturation","alluvial plain; biogeochemistry; confined aquifer; denitrification; dissolved oxygen; evapotranspiration; field survey; groundwater flow; hydrogeochemistry; iron oxide; levee; organic carbon; recharge; redox conditions; riparian zone; river water; semiarid region; solute transport; water table; New Mexico; Rio Grande [North America]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60349121531

Today we recognize that resolution involves a perplexing set of policy issues, since the sources of pollution are often hundreds of miles away, and can only be accomplished through international cooperation, often at a global scale. Acid in the Environment: Lessons Learned and Future Prospects is a collection of essays that blends the research findings and the policy analyses of individuals from different academic disciplines with the positions advanced by representatives of NGOs. In Part I: Ecological Impacts of Acid Deposition, scientists emphasize the web of changes in complex ecosystems caused by sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Analyses of domestic and international policies to control the emission of pollutants that cause acid rain are discussed in Part II: Acid Emissions Energy and Policy. The authors of Part III: Sulfur Dioxide and the Market provide the reader with an economic perspective on the control of sulfur dioxide emissions. The volume concludes with Part IV: Lessons Learned and Future Prospects, which reveals the acid deposition problem has served as a testing ground for applying scientific insights to public policy, forging international agreements and creating economically effective mechanisms to solve environmental problems. The rapid progress in reducing sulfur dioxide emissions in both North America and Europe is promising, and provides a good model for regions in eastern Asia where these emissions are growing fast. Acid in the Environment: Lessons Learned and Future Prospects presents a broad approach to the study of acid deposition, exposing readers with a scientific background to significant policy issues and those with a policy orientation to important ecological impacts. The book raises important questions that will serve as a springboard for discussion between diverse groups of teachers and students, concerned citizens and legislators, and scientists and policy makers. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

In another words, generated energy is greater then spent energy. Even though this is considered as not possible with today's scientific knowledge, I have experimentally proved it on miniature prototype I've made and tested. The measurement on my miniature prototype shows that generated energy is greater than energy we have to spend in order to produce energy. This method may provide as much energy as we want at any point on Planet Earth. There will be no need to burn gas or any other material in order to produce energy, as it is today. All energy needs anywhere in the World will be provided using this method. Today we use gasoline or other material to burn in order to produce energy. Ultimately, using this method to generate energy pollution and other environmental problems will be significantly reduced or even eliminated. The biggest obstacle with this method is to convince other people to believe that my claim is feasible in practice. Even though, I've made and tested prototype to prove my claim, still resistance and disbelieve exist. Reason for disbelieve is that my method violates existing First Law of Thermodynamic and therefore is considered as not possible. The method is very simple, but in order to generate significant amount of energy Multiplier Device must be quite a massive. Size of the Device is in direct proportion with energy wanted to generate For example, Device should be about 30 feet high and 9 feet in diameter in order to produce about 5000 J/sec, which is to have power about 5kWatts. Yes, I've made much smaller Device to prove the feasibility of my method, by measurement and calculation. To make Energy Multiplier Device operational without any energy from outside, the size of the Device must be much greater. How the World will benefit from this project? First, this method of energy generation will allow to produce as much energy as we want at any point on Planet Earth, at least theoretically. Amount of energy produced using this method is in direct proportion with the dimensions. If we are able to make Device with unlimited height, the Device will be able to produce unlimited amount of energy. The method produces 100% clean energy, so the benefits will be: to eliminate burning any material to produce energy to eliminate CO2 generation, main reason for climate change (global wanning) to significantly reduce air pollution, if not eliminate to eliminate environmental problems To provide enough energy for unlimited use to provide energy independence for any entity, Country, State, Household, etc other benefits are up to your imaginations By the way, this project has been selected for oral presentation at World Renewable Energy Congress, Florence, Italy, 19-25 August 2006.

For diesel engines, reducing NOX emissions is a difficult technical challenge.[1],[2],[3],[4]. To respond to these strict regulations, an exhaust gas aftertreatment system was developed, featuring a lean NOX catalyst (LNC) that uses a new chemical reaction mechanism to reduce NO X. The feature of the new LNC is the way it reduces NOX through an NH3-selective catalytic reduction (SCR), in which NO X adsorbed in the lean mixture condition is converted to NH 3 in the rich mixture condition and reduced in the following lean mixture condition. Thus, the new system allows the effective reduction of NOX. However, in order to realize cleaner emission gases, precise engine control in response to the state of the exhaust aftertreatment system is essential. This control includes maintaining the LNC activation state and reducing NOX emissions before LNC activation. In this study, effective NOX reduction technology was developed by combining controls, such as that for maintaining LNC activation temperature, with studies of engine emission improvements and techniques to supply reductant to the catalyst.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) is the federal agency responsible for overseeing seaport dredging projects. With the increased demand for international commodities to be shipped to the United States, there is a need to increase the size of the container ships. These larger ships require increasing the depths of shipping channels and berthing areas in seaports. Recent seaport dredging projects have required the Corps to conduct general conformity analyses during the environmental impact assessment and permitting process. The Corps may demonstrate conformity for a project by showing that direct and indirect project emissions are already included in an EPA-approved state implementation plan (SIP). For projects not included in the SIP, a formal general conformity determination may be required if incremental project-related emissions of any applicable pollutant exceed de minimis levels, or if the project is considered ""regionally significant,"" where incremental project-related emissions of any applicable pollutant are greater than ten percent of the emissions inventory for the non-attainment or maintenance area for that pollutant. A formal determination is required to demonstrate how the proposed project conforms with the purposes of the SIP before the Corps can issue a dredging permit. The challenges of conducting a general conformity analysis include the absence of clear comprehensive guidance on the process; consideration of offsets, design features, or mitigation for emissions that exceed ""de minimis"" levels; the inclusion of harbor dredging and construction activities in SIPs; and identifying the boundaries of the study area for the purposes of estimating project emissions. This paper will summarize the policies and practices that comprise the general conformity process, discuss problems that may arise during a de minimis emissions threshold evaluation, and provide some insight into the process of incorporating project emissions into the SIP.",,"Air quality; Air quality standards; Construction industry; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Environmental Protection Agency; Marine engineering; Pollution; Ports and harbors; Ships; Ambient air quality standards; Construction activities; Container ships; Design features; Dredging projects; Emissions inventory; Shipping channels; State Implementation Plans; Waste management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649186265

The DMF reduces driveline oscillations by mechanically decoupling the crankshaft and the transmission. Existing engine control systems are general designed for use with conventional single mass flywheel (SMF) systems. In the future, to facilitate the optimal control of engines equipped with advanced DMF systems, these conventional control systems may require adaptation, modification or even replacement. In the past, misfire detection has been done by expensive dedicated sensors; seismic, ion current measurement at the spark plugs or even by measuring in-cylinder pressures directly. Typically misfire detection is performed using signals derived from the crankshaft position sensor, which works well for engines with a limited number of cylinders and which are connected to relatively simply drivelines. Torque reactions from the DMF or rest of the driveline can, in extreme circumstances, be misinterpreted as engine misfires, which never actually occurred. Therefore, in this paper, a novel method of misfire detection using the dynamically reconstructed continuous engine torque signal is introduced. Here, the engine torque is estimated by a state space model of the dual mass flywheel. By using the actual reconstructed instantaneous engine torque instead of the commonly used crankshaft acceleration signal, misfire events can be detected far more reliably. Furthermore, if reconstructed engine torque is used as a centrally computed signal for various other purposes (e.g. cylinder balancing control) in the engine management system then the misfire detection system can be easily implemented in the modern engine ECU. This is especially interesting for low to mid-cost vehicles, because it provides a professional solution without the need to install multiple additional sensors to fulfil the increasingly stringent exhaust gas emission laws of the future.

Using alternative combustion modes has become a promising approach to reduce engine emissions. However, due to very different in-cylinder conditions and fueling parameters for different combustion modes, control of engines operating multiple combustion modes is very challenging. It becomes difficult for conventional calibration /mapping based approaches to produce satisfactory results in terms of engine torque responses and emissions. Advanced control techniques are then demanded to accomplish the tasks. An innovative hybrid control system is designed to track different key engine operating variables at different combustion modes as well as avoid singularity which is inherent for turbocharged diesel engines running multiple combustion modes. A finite state machine based supervisory controller with a dedicated switching mechanism and two sliding mode controllers consist of the entire system. The performance of the control system is evaluated on a modern light-duty diesel engine. Compared with those of calibration-based approach, much improved performance, in terms of fast and smooth responses as well as significantly alleviated calibration efforts, were observed.

This paper examines four models and some recent experiences in using financial services at the community level. The paper offers an overview of advantages and limitations of each model to manage disaster risk in communities. Examples include a federal government initiated scheme of social protection funds, a local government risk reduction scheme, an insurance product provided by a non-governmental organization, and a micro-insurance scheme. Finally, the paper offers some directions about specific ways that the public and private sectors, in collaboration with other partners can improve finance alternatives for disaster management at the community level.

It follows previous research in a multi-cylinder engine where liquid phase was found to have advantages over gas phase at most operating conditions. Significant variations in cylinder to cylinder mixture distribution were found for both phases and leading to uncertainty in the findings. The uncertainty was avoided in this paper as in the engine used, a high speed Waukesha ASTM CFR, identical manifold conditions could be assured and MBT spark found for each fuel supply system over a wide range of mixtures. These were extended to lean burn conditions where gaseous fuelling in the multi-cylinder engine had been reported to be at least an equal performer to liquid phase. The experimental data confirm the power and efficiency advantages of liquid phase injection over gas phase injection and carburetion in multi-cylinder engine tests. Analysis shows the charge state at the end of compression is the major contributor to the performance difference. Secondary differences such as the mixture homogeneity also have an important influence. The lower temperature combustion with liquid phase LPG also delivers substantial NOx emission reduction. Suggestions are made for overcoming the deficiency of gaseous phase injection which may be preferred as its application avoids the high cost of the high pressure in-tank LPG pump needed for liquid phase injection.

The system is capable of reporting on the early detection and progression of faults by utilizing piezoelectric, optical, and acoustic frequency measurements for improved, incipient anomaly detection. These gas turbine engine vibration monitoring technologies will address existing operation and maintenance goals for current military system and prognostics health management algorithms for advanced engines. These system features will be integrated in a state-of-the-art vibration monitoring system that will not only identify faults more confidently and at an earlier stage, but also enable the prediction of the time-to-failure or a degraded condition worthy of maintenance action. The authors have made significant progress toward identifying, computing, and comparing the high frequency feature sets generated with various vibro-acoustic measurement techniques. Specifically, the technology has been demonstrated on two subscale test stands. The first is a generator test rig that was equipped with a laser vibrometer and two high-frequency accelerometers. Various mechanical and electrical faults were seeded, with an emphasis on generator bearing faults. Initial results show very good detection capability in frequency bands well above those used in traditional vibration analysis. Another focus, accessory gearbox systems, was addressed for feasibility through a gearbox test rig, which was instrumented with high bandwidth accelerometers and wideband and narrowband acoustic emissions (AE) sensors. Baseline, seeded fault, and fault progression tests were conducted, including tests with various levels of gear tooth corrosion. Successful detection of this fault was then demonstrated using a number of new, innovative approaches. A statistical analysis was also performed to compare the approaches, with narrowband acoustic emission and high frequency vibration features performing the best.

The short ignition delay of conventional diesel fuel requires high fuel injection pressures to achieve adequate premixing along with high levels of EGR (exhaust gas recirculation) to achieve low NOx emissions. Low load operating regions are typified by substantial emissions of CO and HC and there exists an upper operating load limitation due to very high rates of in-cylinder gas pressure rise. In this study mixtures of gasoline and diesel fuel were investigated using a multi-cylinder light duty diesel engine. It was found that an increased proportion of gasoline fuel reduced smoke emissions at higher operating loads through an increase in charge premixing resulting from an increase in ignition delay and higher fuel volatility. The results of this investigation confirm that a combination of fuel properties, exhibiting higher volatility and increased ignition delay, would enable a widening of the low emission operating regime, but that consideration must be given to combustion stability at low operating loads.

At the same time, and with strong links to growth and competitiveness but also to environmental protection, the Union is in the throws of an intense debate on future energy policy and climate change. Part of the research budget, some would say too small a part, is earmarked for energy - in particular the technological aspects of low carbon systems such renewables. This effort, together with measures to improve the EU's security and independence of supply, are essential if Europe is to respond effectively to solve the future energy conundrum. But where does nuclear fit in all this? What will the Union be doing in the area of nuclear research? Indeed, does nuclear figure at all in the long-term plans of the Union? Through the Euratom part of the Framework Programme, the EU is maintaining important support to up-stream research in the area of advanced reactor technologies. This effort is being coordinated at the global level through Euratom's membership of the Generation-IV International Forum. Though EU research in this field still has its critics among the Member States, and despite the relatively small sums currently committed, the leverage effect of current actions is significant and this is set to grow in the future. The imminent setting up of a Strategic Energy Technology Plan, as part of the European Commission's on-going activities in the field of energy policy, and the feedback from independent experts in the Advisory Group on Energy and the Euratom Scientific and Technical Committee all point to the following conclusions: EU support for research on advanced nuclear fission technology is justified as part of a broad portfolio approach to R&amp;D on new energy systems and carriers, this technology is extremely promising as part of the answer to our long-term energy problems, and the current level of R&amp;D support is insufficient in view of the challenges faced.",,"Advanced reactors; Current levels; Energy problem; Energy systems; Energy technologies; European Commission; European research; Global levels; Leverage effects; Long-term plans; Low carbon; Nuclear research; Public funds; Renewables; Research budget; Research programmes; Strong link; Sustainable energy systems; Technical committees; Technological aspects; Turning points; Climate change; Competition; Energy policy; Nuclear energy; Technology; Research",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959508434

Plug-in FCHB provides additional benefits to reduce both the costs of vehicle and operation by downsizing fuel cell and hydrogen storage components, and utilizing grid energy for driving. There could be types of power train configurations for a FCHB, and as for a plug-in, there could be different designed EV range, which gives many possible combinations. For each of the reasonable combination, the global efficiency was analyzed under required vehicle performances and the given urban driving cycle in Beijing, the power train parameters were optimized taking into account the system complexity and operation cost, resulting in data base which help to make the best choice. Based on the analysis, system design of a Plug-in FCHB was completed, the power of fuel cell and weight of hydrogen storage are significantly reduced. For the given system design, the requirements of battery pack and fuel cell system, the operation cost, and even the durability of fuel cell will be affected by the operation mode and control parameters. Since the daily operation distance and driving cycle of a city bus is most likely pre-determined, a well balanced control algorithm can be carried out to reduce the requirements of battery and fuel cell, and hence the technical difficulties and cost, or in other words, the system durability could be improved.

One possible surrogate for fine particle measurement is the nephelometer, which measures the amount of light scattered by particles and gases in an atmospheric sample. EPA Victoria began sampling with nephelometers in 1979. Instruments were carefully maintained for over two decades before being replaced with newer equipment in 2003. A 22-month trial with old and new instruments in parallel showed an excellent correlation, which has allowed the instrument fleet to be replaced without loss of continuity in measurement. Light scattering measurements were also found to correlate well with manual gravimetric PM2.5 data at two sites in Melbourne. This allows estimates of PM2.5 to be determined at low cost, although site-specific relationships may need to be developed, and periodically re-established to account for any trends in aerosol properties. To manage particle pollution, we must be able to determine trends over time given advances in monitoring technology. This requires a detailed understanding of how instruments respond to particles with variable size distributions, amounts of moisture and semi-volatile matter. Although nephelometry as usually deployed does not quantify these variations, it does provide a simple and robust methodology that can be deployed over long time scales, giving an indication of the success or otherwise of air quality management programs.","Ambient air quality; Fine particle matter; Light scattering; Local visual distance; Nephelometer; Visibility","Aerosols; Gravimetric analysis; Light scattering; Nephelometers; Ambient air quality; Fine particle matter; Local visual distance; Air quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44349090342

The model selected for the study, which was completed in 2004, was AERMOD Version 02222. AERMOD Version 04300 was promulgated by USEPA as a regulatory model in the Guideline on Air Quality Models1 on November 9, 2005. To permit a planned facility expansion, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (ODEQ) required the facility to complete an air quality impact analysis for PM10 emissions. Total PM10 emission increases, including fugitive dust emissions from haul trucks on paved and unpaved roads and from landfill waste handling, were required to be included in an ODEQ (state-only) Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) analysis. Important project issues and challenges included utilizing appropriate methods to calculate fugitive PM10 emissions for input to modeling using USEPA AP-42 Section 13, selecting AERMOD source parameter inputs, and processing representative meteorological and site characteristic data inputs. An important up-front modeling data input issue was the PM10 emission calculation methodology. Given the planned large number of haul trucks entering the facility, PM10 emissions calculations, and thus modeled impacts, were highly uncertain and sensitive to roadway length, roadway silt content, proposed dust suppression techniques, and other assumptions employed. Passing the PM10 PSD increment threshold values was challenging. Multiple project refinements and detailed justification was made in the Air Quality Modeling Report to show compliance with ODEQ standards, Refinements are discussed in detail in the paper. Going beyond experience with the eastern Oregon landfill, this paper examines regulatory and technical issues associated with regulating fugitive dust emissions in air permits. The role of state agencies in applying dust control measures or requiring modeling is examined. Challenges of modeling fugitive PM10 emissions with AERMOD are discussed, including developing input source parameters (area and volume sources), establishing average hourly emission rates, issues with source and receptor elevation inputs, meteorological data processing, and use of deposition algorithms.","AERMOD; Air dispersion modeling; Area source; Fugitive dust; ISCST3; Landfill; PM10; Volume source","AERMOD; Air and Waste Management Association; Air dispersion modeling; Air permits; Air quality impacts; Air quality modeling; Area source; Control measures; Data inputs; Dust suppression; Emission calculation; Emission rates; Facility expansion; Fugitive dust; Fugitive dust emissions; Haul trucks; ISCST3; Issues and challenges; Land fill wastes; Meteorological data processing; Modeling data; Municipal solid waste landfills; Municipal wastes; Oregon Department of Environmental Quality; PM10; PM10 emissions; Prevention of significant deterioration; Regulatory models; S ource parameters; State agencies; Unpaved roads; Volume source; Air quality; Alternative fuels; Automobiles; Data processing; Deposition rates; Dust; Dust control; Environmental protection; Land fill; Modal analysis; Parameter estimation; Particulate emissions; Power spectral density; Pulse shaping circuits; Quality control; Refuse disposal; Regulatory compliance; Solid wastes; Standards; Trucks; Waste disposal; Waste management; Weight control; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-52049109232

One approach is based on adding small amounts of labeled 15N2O to the N2O reference gas and tracking the subsequent changes in mlz 30, 31, 44, 45 and 46, and this yields a 15N site preference of 46.3 ± 1.4‰ for tropospheric N2O. The other involves the synthesis of N2O by thermal decomposition of isotopically characterized ammonium nitrate and yields a 15N site preference of 18.7 ± 2.2‰ for tropospheric N2O. Both approaches neglect to fully account for isotope effects associated with the formation of NO+ fragment ions from the different isotopic species of N2O in the ion source of a mass spectrometer. These effects vary with conditions in the ion source and make it impossible to reproduce a calibration based on the addition of isotopically enriched N 2O on mass spectrometers with different ion source configurations. These effects have a much smaller impact on the comparison of a laboratory reference gas with N2O synthesized from isotopically characterized ammonium nitrate. This second approach was successfully replicated and leads us to advocate the acceptance of the site preference value 18.7 ± 2.2‰ for tropospheric N2O as the provisional community standard until further independent calibrations are developed and validated.

Six steady-state flux chambers were coupled via a multiplexer relay board and software with a photoacoustic multi-gas monitor to measure the concentration of ammonia and three greenhouse gases released from manure samples every 20 minutes over 24 hours. Each chamber sweep air flow rate was maintained at 0.5 air changes per minute via a calibrated flow meter. Five chambers evaluated emissions from manure samples consisting of 100 grams each of urine and feces from each cow on trial. This 50:50 urine:feces ratio produced as much or more ammonia gas than other ratios over 1 to 24 hour periods. The sixth chamber was filled with 200 grams of demineralized water for the initial gas concentration used in calculations. Emission was represented as the integral of gas released from the manure over a chosen time period. Results from five sub-samples of collected freestall manure had a standard error of 2% of the mean emission. Instrumentation use on manure slurry from trial cows was able to differentiate between diets but explanation of results may require additional information about other factors influencing gas emission. Results suggest that this method offers repeatable, simultaneous monitoring of gas emission from manure and offers potential to evaluate factors affecting emissions thus allowing better understanding and management of on-farm gas sources.","Ammonia; Design; Flux chamber; Manure; Urine feces ratio","Air pollution; Air quality; Ammonia; Body fluids; Concentration (process); Dairies; Gases; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Instruments; Leakage (fluid); Manures; Nutrition; Waste management; Ammonia gasses; Dairy cattle; Dairy manures; Demineralized waters; Emission detections; Flow meters; Flux chamber; Flux chambers; Gas concentrations; Gas emission reductions; Gas monitors; GaS sources; Instrumentation systems; Manure slurries; Nutritional changes; Simultaneous monitoring; Standard errors; Time periods; Urine feces ratio; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-56349085152

Current water resources planning and management procedures do not address the effects of climate impacts or the fragmentation in water resources management caused by balancing competing water uses. This is particularly true for transboundary watersheds in cold regions, where the effects of climate variability and long-term environmental impacts on extreme hydrological events (flood and drought) have been recognized for a number of years, yet are not accounted for in water management planning or policy. We recognize that the considerable uncertainties that do exist in global climate modeling are partially responsible for the lack of comprehensive planning that includes climate impacts. However, temperature-related effects of climate variability that affect floods and droughts in particular are quite predictable. These impacts should be considered in planning new projects and in the evaluation of existing projects. This paper presents an example where climate impacts can be considered to develop drought criteria in a transboundary situation, and suggests the development of policies to enable climate impacts as an integral component in planning and operations functions. However, implementation of water management plans at the basin level may be severely hampered by jurisdictional fragmentation.

This required detailed understanding of the scavenging flow. Computational study of scavenge flow in a typical small vehicle engine is accomplished using multi-dimensional moving-mesh unsteady and quasi-steady models. Both models indicate that typical multi-port inlet placement and timing allow significant mixture short-circuit, consistent with emissions observations.

The Laboratory's Ecology and Air Quality Group (ENV-EAQ) is responsible for ensuring LANL's compliance with the Clean Air Act (CAA). A Laboratory strategic goal is to improve the efficiency with which we achieve regulatory compliance and manage risk to support operational excellence. Future compliance initiatives and protection of air quality should include an evaluation of operating permit conditions, the Laboratory's Environmental Management System (EMS), and Record of Decision (ROD) for the Site-Wide Environmental Impact Statement (SWEIS). The Laboratory is managed by Los Alamos National Security, LLC, (LANS) under a contract administered by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) of the Department of Energy (DOE). Pursuant to federal CAA Amendments and Title 20 of New Mexico Administrative Code (NMAC), Chapter 2, Part 70, Operating Permits (20.2.70 NMAC), LANS is authorized to operate LANL per the terms and conditions as defined in Operating Permit No. PI00. All laboratory operations that have air emissions exceeding established regulatory levels are covered as part of this permit. Implementing the Title V Operating permit requires increased record keeping, increased frequency of reporting, and an annual compliance certification. LANL is a major source, based on the potential to emit, for nitrogen oxides (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). LANL reports annual emissions for sources included in the operating permit. This permit program includes permit requirements for the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) program and Radionuclides-NESHAP (Rad-NESHAP) program. The Laboratory also operates under the requirements of the Beryllium NESHAP program and the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) program, which will not be discussed in this paper. A system is in place to manage environmental risks. In addition to leadership and management provided by the staff of ENV-EAQ, LANL is ISO 14001 certified for an EMS, which provides a framework for environmental compliance, pollution prevention, and continual improvement in environmental performance.

The lidar transmission system is a pulsed Nd:YAG laser (355, 532, 1064 nm) operating at a pulse rate of 10 kHz. We analyze and model lidar backscatter and extinction coefficients to extract aerosol physical properties. All wavelength channels operate simultaneously, day or night, using photon counting and high speed data acquisition. The lidar housing is a transportable trailer suitable for all-weather operation at any accessible site. We direct the laser and telescope field of views to targets of interest in both azimuth and elevation. Arrays of particle samplers and turbulence detectors were also used by colleagues specializing in those fields and are compared with the lidar data. The value of multiwavelength, eyesafe lidars for agricultural aerosol measurements has been confirmed by the successful operation of AGLITE. In this paper, we demonstrate the ability of the lidar system to quantitatively characterize particulate emissions as mass concentration fields applicable for USEPA regulations. The combination of lidar with point characterization information allows the development of 3-D distributions of standard USEPA mass concentration fractions (PM10, PM2.5, and other interesting groupings such as PM10-PM2.5 and PM1). Lidar measurements are also focused on air motion as seen by long duration scans of the farm region. We demonstrate the ability to use ""standoff"" lidar methods to determine the movement and concentrations of emissions over an entire agricultural facility.","Aerosols; Agriculture; Fluxes; Lidar; Plumes","Aerosol measurements; Agricultural research services; Air motions; All-weather operations; Animal feeding operations; Animal productions; Atmospheric emissions; Extinction co-efficient; Eye-safe lidars; Field of views; High-speed data acquisitions; Lidar; Lidar datum; Lidar measurements; Lidar systems; Long durations; Mass concentrations; Multi wavelengths; Multiwavelength lidars; Particle emissions; Photon-counting; Plumes; Point measurements; Pulse rates; Pulsed nd:yag lasers; Targets of interests; Transmission systems; United states department of agricultures; Wavelength channels; Agriculture; Air pollution; Atmospheric aerosols; Laws and legislation; Neodymium lasers; Particulate emissions; Permanent magnets; Pulsed laser applications; Remote sensing; Standardization; Three dimensional; Optical radar",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57549104534

Such an approach is proposed as part of the multilateral framework on climate change. The concept of sustainable development policies and measures (SD-PAMs) is outlined, making clear that it is distinct from many other approaches in starting from development rather than explicit climate targets. The potential of SD-PAMs is illustrated with a case-study of energy efficiency in South Africa, drawing on energy modelling for the use of electricity in industry. The results show multiple benefits both for local sustainable development and for mitigating global climate change. The benefits of industrial energy efficiency in South Africa include significant reductions in local air pollutants; improved environmental health; creation of additional jobs; reduced electricity demand; and delays in new investments in electricity generation. The co-benefit of reducing GHG emissions could result in a reduction of as much as 5% of SA's total projected energy CO2 emissions by 2020. Institutional support and policy guidance is needed at both the international and national level to realize the potential of SD-PAMs. This analysis demonstrates that if countries begin to act early to move towards greater sustainability, they will also start to bend the curve of their emissions path. © 2007 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Developing countries; Economic development; Energy efficiency; Mitigation; Policy instruments; Public policies; South Africa; Sustainable development","developing world; economic development; electricity industry; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental economics; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; policy implementation; sustainable development; Africa; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39449124465

How do we obtain a package deal starting in Bali but building bridges to a post-2020 climate regime? A fair, effective, flexible and inclusive package deal has to strike a core balance between development and climate imperatives (mitigation, adaptation, dealing with the impacts of response measures, technology transfer, investment and finance) to create bargaining space and establish a conceptual contract zone. Within a continuum of possible packages, two packages in the contract zone are identified: ‘multi-stage’ and ‘ambitious transitional’. The latter is ambitious, combining domestic cap-and-trade for the USA, deeper cuts for Annex B countries, and quantifiable mitigation actions by developing countries. It is transitional as a possible bridge to a more inclusive regime beyond 2020. Multi-stage is defined around mechanisms by which countries move through increasingly stringent levels of participation, and must be based upon agreed triggers. Our assessment of political dynamics is that multi-stage is not yet in the political contract zone. Key to this is the absence of a ‘trigger from the North’, in that the largest historical emitter must act earlier and most decisively. But progress will also depend on continued leadership from Annex B countries, as well as more proactive, incentivized leadership in the South. Agreeing on the transitional stage is the critical next step in the evolution of the climate regime. Negotiating any package will require an institutional space for bargaining, political leadership and trust, and a clear time-frame. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Bali; Climate negotiations; Developing countries; Development and climate; Multilateral climate policy frameworks; Package deals; Post-2012; South—North","bridge; climate change; developing world; environmental planning; environmental policy; environmental protection; Asia; Bali; Eurasia; Indonesia; Lesser Sunda Islands; Malay Archipelago; North America; Southeast Asia; Sunda Isles; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39449083327

Advancements in hybrid vehicles and microturbines, combined with the increased air-quality standards support renewed consideration of small gas turbine power plants for buses and some trucks. A detailed analysis and design of the intercooled recuperated (ICR) gas turbine for municipal buses is presented in this paper. The engine contains several novel features enabling exceptionally high part-load efficiency, thereby reducing the typical battery inventory in a hybrid vehicle. The ICR engine design shows superior integrated part-load efficiency relative to Diesel and natural gas engines. Moreover the ICR engine will meet the stringent CARB10 emission regulations, operating on conventional gasoline or diesel fuels, without catalysts. This paper focuses on the mechanical design, performance modeling, and cost analysis of a 250 kWe power plant, building upon the authors' extensive experience in the microturbine industry. The results from a comprehensive part-load performance model define the system efficiency from near idle to full power.

According to the Australian Government studies on household greenhouse gas emissions, it has been noted that gas cooking generates 30 to 50% of the greenhouse gas generated by traditional electric cooking[1]. Although electric induction cookers are 20 to 50% more efficient than ordinary electric hotplates, its total emission effects remains to be seen since the existing cookware might not be suitable. There are two major problems in designing the gas cooktop burners, viz. energy utilization and greenhouse gas emissions. The proposed study will concentrate on their thermal efficiency, which depends on heat transfer from the flame to the impinging surface, which is quite a complicated issue depending on several engineering variables. In view of the need for a better understanding of design factors affecting cooktop thermal performance and associated gaseous emissions, Design of Experiments(DOE), a key tool in the Six Sigma technology, is often applied to evaluate the magnitude of the individual and interaction effects of each of these variables on the thermal efficiency and gas emissions of the gas-fired domestic cooktop burners. In this study, carbon monoxide(CO) and nitrogen oxide(NOx) emissions from gas cooktop burners would be chosen.","Full-factorial design; Gas-fired cooktop; Six sigma","Carbon monoxide; Design; Design of experiments; Energy utilization; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Heat transfer; Heating; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Process engineering; Process monitoring; Six sigma; Work simplification; Electric induction; Full factorial design; Gas-fired; Interaction effect; Metropolitan cities; Six sigma technology; Statistical modeling; Thermal Performance; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924351593

In 1997, it was listed as one of twelve ""Level I Compounds"" under the U.S.-Canada Binational Toxics Strategy. The two nations have committed to pursuing benzo(a)pyrene emission reduction strategies and tracking the progress of these efforts. Emissions inventories are valuable ways of identifying high-emitting sectors, determining the relative benefit of various emission reduction strategies, and for tracking trends. The eight U.S Great Lakes states and the Canadian province of Ontario have been collaborating on a regional toxic air emissions inventory for the past 15 years. Following the publication of the 2002 inventory, these states and province conducted a specific assessment of the benzo(a)pyrene emissions inventory, including its coverage, estimation methods, available emission factors, errors and inconsistencies. Updates were made to the data to produce a regional inventory with greater accuracy, consistency and comprehensiveness. This paper details the emissions inventory assessment process, presents the revisions to the 2002 regional benzo(a)pyrene inventory, offers recommendations for correcting gaps in estimation tools for a variety of emission sources. The paper also discusses implications for both benzo(a)pyrene control strategies and future emission inventory work for this and other pollutants.","Air toxics; Benzo(a)pyrene; Emission inventory; Emissions; Great Lakes","Emission control; Lakes; Particulate emissions; Pyrene; Waste management; Air toxics; Benzo(a)pyrene; Emission inventories; Emission reduction strategy; Emissions inventory; Great lakes; Great Lakes regions; Persistent toxic substances; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649185654

However, the inoculation efficiency was usually subjected to competitions of indigenous microorganisms. In this study, a temperature-guided three-stage inoculation (TGTSI) method was developed to control the indigenous cell concentrations, and in turn, enhance the composting efficiency. The experimental results indicated that the TGTSI method could effectively suppress the initial cell concentrations of indigenous microorganisms, which resulted in significantly enhancement of biodegradations as well as the reduction of odor emissions. Moreover, a two-stage kinetics method was employed to analyze the TGTSI mechanisms. The model results were consistent with the experimental data. In conclusion, this study implied that TGTSI could not only enhance the composting process but also save system cost. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","Biodegradation; Composting; Inoculation; Three-stage","Biodegradation; Composting; Enzymes; Microorganisms; Inoculation; Microbial population; Odor emissions; Solid wastes; article; cell density; chemical reaction kinetics; composting; controlled study; enzyme release; inoculation; microbial degradation; microflora; municipal solid waste; odor control; oxygen consumption; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34547102213

The averaged monthly and annual SO2 and PM concentrations were measured, and for both, a slight increase in the air was observed from 1998 to 2004. The annual average SO2 and PM concentrations were not above the TPAQR standard. However, annual average concentrations of SO2 were determined to be higher than the WHO limits. The annual average fluctuations of PM exceeded the EPA limits between 2000 and 2003. Significant variations in SO2 were observed between annual minimum and maximum concentrations in the period of 1998-2004. However, variations in PM were only recorded for years 2003 and 2004. Based on these results, it is thought that clean air in Nigde has largely been affected by SO2 and PM. In the last months of 2004, SO2 and PM levels were above the daily limits of TPAQR (400 (μg/m3) and also the averaged ones of WHO, EPA and EU were exceeded.

The source-receptor relationships of the Lagrangian puff model of long-range transportation, ATMOS-N, were used to calculate the wet/dry deposition of the nitrogen (N) in Asia. Critical loads of N deposition in Asia were calculated from the relationships between the critical load of sulfur (S) and balance of N in and out using the data of S critical load of RAINS-ASIA. The cost functions of N reduction of Asian countries were derived by the regression analysis with the data of cost functions of European countries used in RAINS. In order to assess the environmental impact, the gaps between N deposition and critical load of N were calculated. The emission of NO x was reduced in some cases of this model, and the changes of gaps between N deposition and critical load were observed as well as the changes of the reduction cost.

Based on the 6-31+G(d)-UB3LYP, UMP2 and UCCSD(T) calculations on charged [D(CAl4)M]q-, saturated [D(CAl4)Mn] and extended (CpM) p(CAl4)q sandwich-like compounds (D = CAl 4-, Cp-; M = Li, Na, K, Be, Mg, Ca), we find that for the six metals, the planar radical CAl4- can only be assembled in the ""hetero-decked sandwich"" scheme (e.g. [CpM(CAl4)]q-) rather than the traditional ""homo-decked sandwich"" scheme. Moreover, the low and high spin states of the designed sandwich-like species are perfectly degenerate during assembly. This can be ascribed to the good spin conservation of the CAl4 - deck and the good spatial separation between two CAl 4- decks. Our results show for the first time that the planar radical CAl4- can act as a new type of spin-embedded ""superatom"" for cluster assembly when it is assisted by a rigid partner like Cp-. The good spin-conservation of CAl 4- is very promising for the future design of novel paramagnetic and diamagnetic materials. The ionic, clustering and radical interactions between the two decks are analyzed in detail, which is quite crucial to improve the insight and understanding of the nature and origin of the interactions of the ""deck-core-deck"" in the metallocenes. Such information is also important in understanding the radical reactions and designing novel spin-based molecular materials. The present study should be expected to enrich the flat carbon chemistry, radical chemistry, metallocene chemistry and combinatorial chemistry. © the Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34948882270

Seven different kinds of imposed stratification have been introduced according to the position of the maximal local fuel/air equivalence ratio in the cylinder at intake valve close. The results show that: The charge stratification results in stratification of the in-cylinder temperature. The former four kinds of stratification, whose maximal local equivalence ratios at intake valve close locate between the cylinder center and half of the cylinder radius, advance ignition timing, reduce the pressure-rise rate, and retard combustion-phasing. But the following three kinds of stratification, whose maximal local equivalence ratios at intake valve close appear between half of the cylinder radius and the cylinder wall, have little effect on the cylinder pressure.

The catalytic behavior of powdered (SrFe)0.7(SrAl2)0.3Oz, studied by temperature-programmed reduction in dry CH4 at 523-1073 K, is governed by the level of oxygen nonstoichiometry in the crystal lattice of the perovskite component and is qualitatively similar to that of other perovskite-related ferrites, such as Sr0.7La0.3Fe 0.8Al0.2O3-δ. While extensive oxygen release from the ferrite lattice at 700-900 K leads to predominant total oxidation of methane, significant selectivity to synthesis gas formation, with H2/CO ratios close to 2, is observed above 1000 K, when a critical value of oxygen deficiency is achieved. The steady-state oxidation over dense membranes at 1123-1223 K results, however, in prevailing total combustion, particularly due to excessive oxygen chemical potential at the membrane surface. In combination with surface-limited oxygen permeability, mass transport limitations in a porous layer at the membrane permeate side prevent reduction and enable stable operation of (SrFe)0.7(SrAl2) 0.3Oz membranes under air/methane gradient. Taking into account the catalytic activity of SrFeO3-δ-based phases for the partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas and the important role of mass transport-related effects, one promising approach for membrane development is the fabrication of thick layer of porous ferrite-based catalyst at the surface of dense (SrFe)0.7(SrAl2)0.3Oz composite. © the Owner Societies.",,"aluminum derivative; iron; methane; oxygen; strontium; article; catalysis; chemistry; electric conductivity; oxidation reduction reaction; particle size; surface property; temperature; Aluminum Compounds; Catalysis; Electric Conductivity; Iron; Methane; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen; Particle Size; Strontium; Surface Properties; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34447321565

We aimed to determine a hierarchy of causes for explaining the extremely restricted distribution of subsp. staminosa, and to determine the genetic relationships among populations within both subspecies. We measured allozyme variation in all known populations of the two subspecies. There were exceptionally high levels of genetic divergence between subsp. staminosa and subsp. cylindracea, including an apparent duplication of the gene encoding phosphoglucomutase, leading to an additional gene in subsp. cylindracea. These findings combined with UPGMA analysis indicate a very long period of historical separation, perhaps originating in the early Pleistocene. Genetic variation was partitioned mostly between rather than within populations, with very low levels of genetic variation within populations of both subspecies. For subsp. staminosa we quantified seed production for three consecutive years and demography for five consecutive years. We used transition matrix models to describe the shrub's population dynamics and stochastic simulations to explicitly compare the effects of low rainfall and disturbance on population viability. Verticordia staminosa subsp. staminosa produces large numbers of seeds each year and has flower to fruit ratios greater than reported for related rare and common congeners. Seedling recruitment occurs in most years, with pulses in the wettest years. The mean finite population growth rate was 1.031. Elasticity analyses showed that population growth rate was more sensitive to stasis of established plants than to seedling recruitment. Population viability declined with lower rainfall and increased fire-related mortality of adult plants. Rarity in subsp. staminosa is best explained by evolutionary history and the interaction of climate change and disturbances such as fire that kill plants. Climatic fluctuations since the late Pliocene might have led to stochastic extinction episodes of populations on other granite outcrops, resulting in the currently restricted distribution. We discuss the implications of our findings for management of the species. © CSIRO 2007.",,"allozyme; climate change; conservation management; divergence; endemic species; forest fire; genetic variation; intrapopulation variation; isolated population; local extinction; population growth; population viability analysis; rarity; recruitment; seed production; shrub; species conservation; stochasticity; subspecies; Australasia; Australia; Western Australia; Myrtaceae; Verticordia staminosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34249070508

Fossil fuels - coal, oil and natural gas - are expected to constitute about 85% of any future increment in the global energy demand. Such a continuing domination of the global energy mix by fossil fuels will have devastating consequences for the world's environment, given the fact that their combustion results in the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is one of the most prevalent GHG in the atmosphere. Anthropogenic emissions of CO 2 result primarily from the combustion of fossil fuels for energy generation, transportation and manufacturing (e.g. cement). It is consequently at the forefront of the debate on global climate change. There are not that many alternative energy sources that can replace fossil fuels due to capacity and cost constraints and hence, reliance on non-fossil fuels e.g. nuclear power and renewable energy will be limited. Fortunately, there are emerging clean fossil-fuel based energy technologies that are more efficient and environmentally benign. One such technology is the Zero Emission Carbon (ZEC) power plant. However, the estimated cost of energy using such new technologies is also very high. Without any recourse to policy changes, such as the imposition of carbon taxes, these systems cannot compete with the cheaper but environmentally-impacting conventional fossil-fuelled power plants. It is normally emphasized that taxes, in general, are highly unpopular in the Unites States and that carbon emission trading might perhaps be the right course of action. This paper discusses some of the issues involving the use of carbon taxes and carbon emission trading as regulatory mechanisms for mitigating the emissions of CO 2. The economic impacts of these regulatory mechanisms on clean energy technologies such as the ZEC technology will also be assessed.",,"Alternative energy source; Anthropogenic emissions; Carbon emissions; Carbon taxes; Carbon trading; Clean energy technology; CO2 emissions; Cost constraints; Course of action; Economic impacts; Energy generations; Energy requirements; Energy technologies; Environmentally benign; Estimated costs; Global climate changes; Global energy; Global energy demand; Non-fossil fuels; Policy changes; Regulatory mechanism; Renewable energies; Zero emission; Carbon dioxide; Cement manufacture; Climate change; Coal combustion; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy management; Energy policy; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Technology; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865448972

It is therefore necessary to handle process gas streams involving various mixtures of hydrocarbons, H2, H2O, CO and CO2 at moderate to high temperatures. These gases pose a variety of corrosion threats to the alloys used in plant construction. Carbon is a particularly aggressive corrodent, leading to carburisation and, at high carbon activities, to metal dusting. The behaviour of commercial heat resisting alloys 602CA and 800, together with that of 304 stainless steel, was studied during thermal cycling in CO/CO2 at 700°C, and also in CO/H2/H2O at 680°C. Thermal cycling caused repeated scale separation which accelerated chromium depletion from the alloy subsurface regions. The CO/H 2/H2O gas, with ac = 2:9 and pO 2 = 5 ×10-23atm, caused relatively rapid metal dusting, accompanied by some internal carburisation. In contrast, the CO/CO 2 gas, with ac = 7 and pO2 = 10 -24-10-23atm caused internal precipitation in all three alloys, but no dusting. Inward diffusion of oxygen led to in situ oxidation of internal carbides in the stainless steel, and the accompanying volume expansion disrupted the material. Alloy 602CA sustained limited internal carburisation and formed internal Al2O3 rather than undergoing internal carbide oxidation. The very different reaction morphologies produced by the two gas mixtures are discussed in terms of competing gas-alloy reaction steps. © 2007 Science Reviews 2000 Ltd.","Catalysis; Coking; Dusting; Internal oxidation; Precipitation","304 stainless steel; Carburisation; Chromium depletion; Dusting; Heat-resisting; High temperature; Hydrogen-rich gas; In-plants; In-situ oxidation; Internal precipitation; Inward diffusion; Large scale hydrogen production; Metal dusting; Process gas; Reaction steps; Scale separation; Steam reforming; Subsurface regions; Two-gas mixtures; Volume expansion; Alloys; Carbides; Catalysis; Chromium; Coal gasification; Coking; Gas mixtures; Gas producers; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen production; Internet protocols; Oxygen; Precipitation (chemical); Stainless steel; Steam engineering; Thermal cycling; Internal oxidation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-72549119736

The primary goal of this pilot is to demonstrate the efficacy of using CO2 to enhance coalbed methane recovery particularly near reservoir abandonment pressure while also evaluating the suitability of coal seams for longer-term carbon storage. Basic geologic models of the coal seams were developed from well logs in the area. Production histories from several surrounding CBM wells were shown. To monitor the injection of up to 75,000 ton of CO2 beginning September 2007, seismic surveys and tiltmeter arrays were utilized. Larger-scale geo-hydrodynamic simulations were used to develop a regional model for the fluid dynamics of the northern San Juan Basin. Smaller-scale reservoir simulations, incorporating available laboratory and field data, were used to develop an improved understanding of reservoir dynamics within the specific 640-acre pilot area. Both modeling scales were critical to assessing the suitability of deploying commercial carbon storage programs throughout the basin. Reservoir characterization results on the optimization of total CO2 injection volume, injection rate over time, and how CO2 is expected to disperse after injection are presented.

A gaseous plasma is triggered by a pulsed carbon shunting arc discharge. A positively biased electrode (80-mm diameter) is set at a distance of 100 mm from the shunting arc plasma source. Methane, nitrogen, or argon gas is used as an ambient gas at a pressure of up to 150 Pa. The plasma species, both from the carbon shunting arc and from the induced gaseous plasma, are mixed to form a hybrid plasma, that is, the shunting arc discharge plays not only the role of a triggering source for generating the gaseous plasma, but also that of a supplier of carbon species. This system has the following features: (1) The metallic and gaseous plasma species are easily mixed in activated states (ionization, excitation, etc.) in a large volume; (2) The induced gaseous plasma is generated over a wide range of pressures from 0.05 to 140 Pa. Feature (2) is favorable for reactive deposition of compound films under an appropriate gas condition. The mixing of the different species is confirmed by the observation of the emission spectra. When argon is used as an ambient gas, the induced hybrid plasma includes argon and carbon-related species. The emission spectra are typically 434.5 nm (Ar I), 440.1 nm (Ar II), and 426.7 nm (C II). These are simultaneously observed at the same position. In the methane gas environment, carbon and CH spectra are commonly observed. Carbon ions (CII) with a wavelength of 426.7 nm and CH molecules with a wavelength of 431.4 nm are mainly observed in the visible light region. The spectral intensity increases in the presence of methane gas as compared to the case where methane is absent. It is found that the plasma structure changes by the ambient gas pressure. In a pressure region as low as 1 Pa, a glow-like hybrid plasma is uniformly generated, while the glow-like plasma is transferred to a beam-like plasma at pressures higher than 1 Pa. The transferring is due to a sudden change of the space potential brought by termination of the shunting arc discharge. The intensity of the emission spectrum increases with the current of the glow-like plasma. In the beam-like plasma, the life of the emission at the surface of the positively biased electrode is shorter than that of the beam-like plasma current, which suggests a strong flow of the plasma. © 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Box 14155-6455, Tehran, Iran","One of the most important environmental problems in Iran is air pollution, especially in the capital city of Tehran. The exhaust emissions from spark ignition (SI) engines accounts for a major portion of this problem in Tehran. Nitrogen oxides are one of the main groups of pollutants in exhaust emissions from spark ignition engines. Engine deposits derived mainly from the gasoline could adversely affect the engine emissions. It has been observed in the majority of studies that the accumulation of engine deposits may lead to an increase in NOx emissions. In line with Iranian department of environment policies to reduce Tehran air pollution, more than 250,000 SI engine vehicles were decarbonized in Tehran. In decarbonization process a mixture of gasoline and additive was injected into engine to remove engine deposits. In the present research, the influence of a deposit control additive on NOx emissions from two types of gasoline engine vehicles i.e. Peykan (base on Hillman) and Pride (South Korea Kia motors) was studied. Exhaust NOx emissions from 192 Peykans and 227 Prides were measured in two stages, before decarbonization process and after that. Statistical analysis was conducted on the measurement results. Results showed that NOx emissions from Peykans increased 0.3% and NOx emissions from Pride automobiles decreased by 6.2% on average, due to the elimination of engine deposits. The observed variations were not statistically and practically significant. The results indicated that making use of detergent additives is not an effective way to reduce the exhaust NOx emissions from gasoline engine vehicles.","Air pollution; Deposit control additive; Nitrogen oxides emissions; Spark ignition engines","Additives; Air pollution; Internal combustion engines; Nitrogen oxides; Deposit control additive; Nitrogen oxides emissions; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44349125712

A part of the study was done to review modern power plant technologies currently available potential technical concepts for large scale power generation on lignite taking in account their high moisture contents. Reference is also be made to the importance of low rank coals-lignite in the international scene. The combination of the high moisture content and high reactivity of low lignite necessitates their use close to the mine, unless they can be upgraded to value-added products with improved transport safety and economics. Their primary use is therefore power generation or to provide domestic and industrial fuels for local use, although a number of novel alternative fuel and non-fuel applications provide value-added potential. Due to the generally low mining cost of these coals, emphasis was previously placed on developing technologies to minimise the capital expenditure rather than maximise thermal efficiency in their use. However, the current concerns over global warming have focussed attention on developing utilisation technologies to reduce the comparatively high CO2 emissions from burning these coals.","Efficiency; Environement; Lignite; Moisture; New technologies","Capital expenditures; Environement; High moisture contents; Industrial fuels; Modern technologies; Power plant technology; Thermal efficiency; Value added products; Alternative fuels; Efficiency; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Fossil fuel power plants; Geology; Global warming; Moisture; Moisture determination; Lignite",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890287138

To test the effect of spin-up time on the regional climate simulation results for such abnormal climate event, a total of 11 experiments were performed with different spin-up time from 10 days to 6 months, respectively. The simulation results show that, for the meteorological variables in the atmosphere, the model would be running in ""climate mode"" after 4-8-day spin-up time, then, it is independent of the spin-up time basically, and the simulation errors are mainly caused by the model's failure in describing the atmospheric processes over the model domain. This verifies again that the regional climate modeling is indeed a lateral boundary condition problem as demonstrated by earlier research work. The simulated mean precipitation rate over each subregion is not sensitive to the spin-up time, but the precipitation scenario is somewhat different for the experiment with different spin-up time, which shows that there exists the uncertainty in the simulation to precipitation scenario, and such a uncertainty exhibits more over the areas where heavy rainfall happened. Generally, for monthly-scale precipitation simulation, a pin-up time of 1 month is enough, whereas a spin-up time of 2 months is better for seasonal-scale one. Furthermore, the relationship between the precipitation simulation error and the advancement/withdrawal of East Asian summer monsoon was analyzed. It is found that the variability of correlation coefficient for precipitation is more significant over the areas where the summer monsoon is predominant. Therefore, the model's capability in reproducing precipitation features is related to the heavy rainfall processes associated with the advancement/withdrawal of East Asian summer monsoon, which suggests that it is necessary to develop a more reliable parameterization scheme to capture the convective precipitation of heavy rainfall processes associated with the activities of East Asian summer monsoon, so as to improve the climate modeling over China.","Numerical experiment; Regional climate model; Seasonal-scale; Spin-up","atmospheric convection; boundary condition; climate modeling; correlation; monsoon; numerical model; parameterization; rainfall; regional climate; summer; uncertainty role; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39649090278

Given photon noise and background and signal variability, such experiments show how to optimize an aperture to maximize detectability of the signal. Here, we consider a fundamentally different, more realistic task in which the observer is required to both detect and localize a signal. The signal is embedded in a variable background and is known except for location. We inquire whether the addition of a localization requirement changes conclusions on aperture optimization. We have previously formulated an ideal observer for this joint detection/localization task, and here apply it to the classic problem of determining an optimal pinhole diameter in a planar emission imaging system. We conclude that as search tolerance on localization decreases, the optimal pinhole diameter shrinks from that required by detection alone, and in addition, task performance becomes more sensitive to fluctuations about the optimal pinhole diameter. As in the case for detection only, the optimal pinhole diameter shrinks as the amount of background variability grows, and in addition, conspicuity limits can be observed. Unlike the case for detection only, our task leads to a finite aperture size in the absence of background variability. For both tasks, the inclusion of background variability yields a finite aperture size. © 2007 IEEE.","Detection and localization; Ideal observer; LROC; Pinhole; Planar emission imaging; ROC","Digital image storage; Imaging systems; Optimization; Optoelectronic devices; Detection and localization; Ideal observer; LROC; Pinhole; Planar emission imaging; ROC; Medical imaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48349120366

For single-photon radiotracers, one needs a blocking aperture, such as a pinhole, multi-pinhole aperture or collimator, to form images. Here we consider a single pinhole. For engineers, the pinhole design, especially its diameter, is crucial in that it controls a noise-resolution tradeoff, and this tradeoff ultimately determines the ability of a human observer to find and detect the tumor. We considered a single-pinhole planar emission imaging system and addressed the following engineering question: what pinhole diameter allows the best possible performance in both detecting and localizing a signal (e.g. tumor) embedded in the noisy image?

The experimental results indicated the increase in removal rate with increasing applied voltage, increasing pH value of the solution, aeration, and adding Fe2+. The removal rate of phenol could reach 72.1% when air aeration flow rate was 1200 ml/min, and 88.2% when 0.05 mmol/LFe2+ was added into the solution under the conditions of applied voltage 25 kV, initial phenol concentration of 5 mg/L, and initial pH value 5.5. The addition of sodium carbonate reduced the phenol removal rate. In the pulsed high-voltage electric field, local discharge occurred at the surface of activated alumina, which promoted phenol degradation in the thin water film. At the same time, the space-time distribution of gas-liquid phases was more uniform and the contact areas of the activated species generated from the discharge and the pollutant molecules were much wider due to the effect of the activated alumina bed. The synthetical effects of the pulsed high-voltage electric field and the activated alumina particles accelerated phenol degradation. © 2007 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","activated alumina; Fenton's reaction; hybrid gas-liquid electrical discharge; phenol; pulsed high-voltage electric field; water treatment","Activated alumina; Degradation; Electric fields; pH effects; Phenols; Water aeration; Fenton's reaction; Phenol removal; Pulsed high-voltage electric field; Removal rate; Chemicals removal (water treatment); aluminum oxide; carbonic acid derivative; iron; oxygen; phenol; sodium carbonate; Activated alumina; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Degradation; Electric fields; pH effects; Phenols; Water aeration; aeration; aluminum oxide; aqueous solution; electric field; phenol; pollutant removal; removal experiment; water treatment; article; chemistry; electricity; electrochemistry; methodology; pH; water management; water pollutant; Aluminum Oxide; Carbonates; Electricity; Electrochemistry; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Iron; Oxygen; Phenol; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34248346305

Though required by the California Clean Act Air (CCAA), most Air Districts have done little if anything to implement controversial ISR programs, which require new land use developments to comply with emission mitigation requirements. Air Pollution Control Districts were hesitant in implementing ISRs because they did not look forward to the challenges and lawsuits that are expected from the development community. One Air District (Placer County APCD) went forward with an ISR program over 12 years ago. It was developed cooperatively with the development community and has been operating successfully for all these years. In this paper, we address two issues: First, we elaborate the lessons learned and controversial challenges faced during the development and implementation of an ISR program by Placer County APCD. Second, since the implementation of the SJAPCD's ISR program will hopefully interest many other Air Districts in adopting ISRs (once they wait to see how the lawsuits come out!), it will be very important to have a workable framework to evaluate both the implementation and emission reduction reality of ISR programs. We describe the development of a research program and protocols that can be used by all stakeholders to evaluate ISR programs and list the areas that need further research to produce real-world emission reductions from new land use developments.","Air quality; Clean air act; Land use; New development; Non-attainment; NOx; Ozone; PM; Policy evaluation; Transportation","Air pollution; Air quality; Emission control; Gas emissions; Land use; Laws and legislation; Ozone; Pollution; Pollution control; Pollution induced corrosion; Promethium; Quality control; Transportation; Waste management; Clean air act; New development; Non-attainment; NOx; Policy evaluation; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649186830

Re-estimations and reviews continue almost till the end of exploitation in many instances. Estimation of oil reserves, when a field is in its initial stages of development is a relatively easy task. The estimation will not invite critical or close scrutiny, as the oil production at that stage is far lower than the reserves calculated. However as the field matures and the cumulative oil production approaches the estimated value of reserves, the accuracy in the estimation of reserves becomes crucial and more important. Also the estimation process itself is a challenging task, in the light of uncovering geological complexities and reservoir dynamics during the development and the exploitation methods employed to produce the oil. Bahrain field, the first discovery in the Arabian Gulf region, has been on production since 1933. It is a multi-stacked field with 16 oil and 4 gas reservoirs. Most of them are carbonate reservoirs. The nature of the fluids varies from tarry oil in the Aruma formation occurring at shallow depths to dry gas in the deep Khuff zones. The geology of the field is complex with a large number of faults on the structure. The major oil zone Mauddud - an oil wet system - has been on gas injection from 1938. The gas injection has lead to the transfer of oil and gas into layers above and below through the faults. Though many reservoirs of the field have reached mature stage, there are some zones containing oil resources still unexploited due to the heterogeneities, complex nature of the fluid distribution, unfavorable rock-fluid characteristics, compartmentalization, thin oil rim overlain by gas and underlain by water, etc. This paper brings out the challenges posed by the above situations while attempting to estimate and classify oil reserves.

Cold ironing is emerging as a technically feasible, cost-effective way of cutting emissions in port for container ships and cruise liners, and potentially for other ship types, which also make regular calls at a given terminal or berth. The scale of the hotel load borne by a large cruise ship gives special merit to the concept, which can eliminate pollutants, e.g., particulate matter, NOx, and SOx from the ship while alongside. A new regulation envisaged by the California Air Resources Board will require vessels visiting the state's ports to reduce air pollution from auxiliary installations through the use of cleaner marine distillate fuels or equivalent emission controls, including the use of shoreside electrical power. Cold ironing is also set to become an issue for ships calling at ports elsewhere in North America, while steps to provide shore power for regular callers have been taken at various ports in Germany, Japan, and elsewhere. Although there is no global technical standard governing ship-to-shore connection points, IMO has called on the ISO to develop a formula, and it is anticipated that work could be completed in 2008 or 2009.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77953119161

Increasing the number of stages in a preheater will result in reduced fuel consumption and increased power consumption. Increasing from 4-stages to 5-stages reduces fuel consumption more than the saving achieved when increasing from 5-stages to 6-stages.
