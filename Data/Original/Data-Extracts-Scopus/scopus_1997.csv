The theoretical analysis is based on experimental adsorption isotherms measured simultaneously through the local adsorption parameters, together with the rate constants for desorption, first-order surface reaction and gaseous chemical reactions. The experimental procedure is that of the reversed-flow gas chromatography (RF-GC) technique, the analysis of the diffusion bands being effected by a personal computer programme. The methodology has been applied to the action of gaseous hydrocarbons on two metal oxides, and of dimethyl sulfide on Penteli marble particles and on pieces obtained from three archaeological statues. All physicochemical parameters mentioned above were measured both in the absence and in the presence of a second gaseous pollutant (NO2). The synergistic effects in the gas phase on the various deposition parameters was fairly obvious.","Adsorption isotherms; Deposition velocity; Dimethyl sulfide; Hydrocarbons, gaseous; Metal oxides; Reaction probability; Synergistic effect","dimethyl sulfide; hydrocarbon; metal oxide; silica gel; air pollutant; air pollution; archeology; article; chemical reaction; drug determination; drug interaction; gas chromatography; priority journal; technique",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030795795

Due to the continuous discharge of agricultural, industrial and sewage waste waters to these lakes, significant variations in the sediment's nature took place, with fine fractions dominating opposite to the outflowing area of the main drains. Organic carbon was elevated at the southern regions, reaching 10.5 ± 4.5% in lake Mariut. Meanwhile, carbonate increased reaching 90% for samples collected at the lake-sea connection areas. The 0.5 N HCl extractable metals indicated enriched levels of different metals at sites affected by sewage and industrial discharge. This fraction constituted 75 and 81% of the total metals in Lakes Mariut and Manzalah, respectively. Extractable Cd for Lakes Mariut and Manzalah constituted 51 and 53%, respectively, while Ph formed 59% of the total digestable metal in Lake Manzalah. Total metals concentrations especially Cd and Pb were elevated 8 to 70 times than those observed in the same lakes 25 years ago. The conversion of the untreated sewage discharge of Alexandria city to Lake Mariut and significant portion of Cairo sewage to Lake Manzalah during the past 10 years lead to the appearance of elevated levels of contaminants in both lakes. Agricultural discharge showed less impact on Lakes Edku and Burullus. Cluster analysis revealed associations between stations located under same types of stress while the correspondence factor analysis displayed that metals distribution pattern in the Nile delta lakes are governed by organic carbon as well as fine grained size fraction distribution.","Cluser; Extractable; Factor analysis; Geochemistry; Metals; Nile delta lakes; Total","Cluster analysis; Correspondence factor analysis; Analytical geochemistry; Cadmium; Environmental impact; Lead; Natural water geochemistry; Particle size analysis; Sediments; Water analysis; Water pollution; Soil pollution; agricultural discharge; contamination; delta; delta lake; developing country; geochemistry; lake pollution; lake sediment; land use; pollution monitoring; sediment contamination; wastewater discharge; article; binding kinetics; concentration response; gene cluster; genetic linkage; metal binding; reproducibility; sewage treatment; waste water; Africa, Nile River; Egypt, Nile Delta; Equidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031194427

From the ratio of the observed cross sections for π0 production on carbon and copper targets in the interval 0.9 ≤ X ≤ 1.9, the exponent in the cross-section parametrization Ed3σ/d3p ∼ ATn is derived tobe n = 0.38 ± 0.03. Under the assumption that the invariant cross section as a function of the projectile atomic number AP can be parametrized in the form Ed3σ/d3p ∼ Apm , the X and p⊥2 dependences of the exponent m are investigated by comparing the cross sections for the reactions C + AT → π0 + x (AT = C, Cu) with those for the analogous reactions induced by incident α particles. At X = 1.9, the parameter m is found to reach a value of 2.1 ± 0.1. In the kinematical region specified by the inequalities θπ ≤ 16° and Eπ ≥ 2 GeV, the AP dependence of the cross section under study shows a significant variation with X and only a weak variation with the pion transverse momentum. The probabilities of the formation of six-quark configurations in 4He and 12C nuclei are estimated at 5% and 20%, respectively. For the parametrization Ed3σ/d3p ∼ exp(-X/X0), the values of the slope parameter X0 corresponding to various energies of helium and carbon projectiles are compared. The energy at which the cross section reaches the scaling regime corresponding to a plateau in the energy dependence of the parameter X0, which characterizes the quark-parton structure function of the nucleus, is found to increase with increasing atomic weight of the nucleus undergoing fragmentation.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031328370

Under the New Source Review (NSR) program, emission offsets for nonattainment pollutants are required for `major' new and modified sources in nonattainment areas. The entire Northeast (from Northern Virginia to Maine) is classified as an ozone nonattainment area. The second program, initiated by the Ozone Transport Commission, requires sources to hold adequate nitrogen oxides (NOx) allowances for their actual emissions during the ozone season (i.e., May through September). This program is based on the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the Northeast States (except Virginia and Massachusetts) for a strategy to reduce NOx emissions during the summertime. This initiative is commonly referred to as the NOx Budget Program or the Regional Model Rule. The States in the Northeast will each implement the program through their regulations; many are currently drafting rules and determining NOx allocations for affected sources.",,"Air pollution control; Laws and legislation; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone layer; Nonattainment areas; Industrial emissions",Conference Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031342915

The aim of the station is to obtain more information on air quality as influenced by the Kola industrial areas and the effects on photosynthesis in subarctic climate. The diurnal and annual characteristics and correlations of measured species and their profiles were analyzed. Trace gas (SO2, O3, CO2) and particle concentrations, profiles and weather characteristics were measured continuously, and CO2 exchange of pine twigs was measured during summer periods using an automatic cuvette system. Practically, no local sources of pollutants existed in Varrio, however regularly occurring episodes of sulphur dioxide were observed during northeasterly winds. These events were presumed to be caused by transport from the Kola industrial areas. Some of the pollutant sources were located less than 200 km away from Varrio. Trajectories related to some typical pollution conditions are presented. Single episodes of SO2 and aerosols usually occurred simultaneously, but not always. Mean SO2 concentrations were lower during summer due to more effective deposition of SO2, sulfur dioxide conversion into sulfate and vertical mixing of air. The mean aerosol concentrations were higher during the summer than during the winter. An annual and a weak diurnal cycle were observed in ozone concentrations. The ozone concentrations in Varrio were not strongly dependent on the wind direction, and signs of long-range transport could not be clearly seen. Profile measurements of gases and particles showed the deposition to and emission from plants and soil. The carbon dioxide gradient was quite strong during the summer, which was related to the photosynthetic activity of the plants. A gradient in the ozone concentrations was also observed. The dependency of CO2 exchange on irradiation was clear.The trace gas and aerosol concentrations, profiles and weather characteristics were analyzed at Varrio environmental research station in Finland and CO2 exchange of pine twigs were measured during summer periods using an automatic cuvette system.

Δ9D, ribonucleotide reductase, and methane monooxygenase have substantial similarities in their amino acid primary sequences and the physical properties of their diiron centers. These three enzymes also appear to share common features of their reaction cycles, including the binding of O2 to the diferrous state and the subsequent generation of transient diferric-peroxo and diferryl species. In order to investigate the coordination environment of the proposed diferric-peroxo intermediate, we have studied the binding of azide to the diiron center of Δ9D using optical, resonance Raman (RR), and transient kinetic spectroscopic methods. The addition of azide results in the appearance of new absorption bands at 325 nm and 440 nm (k(app) ≃ 3.5 s-1 in 0.7 M NaN3, pH 7.8). RR experiments demonstrate the existence of two different adducts; an η1-terminal structure at pH 7.8 (14N3- asymmetric stretch at 2073 cm-1, resolved into two bands with 15N 14N2-) and a μ-1,3 bridging structure at pH &lt; 7 (14N3- asymmetric stretch at 2100 cm-1, shifted as a single band with 15N 14N2-). Both adducts also exhibit an Fe-N3 stretching mode at ≃ 380 cm-1 but no accompanying Fe-O-Fe stretching mode, presumably due to either protonation or loss of the oxo bridge. The ability to form a μ-1,3 bridging azide supports the likelihood of a μ-1,2 bridging peroxide as a catalytic intermediate in the Δ9D reaction cycle and underscores the adaptability of binuclear sites to different bridging geometries.","Diferric-peroxo adduct; Diiron-oxo-enzyme; Enzyme reaction mechanism; Fatty acid desaturase; O2 activation","acyl coenzyme a desaturase; azide; oxygen; amino acid sequence; article; catalysis; enzyme active site; enzyme activity; fatty acid metabolism; priority journal; protein analysis; protein structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030971147

Since the main products of cellular metabolism are lactic acid and carbon dioxide, this instrument affords an indirect but sensitive measure of cellular metabolism. We previously described the use of the instrument with primary neuronal cultures (Raley-Susman, K.M., Miller, K.R., Owicki, J.C. and Sapolsky, R.M., Effects of excitotoxin exposure on metabolic rate of primary hippocampal cultures: application of silicon microphysiometer to neurobiology, J. Neurosci., 12 (1992) 773-780). In the present report, we adapt the instrument for the indirect measurement of metabolism in tissue slices. In initial studies, we demonstrate stable measures of metabolism with low background noise in hippocampal slices. In addition, measures were relatively insensitive to slice thickness, preparation time or the possible contribution of contaminating bacteria. We then demonstrate the ability to detect metabolic correlates of selective vulnerability in individual hippocampal cell fields. Specifically, we observe a metabolic response to kainic acid that was selective for CA3-derived tissue, and a response to cyanide that was selective for CA1-derived tissue. This corresponds to the well-known vulnerability of CA3 and CA1 to excitotoxic and ischemic insults, respectively. Finally, we show that glucocorticoids, stress-sensitive steroid hormones which are known to exacerbate the toxicity in kainic acid in CA3 neurons, exacerbate the metabolic effects of this excitotoxin as well; in this case, the steroid manipulation was carried out in rats prior to killing. Thus, this instrument represents a complement to more traditional approaches for assessing metabolism in specific brain regions and it can potentially be used for a broad variety of studies with animals of differing ages and pre-mortem manipulations.","hippocampal slice; metabolism; microphysiometry; neurotoxicity; selective neuronal vulnerability","glucocorticoid; kainic acid; adrenalectomy; animal tissue; article; brain metabolism; brain slice; controlled study; female; hippocampus; male; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; ph; priority journal; rat; Animals; Cyanides; Drug Synergism; Equipment Design; Female; Glucocorticoids; Hippocampus; Kainic Acid; Male; Neurons; Physiology; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Silicon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031000947

These programs were designed to provide actual data as a basis for better estimating impacts of vinyl chloride emitted from the landfills on the surrounding environment. Dispersion modelling was conducted to replicate vinyl chloride levels measured during the sampling programs. This was accomplished by using the vinyl chloride emission rates determined by the U.S. EPA's Landfill Air Emissions Estimation Model and modelling the same meteorological conditions and sampling locations recorded during the monitoring program. This emissions model is known to produce conservative estimates of gas emissions from landfills. Predicted vinyl chloride levels were generally much higher than the measured values at both landfill sites. Based on statistical comparisons of the data sets, it was found that predicted vinyl chloride levels were 4 and 51 times higher than levels measured at the Eastview and Britannia Landfill sites, respectively. These reduction factors were applied to the emission rates estimated by the emissions model and the predicted impacts were re-assessed. These reduction factors ensure a more realistic prediction of vinyl chloride levels but still ensure that the predicted levels were generally higher than the measured levels. The air quality impact, when generated using the adjusted model, indicated no need for mitigation measures such as landfill gas collection and destruction.",,"Air quality; Chlorine compounds; Dispersions; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Land fill; Mathematical models; Meteorological problems; Air dispersion model; Landfill air emission estimation model; Vinyl chloride; Air pollution",Conference Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031387354

Only a few prospective, randomized clinical trials have been performed to evaluate the potential preventive effects of dietary fiber or calcium in patients with an increased risk for the development or recurrence of colorectal cancer. We designed and conducted a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial involving supplementation of fiber and calcium intake and measurements of [3H]thymidine labeling index (LI) percentages in rectal mucosal biopsies obtained from patients with resected colorectal adenomas to examine the potential mechanisms by which dietary interventions might reduce colorectal cancer risk. We performed a randomized, double-blinded, Phase II study, using a factorial design to measure the effects of supplemental dietary wheat bran fiber (2.0 or 13.5 g/day) and calcium carbonate (250 or 1500 mg/day elemental calcium) supplementation on [3H]thymidine LI percentages in rectal mucosal crypts and 24.h in vitro outgrowth cultures. Measurements were made at baseline randomization (ie., after a 3-month placebo run-in period using 2.0 g of wheat bran fiber plus 250 mg of calcium carbonate) and after 3 and 9 months on treatment in 100 randomized participants who had a history of colon adenoma resection. Neither the wheat bran fiber nor the calcium carbonate supplements significantly reduced [3H]thymidine LI percentages in rectal mucosal crypts (total or compartmental analysis) or 24-h in vitro outgrowth cultures at either 3 or 9 months of daily supplementation in the 93 evaluable participants. We conclude that 9 months of high-dose wheat bran fiber and calcium carbonate supplementation in study participants with a history of recently resected colorectal adenomas does not have a significant effect on cellular proliferation rates in rectal mucosal biopsies, comparing 3- and 9- month results to baseline results. Ultimately, there is great need for the evaluation of these two different nutrient interventions in the setting of Phase III studies wherein adenomatous polyp recurrence, rather than a rectal mucosal biomarker, serves as the primary end point.",,"calcium carbonate; abdominal pain; adenomatous polyp; adult; aged; article; calcium intake; cell proliferation; clinical trial; diarrhea; diet supplementation; dose response; double blind procedure; female; human; human cell; human tissue; major clinical study; male; nausea; phase 2 clinical trial; priority journal; rectum mucosa; wheat bran; Adenomatous Polyps; Aged; Calcium Carbonate; Calcium, Dietary; Cell Division; Cells, Cultured; Colonic Polyps; Dietary Fiber; Double-Blind Method; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Intestinal Mucosa; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Placebos; Prospective Studies; Rectal Neoplasms; Rectum; Risk Factors; Thymidine; Tritium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16944365473

In Nicaragua the feasibility of attacking this problem was studied at one of its roots, the demand for and consumption of firewood, through a massive fuel switch towards kerosene. A locally-based foundation distributed 700 high-quality Chinese kerosene stoves, using a credit scheme, both in a village and in a suburb of the capital. Surveys of family fuel consumption for meal preparation were carried out before the intervention and again, one year later, after the intervention. The population's acceptance of the stoves was very high. Proof of this is evident in such factors as (1) the high percentage of delivery of the stoves to 93% and 73%, respectively, of the population that uses firewood or charcoal; (2) the highly enthusiastic reactions elicited from the people during visits by the Foundation's workers; (3) the high usage rate of the stoves (80%); and (4) the overall decrease of 50% in the use of firewood for the involved area. This article is centered around the extent of coverage, social acceptance and community behavior, and the local capacity to perform this fuel switch, while themes related to energy efficiency, energy policy, the greenhouse effect and financial implications are incorporated to indicate the national and international impact of this strategy. Offering an alternative source of fuel to the population is a feasible, cheap and highly appreciated solution to deforestation. Projects using these methods could potentially lower firewood consumption at the national level by 50%. Local organizations are capable of implementing this strategy on a wide scale. The economically less favored classes of the population can be reached without any major constraints, leading at the same time to important positive effects on health. The cost per tonne of carbon emission avoided through this strategy is calculated at US$ 1.7, which is far below standards used in joint implementation programs. A worldwide strategy could lower the present surplus balance of CO2 emission by 13%, maintaining at the same time the natural capacity of CO2 absorption.

Permitting these facilities can be challenging due to the amount of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), among other pollutants, emitted from wood furnish dryers. VOC emissions from particle dryers are generated in the combustion process and through the heating of the wood particles. Naturally occurring organics in the wood such as tars, resins, fatty acids, and terpenes, are volatilized when exposed to the high dryer temperatures. Conventional three-pass rotary dryer design consists of three concentric cylinders, with wet furnish and furnace flue gases entering the innermost cylinder and proceeding through the outer shells. This design can actually increase VOC emissions. However, the 3PHV Rotary Drum Dryer (3PHV), manufactured by Productization Incorporated, uses a state-of-the-art design that reduces the amount of VOC, particulate, and carbon monoxide emissions generated in the drying process. As a result, add-on controls are often unnecessary. Recently, Boise Cascade Corporation's (Boise Cascade's) facility in LaGrande, Oregon, was pertained to install a 3PHV and ROEMMC sanderdust burner.

Nine periods, each lasting several decades, are known during which large quantities of herring were caught close to the shore. In the 1895-96 season, more than 200 000 tonnes were landed. During the 'interim' periods, which stretched over 50 or more years, the herring fishery played little role in the economy of this region. Several other herring fisheries in European waters overlap with recent Bohuslan periods whereas the Norwegian spring-spawning herring and some sardine, Sardina pilchardus, fisheries exhibit alternating periods. A study of the climatological/hydrographic scenario of all Bohuslan periods and those of herring in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay showed that, on a decadal scale, they coincided with times when there was a strong ice cover off Iceland, severe winters in western Europe with extremely cold air and water temperatures, a reduction of westerly winds as indicated by negative anomalies in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and a minimum of south-westerly winds over England in response to meridional migrations of the belt of westerly winds. Periods of the Norwegian spring-spawning herring and sardines in the English Channel coincided with inverse climatological/hydrographic situations.

In the region where the temperature is low enough for these products to freeze onto grains, a considerable amount of carbon and nitrogen is locked up in the ice mantle and is depleted from the gas phase in a timescale of ≲3 × 106 yr. Oxidized (CO2) ice and reduced (NH3 and hydrocarbon) ice naturally coexist in this part of the disk. The molecular abundance both in the gas phase and in the ice mantle varies significantly with the distance from the central star. © 1997. The American Astronomical Society.

Ion bombardment heating is reduced by thermionic electron emission when the macroparticle approaches the temperature region of strong evaporation. The heat loss mechanisms, thermal radiation and evaporation, increase strongly with temperature. Direct heating of the macroparticle seems to be most promising.

Sensitivity analyses concerning initial conditions, emissions, deposition, biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOC), and emission reductions were carried out. Results were compared with field measurements. Calculations showed that although ozone (O3) formation in Switzerland is mainly NOx (NO + NO2) limited, some areas seem also to be sensitive to VOC emissions. According to the calculations, reducing anthropogenic VOC emissions by 20-80% would lead to a decrease of 5-25% in O3 levels in a few regions, whereas the calculated decrease in O3 concentrations by NOx emission reductions was 6-38% and is expected to be effective over a larger area. Impacts of emission reductions on other species, such as peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), nitric acid (HNO3) and formaldehyde (HCHO) were investigated. A correlation was found between the sensitivity of O3 to emission reductions, and NOz (NOy-NOx, where NOy = NOx + PAN + HNO3 + other nitrates) at the time of peak O3. VOC controls seem to be effective only at NOz concentrations higher than about 2 ppb, whereas NOx controls are effective also below this range. Exclusion of biogenic VOC decreased the calculated O3 concentrations by only 5% in certain regions. PAN and H2O2 concentrations, however, decreased significantly. Differences and similarities between the results of this study and those of a multi-parcel Lagrangian model are discussed, and criteria are outlined to decide on the choice for specific problems.","Biogenic VOC; Emission reduction; Lagrangian model; Ozone; UAM","Computational methods; Formaldehyde; Gas emissions; Hydrogen peroxide; Mathematical models; Nitrates; Nitric acid; Ozone; Sensitivity analysis; Volatile organic compounds; Multiparcel Lagrangian model; Peroxyacetyl nitrates; Urban airshed model (UAM); Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031346566

The aggregation rules are shown to estimate parameters which give area-average surface fluxes similar to those calculated, with explicit representation of forest and pasture patches for a range of meteorological and surface conditions relevant to this site, but the agreement deteriorates somewhat when there are large patch-to-patch differences in soil moisture. The aggregation rules, validated as above, are then applied to a remotely sensed 1 km land-cover data set to obtain grid-average values of BATS vegetation parameters for 2.8° x 2.8° and 1° x 1° grids within the conterminous United States. There are significant differences in key vegetation parameters (aerodynamic roughness length, albedo, leaf-area index, and stomatal resistance) when aggregate parameters are compared with parameters for the single, dominant cover within the grid. However, the surface energy fluxes calculated by stand-alone BATS with the 2-year forcing data from the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Programme CD-ROM are reasonably similar using aggregate-vegetation parameters and dominant-cover parameters, but there are some significant differences, particularly in the western USA.","Aggregation rules; Boundary-layer model; Mixed vegetation; Surface fluxes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0003199287

Further, application to the south-eastern Iberian Peninsula, one of the regions of the western Mediterranean basin in which advanced social structures first appeared, is reported. Currently there is a strong debate about when irrigation practices started in this region. It has been argued, on the basis of scattered, indirect evidence, that irrigation was already practiced during the Bronze Age (from 4400 BP). However, this remains to be confirmed. Kernels of durum wheat, hulled and naked barley and faba bean grains from a set of archaeological sites in the south-eastern Iberian Peninsula were analysed. Samples ranged from late Neolithic (about 6500 BP) to the Iron Age (2400 BP). None of the results, apart from those of the faba bean, support the existence of irrigation practices during this period. Grains of faba bean showed consistently high values of A at all the archaeological sites studied. This could reflect not only growth habit, faba beans being less determined plants than cereals, but also selective irrigation of faba bean crops. © 1997 Academic Press Limited.","Ancient agriculture; Barley; Carbon isotope discrimination; Faba bean; Irrigation; Spain; Wheat","agricultural history; archaeological evidence; carbon isotope discrimination; historical study; irrigation system; Mediterranean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031466679

The influence of the oxide loading on the surface structure and dispersity of MoO3/SiO2 and V2O5/SiO2 catalysts has been assessed. CH4-TPR measurements indicate that the activity-selectivity pattern of oxide catalysts in MPO (A. Parmaliana and F. Arena, 1997, J.

The nature of the support as well as the level of the oxide loading affect the ""reactivity"" of lattice oxygen of supported systems determining their catalytic behaviour in MPO. The most effective reaction mechanism leading to the primary formation of HCHO implies the direct participation of gas-phase oxygen, while the involvement of bulk-lattice oxygen ions in the process of product formation mainly leads to COx.

Previous investigations indicated that, east of the Andes, the middle and high latitudes of South America warmed uniformly and rapidly from 13 000 14C yr BP, with no indication of subsequent climate fluctuations, equivalent, for example, to the Younger Dryas cooling. Here we present a multiproxy continuous record, radiocarbon dated by accelerated mass spectroscopy, from proglacial Lake Mascardi in Argentina. The results show that unstable climatic conditions, comparable to those described from records obtained in the Northern Hemisphere, dominated the Late-glacial-Holocene transition in Argentina at this latitude. Furthermore, a significant advance of the Tronador ice-cap, which feeds Lake Mascardi, occurred during the Younger Dryas Chronozone. This instability suggests a step-wise climatic history reflecting a global, rather than regional, forcing mechanism. The Lake Mascardi record, therefore, provides strong support for the hypothesis that ocean-atmosphere interaction, rather than global ocean circulation alone, governed interhemispheric climate teleconnections during the last deglaciation. © 1997 by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Late-glacial-Holocene transition, northern Patagonia; Multiproxy climate records; Proglacial lakes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001761366

Root competition can be an important determinant of the performance of neighbours within plant populations and communities. Because plants often maintain larger root systems and allocate more of their carbon to root systems under elevated atmospheric CO2 than they do at lower CO2 concentrations, root-root interactions could play an increasingly important role in determining competitive outcomes among individuals and plant species as global CO2 concentration continues to rise. 2. We established 12 pure stands of Linum usitatissimum (flax) and 12 mixed stands of Linum and its naturally co-occurring weed species Silene cretica in opaque plastic trays each filled with the same amount of nutrient-rich soil mix. In half of the trays from each of these stand types, vertical waterproof partitions separated the root systems of individual plants from each other to prevent root competition, while in the other half no partitions were present. Half of the trays from all treatments were allowed to grow under low atmospheric CO2 concentration (320 μl l-1) and the other half under elevated CO2 (600 μl l-1), in daylight growth chambers for 30 days from seedling emergence until harvest in mid-June. All trays received equal amounts of water so that soils in the low CO2 treatment were maintained at field capacity. 3. Our results indicate that under high soil fertilities: (1) intra-specific root-root interactions alone play a relatively insignificant role in determining plant biomass production within pure Linum populations and (2) the impact of an aggressive species (Silene) on co-occurring less aggressive species (Linum) becomes more severe under elevated CO2 as a result of amplified interspecific root competition.","Below-ground interactions; CO2 enrichment; plant communities; plant populations; root allocation","Linum usitatissimum; Silene cretica; Caryophyllaceae; Linaceae; Linum usitatissimum; Silene cretica; carbon dioxide enrichment; flax; root competition; seedling growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030620358

In this method, technical options are compared using a measure made up from the ""private costs"" of owning and operating a power station together with the ""external costs"" representing its environmental impact. The method is tested on three types of power generation plant, each of which incorporates CO2 capture and sequestration technology - these include natural gas-fired and coal-fired power plant, as well as CO2 storage in a disused gas field, in the deep ocean or in an off-set forest. Emissions arising from all stages of the fuel cycle are estimated - from extraction of fossil fuel through to dispatch of power to the grid. All types of emission and their impact at local, regional and global level are assessed and valuation of these impacts is attempted. Previous work in this field has concentrated on local impacts, such as occupational health, and regional impacts, such as ""acid rain"". This study is one of the first to include a comprehensive assessment of global warming impacts, how these will vary with time as well as geographically, including allowance for any potential benefits.

The ASCA observation has revealed that the X-ray emission consists of two components. One is a soft X-ray emission characterized by thin thermal model with kT = 0.76+0.05-0.10 keV and a metal abundance of 0.08 ± 0.04 solar. Since the soft X-rays are extended and the centroid is located at the region between NGC 7318 and NGC 7319, thin thermal emission originates from diffuse hot gas filling the Quintet. The total mass of hot gas is about 2 × 1010M(Fisheye), which is only 10% of the galaxy mass. The low metal abundance indicates that most of the hot gas consist of primordial gas. The binding mass is about 6 × 1012M(Fisheye). The baryonic fraction is about 10%. The other component is hard X-ray emission located at NGC 7319, a Seyfert 2 galaxy. The X-ray spectrum is well fitted by the absorbed-power law emission plus a line. The photon index is 0.8+0.8-1.1, and the absorption column is about 1023 cm-2. The X-ray luminosity in the 2-10 keV band is about 1.7 × 1042 erg s-1. These characteristics are consistent with those of Seyfert 2 galaxies. We have revealed an obscured nucleus in NGC 7319.

Furthermore, many on-board diagnostic algorithms do not perform well during transient operation and are often temporarily disabled to avoid problems. The inability to quickly and repeatedly test engines during transient conditions in a laboratory setting limits researchers and development engineers ability to produce more effective and robust algorithms to lower vehicle emissions. To meet this need, members of the Powertrain Control Research Laboratory (PCRL) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have developed a high-bandwidth, hydrostatic dynamometer system that will enable researchers to explore transient characteristics of engines and powertrains in the laboratory. Unlike most conventional dynamometers that typically operate under relatively steady state operation, this device is capable of providing a repeatable virtual transient engine load on engines under test during motoring as well as absorbing conditions. In this paper the authors review the hardware design considerations for hydrostatic dynamometers and describe in detail the components used in the current system. The dynamometer performance is then illustrated with test results.

A GIS-based modeling approach can provide emissions estimates for both on-network and off-network vehicle activities on a modal basis (as a function of various vehicle operating modes that significantly affect vehicle emission rates). An entire metropolitan region can be modeled on a zone, link, and point basis. Vehicle subfleet composition can be tracked or estimated and combined with estimates of vehicle activity and characteristic operating modes to provide emissions estimates in a spatial and temporal context. Emissions from various modal activities are aggregated into grid cells to be used as input to an airshed model. Identifying spatial and temporal distributions of these activities adds to a greater understanding of emissions impacts. A research prototype of this modeling concept was produced to illustrate its capabilities and identify difficulties that must be addressed in the development of a fully functional model.

This provides a basis for the conceptual, large-scale understanding of hydrocarbon generation, migration and accumulation in a basin, which, in turn, could be used as a tool for better-targeted, local-scale exploration and discovery of hydrocarbons. The approach is exemplified for the mature Alberta and Williston basins in Canada and U.S., and the developing Llanos basin in Colombia. Hydrocarbon migration and accumulations in the Alberta basin, including huge tar sands deposits, and in the Williston basin, were controlled by stratigraphy and structure, and by several flow systems driven by different mechanisms. Low rock permeability led to incomplete flushing of the original formation waters, and a conduction-dominated geothermal regime. The Llanos basin is characterized by high rock-permeability, being probably flushed of the original formation waters. The geothermal regime is controlled by both conduction and convection. Hydrocarbons migrated updip and have been flushed out of the basin unless caught in stratigraphic, structural or hydrodynamic traps. © 1998 The Executive Board of the World Petroleum Congress.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057775093

Fertilizer Development Centre, Javier Barrios Amorín 870, Montevideo, Uruguay","The vulnerability of the agricultural sector in any region to future possible climate-change scenarios is determined to a great extent by the vulnerability of the sector to current climatic, economic and policy scenarios. Agricultural systems which are currently subject to extreme climatic interannual variability (drought, flood, storms, etc.) are likely to become even more vulnerable under the most commonly expected scenarios of climate change (i.e. increased temperatures, increased rainfall variability). Similarly, agricultural systems which are currently subject to drastic changes in economic and policy scenarios are also prone to become more vulnerable under expected climate-change conditions. The agricultural sector of Latin America has been subject to important variations in economical conditions and policies. These conditions have affected the structure of agricultural production, and resulted in a large reduction of the number of small farmers, who have migrated to poor metropolitan areas. Even for larger, commercial farmers, unstable and often inconsistent agricultural policies have increased the vulnerability of the sector. Additionally, large areas of Latin America are already affected by current interannual climatic variability related to the length of rainy seasons and the occurrence of extreme events (droughts, floods, etc.). The few studies conducted in the region to specifically assess the impact of climate change on agriculture have revealed expected reductions and increased variability in crop productivity. Similar results should be expected in the vast regions devoted to livestock production, since the systems are based on a fragile balance of nutrients, available water, stocking rates and pasture species. The characteristics of the current situation described in this article demonstrate the vulnerability of Latin American agriculture to climate change. Preparing the agricultural sector to mitigate the potential negative effects of climate change will require strong and consistent efforts in both the scientific and policy sectors of the region.","Agriculture; Climate change; Economics; Latin america; Policy; Vulnerability","agricultural production; agriculture; climate change; developing region; economics; global environmental change; nature-society relations; policy; vulnerability assessment; Latin America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031393987

Renewable fuels may also substantially reduce contributions to global climate change. In the transportation sector, ethanol produced from biomass shows promise as a future fuel for spark-ignited engines because of its high octane quality. Ethanol, however, is not a high-quality compression-ignition fuel. Ethanol can be easily converted through a dehydration process to produce diethyl ether (DEE), which is an excellent compression-ignition fuel with higher energy density than ethanol. DEE has long been known as a cold-start aid for engines, but little is known about using DEE as a significant component in a blend or as a complete replacement for diesel fuel. Dimethyl ether, the methanol analog to DEE, was recently reported to be a low-emission, high-quality diesel fuel replacement, but similar engine testing and process information on DEE is limited. To identify the potential of DEE as a transportation fuel, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of its utilization in engines and also conducted limited laboratory experiments.

A welcomed discovery in the past decade is the occurrence of artesian thermal groundwaters at Mukhebeh in the lower Yarmouk valley, which produce over 40 x 106 m3 year-1 of fresh water. The principal resources occur in the upper B2 Formation (Campanian), a limestone overlain by confining marls of the B3 Formation (Maastrichtian). Additional resources are found near by along the eastern Jordan Rift Valley (JRV), in the underlying A7 limestone (Turonian). Groundwaters in the Mukhebeh (B2) wells are low salinity (500 mg l-1 TDS) Ca(Mg)-HCO3 waters with elevated HS- attributed to sulphate reduction driven by oxidation of aquifer-derived organic matter. The JRV (A7) groundwaters are similar to the B2 waters with the exception of higher Mg2+ and HCO3/- attributed to dolomite dissolution and sulphate reduction. Groundwaters from JRVI and the Maqla spring at Mukhebeh are NaCl waters with a strong Ca(Mg)-HCO3 facies (900 to 1000 mg l-1 TDS). The elevated temperatures of all groundwaters (30 to 54°C) can be attributed to heating along a local geothermal gradient of 2.5°C per 100 m. Departures from this gradient are due to vertical flow in fault zones and possibly to the local influence of an intrusion (MK-7). All groundwaters are characterized by a late Holocene (modern) stable isotope signature. Ground-waters from the high yielding upper B2 aquifer (MK wells) have a δ18O/δ2H composition demonstrating recharge in the B2 outcrop region, near and to the east of Irbid, within the Yarmouk River basin. Conversely, the deeper A7 aquifer groundwaters (JRV wells) are recharges at a lower elevation in the rift valley margin, where incised wadis have exposed these strata. The deepest A1 to A6 strata (Maqla spring and JRVI well) contain the isotopically most depleted groundwaters. Based on comparison with precipitation and phreatic groundwaters, recharge in the highest landscape of norther Jordan is likely, although of recharge from the northern Golan region of Syria cannot be excluded. All thermal waters are essentially 3H-free. Estimates of their mean subsurface residence times have been constrained on the basis of 14C(DIC). Significant corrections have been made for 14C-dilution processes including carbonate dissolution, sulphate reduction and a tertiary process involving either incorporation of mantle CO2 or matrix exchange. All dilution processes were quantified on the basis of geochemical and 13C mass balance equations. Modelled ages show that recharge for most B2 and A7 groundwaters occurred during the late Holocene (recent to 5 ka BP).",,"chemical composition; groundwater; groundwater resources; isotopic analysis; isotopic composition; recharge; thermal water; water resources; Jordan, Yarmouk Valley, Mukhebeh; Aquifers; Arid regions; Recharging (underground waters); Thermal gradients; Artesian thermal groundwaters; Groundwater resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030615823

The topside injection facilities, the well and reservoir aspects are discussed as well as the considerations made during establishing the design basis and the solutions chosen. The CO2 injection issues in this project differs from industry practice in that the CO2 is wet and contaminated with methane, and further, because of the shallow depth, the total pressure resistance in the system is not sufficient for the CO2 to naturally stay in the dense phase region. To allow for safe and cost effective handling of the CO2, it was necessary to develop an injection system that gave a constant back pressure from the well corresponding to the output pressure from the compressor, and being independent of the injection rate. This is accomplished by selecting a high injectivity sand formation, completing the well with a large bore, and regulating the dense phase CO2 temperature and thus the density of the fluid in order to account for the variations in back pressure from the well.",,"Injection system; Sand formation; Shallow underground aquifers; Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Environmental impact; Injection (oil wells); Methane; Oil field development; Petroleum reservoirs; Pressure; Temperature control; Industrial waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030654634

There is a need to better characterize the emission rates and chemical composition of particles emitted from vehicles equipped with the latest emission reduction technology. Particle-mass emission rates were measured for four 1995 Ford vehicles driven over three different driving cycles: the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS), the Highway Fuel Economy Test (HFET), and the USO6 driving cycle. The average particle-mass emission rates were less than 10 mg/mi for any of the driving cycles. The particle-mass emission rate was least for the HFET and about equal for the UDDS and the USO6 cycles.

In particular, it has been demonstrated that the three most recent periods of low sunspot occurrence were characterized by high values of atmospheric 14C/12C. During the last millennium other periods of high 14C/12C values were observed but their solar origin is still debatable. In the present work we compare these fluctuations with an independent record of cosmogenic 10Be measured in ice from the South Pole to check the solar origin of the observed 14C/12C variations. In order to compare quantitatively the results obtained on 10Be and 14C, it is necessary to take into account the different behaviour of these two cosmogenic isotopes, and especially the damping effect of the carbon cycle in the case of 14C. As an input to a 12-box numerical model we used the relative fluctuations of the 10Be concentrations record measured in South Pole ice and converted it into a synthetic 14C record. We took into account the fact that 10Be modulation is enhanced in polar regions due to the orientation of the geomagnetic field. As expected, the fluctuations of the modelled 14C record are much smaller (a factor of 20) than those observed for the raw 10Be record. In addition, the variations are smoother and shifted in time by a few decades. The 10Be-based 14C variations closely resemble the 14C measurements obtained on tree rings (R = 0.81). In particular, it is easy to identify periods of maximal 14C/12C which correspond to solar activity minima centred at about 1060, 1320 (Wolf), 1500 (Spörer), 1690 (Maunder) and 1820 (Dalton) yr A.D. Cross-correlation calculations suggest that there is no significant lag between the 10Be-based 14C and the tree-ring 14C records. Our study strongly suggests the dominance of the solar modulation on the cosmonuclide production variations during the last millennium. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.","Be-10; C-14/C-12; Climate; Cosmogenic elements; Modern; Solar activity","atmospheric carbon; beryllium-10; carbon-14; cosmogenic nuclide; palaeoclimate; solar modulation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031417790

As a consequence of the very high sulphur content coal, which is the prime energy source, daily average concentrations of SO2 often exceed 600 μg m-3. After collating information on the existing environment, the effects of the air pollution and compiling a detailed emissions inventory, modelling techniques were used to simulate both the air quality and the economic development of Chongqing up until 2005. An economic model was also constructed to optimize the mix of control measures. The latter aspect was especially important to this study, given the need to produce a least cost strategy. Using this work as a case study, this paper seeks to show how a solution to an air quality management problem can be found by close collaboration between two groups and also the value of close collaboration between specialists with different skills throughout the life of a project such as this. The integration of economics and technical aspects of air pollution is especially pertinent in this respect. Optimizing the control strategy with respect to costs and benefits also has implications for the sustainability of economic development in Chongqing.",,"Air quality; Computer simulation; Cost effectiveness; Economics; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Optimization; Strategic planning; Sulfur dioxide; Sustainable economic development; Air pollution control",Conference Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031358805

Live clams occurred only in sediment where sulfide was detectable. Sulfide was not detected in the absence of vesicomyid clams. The relative abundances of five vesicomyid species varied greatly among seeps. C. kilmeri accounted for 85-99% of all vesicomyids at seeps with high sulfide content, and C. pacifica dominated (73%) seeps with low sulfide levels. These species were also partially segregated along sulfide gradients from the center to the margin of seeps, analogous to zonation of rocky intertidal communities. We hypothesize that the absence of thiotrophic or methanotrophic mytilid mussels from Monterey Bay cold seeps is related to the lack of physiological specializations for concentrating reduced sulfur compounds or methane and the absence of hypersaline brines that could extend the persistence of methane or sulfide-rich fluids very near the sea floor.",,"Bivalvia; Calyptogena kilmeri; Mytilidae; Vesicomya pacifica; Vesicomyidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030766857

Because alpha emissions can only be detected over a short range in water (approximately 40 micrometers), the conventional approach is to collect samples for processing in a central laboratory; a time-consuming and costly procedure ensures to separate and measure the radionuclides. Because of the sporadic nature of sampling processes, there is the possibility that a release may go undetected. We are addressing this issue by developing a real-time, field-deployable instrument. This device incorporates a proprietary film that selectively binds radionuclides from dilute aqueous samples. By combining the film with an appropriate alpha spectrometer, we have developed a fieldable system that can operate as an autonomous monitor in a batch or continuous manner. Laboratory results to date have been encouraging. Positive identification of uranium and plutonium has been made by resolving the energy spectrum of emitted alphas.

Stochastic downscaling is related to synoptic climatology, weather-typing approaches (classifying circulation patterns) such as the Lamb Weather Types developed for the United Kingdom (UK), the European Grosswetterlagen and the Perfect Prognosis (Perfect Frog) method from numerical weather prediction. The large-scale atmospheric circulation is linked with site-specific observations of atmospheric variables, such as precipitation, wind speed or temperature, within a specified region. Classifying each day by circulation patterns is achieved by clustering algorithms, fuzzy rule bases, neural nets or decision trees. The linkages are extended to GCM output to account for climate change. Stochastic models are developed from the probability distributions for extreme events. Objective analysis can be used to interpolate values of these models to other locations. The concepts and some applications are reviewed to provide a basis for extending the downscaling approach to assessing the integrated risk of the six air issues: climate change, UV-B radiation, acid rain, transport of hazardous air pollutants, smog and suspended particulates.","Atmospheric stress; Climate; Downscaling; Spatial interpolation","rain; acid rain; air pollution; algorithm; climate; conference paper; decision making; decision theory; pollution transport; probability; risk; smog; stochastic model; ultraviolet b radiation; united kingdom; weather; wind; Anura; Acid rain; Air pollution; Algorithms; Atmospheric movements; Climatology; Decision theory; Environmental impact; Fuzzy sets; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Probability; Weather forecasting; Clustering algorithms; General circulation models (GCM); Smog; Climate change; atmospheric pollution; climate change; downscaling; GCM; integrated modelling; stochastic analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030609239

Fraction of biomass allocated to active line roots as well as total N (NH4/+ + NO3/-) absorption per unit root dry mass were unaffected by CO2. On a whole-plant basis, elevated CO2 led to a significant increase in N acquisition in loblolly but not in ponderosa pine. However, even in loblolly pine where CO2 significantly increased plant N acquisition, the relative increase, in biomass far exceeded the gain in N, i.e. a 60% increase in total dry weight was accompanied by only a 30% increase in N gain in response to high CO2. We suggest that the commonly reported decline in tissue N concentration of these and other species at high CO2 is largely caused by inability of the root systems to sufficiently compensate for increased N demand. Elevated CO2 significantly altered root uptake capacity of the different N forms, i.e., high CO2 significantly increased NO3/- absorption rates, but decreased NH4/+ absorption rates in both species though the decrease in loblolly was insignificant. However, elevated CO2 increased root respiration rate in loblolly pine while significantly decreasing it in ponderosa pine. This indicates that CO2-induced changes in plant preference for inorganic N forms is not simply regulated by root energy status. If changes in plant preference for inorganic N forms represent typical responses to elevated CO2, the results could have important implications for N dynamics in managed and natural plant communities.","Elevated CO2; Loblolly pine; Ponderosa pine; Root nitrogen uptake rate; Root respiration","carbon dioxide enrichment; loblolly pine; nitrogen uptake; ponderosa pine; Pinaceae; Pinus ponderosa; Pinus taeda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030613468

Utilities in sensitive areas such as the Ozone Transport Region (OTR), or others which may be affected by the activities of the Ozone Transport Assessment Group (OTAG) may face still lower limits than the current Title IV, Phase II regulations. Effective compliance strategy development must take into account baseline NO x emissions, actual or future regulatory limits, emissions averaging and bubbling schemes, unit capacity factors and economic parameters, as well as the potential of various NO x control techniques under consideration. Stone &amp; Webster has developed and used the NO xCOMP technical/economic computer model to aid utilities in determining the least-cost, least-risk strategy for compliance with the NO x provisions of the CAAA. Designed specifically to be used throughout the implementation of a NO x compliance program, NO xCOMP can be updated with post-modification data. By inputting actual cost and emissions performance information, the impact to the utility compliance program can be determined and the strategy adjusted accordingly. Better, or worse than expected, performance can be evaluated based on overall compliance cost. NO xCOMP uses input directly from the major load forecasting programs such as ENPRO and PROMOD, and when combined with the actual NO x vs. load profile for each boiler, develops projections of baseline annual NO x emissions. Least-cost compliance plans are determined by evaluating all applicable technologies to each unit, allowing marginal costs to be generated.

Low Emission Vehicles, or LEVs, are designed to meet significantly stricter HC, CO and NOx standards than vehicles sold in the remainder of the U.S., and are designed to operate on a strictly controlled reformulated fuel to achieve low emissions over the vehicle's lifetime. One of the characteristics of this fuel is a low sulfur content, which averages 30-40 ppm or less. Data provided by the Auto Oil Air Quality Research Program and other studies were instrumental in the development of the low emission properties of this fuel, and vehicle manufacturers now use this fuel in the development, calibration, and certification process for Low Emission Vehicles sold in California. Such vehicles may also be introduced federally through a national low emission vehicle program or by individual states adopting the California program, but there is concern that the low emission benefits obtained in California may not be achieved federally because of the variability in fuel properties, including sulfur content, which may be present in concentrations as high as 1000 ppm. This has caused increased interest on the impact of sulfur on the performance of automotive catalysts, particularly catalyst systems which will be used in Low Emission Vehicles. The impact of sulfur on catalyst oxygen storage is also of interest, due to the requirement of an on-board catalyst performance diagnostic which uses the loss of catalyst oxygen storage as an indicator of catalyst deterioration. This paper will review both laboratory and vehicle studies performed at GM and elsewhere which focus on the impact of sulfur on the performance and oxygen storage capacity of catalyst systems which are anticipated to be used in low emissions vehicles, and notably catalysts which incorporate palladium, and compare the magnitude of these impacts to those observed on earlier generation automotive catalyst systems. This paper will also review how these observations are consistent with conclusions obtained from fundamental studies of the interaction between sulfur-containing gas species in vehicle exhaust and the catalytic and oxygen storage sites in the catalyst. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

One hundred seventy-six peptide segments of a length of 15 residues, overlapping by 13 residues and covering the complete sequences of AK1 and GK3, were synthesized in order to evaluate their secondary structure composition by CD spectroscopy. The peptides were prepared by solid phase multiple peptide synthesis method using the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl/tert-butyl strategy. The individual peptide secondary structures were studied with CD spectroscopy in a mixture of 30% trifluoroethanol in phosphate buffer (pH 7) and subsequently compared with x-ray data of AK1 and GK3. Peptide segments that cover α-helical regions of the AK1 or GK3 sequence mainly showed CD spectra with increasing and decreasing Cotton effects that were typical for appearing and disappearing α-helical structures. For segments with dominating β-sheet conformation, however, the application of this method is limited due to the stability and clustering of β-sheet segments in solution and due to the difficult interpretation of random-coiled superimposed β-sheet CD signals. Nevertheless, the results of this method especially for α-helical segments are very impressive. All α-helical and 71 % of the β-sheet containing regions of the AK1 and GK3 could be identified. Moreover, it was shown that CD spectra of consecutive peptide content reveal the appearance and disappearance of α-helical secondary structure elements and help localizing them on the sequence string. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",,"Biosynthesis; Enzymes; Polypeptides; Spectroscopic analysis; Porcine adenylate kinase; Yeast guanylate kinase; Proteins; adenylate kinase; guanylate kinase; animal cell; article; circular dichroism; enzyme structure; nonhuman; peptide synthesis; prediction; protein secondary structure; structure analysis; swine; yeast; Adenylate Kinase; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Circular Dichroism; Evolution, Molecular; Guanylate Kinase; Molecular Sequence Data; Nucleoside-Phosphate Kinase; Peptide Mapping; Peptides; Protein Folding; Protein Structure, Secondary; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031080856

We report on the spatial X-ray fine structure. Regions of enhanced X-ray emission, more than two orders of magnitude fainter than previously reported X-ray bright points, are loosely associated with bipolar regions in the magnetic network. The power spectrum of quiet X-ray images at small spatial scales is similar to that of active regions, but exhibits a kink at a scale of ≈ 25,000 km, possibly connected to the supergranular structure. The spatial X-ray structures in the time averaged image amount to an rms amplitude which is 6% of the mean value. The X-ray structures correlate with contemporaneous radio maps obtained by the VLA at wavelengths of 1.3, 2.0, and 3.6 cm. The amplitude of the brightness variations in the images increases with radio wavelength, i.e., with increasing height. The cross-correlation coefficient with the absolute magnetic field strength, however, generally decreases with height, consistent with the idea of bipolar regions in the network and of the magnetic field deviating from vertical in the upper chromosphere. The X-ray observations require an enhanced pressure in the corona above the magnetic network, but suggest similar temperatures. Model calculations show that, under a constant temperature, an rms density increase (relative to that in the cell interior) ranging from about 20% in the chromosphere to 60% in the low corona is sufficient to explain the observed standard deviations due to the spatial structures in radio waves and soft X-rays, respectively.","Sun: corona; chromosphere; transition region; Sun: X-rays; radio radiation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000684584

These materials have a number of properties that make them good candidates for such applications-for example, emission bands that are displaced (via a Stokes shift) from absorption bands, and the ease with which the emitting species can be embedded in a suitable host material. But despite these advantages, the threshold power densities required for light amplification that have been reported so far have been high.

Two of the largest power plants, accounting for 20 percent of the state's CO2 emissions, have adequate reservoir volumes within 50-100 miles to allow CO2 disposal for 30 years or more. However, the majority of these fields are still producing and will not be sufficiently depleted and ready for CO2 injection for 10 years or more. Oil reservoirs are economically preferred to gas reservoirs since operators are willing to buy the CO2 for enhanced oil recovery. For retrofit to existing power plants, estimated costs are $50-$65/ton CO2 for disposal in nearby gas reservoirs and $40-$55/ton CO2 for disposal in oil reservoirs. For advanced technologies in future power plants estimated costs are $15-$25/ton CO2 for disposal in gas reservoirs, and $5-$15/ton CO2 for disposal in oil reservoirs. Avoided costs are approximately 50 % higher. Comparative cost differences between power plants using coal or natural gas are discussed.

Biol., Biological Laboratories, 16 Divinity Avenue, Cambridge, MA 02138, United States","The response of temperate forest ecosystems to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations is important because these ecosystems represent a significant component of the global carbon cycle. Two important but not well understood processes which elevated CO2 may substantially alter in these systems are regeneration and nitrogen cycling. If elevated CO2 leads to changes in species composition in regenerating forest communities then the structure and function of these ecosystems may be affected. In most temperate forests, nitrogen appears to be a limiting nutrient. If elevated CO2 leads to reductions in nitrogen cycling through increased sequestration of nitrogen in plant biomass or reductions in mineralization rates, long-term forest productivity may be constrained. To study these processes, we established mesocosms of regenerating forest communities in controlled environments maintained at either ambient (375 ppm) or elevated (700 ppm) CO2 concentrations. Mesocosms were constructed from intact monoliths of organic forest soil. We maintained these mesocosms for 2 years without any external inputs of nitrogen and allowed the plants naturally present as seeds and rhizomes to regenerate. We used 15N pool dilution techniques to quantify nitrogen fluxes within the mesocosms at the end of the 2 years. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration significantly affected a number of plant and soil processes in the experimental regenerating forest mesocosms. These changes included increases in total plant biomass production, plant C/N ratios, ectomycorrhizal colonization of tree fine roots, changes in tree fine root architecture, and decreases in plant NH4/+ uptake rates, gross NH4/+ mineralization rates, and gross NH4/+ consumption rates. In addition, there was a shift in the relative biomass contribution of the two dominant regenerating tree species; the proportion of total biomass contributed by white birch (Betula papyrifera) decreased and the proportion of total biomass contributed by yellow birch (B. alleghaniensis) increased. However, elevated CO2 had no significant effect on the total amount of nitrogen in plant and soil microbial biomass. In this study we observed a suite of effects due to elevated CO2, some of which could lead to increases in potential long term growth responses to elevated CO2, other to decreases. The reduced plant NH4/+ uptake rates we observed are consistent with reduced NH4/+ availability due to reduced gross mineralization rates. Reduced NH4/+ mineralization rates are consistent with the increases in C/N ratios we observed for leaf and fine root material. Together, these data suggest the positive increases in plant root architectural parameters and mycorrhizal colonization may not be as important as the potential negative effects of reduced nitrogen availability through decreased decomposition rates in a future atmosphere with elevated CO2.","Betula; CO2; Mycorrhizal fungi; Nitrogen; Pool dilution","belowground biomass; carbon dioxide enrichment; forest; mesocosm experiment; nitrogen cycling; Betula; Betula alleghaniensis; Betula alleghaniensis; Betula papyrifera; Betula papyrifera; Betula pendula; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031966630

An integrated approach using wet-chemical analyses, cross polarization magic angle spinning carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (CPMAS 13C-NMR), and pyrolysis-field ionization mass spectrometry (Py-FIMS) was applied to characterize the SOM composition at different depths. Dead mosses material are the source of fresh organic matter for soil formation in the Pergelic Cryohemist. Polysaccharides are the primary organic compounds. This composition is very similar to that of litter from peat soils in temperate climate regions. In addition protein and alkyl carbon are found in the mosses, whereas in contrast to temperate climate zones lignin was of minor importance. The alkyl compounds consist of lipids, fatty acids, and sterols. A high amount of carboxyl groups probably develops from fatty acids and proteins and the aromatic structures mainly from aromatic amino acids. Changes in the SOM morphology were not confirmed with the classical wet chemical analysis but were confirmed by CPMAS-13C-NMR and Py-FIMS. Carbohydrates are less mineralized than under temperate climate conditions. Alkyl carbon units are enriched due to selective preservation. During advanced humification the alkyl carbon units are probably incorporated into the complex humic matter. The drastic increase of alkyl-C with peat depth has been described also for peat soils in temperate climate zones. The aromatic structures identified demonstrate that lignin input is not necessary for the formation of aromatic humics. The chemical degradation of the organic matter is not as intensive as in soils of temperate climate regimes. The extremely cold climate conditions retard the transformation of fresh organic residues. Therefore in this Antarctic peaty soil, carbohydrates dominate in the composition of the SOM also in the deeper horizons.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039438602

Public policies, particularly the Clean Air Act (CAA) and its amendments, have dramatically altered coal markets and will continue to do so. These policies will continue to set the market terms under which the Illinois coal industry competes. The 1970 CAA amendment's limit on SO2 emissions of 1.2 lb/mmBtu on coal-fired power plants sparked the beginning of a major expansion of the low-sulfur coal mining industry in Wyoming and Montana. Sales of high-sulfur coal produced east of the Mississippi River began to stagnate as low-sulfur western coal became available at low cost. Largely because low-sulfur coal remained highly cost-effective, attempts in 1977 to improve the competitive position of high-sulfur coal by requiring that both high- and low-sulfer coal have their emission potential reduced by 90% failed. The 1990 CAA amendments introduced 'pollution credit' trading to promote emission reductions nationally at the lowest cost to the economy. They also extended the emission limits to all previously exempt plants and mandated a nationwide SO2 emissions reduction of 10 million tons through 2000. Finally, they banned any increase in national emission levels beyond the level mandated for the year 2000. Introducing new competitive elements by which utilities can more economically and efficiently meet regulatory standards, these amendments favor the use of the cleanest fuels and the shifting of electricity generation to the lowest-cost power plants nationwide. The winners will likely be the environment, the economy, and the producers of low-sulfur, low-cost fuels. The immediate cost will be borne by regions that produce high-sulfur coal, such as the Illinois Basin. Dynamic supply and demand changes in the US coal market, market competition between coal, natural gas and nuclear energy, and changes in the electric utility regulatory environment will bring about major changes in the years through 2010. Continued availability of low-cost western coal, adequate amounts of natural gas, and the continuation of emissions credits are likely to adversely affect Illinois coal sales. The key to long-term sustainability for the Illinois coal industry is to concentrate research and policy efforts on improving the cost competitiveness of coal produced in the state.",,"coal industry; coal market; emissions control; energy market; hydrocarbon resources; market conditions; USA, Illinois",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031419286

The variables include the shapes of the profiles of axial and tangential velocity at entry to the diffusing quarl, premixedness of the central fuel stream and frequency and the amplitude of oscillations imposed on the air flowing in the annulus. The geometry of the burner is similar to that used in furnaces and the heat release around 50 kW for stoichiometric proportions of fuel and air. The flammability range was found to increase with swirl number and to decrease with increase in the proportion of mass flow in the central region of the quarl. The addition of small quantities of air to the central flow of methane led to partial stabilisation of the flame on the fuel tube so that the lean flammability was decreased for all swirl numbers. The amplitude of imposed oscillations was enhanced by cavity resonance and their effect depended on consequent velocity fluctuations; in general, oscillations increased the range of overall equivalence ratios for which stable combustion was possible, allowed operation of the burner without swirl, and improved rich flammability limits, although the lean limit occurred at higher equivalence ratios. The local measurements of temperature and species concentrations quantified the extent to which oscillations shortened the flames, provided explanations for the changes in flammability limits and showed that oscillations did not reduce NOx. emissions.","Combustion; Quarl burners; Stability; Swirl",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001010938

High freshwater inflow into this shallow turbid estuary results in the shortest hydraulic residence time (ca. 7 d) of all Texas estuaries (Baskaran et al. in press). Annual averages of chlorophyll-α (3.0 μg l-1) and particulate organic carbon (1.1 mg l-1) in the water column were extremely low in comparison to other shallow estuaries. The highest chlorophyll-α concentrations were observed in October 1993, in the mid and lower regions of the estuary, during the lowest river discharge. Zeaxanthin and fucoxanthin concentrations suggested that much of the chlorophyll-α during this low flow period was represented by cyanobacteria and diatoms that entered from the Gulf of Mexico. The range of DOC concentrations was generally high (4.4-20.9 mg l-1) and were significantly correlated with POC, but not with chlorophyll-α concentrations. When total suspended particulate (TSP) concentrations were below 20 to 30 mg l-1, there were significant increases in %POC and %PON of the TSP. The unusually high POC: chlorophyll-α ratios (highest value of 1423) suggested that much of the POC contained low concentrations of chlorophyll-α that had degraded during transport from wetlands in the Sabine and Neches rivers. Based on these data, this estuary can be characterized as a predominantly heterotrophic system, with low light penetrance, short particle-residence times, high DOC, and low inputs from autochthonous carbon sources.",,"Bacillariophyta; Cyanobacteria; carbon cycle; estuarine ecosystems; plant pigment biomarkers; water quality; USA, Texas, Sabine-Neches Estuary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030618585

Newfoundland (NW Atlantic) were determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry and gas chromatography/combustion/isotope ratio mass spectrometry. Although individual hydrocarbons were generally depleted by at least 3‰ relative to bulk organic matter, significant variations and temporal fluctuations in compound specific carbon isotopic compositions were documented in bloom samples and laboratory cultures. Marked 13C depletions in a suite of eight C25 highly branched isoprenoid alkenes, as well as a temporal shift in the 13C composition of spring bloom n-alkanes are suggested to be related to changes in the growth rates of bloom organisms. The input of multiple sources of organic matter into deep bay sediments could be recognized in the isotopic compositions of sedimentary n-alkanes. Overall, the carbon isotopic composition appeared to be primarily a reflection of the carbon fixing pathway of source organisms, with superimposed variations caused by fluctuations in growth rates and [CO(2(aq))]. These findings highlight the need for more study of contemporary biogenic hydrocarbons; specifically of the influence of growth rate and timing of synthesis on the carbon isotopic composition of biomarkers over the course of phytoplankton blooms.","Compound-specific 13C; Highly branched isoprenoid; Laboratory culture of diatoms; Newfoundland; Plankton blooms","Biomarkers; Composition; Gas chromatography; Geographical regions; Hydrocarbons; Isotopes; Mass spectrometry; Sediments; Surface waters; Synthesis (chemical); Biogenic hydrocarbons; Diatoms; Highly branched isoprenoid; Newfoundland; Plankton blooms; Geochemistry; algal blooms; biogenic hydrocarbon; biogenic hydrocarbons; carbon; diatom; distribution; isotopic composition; marine sediment; organic compounds; plankton bloom; Canada, Newfoundland, Conception Bay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030616279

On-road emissions were measured in Monterrey, Nuavo Leon, Mexico in 1995 from more than 24 000 vehicles. The Subsecretaria de Ecologia's Office was able to provide vehicle registration information for 10 654 vehicles. These data show a steady emission reduction that coincides with the introduction of light- duty vehicle exhaust emission standards for Mexican vehicles and the implementation of Monterrey's I/M program. The 1995 models are emitting 75% less CO, 70% less HC, and 65% less NO than precontrol models. Pre-1995 models appear to experience a steady degradation in their emission control capabilities, but the cause of this observation cannot reliably be determined without additional data.

The Monterrey data set can also be used to help explain some of the large on-road reductions observed in Mexico City between 1991 and 1994. Sweden's experience in introducing three-way closed-loop emission control systems suggests that the service life of Mexican vehicle emission control systems can be improved.In 1991, the nation of Mexico lowered light-duty vehicle emission standards leading to the introduction of catalytic convertors. On-road emissions were measured in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico in 1995 from more than 24 000 vehicles. The Subsecretaria de Ecologia's Office was able to provide vehicle registration information for 10 654 vehicles. These data show a steady emission reduction that coincides with the introduction of light-duty vehicle exhaust emission standards for Mexican vehicles and the implementation of Monterrey's I/M program. The 1995 models are emitting 75% less CO, 70% less HC, and 65% less NO than precontrol models.

SiC films were deposited using three different techniques; atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD) in a hot-wall type reactor using the silane-propane-hydrogen system in a substrate temperature (Ts) regime 900°C to 1300°C, reactive magnetron sputtering of Si target in mixed CH4/Ar discharge at Ts = 850°C, and sequential sputtering from Si and C (graphite) targets in pure Ar discharge at Ts between 710°C and 850°C. Voids formed in the Si substrates with primary faceting on {1 1 1} planes and increased in size with increasing temperature. Truncation of voids was on {0 0 1} and {1 1 3} planes as expected from shape equilibrium, but also truncation on apparent {0 1 1} facets were observed between inclined {1 1 1} planes as an effect of growth kinetics. The presence of voids resulted in an inhomogeneous residual strain state in the films during cooling from the deposition temperature due to thermal mismatch to the substrate as evidenced by a significant broadening of the SiC(0 0 2) peak in X-ray diffraction. Corresponding strain relaxation of the SiC film in the absence of voids resulted in plastic deformation of the Si substrate.","Interface; Si; Sic; Transmission electron microscopy; Voids","Chemical vapor deposition; Crystal microstructure; Crystal orientation; Film growth; Interfaces (materials); Magnetron sputtering; Substrates; Thin films; Transmission electron microscopy; Vapor phase epitaxy; X ray diffraction analysis; Atmospheric pressure chemical vapor deposition (APCVD); Cubic silicon carbide (3C SiC); Silicon carbide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031550066

Airway CO2 excretion can be noninvasively and stably measured under changing environmental conditions. We investigated the relationship between the volume of airway CO2 excreted (CO2EX) during CPR to regional blood flow (RBF) and survival. A total of 21 dogs were randomly divided into four CO2EX groups (&lt; 5, 5-6, &gt; 6-7 and &gt; 7 ml CO2/min per kg), anesthetized, instrumented and ventilated with an in-line infrared airway CO2 sensor. Anesthesia was reduced and baseline measurements made. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was initiated and resuscitation withheld for 3 min, followed by 17 min of CPR. Compression force alone was adjusted to maintain predetermined CO2EX. Animals were resuscitated, monitored for 2 h and observed for an additional 22 h. RBF was determind at baseline, 16 min post-VF and 60 min post-resuscitation. Mean CO2EX during CPR was significantly higher in survivors than nonsurvivors. The probability of survival increased as CO2EX increased. The highest CO2EX group had the highest rate of survival (86%), but did not always have significantly higher cardiac output (CO), myocardial or cerebral blood flows (MBF, CBF) than the lowest CO2EX group with a 0% survival rate. These data suggest survival is tracked better by CO2EX than by CO, MBF or CBF. Therefore, CO2EX appears to provide a practical reliable noninvasive method of determining CPR efficacy in the field.","Carbon dioxide; Cardiopulmonary resuscitation; Dogs; Regional blood flow; Survival","carbon dioxide; anesthesia; animal experiment; animal model; article; brain blood flow; carbon dioxide excretion; compression; defibrillation; dog; heart muscle blood flow; heart output; heart ventricle fibrillation; nonhuman; priority journal; probability; resuscitation; survival rate; time; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Cardiac Output; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Disease Models, Animal; Dogs; Lung; Predictive Value of Tests; Pulmonary Gas Exchange; Random Allocation; Regional Blood Flow; Survival Rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030931505

To a lesser extent, the natural grasslands in the Central United States have also been replaced with crops. Simulations with a land surface process model coupled to an atmospheric general circulation model show that the climate of the United States with modern vegetation is significantly different from that with natural vegetation. Three important climate signals caused by modern vegetation are: (1) 1 °C cooling over the Eastern United States and 1 °C warming over the Western United States in spring; (2) summer cooling of up to 2°C over a wide region of the Central United States; and (3) moistening of the near-surface atmosphere by 0.5 to 1.5 g kg-1 over much of the United States in spring and summer. Although individual months show large, statistically significant differences in precipitation due to land-use practices, these differences average out over the course of the 3-month seasons. These changes in surface temperature and moisture extend well into the atmosphere, up to 500 mb, and affect the boundary layer and atmospheric circulation. The altered climate is due to reduced surface roughness, reduced leaf and stem area index, reduced stomatal resistance, and increased surface albedo with modern vegetation compared to natural vegetation. The climate change caused by land use practices is comparable to other well known anthropogenic climate forcings. For example, it would take 100 to 175 years at the current, observed rate of summer warming over the United States to offset the cooling from deforestation. The summer sulfate aerosol forcing completely offsets the greenhouse forcing over the Eastern United States. Similarly, the climatic effect of North American deforestation, with extensive summer cooling, further offsets the greenhouse forcing.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030778342

In most cases, due to the limited number of layers in a core (i.e., small number of data points), estimation of the slope and uncertainties in classical regression analysis does not take into account the uncertainties in radiocarbon dating. Here, fuzzy linear regression, which may be applied even to a very small data set, is utilized. The method, illustrated through a practical example, with eight data points, appears to be a promising tool in stratigraphic studies to link sediment age to layer depth and takes into account uncertainties from radiocarbon dating.","climate change; fuzzy linear regression; imprecision; radiocarbon dating; sediment layer; uncertainty","climate change; fuzzy linear regression; radiocarbon dating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031000869

Fuel-cell vehicles would provide a promising technology for coping with the environmental and economic effects of an expanding vehicle fleet and a decreasing petroleum supply. Fueled with methanol or hydrogen derived from biomass fuel cells can also effectively address the problem of CO2 emissions from that fleet. The extent to which this combination might affect petroleum displacement depends on the amount of biomass that could be produced and tile efficiency of its conversion to a fuel compatible with fuel cells. Reduction of net CO2 emissions by the best current bio-fuel technology will be limited by biomass supply. Biomass conversion efficiency, petroleum displacement and overall net CO2 emission reduction can be improved, and the cost of fuel minimized, by use of natural gas as a co-feedstock. The extra hydrogen provided by natural gas allows these improvements by eliminating the partial shift of CO to CO2 that is otherwise necessary; elimination of that step and additional in Situ leveraging of fuel yield by conventional reforming reactions also reduce the production cost. A thermochemical process utilizing both biomass and natural gas as co-feedstocks is compared with other options for methanol production and CO2 mitigation using either biomass or natural gas alone. Use of natural gas as co-feedstock makes possible the additional environmental advantage of utilizing waste methane from landfills and waste-water treatment facilities, as well as the carbonaceous solid wastes and sludge from those facilities, for conversion to clean transportation fuel. Greenhouse gas emissions from these important municipal sources can thus be concurrently reduced, together with landfill disposal requirements.","Biomass; Fuel cells; Greenhouse gas; Hydrogen; Methanol; Natural gas","Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Environmental protection; Feedstocks; Fuel cells; Greenhouse effect; Ground vehicles; Hydrogen fuels; Land fill; Methane; Methanol; Natural gas; Greenhouse gas; Biomass; alternative energy; biomass fuel; cogeneration; energy crop; renewable energy; vehicular fuel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030803689

The code has been modified to include space charge limited emission. Several different ways of doing this are considered. One of the models considered uses Gauss's law to force the electric field on the emitter to vanish; it was used in the original version of BFCPIC for the simulation of ion diodes.

Optimised fertilisation on 25% of Swedish forest land and the use of stem wood could almost double the biomass potential from forestry compared with no fertilisation, as both logging residues and large quantities of excess stem wood not needed for industrial purposes could be used for energy purposes. Together with energy crops and straw from agriculture, the total Swedish biomass potential would be about 230 TWh/yr or half the current Swedish energy supply if the demand for stem wood for building and industrial purposes were the same as today. The new production methods are assumed not to cause any significant negative impact on the local environment. The cost of utilising stem wood produced with optimised fertilisation for energy purposes has not been analysed and needs further investigation. Besides replacing fossil fuels and, thus, reducing current Swedish CO2 emissions by about 65%, this amount of biomass is enough to produce electricity equivalent to 20% of current power production. Biomass-based electricity is produced preferably through co-generation using district heating systems in densely populated regions, and pulp industries in forest regions. Alcohols for transportation and stand-alone power production are preferably produced in less densely populated regions with excess biomass. A high intensity in biomass production would reduce biomass transportation demands. There are uncertainties regarding the future demand for stem wood for building and industrial purposes, the amount of arable land available for energy crop production and future yields. These factors will influence Swedish biomass potential and earlier estimates of the potential vary from 15 to 125 TWh/yr.Swedish biomass production potential could be increased significantly if new production methods such as optimised fertilisation, were to be used. Optimised fertilisation on 25% of Swedish Forest land and the use of stem wood could almost double the biomass potential from forestry compared with no fertilisation, as both logging residues and large quantities of excess stem wood not needed for industrial purposes could be used for energy purposes. Together with energy crops and straw from agriculture, the total Swedish biomass potential would be about 230 TWh/yr or half the current Swedish energy supply if the demand for stem wood for building and industrial purposes were the same as today. The new production methods are assumed not to cause any significant negative impact on the local environment. The cost of utilising stem wood produced with optimised fertilisation for energy purposes has not been analysed and needs further investigation. Besides replacing fossil fuels and, thus, reducing current Swedish CO2 emissions by about 65%, this amount of biomass is enough to produce electricity equivalent to 20% of current power production. Biomass-based electricity is produced preferably through co-generation using district heating systems in densely populated regions, and pulp industries in forest regions. Alcohols for transportation and stand-alone power production are preferably produced in less densely populated regions with excess biomass. A high intensity in biomass production would reduce biomass transportation demands. There are uncertainties regarding the future demand for stem wood for building and industrial purposes, the amount of arable land available for energy crop production and future yields. These factors will influence Swedish biomass potential and earlier estimates of the potential vary from 15 to 125 TWh/yr.","Agriculture; Biomass; Forestry; Fossil fuel substitution; Optimised fertilisation; Power production","Agricultural products; Carbon dioxide; Energy resources; Energy utilization; Forestry; Fossil fuels; Carbon dioxide mitigation; Fertilization; Fossil fuel substitution; Power production; Sweden; Biomass; alternative energy; biomass; biomass power; carbon dioxide; carbon emissions; energy resources; energy supply; resources development; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031433487

The PAC was added either directly to the aerated basin (simultaneous PAC-treatment), or to a partial stream of clarified effluent, which was treated with PAC in an agitated tank and recirculated to the aerated basin (subsequent PAC-treatment with recirculation). The standard advanced biological treatment reduced the AOX-content by 24%. In the pilot-plant, three types of powdered activated carbons were tested for a simultaneous treatment. The treatment with 100 mg/l PICA PCO Super produced an additional reduction of AOX by 20%, whereas a dosage of 50 mg/l NORIT W-20 showed no enhancement effect, and W-35 led to an additional AOX-removal of about 9%. Also, an improved removal of DOC, NH4-N and PO4-P was observed. In all cases, the PAC addition caused a significantly improved settling of the AS, reducing the sludge-volume-index, and increasing the content of volatile solids of the PAC-sludge. In general, no evidence of a synergistic effect of the PAC addition to activated sludge, nor bioregeneration of the activated carbon, could be observed. This suggests, that the observed effects probably are caused only by simple adsorption.","Activated sludge; Adsorbable organic halogens (AOX); Advanced wastewater treatment; Dissolved organic carbon (DOC); Municipal wastewater; PACT-process; Powdered activated carbon (PAC); Wastewater treatment plant","Adsorbable organic halogens; Bioregeneration; Dissolved organic carbon; Municipal wastewater; Powdered activated carbon; Wastewater treatment plants; Activated carbon treatment; Activated sludge process; Adsorption; Biological water treatment; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Clarification; Effluents; Halogen compounds; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; activated carbon; halide; activated sludge; adsorption; aeration; conference paper; domestic waste; intermethod comparison; waste water management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030838936

Management for these diverse goals can be guided by optimisation models that seek the best cutting regime, given different constraints and objective functions. The results for a lowland tropical rainforest in peninsular Malaysia show that to maximise a sustainable income one would cut all commercial trees of 30 cm and above every 20 years. All non-commercial trees would remain, and thus contribute to diversity and carbon storage. The best policy to maximise carbon storage was not to cut at all. This also maximised diversity, by leading to a forest in its climax state. However, this policy had a very high opportunity cost. Compromise policies were obtained, for example by maximising carbon storage, or diversity, while getting a competitive rate of return on the capital in trees. Findings suggest that increasing carbon storage and tree diversity can be attained only at significant costs in terms of foregone income. For example, increasing carbon storage beyond the income-maximising amount would cost $47/ton.","Carbon storage; Diversity; Linear programming; Soil rent; Tropical forest management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042540801

According to adsorption data, the micropore structure and the chemical character of the two activated samples were found to be practically independent of their origin, but essential structural dissimilarities were concluded from SAXS data. STM illustrated the effect of the precursor's structure only in dimensions which are considerably larger than the size of the regions governing the microporous behavior.

Cells were identified by anti-galactocerebroside antibody. The mean steady-state pH(i) was 7.02 in the absence of CO2/bicarbonate (Hepes- buffered solution) at an external pH of 7.40 and 7.04 in 5% CO2/25 mM bicarbonate-buffered solution at the same external phi this value was modified neither by the removal of external chloride nor by the addition of the chloride-coupled transport blocker DIDS. In both external solutions steady-state pH(i) values were strongly dependent on external pH. In Hepes- buffered solution pH(i) recovery following an acid load required external Na+ and was completely inhibited by amiloride, indicating the presence of a Na+/H+ exchanger. In CO2/bicarbonate-buffered solution amiloride partially reduced the phi recovery rate, indicating the presence of a bicarbonate- dependent phi regulating mechanism. Membrane depolarization induced by increasing external K+ concentration elicited an alkalinization only in the presence of external Na+ and bicarbonate.

In ice-covered ponds or lakes, oxygen levels may also become limiting, thereby forcing animals to endure prolonged periods of severe hypoxia or anoxia. Certain frogs (e.g. Rana temporaria) can dramatically suppress their metabolism in anoxial but are not as tolerant as other facultative vertebrate anaerobes (e.g. turtle, goldfish) of prolonged periods of complete O2 lack. Many overwintering amphibians do, however, tolerate prolonged bouts of severe hypoxia, relying exclusively on cutaneous gas exchange. Rana temporaria overwintering for 2 months in hypoxic water (P(O2)) approximately 25 mmHg) at 3°C progressively reduce their blood P(CO2) to levels characteristic of water-breathing fish. The result in that blood pH rises and presumably facilitates transcutaneous O2 transfer by increasing Hb O2-affinity. Even after months of severe hypoxia, there is no substantial build-up of lactate as the animals continue to rely on cutaneous gas exchange to satisfy the requirements of a suppressed aerobic metabolism. Our recent experiments have shown that the skeletal muscle of frogs oxyconforms in vitro to the amount of O2 available. The cellular basis for the oxyconformation of skeletal muscle is unknown, but the hypothesis driving our continuing experiments theorises that metabolic suppression at a cellular level is synonymous with suppressed ion leak across cellular membranes.","acid-base balance; aquatic amphibian; cold torpor; cutaneous gas exchange; ion channel suppression; metabolic suppression; osmotic homeostasis; overwintering","carbon dioxide; glycogen; oxygen; adaptation; adipose tissue; Amphibia; animal; anoxia; article; blood; cell membrane; cold; comparative study; electrolyte balance; energy metabolism; epithelium; frog; functions of the skin and its appendages; hibernation; homeostasis; lipid metabolism; mammal; metabolism; nerve cell; pH; physiology; season; signal transduction; skeletal muscle; species difference; turtle; Adaptation, Physiological; Adipose Tissue; Amphibia; Animals; Anoxia; Carbon Dioxide; Cell Membrane; Cold; Energy Metabolism; Epithelium; Glycogen; Hibernation; Homeostasis; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Lipid Metabolism; Mammals; Muscle, Skeletal; Neurons; Oxygen; Rana temporaria; Seasons; Signal Transduction; Skin Physiology; Species Specificity; Turtles; Water-Electrolyte Balance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030977914

In contrast, nitrate, ammonium, and calcium concentrations generally increased in 1995. What's more, the H+ and SO42- declines were highly correlated (R2 = 0.72), indicating a reduction of acid rain. The largest concentration decreases in both ions occurred in and downwind of the Ohio River Valley. This is the same area where the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) set limits on SO2 emissions from 110 affected sources, 63 in states bordering the Ohio River Valley. Phase I of the CAAA required these limits be met by January 1, 1995. Indeed, sulfur dioxide emissions from Phase I sources dropped 40% in 1995 compared to 1994. This was a nearly 19% reduction in overall emissions in the 21 states with Phase I sources. Based on our analysis of emissions and NADP/NTN precipitation chemistry data, we infer that the substantial declines in acid rain in the eastern United States in 1995 occurred because of large reductions in SO2 emissions in the same region.",,"Acid rain; Atmospheric chemistry; Calcium; Gas emissions; Nitrates; Precipitation (meteorology); Sulfur dioxide; Free acidity; Air pollution",Conference Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031368640

The ratio of unsaturated to saturated alkane homologues in the interstitial and headspace gasses is on average equal to one and show positive correlation. This rules out thermogenic hydrocarbons as a direct source for the headspace and interstitial gasses. The proportion of unsaturated hydrocarbons in the adsorbed gas is much lower (&lt; 1%), but also here a significant positive correlation between unsaturated and saturated alkanes is observed. The highest interstitial methane contents are found in sediments with high contents of coarse material. Principal component analysis show that the yields, dryness, and isotopic composition of adsorbed methane correlate positively with the contents of calcium and strontium, the Sr/Ca ratio in the sediments and the proportion of silt size material in the sediments. We infer from this that a major component in the adsorbed gas is cogenetic with carbonates in the fine fraction, probably resulting from in situ bacterial degradation of organic matter. Distinct and unquestionable regional headspace gas anomalies are found within the Quaternary Kleppe Senior (KSE) formation of soft, silty marine/glaciomarine clays. Outside of KSE only background levels of headspace methane is observed. Some of the most prominent headspace gas anomalies correlate very well with a shallow gas accumulation in a sand body just 10-20 m below sea floor. We conclude that gas found at the surface has migrated upwards from this sand body. The 13C/12C isotopic ratio for the anomalous methane (-51 to -100) ppt and its extremely dry characteristics are typical for a biogenic origin. We speculate that shallow biogenic gas may be a secondary form of carbon related to leakage from petroleum deposits at depth in this very prolific area.","biogenic gas; calcium; carbonates; methane; strontium; surface geochemistry","gas seepage; gas seepages; hydrocarbon gas; hydrocarbons; marine sediment; shallow sediments; North Sea",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030620740

Trying to reduce the ever-increasing burden on the environment from pollutant exhaust gases, legislators worldwide are reacting with increasingly stringent emission controls. In mid-1996 the ECE Stage III emission control standards for 1999 have been proposed by the European Community; concurrently, a further reduction for 2005 was proposed as ECE Stage IV. These new standards, in conjunction with a modification of the European exhaust gas test, will lead the way to closer approximation with, and an approach comparable to the demands of emission legislation in the United States of America and in particular, California. As in the American FTP (Federal Test Procedure) test, the 40-second idle phase will no longer be applied in the new European test, with emission tests beginning immediately with engine cranking.

The principal axis of this area extends for approximately 1000 miles from the general vicinity of Newark, NJ, to near Birmingham, Ala. The subsurface geology is diverse and ranges from thick sequences of carbonate sediments and shales in the Valley and Ridge Physiographic Province to fractured crystalline rocks mantled with weathered regolith in the Piedmont and the Blue Ridge Physiographic Provinces. Most aquifers consist of local, shallow flow systems whose flow paths are typically less than 20 miles long and within 300 feet of land surface. In all three physiographic provinces, ground water discharges naturally from springs, but almost three-fourths of the sampled springs are in the Valley and Ridge Province. Ground water interacts with stream water in many parts of the study area, and the movement of the water between systems is generally complex. Because of these interactions, this study examines the quality and chemical character of ground water, spring water, and surface water in all three physiographic provinces and contrasts geographic trends in a selected set of water-quality properties and constituents. In the study area as a whole, typical ground water is not highly mineralized: the median dissolved-solids concentration is 164 milligrams per liter (mg/L). Typical ground water is also nearly netural (median pH is 6.9) and is classified as moderately hard (median hardness is 82 mg/L as CaCO3). For most water in the study area, the major dissolved ions are calcium, magnesium, and bicarbonate, which are produced by the dissolution of carbonate rocks (limestone and dolostone). Commonly, other order of abundance of major cations is calcium&gt;magnesium&gt;sodium, and for major anions, the order is bicarbonate&gt;chloride. In parts of the Valley and Ridge Province, however, the sediments contain significant amounts of gypsum, and sulfate becomes the dominant anion at higher ionic concentrations. Although calcium is usually the dominat cation in most water in the study area, for estuarine streams in the northeastern Piedmont Province, sodium becomes the dominant cation at higher ionic concentrations. A new method for displaying variations in chemical composition of water is described in this report.",,"water quality; USA, (East)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17944398495

In the region under study, the emissions of precursor substances are considerably lower on weekends than on weekdays, as can be derived from the Swiss emission inventory or from traffic frequencies. Chemical production as well as destruction of ozone are affected differently by sudden changes in emissions, depending on meteorology and on the structure of the emissions. Therefore, in Switzerland, several distinct patterns of the weekly cycle of mean daily ozone peak concentrations can be detected. When meteorology is not favourable to ozone production, weekends show generally higher ozone peaks than weekdays. Favourable meteorology (i.e. high solar radiation, high temperatures, low wind speeds) produces an inverse pattern, the mean ozone peaks being 10-15% lower on Sundays than on Thursdays or Fridays. Differences in emission structures slightly modify the patterns and can delay the effects. Threshold values to separate favourable conditions can be estimated for radiation and temperature. In Switzerland, 'favourable' meteorology is achieved on about 30-50 days per year, corresponding well with 'summer smog days'.","Emission control strategies; Ozone; Photochemical episodes; Weekly cycles","ozone; air monitoring; air pollution; article; environmental temperature; exhaust gas; meteorology; pollution transport; priority journal; solar radiation; switzerland; wind; ozone; photochemistry; weekly cycle; Switzerland; Air pollution control; Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric temperature; Meteorology; Photochemical reactions; Emission control strategies; Photochemical episodes; Ozone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107054

The ACS takes into consideration the intent of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) to incorporate pollution prevention into regulations and provides a viable mechanism for implementation. This proposed new compliance strategy was developed after studying the CAAA regulations, related compliance issues, and pollution prevention literature. The ACS is defined by amending language in the Hazardous Organic National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (HON) regulation into a performance-based standard permitting regulated facilities to design compliance programs to meet all requirements. A change in regulation is considered reasonable only if it forces the same emission reductions, reduces risk a comparable amount, and is acceptable to the public, the regulators, and the regulated industry. In order to demonstrate that the ACS can meet all these requirements, an example application is summarized from an ethylene oxide-ethylene glycol plant. The example demonstrates that the ACS reduces hazardous air pollution (HAP) emissions more than the HON rule requires. Three evaluation methods are developed and applied to further demonstrate the acceptability of the ACS. They include a qualitative evaluation matrix, a total cost assessment, and a risk reduction measurement model. Results indicate that the ACS provided a preferable compliance program. The ACS should be adopted as an alternative method of compliance. It provides a major step in the progression of regulations from the traditional EOP treatment philosophy to pollution prevention performance-based standards. © 1997 Air & Waste Management Association.",,"Cost effectiveness; Hazardous materials; Industrial emissions; Laws and legislation; Mathematical models; Risk assessment; Standards; Alternate compliance strategy (ACS); Air pollution control; air pollutant; air pollution; article; environmental protection; law; nomenclature; priority journal; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031127612

Information about the fate of volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) which are commonly present in MSW is needed to protect the environment from undesirable emissions. To achieve this goal, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the fate of four VOCs (benzene, carbon tetrachloride, dichlorobenzene, and xylene) and two pesticides (Captan and Lindane) added to simulated MSW. Volatile organic chemicals were added at three concentrations while pesticides were tested at a single concentration. All of the treatments were replicated three times and composted in 200 L aerated static pile composters. The composters were specially equipped with pumps and flow meters to aerate the feedstock at 1.12-1.68 m3/hr, sorption filters to collect volatile organic chemicals from the exiting air stream, and leachate collection vessels. The feedstock was selected to be representative of MSW after the majority of recyclable metal and glass had been removed and was spiked with organic chemicals known to commonly occur in MSW. The results showed that the majority of VOCs present in the feedstock were lost via volatilization in the initial 48 hours of composting. Concentrations of VOCs were below detection limits after one week of composting in both the leachate and compost. Thus, while aerated pile composting is effective in removing VOCs from the feedstock, the exiting air stream will need to be monitored for approximately one week and possibly treated to meet environmental quality standards. Aerobic composting reduced the initial concentrations of 275 mg/kg each of Captan and Lindane to final concentrations of 53.8 and 158.9 mg/kg, respectively, after five weeks of composting. This corresponded to half lives of 1.5 and four weeks during composting for Captan and Lindane respectively. All concentrations of both pesticides were below detection limits in all samples of air, condensate and leachate, in dicating that none of the pesticides were volatilized and all were retained by the MSW until they biodegraded. © 1997 Taylor and Francis.",,"benzene; captan; carbon tetrachloride; chemical analysis; compost; dichlorobenzene; lindane; methane; municipal solid waste; solid waste; volatile organic compound; xylene; composting; landfill; municipal solid waste; pesticide; VOC",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031429917

The desorption experiments indicate that H2O molecules dissociate in contact with surfaces of the clean tungsten emitter, but no traces of dissociation of water adsorbed on Au/W were found, if only the gold coverage was sufficiently high (Θ ≥ 2). H2O is probably adsorbed in two adsorption states on Au/W. Water desorption from the first state was carried out in the temperature range 145-155 K with an activation energy of 51.5 ± 1.5 kJ/mol, whereas the desorption from the second state was observed at 220-240 K. Generally, the adsorption of water causes the reduction of the emission current at a constant high voltage, both for W and Au/W, but for the second adsorption state in the system H2O/Au/W a slight increase of the emission current was noticed. The behaviour of water adlayer in the presence of the high electric field is discussed. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

For this reason they have been the subject of study for decades. A critical mass of case studies now exist and some significant conclusions can be drawn from the cumulative data. In most cases the association with an island is casual and not genetic, nevertheless, these dolomite occurrences are referred to herein as island dolomites. One type of dolomite on carbonate islands is penecontemporaneous dolomite, a phase that forms while the host sediment is in its original depositional setting. Island examples are Holocene in age, occur in Holocene sediments and originate as a direct precipitate from either normal or evaporated seawater. These are microcrystalline, poorly ordered, Ca-rich 18O-enriched and geochemically unstable phases that are susceptible to recrystallization in the setting in which they formed. Post-depositional dolomite is the other type of dolomite associated with carbonate islands. This type of dolomite replaces older precursors and forms as cement. Distinctive characteristics include a dominance of fabric-preserving texture, pore-lining cement rims that may exhibit micron-scale banding with low-Mg calcite, and formation in association with precursor dissolution. Sr-isotopic dating indicates that all examples are Neogene or Quaternary in age. Those formed during the Middle Miocene through Pliocene are massive, laterally continuous, and often multigenerational. In contrast, younger examples tend to be localized partial replacements of a single generation. Sr-isotope ages also suggest global synchroneity in many dolomitization events, which suggests a connection between dolomitization, global eustacy and/or global climatic factors. Geochemical attributes of post-depositional island dolomites are Ca enrichment, positive δ18O and δ13C, low Sr contents (150-300 ppm) and low Fe (&lt; 300 ppm) and Mn (&lt; 35 ppm) concentrations. Exceptions to these characteristics occur, but are in the minority and can be explained by local enrichment of 12C from sulfate reduction or oxidation of methane, excess Sr from aragonite precursors, and allochthonous Fe and Mn from nearby siliciclastics or volcanics. Global similarity in petrography and geochemistry of replacive island dolomites argues for a similar origin. Inferred origins, however, depend primarily on how δ18O and Sr data are interpreted. Values for Δ18O and DSr must be assumed due to uncertainties in oxygen isotope fractionation and Sr partitioning. There is no consensus or uniformity in those assumptions, thus interpretations can vary and be biased to a desired result. Covariant trends in δ13C and δ18O, some negative δ13C values, and high Sr all favor a mixing-zone origin, but examples with these attributes are few. Lack of covariance in the isotopes, mean δ18O of + 2.0%o to + 3.5%o and low Sr (&lt; 300 ppm) favor an origin from normal or slightly evaporated seawater. Examples with these attributes are in the vast majority, and dolomite geometries and ages relative to overlying limestones indicate that seawater derived laterally is the parent fluid for most of these dolomites. Many interpreted as mixing-zone or hypersaline reflux products are probably misinterpretations based on unreasonable or extreme assumptions about DSr, Δ18O or the chemistry of hypothetical end-member dolomites. Future studies should standardize the type of data collected and the analytical techniques employed. Multiple geochemical attributes should be measured on microsampled components and quantitative modeling should be employed in order to constraint interpretations as much as possible. Also needed are a better understanding of the kinetic processes that form these dolomites, more careful assessment of their recrystallization status and an improved understanding of DSr and Δ18O at low temperature.","Cenozoic; Dolomite; Islands; Stable isotopes; Trace elements",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002226470

The severe winter environmental conditions of the Antarctic sea-ice zone make it difficult to observe many of the physical characteristics in a comprehensive way. The inter-relations between the variables mean that much can be learnt from the observations of some features along with detailed numerical modelling of the whole system and the interactions between the variables. This study therefore aims to use numerical modelling of the atmosphere, sea ice and surface mixed-layer ocean in the sea-ice zone, together with observations to simulate a comprehensive range of parameters and their variability through the annual cycle to provide a basis for further observations and model validation for the present climate. The model includes a coupled atmospheric general circulation model with an interactive dynamic and thermodynamic sea-ice model and surface mixed-layer ocean. The deep ocean and ocean surface conditions outside the sea-ice zone are constrained to the present mean climate conditions to ensure no climatic drift. The sea-ice model is similar to previous published versions, but has refined schemes for partitioning of the freezing of frazil ice within the leads and under the ice floes, and for rafting. These perform well in both polar regions with the same physics. The model simulates the annual cycle of atmospheric and sea-ice features well in comparison with data from the global atmospheric analyses, the satellite sensing of sea ice, and the limited in situ surface observations. The output from the model also includes: all components of the heat fluxes, atmospheric profiles and surface temperatures for air, ice and ice-ocean mixtures, open-water fractions, surface snow and snow-ice depths, and the sea-ice convergence-divergence and drift. The comparison of these features with additional observations provides a means for further validating the model and representing the present climate more closely.",,"atmosphere; atmosphere/ocean coupling; GCM; modelling; sea ice; Antarctica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031400127

Adaptation to current climate variability has been proposed as an additional way to approach adaptation to long-term climate change. In effect improved adaptation to current climate is a step in preparation for longer term climate change. International programs of research and assessment are separately organized to deal with natural disasters and climate change. There is no scientific concensus so far, that extreme events have changed in frequency on a world-wide basis, although some regional changes have occured. It is extremely unlikely that significant shifts in the means of weather distributions will take place without shifts in the tails. In some situations it may make more sense to focus on adaptation to extreme events and the tails of distributions. In other circumstances adaptation to the norms is the logical focus. The relationship between normal climate and climate change is examined in terms of single and complex variables and phenomena. It is proposed that the research communities studying adaptation to extreme events and adaptation to climate change work more closely together, perhaps in a newly organized joint research program.",,"adaptive response; climate; climate change; extreme event; man-environment relations; variability",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030617189

Oceanographic research experiments and process studies in the field have also contributed to the climatological data bases for the global ocean, but, for the most part, these have been limited in duration and extent. However, over the last 10 years under the auspices of the World Climate Research Program and the International Geosphere Biosphere Program the role of the oceans in global and climate change has taken on increased significance. This has created a need for a considerably improved understanding of the seasonal, interannual, decadal and longer time-scale variability of the physical and biogeochemical attributes of the global ocean. As a result, over the past 10 years several major international field programs have been implemented and have had a tremendous impact on the number of in situ observations obtained for the global ocean. The Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) program, the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE), and the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) were designed with observational, modelling, and process study components aimed at analyzing different aspects of the ocean's role in the coupled climate system. In parallel with the field programs, continuous space-based observations of sea surface temperature, sea surface topography, and sea surface winds spanning nearly a decade or longer have become a reality. During this same time period, numerical ocean models and computational power have advanced to the point where the oceanographic observations, both in situ and remotely sensed, can be assimilated into numerical ocean models in order to provide a four-dimensional (x-y-z-t) depiction of the evolving state of the global ocean. © 1997, Meteorological Society of Japan.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143079840

Desiree) plants expressing yeast invertase directed either to the apoplast, vacuole or cytosol were biochemically and physiologically characterised. All lines of transgenic plants showed similarities to plants growing under water stress. Transformants were retarded in growth, and accumulated hexoses and amino acids, especially proline, to levels up to 40-fold higher than those of the wild types. In all transformants rates of CO2 assimilation and leaf conductance were reduced. From the unchanged intercellular partial pressure of CO2 and apoplastic cisabscisic acid (ABA) content of transformed leaves it was concluded that the reduced rate of CO2 assimilation was not caused by a limitation in the availability of CO2 for the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco). In the transformants the amount of Rubisco protein was not reduced, but both activation state and carboxylation efficiency of photosynthesis were lowered. In vacuolar and cytosolic transformants this inhibition of Rubisco might be caused by a changed ratio of organic bound and inorganic phosphate, as indicated by a doubling of phosphorylated intermediates. But in apoplastic transformants the pattern of phosphorylated intermediates resembled that of leaves of water-stressed potato plants, although the cause of inhibition of photosynthesis was not identical. Whereas in water-stressed plants increased contents of the phytohormone ABA are supposed to mediate the adaptation to water stress, no contribution of ABA to reduction of photosynthesis could be detected in invertase transformants.","Invertase overexpression; Photosynthesis Solanum (invertase overexpression); Transgenic plant (potato); Water stress","abscisic acid; beta fructofuranosidase; carbon dioxide; chlorophyll; fungal protein; glycosidase; hexose; hybrid protein; proline; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; water; article; cell vacuole; cytosol; electrolyte balance; enzymology; gene expression; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; phenotype; phosphorylation; photosynthesis; plant leaf; potato; transgenic plant; yeast; Abscisic Acid; beta-Fructofuranosidase; Carbon Dioxide; Chlorophyll; Cytosol; Fungal Proteins; Gene Expression; Glycoside Hydrolases; Hexoses; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plants, Genetically Modified; Proline; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase; Solanum tuberosum; Vacuoles; Water; Water-Electrolyte Balance; Yeasts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842328058

This article summarizes findings from the most recent research regarding on-road emissions from mobile sources, presented at the CRC workshop held in March 1996. Among the topics discussed were efforts to improve and update emission models, results from field studies designed to understand the contribution of mobile sources to emission inventories, results from gas-and particle-phase emissions studies from in-use motor vehicles, and areas of future research. The Sixth Coordinating Research Council (CRC) On-Road Vehicle Emissions Workshop was held March 18-20, 1996, in San Diego, CA. More than 160 representatives from academia, industry, government, and consulting firms in the United States, Canada, and Europe participated in the three-day meeting. The objective of the Workshop was to present the most recent information from research programs on: mobile source contributions to the emission inventory emission factor models and activity data model comparison and development emission reduction programs new developments in remote sensing studies of on-road vehicle exhaust and non-tailpipe emissions off-cycle Federal Test Procedure (FTP) studies and revisions to the FTP particle emissions from the light- and heavy-duty fleets future research needs Nine sessions were devoted to vehicle emissions models, improvements to the emission inventory, on-road and tunnel studies, off-cycle emissions, non-tailpipe and diesel emissions, emission reduction programs, and remote sensing. Overall workshop coordination was provided by Timothy Belian and the CRC staff, with Steven Cadle and Robert Gorse serving as cochairmen. Individual session chairmen were Brent Bailey (National Renewable Energy Laboratory), Mark Carlock (California Air Resources Board), Harold Haskew (General Motors), Kenneth Knapp and Philip Lorang (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency), Douglas Lawson (Colorado State University), Alan Lloyd (Desert Research Institute), Robert Slott (Shell Oil), and Timothy Truex (University of California, Riverside). In addition, during the Workshop, Lesha Hrynchuk of the California Air Resources Board (CARB) presented a hands-on demonstration using the Internet to obtain motor vehicle emissions information from groups throughout the world.

The REP05 cycle was developed to test vehicles under high speed and high load conditions not included in the FTP. The vehicle fleets consisted of 1989 light-duty gasoline vehicles, 1992-93 limited production FFV/VFV methanol vehicles, 1992-93 compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles and their gasoline counterparts, and a 1992 production and two prototype ethanol FFV/VFV vehicles. All vehicles (except the dedicated CNG vehicles) were tested using Auto/Oil AQIRP fuels A and C2. Other fuels used were M85 blended from A and C2, E85 blended from C1, which is similar to C2 but without MTBE, and four CNG fuels representing the range of in-use CNG fuels. In addition to bag measurements, tailpipe exhaust concentration and A/F data were collected once per second throughout every test. HC and oxygenate speciation of the exhaust was also performed. The data base permits the comparison of emission rates of regulated emissions (including fuel economy), air toxics, specific reactivity, and reactivity weighted emissions on the FTP versus the REP05, as well as the effect of switching fuels on both cycles for each fleet. Overall, no concerns were uncovered in this study having to do with emissions increases on the REP05 relative to the FTP, or for emissions changes for the different fuel comparisons. © 1997 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air quality; Compressed natural gas; Dynamometers; Fuel economy; Gasoline; Air quality improvement; Chassis dynamometers; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Dynamometer studies; Light duty gasoline vehicles; Regulated emissions; Research programs; Specific reactivity; Natural gas vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072453373

Estimates of aboveground biomass based on well-established methods are relatively abundant: estimates of root biomass based on standard methods are much less common. The goal of this work was to determine if a reliable method to estimate root biomass density for forests could be developed based on existing data from the literature. The forestry literature containing root biomass measurements was reviewed and summarized and relationships between both root biomass density (Mg ha-1) and root:shoot ratios (R/S) as dependent variables and various edaphic and climatic independent variables, singly and in combination, were statistically tested. None of the tested independent variables of aboveground biomass density, latitude, temperature, precipitation, temperature:precipitation ratios, tree type, soil texture, and age had important explanatory value for R/S. However, linear regression analysis showed that aboveground biomass density, age, and latitudinal category were the most important predictors of root biomass density, and together explained 84% of the variation. A comparison of root biomass density estimates based on our equations with those based on use of generalized R/S ratios for forests in the United States indicated that our method tended to produce estimates that were about 20% higher.","Aboveground biomass; Forests; Root biomass; Root:shoot ratio","aboveground biomass; biomass estimation; root biomass; upland forest; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031468880

Average phytomass C densities decreased from south to north while average soil C densities in all three vegetation types generally increased from south to north. The C flux from land cover conversion was divided into a biotic component and a land-use component. We estimate that the total net biotic flux (Tg/yr) was positive (= uptake) in the FSU (631) and the U.S. (332), but negative in Mexico (-37) and Brazil (-16). In contrast, total flux from land use was negative (= emissions) in all four countries (TgC/yr): FSU -342; U.S. -243; Mexico -35; and Brazil -235.

DIfferential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) is used for measuring trace gases, including pollutants like ozone at low concentrations. Multiple wavelengths backscatter and depolarization measurements give information about particles in the atmosphere, and single wavelength lidar can be used for meteorological measurements like wind velocity and temperature. Range resolved in situ data obtained by lidar can play a significant role in our understanding of the air quality in the planetary boundary layer, particularly when applied in conjunction with air quality models. This is because DIAL can be used to measure concentrations in three dimensions in real time with a spatial resolution that corresponds well to that used in the model calculations. Thus one obtains an advantage when comparing with point measurements at or near ground level which are often perturbed by local emissions. A summary of the lidar principle is presented here, followed by different examples of vertical ozone profiles and time series obtained with a new optical layout of the EPFL-LPAS DIAL system using dual telescope detection. These data were obtained during the summer 96 field campaign in the Geneva area. Results are then compared with the mesoscale Eulerian model calculations performed in our laboratory.

During this initial step, the effect of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) on resulting polarization of this artificial galvanic cell was investigated. The previously conditioned electrodes then were left short-circuited, and the naturally flowing galvanic current was measured using a zero-resistance ammeter. In the presence of SRB biofilms, an active and naturally stable galvanic cell was achieved. In sterile conditions, the coupling current either was unstable or very low.

The possibility that elevated CO2 concentrations may alter plant water relations is therefore particularly relevant to pastures and rangelands, and may have important consequences for grassland ecosystem function, water use, carbon storage and nutrient cycling. The planning of effective research to better understand these changes requires attention to both: (i) gaps in knowledge about CO2 and water interactions, and (ii) knowledge of how precisely the effects of CO2 must be understood in relation to other factors, in order to predict changes in grassland structure and production. A recent microcosm experiment illustrates that non-linear effects of CO2 and water stress could perturb primary production by triggering changes in grassland community composition. The magnitudes of the effects of CO2 on key grassland ecosystems remain to be precisely determined through ecosystem-level experiments. A simplified simulation of the impact of different levels of productivity change in a water-limited Australian rangeland system was conducted by varying effects of CO2 on radiation and water use efficiency. The results indicate that direct effects of CO2 may be moderated at the enterprise scale by accompanying changes in adaptive management by farmers. We conclude that future research should aim to construct quantitative relationships and identify thresholds of response for different grassland systems. The sensitivity of these systems to management (such as grazing pressure) should also be considered when developing integrated predictions of future effects of CO2 on water supply to grassland ecosystems. © 1997 Blackwell Science Ltd.","Carbon dioxide; Grassland models; Management; Pastoral agriculture; Production; Water stress","carbon dioxide enrichment; land management; pastoralism; pasture; rangeland; water supply; water use efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031430063

The model is usually refered as the GMSK (Gabric-Murray-Stone-Kohl) model and it is described by Gabric et al. (1993, 1996). The aim of the experiment is to quantify the relative importance of some pre-selected input factors in determining the predicted value of a model state variable: the DMS annual flux. The method is based on an experimental plan, composed of individually randomised one-factor-at-a-time designs, with the purpose of collecting random samples from the distribution of ""elementary effects"", denoted by Fi, associated with each input parameter. A large (absolute) measure of central tendency for Fi indicates an input with an overall influence on the output. A large standard deviation indicates an input whose influence is highly dependent on the values of the other inputs -i.e., one involved in interactions or whose effect is nonlinear. In particular, estimates of the means and standard deviations of these distributions will be used as indicators of which inputs should be considered important. Five of the total number of factors involved in the GMSK model have been exami-ned. The selected factors are: the maximum nitrate uptake by phytoplankton (k23 in the model), the algal S:N (sulphur to nitrogen) ratio (gamma in the model), the parameter involved in the link phytoplankton-protozoa (k3), the initial mixed layer nitrogen concentration (DIN), and the sea surface temperature (SST). The experimental results show that none of the parameters studied has both mean and standard deviation close to zero, that is they all have a direct or indirect effect on the output, confirming that the DMS flux prediction is indeed sensitive to these parameters.","Climate change; Dimethyl-sulfide; Factor screening; One-at-a-time experiment; Sensitivity analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031353628

The mineral assemblages, paragenesis and precipitation temperatures of the veins resemble the Mississippi Valley deposits. Crosscutting relationships with carbonate rocks of the St. Lawrence Lowlands and deformed carbonate rock slivers of the Charlevoix astrobleme show that the Ottawa graben and Saguenay graben veins are younger than mid-Ordovician or post-Devonian, respectively. δ18O and δ13C values for vein calcite are positively correlated and range from +11 to +24‰ and -9 to +3‰, respectively. 87Sr/86Sr in calcite and barite range from 0.7129 to 0.7081. The fluids that precipitated calcite were part of a hydrothermal system dominated by meteoric water enriched in 18O by exchange with silicate minerals and deep-seated carbon, either from mantle outgassing, deep-seated brines of the Canadian Shield or from oxidation of reduced carbon in high-grade metamorphic rocks. Veins cutting marbles of the Grenville Supergroup have lower 87Sr/86Sr and higher δ18O and δ13C values than those hosted in quartzofeldspathic gneisses of the Grenville Province, showing that the fluids were modified by interaction at depth with the marbles. Stable and Sr isotope compositions are also correlated with La/Yb ratios in calcite, supporting the fact that the veins formed within similar hydrothermal systems in both the Ottawa and Saguenay grabens. The Pb isotopic compositions of vein galena are radiogenic (206Pb/204Pb = 18.0-19.7; 207Pb/204Pb = 15.5-15.7; 208Pb/204Pb = 37.9-41.0) and positively correlated in conventional Pb-Pb diagrams. Pb isotope and REE data strongly suggest that the fluids leached selectively, at the mineral scale, gneisses of the Grenville Province. The basinal fluids within the shelf sequence of the western Appalachians had 208Pb/204Pb ratios, in the lower Paleozoic, significantly lower than those of vein galena.

A global view of the dynamics underlying the amplification is provided by a quantum stochastic process governing an interplay between coherence and decoherence. The quantum trajectories decompose into distinct “gain cycles” and “loss cycles” which determine, respectively, the emission and absorption spectra that might be calculated from perturbation theory. Two methods for calculating net gain are developed, motivated by complementary views of the exchange of energy between an atom and a probe field. One time averages the energy radiated continuously by the induced dipole, while the other determines probabilities for discontinuous energy exchange through the emission and absorption of individual quanta. In the latter case, the emission and absorption probabilities are evaluated as sums over probabilities for classical records that define the unobservable exchange of a quantum with the probe field in terms of observable scattering events. Quantum trajectories for a V-type medium driven by a coherent field are compared with those for a medium driven incoherently. Two relationships which connect amplification to population inversion in the latter case are shown to be lacking in the former; hence the possibility for amplification without population inversion arises from the following: (1) a decoupling of the rate of gain-cycle (loss-cycle) initiation from the time-averaged population in the initial state for gain (loss), and (2) loss of the symmetry that the final state for emission be the initial state for absorption and vice versa. The specific influences of these general observations vary from model to model. The details are worked out for the resonant V-type medium, where the quantum trajectory analysis sheds light on the meaning of “without population inversion” and “cancellation of absorption by quantum interference.” © 1997 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000198334

Empirical studies have concentrated on a wide spectrum of countries and run into inevitable problems of data comparability and quality. We avoid these problems by looking at seven types of air emissions across the 50 US states and find all seven pollutants decrease with increasing per capita income. We also find strong evidence of heteroscedasticity with respect to the income-emissions relationship: lower-income states display much greater variability in per capita emission levels than higher-income states. Additionally, we look at the best measured of these emissions, air toxics, for the period 1988-94. Using a simple sign test, we find support for the notion that an increase in income is associated with a decrease in per capita emissions. However, the change in emissions appears to be unrelated to the magnitude of the change in income. We do find, though, that the reduction in per capita emissions is increasing both in terms of the 1988 level of per capita emissions and income.

In order to better understand the factors involved in the amelioration of subsoil acidity, the effects of calcium sulphate, phosphogypsum and calcium carbonate on the properties of the solid and liquid phases of subsoil samples and on the growth and nutrient uptake by maize (Zea mays L.) were evaluated. The soils used were two alic red-yellow latosols, two acric dusky red latosols and one alic dark-red latosol from the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. A vertical split-root technique was used in a greenhouse experiment, with the plants initially grown in a small pot with 130 g fertile soil, which was introduced in a larger pot containing 2 dm3 of the subsoil samples. The treatments consisted of a control (C) and applications of calcium carbonate (CC), calcium sulphate (CS) and phosphogypsum (PG) at the rate of 10 mmol(c) Ca2+ dm-3. CS and PG reduced soil acidity, but in a much smaller proportion than CC. Calcium carbonate reduced the activity of Al3+ because of the increase in pH. Total aluminum and calcium contents in the soil solution were much higher for the red-yellow latosols than for the other soils, indicating lower sorption of Ca2+ and SO4/2- in these soils. The activity of Al in the soil solution was decreased in different ways for the five soils, depending on the ionic strength and the formation of the ionic pair AlSO4/+ and, in the case of PG, the formation of complexes of Al with F (AlF2+, AlF2/+ and AlF3/(o)). The subsoil samples presented severe restrictions for maize root growth and all three treatments were equally effective in increasing root development, which could be attributed to the supply of calcium in one of the acric dusky red latosols and a combined effect of the amendment in reducing the activity of Al and increasing the activity of Ca in the soil solution in the other soils. As a consequence the three treatments increased in the same manner water, N and K uptake from the subsoil and the dry matter production of maize. It can be concluded that, for the soils considered in this research, phosphogypsum is an effective amendment for acid subsoils containing low calcium or toxic aluminum contents.","Al toxicity; Ca deficiency; Maize; Phosphogypsum; Root growth; Subsoil acidity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030756352

A MLS1-lacZ fusion gene, expressed at a basal level in the presence of 2% glucose, is derepressed more than 100-fold under conditions of sugar limitation. No evidence for MLS1 induction by oleic acid was found. By deletion analysis of the MLS1 control region, we identified two sites, UAS1 and UAS2, as important for efficient derepression of the gene. Both sites contain sequences that resemble the previously characterized carbon source-responsive element (CSRE) found in the promoter of the isocitrate lyase gene ICL1. Indeed, UAS1 and UAS2 in the MLS1 upstream region turn out to be functional CSRE sequence variants. This finding allowed us to define a modified version of the CSRE consensus sequence (CCRTYSRNCCG). Protein binding to UAS1(MLS1) was observed with extracts from derepressed but not from repressed cells, and could be competed for by an excess of the unlabelled CSRE(ICL1) sequence. No competition was observed with a mutated CSRE variant. Site-directed mutagenesis of both CSREs in the MLS1 promoter reduced gene activation under derepressing conditions to 20% of the wild-type level. The same decrease was observed with the wild-type MLS1 promoter in a cat8 mutant, lacking an activator of CSRE-dependent transcription. The CSRE/Cat8p-independent activation of MLS1 is mediated by constitutive UAS elements. The pleiotropic transcription factor Abf1p, which binds to the MLS1 upstream region, may contribute to constitutive activation. Thus, in order to ensure the severe glucose repression of MLS1 observed, repressor elements that respond to the carbon source must counteract constitutive activation. In summary, ICL1 and MLS1 share common cis-acting elements, although a distinct mechanism of carbon source control also contributes to MLS1 regulation.","Gluconeogenesis; Malate synthase; MLS1; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Transcriptional regulation","carbon; isocitrate lyase; malate synthase; transcription factor; article; consensus sequence; controlled study; deletion mutant; dna responsive element; dna sequence; gene; gene activation; gene expression regulation; gene mutation; gene repression; metabolism; nonhuman; pleiotropy; priority journal; promoter region; protein dna binding; saccharomyces cerevisiae; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Carbon; Consensus Sequence; DNA, Fungal; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Genes, Fungal; Malate Synthase; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030832065

Influencing factors taken into consideration are the general climatic conditions for plant growth, the soil fertility, the soil moisture ávailability, the precipitation uncertainty and the erosion risk due to the steepness of slopes. Comparison of our marginality index with present global assessments of agricultural land use shows that about 30 % of agricultural land currently in use can be identified as marginal, in other words as having a disposition towards overuse and potential environmental degradation. The validity of our approach is strengthened by the fact that agriculturally used areas identified as marginal are described as vulnerable in the literature. The risk of degradation with a further intensification of agriculture on existing crop land and the potential for the cultivation of previously unused land can be identified using our fuzzy logic technique.","Agriculture; Fuzzy logic; Global assessment; Land use; Marginality; Vulnerability","agricultural land; environmental degradation; fuzzy logic; global perspective; man-environment relations; marginality index",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030815859

The selective destruction of nigrostriatal neurons by MPP+ is dependent on a unique sequence of events (transport into the nerve terminals by the dopamine transporter, localization in the inner mitochondrial membrane by electromotive forces, and inhibition of complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain) that, fortunately, are unlikely to be encountered with many substances. A second example of a well-documented metabolic bioactivation sequence involves the highly toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (102). These compounds undergo cytochrome P450-catalyzed α-carbon oxidation which converts the 3-pyrrolinyl moiety present in the parent alkaloids into a pyrrolyl-containing metabolite (105). The presence of labile functional groups results in the spontaneous conversion of 105 to reactive electrophilic products (106 and 108) that undergo Michael addition reactions with nucleophiles on biomacromolecules leading to a variety of toxic outcomes. Less clearly defined are the potential contributions to neurodegenerative processes that may be mediated by low-level, long term exposure to less potent toxins. Examples of potential proneurotoxins are the endogenously formed tetrahydroisoquinolines (such as 40-50) and tetrahydro-β-carbolines (such as 54) that may be biotransformed to neurotoxic isoquinolinium (such as 51) and β-carbolinium (such as 52) species in the brain. A similar argument can be made for 4-piperidinols (compounds that are at the same oxidation state as the tetrahydropyridines) which may be metabolized via iminium intermediates to amino enols that spontaneously convert to dihydropyridinium species and hence to pyridinium metabolites (67 → 68 → 69 → 70 → 71, Scheme 10). This type of reaction sequence has been well documented with the parkinsonian-inducing neuroleptic agent haloperidol (72) which is metabolized in humans, baboons, and rodents to the pyridinium species HPP+ (75), a potent inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration. Finally, an appreciation of the α-carbon oxidations of fully reduced azacycles such as (S)-nicotine (61) and phencyclidine (82) to chemically reactive metabolites that form covalent adducts with proteins, including the enzymes that are responsible for their formation, may prove of toxicological importance when attempting to account for the effects of chronic abuse of these potent drugs.",,"1,2,3,6 tetrahydro 1 methyl 4 phenylpyridine; amine oxidase (flavin containing); cytochrome p450; heterocyclic compound; isoquinoline derivative; neurotoxin; nicotine; phencyclidine; piperidine derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative; pyridinium derivative; pyrrolizidine alkaloid; tertiary amine; tetrahydroisoquinoline; tryptoline; biotransformation; drug abuse; nerve degeneration; oxidation; reaction analysis; review; Amines; Animals; Aza Compounds; Biotransformation; Humans; Oxidation-Reduction; Papio; Parkinsonia; Rodentia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030869610

We hypothesized that the changes in soil properties induced by vegetation removal modified the runoff and soil erosion response in a semiarid area of Spain. To test this, two plots (15 by 5 m) were installed on a 23% slope on a Lithic Haploxeroll. Vegetation was removed by clipping from one of the plots (Plot D) and the changes in surface runoff and soil loss were compared with an undisturbed control plot (Plot N) from 1989 to 1993. Total runoff was significantly greater in Plot D (48.8 mm) than in Plot N (34.9 mm). Runoff ratios between the disturbed and natural plots increased with time from 1.4:1 in 1990 to 2.5:1 in 1993. Vegetation removal increased the soil losses in Plot D (150.2 g m-2) by 127% compared with those in Plot N (66.3 g m-2). The annual soil loss ratio between the disturbed and natural plots increased from 1.6:1 in 1989 to 4.2:1 in 1993. The observed increase in surface runoff and soil loss was attributed to a progressive deterioration of soil physical properties in Plot D. Bulk density increased by 8.4% (from 1.55 to 1.68 Mg m-3) and a reduction of total organic carbon (from 4.0 to 2.6%) and the percentage of stable aggregates (from 81.6 to 56.3%) were observed. There was no evidence of vegetation recovery, suggesting that reduced vegetal cover might lead to irreversible soil degradation in semiarid areas.",,"runoff; soil; vegetation; water management; desertification; plant cover; runoff; semiarid region; soil degradation; soil loss; Spain; Arid regions; Density (specific gravity); Erosion; Organic compounds; Plants (botany); Runoff; Soil degradation; Vegetation; Soil conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030609762

In some cases, both hydroxyl and methanol masers are present. Maser position measurements of both species are then especially useful for exploring the immediate surroundings of the new-born star. The present study used the Australia Telescope Compact Array to observe 6.035-GHz OH maser emission in 35 fields; 30 of these were also observed at the 6.668-GHz methanol transition. In many of the fields the masers were found to be grouped into several distinct maser sites, allowing a total of 62 sites to be studied. Relative positions at 6.035 and 6.668 GHz could be registered to an accuracy of 0.1 arcsec. 29 sites harbour both 6.035-GHz OH and 6.668-GHz methanol, and most of these have sufficient maser features to reveal that the distributions of OH and methanol are largely co-extensive, with total extents between 10 and 30 mpc (milliparsec). Elongated morphologies are common in both the OH and methanol distributions. The new-born star associated with each group of masers is not visible, but is expected to generate an enveloping ultracompact H II region. Such H II regions have been detected (as compact radio sources, mostly by searching continuum images made from the present observations) at 23 of the present maser sites. For these, the projected distribution of the masers was mapped relative to the H II region. In most cases, the masers are confined to a zone that covers only a portion of the H II region, and is commonly offset from the centre of the H II region, but rarely lies at its projected boundary. The masing zone can be plausibly identified as centred on the (unseen) principal exciting star of the H II region, with the maser distribution corresponding to a torus or ring, in some cases small enough to suggest that it may be embedded within the H II region. The fact that the typical extent is confined to less than 30 mpc can be used in some cases to establish distances once the angular extent has been measured. The sample of maser sites studied here is OH-selected and thus biased towards sites with strong OH emission. The high rate of strong H II region detections among them indicates a marked trend (but not a close correlation) for H II regions to be more prominent towards OH-favoured maser sites than methanol-favoured sites. © 1997 RAS.","H II regions; ISM: molecules; Masers; Radio lines: ISM; Stars: formation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038917932

The long-term output characteristics and their dependence on the mixture's composition determined in the experiment gave a hint concerning the thorough theoretical analysis of decomposition in CO2:N2: He laser mixtures. The observed optimal concentration of N2 lies within the range 30% ≤ [N2] ≤ 50% and that of CO2 is about 2-3% for the laser under consideration. In the theoretical analyses of available data we focus our attention on the roles played by the gas pressure, the mixture composition and the growth of the afterglow region in the reduction of working gas degradation. The CO2 equilibrium conversion Xe decreases with increasing gas pressure. A 50% reduction in Xe is obtained when the pressure increases from 13.33 to 46.66 hPa. The observed optimal composition corresponds to low reactivity of the laser plasma with a small oxygen content. The optimal period for the laser gas mixture to reside in the afterglow region is larger by a factor of 1000 than the discharge residence time. The relatively small value of the CO2 equilibrium conversion in the MLT 1200 laser results from relatively high concentrations of atomic and electronically excited species.

Dynamic contrast- enhanced scanning at the same level was employed to image the cerebral circulation at the rate of 1 image per second. Using data acquired with this non-helical mode of scanning, we have developed a method for the simultaneous in-vivo determination of cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and mean transit time (MTT). These measurements are given in the same physiological units as positron emission tomography. In order to obtain accurate measurements of these parameters, methods were also developed to correct for recirculation and partial volume averaging in imaging small blood vessels. We have used 6 New Zealand white rabbits in our studies. For each rabbit, up to 3 CT measurements of CBF, CBV, and MTT were made at normocapnia under isoflurane anesthesia. Coronal sections through the brain were imaged while simultaneously imaging either a brain artery or the ear artery. Images were acquired for 1 minute as Isovue 300 was injected intravenously. In the acquired CT images, regions of interest in brain parenchyma and an artery were drawn. For each region of interest, the mean CT number in pre-contrast images was subtracted from the mean in post-contrast images to calculate the contrast concentration curves for the brain regions Q(t) and the arterial region Ca(t). Using a robust deconvolution method, the MTT was determined. CBV was then determined from the ratio of the areas of Q(t) and Ca(t). Finally, CBF was calculated from the Central Volume Principle. The mean regional CBF, CBV and MTT values were 73.3 ± 5.1 ml/min/100g, 1.93 ± 0.12 ml/100g and 1.80 ± 0.18 s respectively. IN order to validate our CT CBF measurements, we also measured CBF using the well- established technique of microspheres with each CT study. The feasibility of our CT method to measure CBF accurately was demonstrated by an almost one-to-one correspondence between CT CBF and microspheres CBF measurements. The slope of the linear regression line between the two sets of CBF measurements was 0.97 ± 0.03 with a correlation coefficient of 0.837.",,"Biomechanics; Blood; Brain; Data processing; Image processing; Medical imaging; Scanning; Cerebral perfusion; Hemodynamic parameters; Multidimensional images; Magnetic resonance imaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031346551

Field tests reveal station car users like and feel safe driving small electric vehicles to and from rail stations, but few are willing to pay enough to cover full costs. The early stages of a pilot program in the city of Emeryville showed that station cars were used more for non-commute than commute purposes and have the potential to significantly induce work-trip modal shifts to rail transit. In addition to introducing bi-directional programs that share station cars at both the work and home ends of commute trips, vehicle co-ops and instant rental car technologies could make station cars economically viable. Over the long run, however, the degree to which station cars become commercially available will likely rely on market-based principles gaining wider acceptance in America's urban transportation sector.",,"Cost effectiveness; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Railroad cars; Electric station cars; Electric locomotives",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031084544

A threshold level of 0.0001 lb/year for Cr VI emissions has been established by the California Air Resources Board for reporting under Assembly Bill 2588. A need for an innovative control technology to reduce fugitive emissions of Cr VI was identified during the Air Toxic Emissions Reduction Program at Northrop Grumman Military Aircraft Systems Division (NGMASD). NGMASD operates an aircraft assembly facility in El Segundo, CA. Nearly all of the aircraft components are coated with a protective coating (primer) prior to assembly. The primer has Cr VI as a component for its excellent corrosion resistance property. The complex assembly process requires fasteners which also need primer coating. Therefore, NGMASD utilizes High Volume Low Pressure (HVLP) guns for the touch-up spray coating operations. During the touch-up spray coating operations, Cr VI particles are atomized and transferred to the aircraft surface. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) has determined that the HVLP gun transfers 65% of the paint particles onto the substrate and the remaining 35% are emitted as an overspray if air pollution controls are not applied. NGMASD has developed the Portable Air Pollution Control Equipment (PAPCE) to capture and control the overspray in order to reduce fugitive Cr VI emissions from the touch-up spray coating operations. A source test was performed per SCAQMD guidelines and the final report has been approved by the SCAQMD.",,"Air quality; Chromium; Particulate emissions; Portable equipment; Sprayed coatings; Fugitive emissions; Touch up spray coatings; Air pollution control equipment",Conference Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031345777

We use coordination theory to develop a simple exponential model that considers allocation of dry matter between shoots and roots during growth in relation to carbon and water supplies, and accounts for the effects of water stress on growth. We compare coordination vs. optimization (global and local) versions of the exponential model by examining similarities and differences in model behaviour obtained under constant and variable environmental conditions, and with drastically changing conditions (mild, moderate and severe water stress). The greatest differences between coordination and optimization exist in the drastically changing conditions. In a second version of the model, we remove the restriction of exponential growth and show how coordination principles can be extended to a more complicated structure. The non-exponential model is used to analyse experimental data on the effects of different pot sizes (and hence water availability) on root restriction and plant growth as reported by Thomas and Strain (Plant Physiology 96:627 634. 1991). With further refinements, the coordination model has potential as a tool to model plant growth in relation to water supply under various environmental conditions.","Functional balance; Optimization; Root restriction; Root: shoot ratio",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030858285

The summer extends more than 5 mo in Florida, while it only lasts 3 mo in Maine. In the mid-Atlantic region, there are 2 longer seasons (summer and winter; about 4 mo each) and 2 shorter seasons (spring and fall; about 2 mo each). The seasonal definition proposed here more closely corresponds to phenological responses than do traditional definitions. The information can be applied to numerous environmental assessment problems, including animal demographics and habitat distributions, plant phenology and subsequent pollen release, migration and hibernation patterns, human health and psychological responses to climate, and agricultural planning activities.","Air masses; Climatological seasons; Discriminant function analysis; Spatial synoptic classification; Synoptic climatology","Animalia; air mass; climate season; regional weather pattern; synoptic classification; USA, Atlantic Coast",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031422038

One potentially large benefit of Title IV is the expected improvement in visibility conditions in the eastern United States due to the reductions in secondary sul-fate aerosols. This paper combines available economic estimates of willingness to pay for improvements in visibility with current estimates of the difference between expected visibility conditions in the eastern United States with and without Title I V, to estimate the expected visibility benefits of Title IV.

The study area was selected because it represents a large portion of Uruguayan land (21 %) almost exclusively oriented to cattle production; due to the variety of soil types in this region it was possible to analyze contrasting situations regarding vulnerability to the occurrence of extreme climatic events - such as droughts - and to potential climate changes. The information used, which included soil texture, organic matter content and hydrologic characteristics, corresponded to a representative soil of the Itapebi Tres Arboles unit. The weather data used were daily records for precipitation, as well as air temperature, solar radiation and wind run data simulated with a climate generator program. The model was run for the 1961-1990 period under normal (present day) carbon dioxide concentration conditions. The analysis focussed particularly on the SPUR2 outputs of the hydrology and plant submodels. Biomass production simulations showed a good representation of reality with regard to annual production. However, they differed from the actual data available for this area with regard to the seasonal distribution of forage. The results of the hydrology submodel significantly departed from the expected values. Potential evapotranspiration reached monthly values 148% above normal (observed), which could be partly explained by the fact that the global solar radiation estimates were higher than the real values.","Climate change; Grazing system; Natural pastures; Simulation model; SPUR2","Bos taurus; agricultural production; climate change; developing country; global environmental change; grazing system; modelling approach; nature society relations; pasture; rangeland; rangelands; SPUR2 model; Uruguay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031390761

The results showed that the difference spectra, obtained by subtracting the devices' pre-stress spectra from the post-stress spectra, could be used for distinguishing the effects of interface states and trapped charges. Interface states cause enhanced surface scattering and therefore increase the efficiency of photon emission while trapped charges drive the current away from the surface of the channel and reduce the photon emission efficiency.",,"Electric currents; Emission spectroscopy; Hot carriers; Interfaces (materials); Light emission; Light scattering; Photons; Substrates; Double diffused drain (DDD) MOSFET devices; Large angle tilt implanted drain (LATID) MOSFET devices; MOSFET devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031558465

The improvement of leakage properties of BST films can be attributed to the elimination of the bulged curve in the leakage current characteristics.

It also requires a modified vertical wind field to minimize possible local accumulation or drainage of species mass. A model with a fixed layer-depth structure may require many layers to better resolve the mixing height and contains an explicit challenge to define the thickness of the lowest layer that carries most precursor emission sources. This challenge, also present implicitly in the varying layer-depth case, could be addressed only if well- resolved mixing information or the eddy diffusivity profile under realistic physical environments were available, especially at night and in the morning. The impact on air quality predictions of using a fixed layer-depth and a varying layer-depth structure in the Urban Airshed Model is compared. Under the given input information and existing model assumptions, the fixed layer- depth approach yields substantially higher hourly concentrations of NO, CO, and VOC in the lowest layer in isolated areas in the early morning than the varying layer-depth approach. When different spatial resolutions are used in the fixed layer-depth approach, the resulting spatial concentration distributions tend to be more similar between the different spatial resolutions than between a fixed layer-depth approach and the varying layer- depth approach. The fixed, 11-layer model tends to yield lower precursor concentrations than the fixed, 6-layer model in the morning. Insofar as emission control is concerned, because the location of the predicted peak O3 concentration tends to shift differently for the different model versions when NO(x) emissions are reduced, it becomes difficult to reveal a general pattern rather independent of the vertical layer structure. If we ignore the shift in location and time of the O3 peak, then it may be fortuitous that the relative changes in the predicted peaks appear rather consistent among the different model versions, especially for the 8-h O3 peak.",,"carbon monoxide; nitric oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; article; model; structure analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031035917

These limits apply to engines as small as 50 horsepower. Other areas of the country could eventually follow this trend if attainment is not achieved or if air quality standards are tightened. Internal combustion engines can be ripe targets for further controls because of their high aggregate emissions. Problems can occur when the emissions limits are tightened. For instance, when certain districts initially adopted technology-forcing limits, other districts later referred to those levels as available before the technology was even implemented. Occasionally, the limits were so low as to force replacement of many of the engines with electric motors. Both regulators and industry must make crucial decisions several years prior to implementing regulations whether they apply to engines or other equipment. These include setting emission limits with only predictions and assumptions on the technology's reliability and feasibility. Optimistic predictions of control technology performance could lead to significant compliance problems after start-up. On the other hand, ignoring the realities of technological advances could result in setting overly conservative limits. This may lead to the addition of more costly controls on other source types in order to meet total emission reduction goals. This paper will discuss steps that industry and government should take when developing incrementally more restrictive regulations. These include determining a valid inventory of existing engines, predicting future horsepower requirements, determining the amount of power reduction that may occur, analyzing the effects from real-world operating conditions, evaluating both unsubstantiated claims of performance and denials of progress, determining the difference between currently available technology and an arbitrary limit, calculating a realistic incremental cost effectiveness, and finally developing justifiable compliance alternatives. © Copyright 1997, Society of Petroleum Engineers, Inc.",,"Air quality; Air quality standards; Combustion; Compliance control; Cost effectiveness; Emission control; Forecasting; Petroleum prospecting; Adopted technology; Conservative limits; Control requirements; Control technologies; Operating condition; Power reductions; Stationary internal combustion engine; Technological advances; Internal combustion engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088203732

We estimate that the global direct radiative forcing is about -0.4 W m-2 with a maximum over Europe where the strongest anthropogenic sulfur emissions occur. With different approaches for the formation of anthropogenic sulfate and its relation to aerosol size distribution, we estimate that the indirect forcing may range from -0.6 to -1.6 W m-2. This range reduces to -0.4 to -1.1 W m-2 if a prescribed marine background particle number concentration is universally applied over the ocean. Contrary to the direct effect which is more significant over continents, the calculated maximum of indirect forcing is located over the Atlantic Ocean near the coastline of North America. Our simulations indicate that anthropogenic sulfate may result in important increases in reflected solar radiation, which would mask locally the warming from increased greenhouse gases. We also compare the simulated cloud drop effective radii with those retrieved from satellite data to validate the accuracy of our cloud drop parameterization.",,"aerosol; anthropogenic aerosol; radiative forcing; sulphate aerosol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0012795448

It is found that the emission current j increases with increasing doping density n. Such n-dependence is obtained if the internal voltage drop in the semiconductor is taken into account. The j is also calculated for several electron affinities χ. It is also found that for the reported values of χ, the emission current from a planar electrode can not describe the measured I-V curve. If a Taylor-cone tip is assumed to be a hexagonal pyramid emitter, the field intensity F around the cone apex is strong enough to yield j in agreement with experiment.

Control and reduction of air pollution from combustion is more feasible than from other sources because of its discrete localization. The gaseous products of combustion inevitably include H2O and CO2, NO and/or NO2, and may include N2O, SO2, SO3 and unburned and partially burned hydrocarbons. Soot, ash and other dispersed solids may also be present, but are not considered herein. Unburned and partially burned hydrocarbons are prima facie evidence of poor mechanics of combustion and should not be tolerated. On the other hand, NOx, SO2 and SO3 are unavoidable if the fuel contains nitrogen and sulfur. The best remedy in this latter case is to remove these species from the fuel. Otherwise their products of combustion must be removed by absorption, adsorption or reaction. NOx from the fixation of N2 in the air and CO may be minimized by advanced techniques of combustion. One such method is described in some detail. If CO2 must be removed this can be accomplished by absorption, adsorption or reaction, but precooling is necessary and the quantity is an order of magnitude greater than that of any of the other pollutants. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Air pollution; Incineration; Thermally stabilized combustion","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur compounds; Thermal stabilization; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031176113

[1991] to describe the organic emission of isoprene-emitting plants has been used for predicting monoterpene emission from Quercus ilex L., an evergreen oak typical of the Mediterranean basin. The dependence of monoterpene emission on photosynthetically active radiation and temperature has been verified through laboratory experiments carried out on single leaves as well as through field measurements at branch level. While the algorithm describes well monoterpene emission under stationary state conditions, it is less accurate when rapid fluctuations of light and temperature take place. Because of this, the isoprene algorithm is capable of predicting the response of Quercus ilex L. with an accuracy better than ±25% only in 65% of the environmental situations experienced by the plant. Field and laboratory observations consistently indicate that temperature oscillations can be an important source for the discrepancies between predicted and observed values as they can generate bursts of emission with values twice as high as those predicted by the algorithm. Possible causes generating these effects are analyzed and critically discussed. In spite of the observed limitations, the isoprene algorithm can successfully describe the biogenic emission from Quercus ilex L., and its use is advantageous as it greatly simplifies regional and global emission models, especially if the light dependence of monoterpene emission is proven to be a widespread phenomenon.",,"isoprene algorithm; monoterpene emission; oak; PAR",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031422836

Ambassador) exposed to 150 nmol mol-1 of ozone (5 days, 5 h day-1). Gas-exchange measurements revealed a reduction in CO2 assimilation and stomatal conductance, accompanied by an increase in the intercellular CO2 concentration both in young and in mature leaves as compared to their respective controls. In both leaves, F0 remained unchanged, while F(m) and the F(v)/F(m) ratio decreased after O3 fumigation, indicating that ozone may induce an alteration in the capability of photosystem II (PSII) to reduce the primary acceptor Q(A). In the mature leaves the photochemical quenching (q(P)) was significantly lowered by the pollutant, but this was not the case in the young leaves where q(P) did not change. In both mature and young ozonated pumpkin leaves, the development of non-photo-chemical quenching caused a decrease in the PSII photochemical rate, as shown by the correlation between F(v)/F(m) and the de-epoxidation state of dark-adapted leaves. Decreases in the F(v)/F(m) ratio are generally attributed to damage to the PSII reaction centre, apart from the down-regulation of the capacity of PSII electron transport. While in young ozonated leaves the decrease in the F(v)/F(m) ratio was not associated with damage to the D1 protein, in mature ozonated pumpkin leaves, the decrease in the F(v)/F(m) was accompanied by a significant decline in the D1 content. In conclusion, ozone exposure induces alterations in the light reactions of photosynthesis in both young and mature leaves. However, in young leaves the engagement of the xanthophyll cycle appears to counteract ozone effects against the photosynthetic apparatus as demonstrated by the absence of damage to the D1 protein. On the other hand, the loss of D1 protein in mature fumigated leaves suggests that the activation of the xanthophyll cycle is not sufficient to prevent photoinhibition, probably because a physiological state of senescence adds to the oxidative stress.","Clorophyll a fluorescence; Cucurbita pepo; D1 protein; Gas exchanges; Ozone; Pumpkin; Xanthophyll cycle",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031424556

In the early years the reduction of emissions was the only approach to improving water quality. By 1975 there were two approaches to water quality management: a direct emission approach and a water quality approach. From 1981 on the water quality approach was focused on human and on ecological interests. Related to the use of surface water a number of function-related sets of quality standards has been introduced. From the ecological point of view a three level system was introduced in 1985. The lowest level is set as a minimum for all Dutch surface waters. More stringent standards are appropriate to waters which have a nature function. Related to the ecological approach it is necessary to distinguish water types, even at the lowest ecological level. In the province of Friesland a biotypological division has been made, resulting in 14 water types. For every type relevant physico-chemical quality standards have been derived. In the provincial Water Policy Plan a large number of aquatic ecosystems have been given a function as 'specific ecological objectives'. These ecological objectives have been worked out for various comparable environmental groups of waters. Standards are given for physico-chemical as well as biological parameters. The actual situation is far from the desired one. Eutrophication, contamination with micropollutants, acidification, desiccation, physical fragmentation and disturbance are the main causes of problems for good ecological water quality. From 1990 area-orientated restoration projects have been carried out.

In particular, it is acknowledged that natural gas has the potential to reduce the inventory of particulate matter, and this has encouraged the use of natural gas engines in transit bus applications. Extensive data on natural gas and diesel bus emissions have been gathered using two Transportable Heavy Duty Vehicle Emissions Testing Laboratories, that employ chassis dynamometers to simulate bus inertia and road load. Most of the natural gas buses tested prior to 1997 were powered by Cummins L-10 engines, which were lean-burn and employed a mechanical mixer for fuel introduction. The Central Business District (CBD) cycle was used as the test schedule. The potential of these natural gas engines to reduce emissions significantly was demonstrated, but vehicles that had strayed from a proper state of tune were found to emit high levels of carbon monoxide, and could emit oxides of nitrogen at higher levels than their diesel counterparts, emphasizing the need for careful maintenance. Recently, one of the Transportable Laboratories tested ten compressed natural gas and three diesel buses in Atlanta, GA and seven diesel buses in Flint, MI. The natural gas vehicles were powered by Detroit Diesel Series 50 G 275hp engines, which employ lean burn, with electronically managed fueling without feedback control. CBD cycle emissions data showed that the natural gas buses offered lower levels of oxide of nitrogen emissions than their diesel counterparts, and that their particulate emissions were exceptionally low. Oxides of nitrogen emissions ranged from 26.1 to 60.4 grams/kilometer while carbon monoxide emissions were consistently close to 14.5 grams/kilometer for all of the Atlanta natural gas buses. Data are also available from these buses to show the methane versus non-methane split of hydrocarbons, and data also show the emissions reduction associated with correcting an ignition system fault on one bus. In addition, the effect of the test cycle on diesel bus emissions has been discussed.",,"Buses; Carbon monoxide; Compressed natural gas; Diesel engines; Dynamometers; Emission control; Gas emissions; Gas engines; Laboratories; Load testing; Methane; Carbon monoxide emissions; Central business districts; Chassis dynamometers; Emissions reduction; Heavy duty vehicles; Nitrogen emissions; Oxides of nitrogen; Particulate Matter; Natural gas vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072448786

Such measurements are fundamental for the understanding of Mercury's origin and the inner solar system's history. The spin-stabilized Mercury Orbiter proposed for launch in the first or second decade of the twenty-first century as part of the ESA's Horizon 2000-plus plan could address this problem by including the X-ray spectrometer proposed here. X-ray spectrometers act as detectors for the X-ray emission induced by the solar flux incident on planetary surfaces. This emission is strongly dependent on the chemical composition of the surface as well as on the solar spectrum. Characteristic fluorescent lines, the most prominent being the K-alpha lines, are of sufficient intensity for major elements (Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Fe) to allow orbital measurement by remote X-ray detectors. The X-ray spectrometers described here will all have established heritage for space missions by 2000. These instruments have previously flown, are being flown as part of the NASA NEAR (Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous) or Clark SSTI (Small Science and Technology Initiative) missions, or are now under development as part of NASA Facility Instrument Development Program. The instrument package would probably consist of an array of solid state detectors for surface measurements, as well as one which would act as a solar monitor. Calculations of anticipated results have been done for a variety of orbital and instrument configurations, and a variety of lunar soil compositions which could be analogous : anorthosific gabbro bearing soils from lunar highlands (Apollo 16), high-Mg basaltrich soils from a KREEP-bearing area (Apollo 15), and mare basalt bearing soils (Apollo 12). The mission being considered here should result in maps of abundances of major elements, including Mg, Al, Si, Ca, and Fe, for much of Mercury's surface; with resolutions ranging from tens to hundreds of kilometers depending on the element, the orbital eccentricity and altitude of the spacecraft. © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd, All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9744261780

The rules of the model are more complex than those of a typical CA and involve the use of multiple data sources, including topography, road networks, and existing settlement distributions, and their modification over time. In addition, the control parameters of the model are allowed to self-modify: that is, the CA adapts itself to the circumstances it generates, in particular, during periods of rapid growth or stagnation. In addition, the model was written to allow the accumulation of probabilistic estimates based on Monte Carlo methods. Calibration of the model has been accomplished by the use of historical maps to compare model predictions of urbanization, based solely upon the distribution in year 1900, with observed data for years 1940, 1954, 1962, 1974, and 1990. The complexity of this model has made calibration a particularly demanding step. Lessons learned about the methods, measures, and strategies developed to calibrate the model may be of use in other environmental modeling contexts. With the calibration complete, the model is being used to generate a set of future scenarios for the San Francisco Bay area along with their probabilities based on the Monte Carlo version of the model.

It is necessary, however, to be able to confidently attribute observed fluorescence changes to electrical effects alone and avoid interference from changes in membrane fluidity. Furthermore, the effect of the dyes themselves on the dipole potential must be investigated. The effect of membrane fluidity on the fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of the dyes RH421 and di-8-ANEPPS have been investigated in lipid vesicles by temperature scans between 15 and 60°C. Both dyes show significant temperature-dependent shifts of their excitation spectra, the magnitude of which depend on the emission wavelength and on the lipid structure. In order to eliminate membrane fluidity effects, fluorescence must be detected at the red edge of the emission spectrum; in this case 670 nm. In order to avoid dye-induced shifts of the excitation spectra of membrane-bound dye, an excess molar ratio of lipid to dye of at least 200-fold is necessary. Fluorescence ratio measurements indicate qualitatively that dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine has a significantly higher dipole potential than that of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine.","Dipole potential; Excited state relaxation; Lipid vesicle; Na+,K+-ATPase; Viscosity; Voltage sensitive dye","adenosine triphosphatase (potassium sodium); fluorescent dye; article; dipole; fluorescence; lipid vesicle; membrane fluidity; membrane potential; priority journal; viscosity; Cell Membrane; Fluorescent Dyes; Ketocholesterols; Membrane Fluidity; Membrane Lipids; Membrane Potentials; Phloretin; Phosphatidylcholines; Pyridinium Compounds; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Styrenes; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031012421

Clayton also describes the role he played in transferring the lead federal role for community air pollution to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

Data indicate that N2O is mainly formed in the biofilm by nitrification and/or denitrification. In laboratory experiments, samples with wastewater and wastewater/biofilm mixture were incubated with and without NaCl. After two hours of incubation, N2O release was in a range of 42...429 ng N2O per millilitre wastewater or wastewater/biofilm. Incubated samples without NaCl addition showed no significant difference between wastewater and wastewater/biofilm mixture. If salt (NaCl) was added before incubation, samples with wastewater/biofilm mixture emitted 4.8 times more N2O than wastewater samples. It is assumed that high concentrations of NaCl inhibit further microbial reduction of N2O to N2.

The screening of the projectile charge by the projectile electrons reduces the backward electron emission.

In addition a pronounced increase of the (Formula presented) with increasing Z is also observed. It was found that the increase of the (Formula presented) with Z in the medium velocity region (∼1 MeV/u) is not a 'nuclear charge' effect, but is simply due to the difference in the incident number of projectile electrons.

Because some species with alpine affinities persist on high elevation rock outcrops in these mountains and because of our interest in the potential impacts of past and future climate changes on rare plants, we sought answers to the following questions: At what elevation would climatic treeline occur in these mountains under current climatic conditions if the mountains were higher and how variable are predictions based on different methods and assumptions? We compared sixteen estimates based on geographic, vegetational, floristic, and climatic lines of evidence in order to bracket the potential treeline. At 36°N in eastern North America these estimates showed considerable variation, ranging from 2,009 m to 3,237 m (28 m lower to 1,200 m higher than the highest summit). World-wide latitude averages probably overestimate treeline because of differences in continentality among sites, while extrapolations from the northern Appalachians underestimate it because of importance of particular climatic factors in northern latitudes. Non-linear or site-specific methods using extrapolation of vegetation zones, alpine species distributions, or temperature correlations give estimates that lie between these extremes. The range of the four independent methods that we considered the most appropriate for the southern Appalachians was 2,285 to 2,600 m, with an average of 2,417 m (7,930 ft.). We believe that the most realistic prediction of treeline elevation in the southern Appalachians, combining local summer temperature regime with the best treeline isotherm from maritime east Asia (11.9°C), is 2434 m (7,985 ft), 397 m (1,301 ft) above the highest southern Appalachian peaks.",,"alpine environment; Treeline; North America, Applachians",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031399977

The evidence derives from studies of lung cancer trends, studies of occupational groups, comparisons of urban and rural populations, and case-control and cohort studies using diverse exposure metrics. Recent prospective cohort studies observed 30-50% increases in the risk of lung cancer in relation to approximately a doubling of respirable particle exposure. While these data reflect the effects of exposures in past decades, and despite some progress in reducing air pollution, large numbers of people in the US continue to be exposed to pollutant mixtures containing known or suspected carcinogens. These observations suggest that the most widely cited estimates of the proportional contribution of air pollution to lung cancer occurrence in the US, based largely on the results of animal experimentation, may be too low. It is important that better epidemiologic research be conducted to allow improved estimates of lung cancer risk from air pollution in the general population, The development and application of new epidemiologic methods, particularly the improved characterization of population-wide exposure to mixtures of air pollutants and the improved design of ecologic studies, could improve our ability to measure accurately the magnitude of excess cancer related to air pollution.","Air pollution; Lung neoplasms/risk; Review","air pollutant; air pollution; human; lung cancer; review; risk factor",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030928563

Although the competences of local authorities vary between countries, they all have some responsibilities in the crucial areas of energy and transport policy. This paper examines local competences in Sweden and the UK and looks at the responses to the climate change issue by six local authorities, focussing on energy related developments. The points of departure are very different in the two countries. Swedish local authorities are much more independent than UK ones, especially through the ownership of local energy companies. Yet, UK local authorities are relatively active in the climate change domain, at least in terms of drawing up response strategies, which they see as an opportunity for reasserting their role, after a long period of erosion of their powers. Furthermore, there is more scope for action in the UK, as in Sweden many potential measures; especially in the energy efficiency field, have already been taken. However, in both countries climate change is only a relatively marginal area of local environmental policy making and the political will, as well as the financial resources, for more radical measures are often absent.",,"climate change; comparative study; energy policy; environmental policy; global change; international comparison; local initiative; Sweden; UK",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031107117

In order to test the model, reductions in inorganic carbon uptake are related to nitrate uptake in axenic cultures of seven species of microalgae during perturbations of the nutrient regime under photosynthesizing conditions. For 4 data sets out of 5, 70 to 99% of the variability in reduction in carbon uptake could be explained by variations in nitrate uptake. Given the specificity of nitrate uptake to phytoplankton, it is suggested that such a variable could be used to obtain reliable estimates of algal respiration in the field in presence of other respiring organisms such as zooplankton or bacteria. The model yields values which are consistent with classical estimates of algal respiration (about 10% of gross photosynthesis) under conditions of balanced growth only. However, during nutrient pulsing such as that occurring near the bottom of the euphotic zone in stratified aquatic areas, the model indicates that growth-related respiration may reach 50% of gross photosynthesis.","Inorganic carbon release; Nitrate uptake; Phytoplankton","algae; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030918186

However, the specific effects of these Zn2+dependent interactions on physiological processes remains unclear. Because Zn2+ -containing axon terminals are abundant in the septal region, we selected a septal cell line (SN56) to study the effects of Zn2+ on cell activity. Voltage-clamp recordings showed well-developed voltage- dependent Na+, Ca2+ and K+ currents. Micromolar concentrations of Zn2+ partially blocked Na+ and Ca2+ currents without affecting K+ currents. Current-clamp recordings showed that SN56 cells fire spontaneous and evoked action potentials. While most (≤83%) Na+ and Ca2+ currents were blocked with 1 μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) and 2 mM Co2+, action potentials persisted after either 1 μM TTX or 2 mM Co2+ application. In contrast, concentrations of Zn2+ (50-300 μM) that induced incomplete blockade (≤ 50%) of either Ca2+ and Na+ currents abolished action potential generation. These data show that simultaneous and partial blockade of Ca2+ and Na+ channels by Zn2+ inhibit SN56 cell activity. Because septal outputs extensively modulate the excitability of cortical and subcortical brain regions, Zn2+ inhibition of action potential generation in septal neurons could play an important physiological role in regulating brain activity.","Ca2+ channel; Na+ channel; Septum; Zinc","calcium channel; sodium channel; zinc; animal cell; article; calcium current; controlled study; evoked response; nerve cell culture; nerve cell differentiation; nerve ending; nonhuman; potassium current; priority journal; septum pellucidum; sodium current; voltage clamp",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030793716

After introducing suitable background we provide some of the institutional and legal framework needed to understand the continuing regulatory efforts in United States. Attention is then turned to mathematical programming models ranging from fairly simple deterministic linear programs to quite sophisticated stochastic models which have appeared in the literature dealing with these topics. This is followed by extensions reflecting some of the work we have undertaken in association with the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, a regulatory agency in Texas. Application and potential use of models is the central theme of this survey. Issues for future research are presented at the end and an extensive list of publications is provided in the references at the end of the article. Principal air quality issues of local, national, and international concern are listed below in increasing order of difficulty based on the number of different types of pollutants and problems in quantification of the risks the pollutants pose: 1. Stratospheric ozone depletion: one relatively easily controllable class of trace gases - ozone depleting chemicals, or ODCs, principally chloroflurocarbons (CFCs) - with relatively well quantified risks; 2. Criteria pollutants: six common pollutants - ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), lead (Pb), and particulate matter less than 10 microns in size (PM10) - regulated since 1970 in the U.S. and presenting relatively well quantified risks; 3. Acid precipitation: two relatively easily controllable classes of trace gases - oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and oxides of sulfur (SOx) with relatively well quantified risks; 4. Global warming/climate change: a few difficult to control trace gases - principally carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and CFCs - with highly uncertain risks; 5.

PM can be classified as either filterable or condensible PM. Condensible PM includes sulfates, such as sulfuric acid. Sulfates typically account for at least half of the total dry fine PM mass in the atmosphere. Power plant SOx-based emissions make a significant contribution to ambient fine PM levels in the eastern United States. Although much of this mass is derived from secondary chemical reactions in the atmosphere, a portion of this sulfate is emitted directly from stacks as condensible PM. The potential condensible PM fraction associated with coal-burning boiler emissions is somewhat uncertain. The characterization of PM emissions from these sources has been, until recently, based on in-stack filterable PM measurements only. To determine the relative magnitude of condensible PM emissions and better understand condensible PM measurement issues, a review and analysis of actual EPA Method 202 (for in-stack condensible PM10) results and state-developed hybrid condensible PM methods were conducted. A review of available Method 202 results for several coal-burning boilers showed that the condensible PM, on average, comprises 60% of the total PM10. A review of recent results for state-developed measurement methods for condensible PM for numerous coal-burning boilers indicated that condensible PM accounted for, on average, approximately 49% of total PM. Caution should be exercised in the use of these results because of the seemingly unresolved issue of artifact (i.e., sulfate) formation, which may bias the Method 202 and state-developed methods results on the high side. Condensible PM10 measurement results and issues, and potential ramifications of including condensible PM10 emissions in the PSD permit review process are discussed.

The linked ecosystem model was applied to examine ecosystem-level responses to CO2, temperature, precipitation, and global-warming scenarios in grasslands of Colorado and Kansas, USA, and Kenya. The model predicted that increased temperatures would decrease primary production at current CO2 levels, but decreases were reversed by doubling atmospheric CO2 concentration. Greater increases in daily minimum temperatures than daily maximum temperatures mitigated reductions in photosynthesis and water-use efficiency (WUE) later in the day, more than offsetting increases in nighttime respiration rates under warmer temperatures. A temperature increase of 5°C reduced organic carbon in grassland soils by 20-30%, through effects on plant growth and decomposition, but the doubled CO2 negated soil carbon losses by increasing plant growth. Under higher precipitation and doubled CO2, soil carbon stocks increased, or decreased little, in response to warmer temperatures. Doubling CO2 increased net primary production (NPP) by 31-45% in a simulated Colorado C4 grassland, by 20-70% in a Colorado C3 grassland, by 23-31% in a Kansas C4 grassland, and by 23-35% in a Kenya C4 grassland at ambient precipitation levels. Growth was shifted belowground, thus weakening aboveground responses. Higher temperatures strengthened the positive NPP responses to CO2. Larger positive responses to elevated CO2 were modeled under drier conditions, and smaller responses were modeled under wetter conditions. NPP increases under elevated CO2 were mostly caused by increased plant WUE at all sites, which was brought about by partial stomatal closure. Decreased N concentrations in plant litter under elevated CO2 slowed N mineralization, but greater plant production and thus greater litter inputs into the soil under elevated CO2 offset the negative effects of lower litter quality. Decreases in plant N concentration under elevated CO2 also reduced plant N requirements. At current atmospheric CO2 (350 μmol/mol), a general circulation model (GCM) climate-change scenario decreased NPP and soil organic matter (SOM) in Colorado but not in Kansas or Kenya.

The tests require minimal system intrusion; determination of oxidation efficiency is essentially nonintrusive, but reduction efficiency measurement requires replacement of the oxygen sensor with a high precision universal exhaust gas oxygen (UEGO) sensor. The vehicle is operated on a dynamometer at 40mph steady state using the IM240 specified loading for that vehicle. To ensure proper fueling, the engine-out A/F ratio is measured. This measurement can be taken at the tailpipe with secondary air injection disabled, if present. Oxidation efficiencies for hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) require normal vehicle configuration (secondary air active, if present) and tailpipe measurements of total HC and methane (CH4). The catalyst efficiencies for oxidation of HC and CO are inversely related to the HC/CH 4 ratio. The reduction efficiency for nitrogen oxides (NO x) requires NOx tailpipe measurement at two A/F ratios, stoiciometric and about 15/1 (wt/wt). At about 15/1 A/F, excess oxygen prevents catalyst reduction and, consequently, an engine-out value can be obtained from a tailpipe measurement. The difference between the tailpipe measurements at the two A/F ratios provides an experimental catalyst efficiency which can be related, by regression analysis, to the actual efficiency. Actual catalyst efficiencies for HC, CO, and NOx were obtained from concurrent engine-out and tailpipe emissions measurements. Data were obtained from 27 vehicles using the original catalyst and (primarily) two intermediately active catalysts. Actual efficiency data show that catalysts with HC/CH4 ratios less than 3.5 will, with a high degree of confidence, have oxidation efficiencies above 80% for HC and CO, and NOx reduction efficiency can be determined at a standard error of estimate of 6%. Engine-out emissions differences (for different vehicles and at different A/F ratios) increases data scatter as catalyst efficiency decreases. NOx differences do not excessively influence test results for catalysts having &gt;10% reduction capability, but at oxidation capability below 80%, HC and CO engine-out differences produce data scatter to the extent that the primary significance of the test is determination of maximum or minimum oxidation efficiency. © Copyright 1997 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Carbon monoxide; Catalysts; Data reduction; Engines; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Regression analysis; Research laboratories; Vehicles; Department of environmental qualities; Engine-out emissions; Oxidation and reduction; Reduction efficiency; Secondary air injection; Spark ignition vehicles; Universal exhaust gas oxygen sensor; Vehicle configuration; Efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072452525

L5K 1B2, Canada","Gasketed joints designed using the service factors ""m"" and ""y"" of Appendix 2 of the ASME Pressure Vessel Code have generally served industry well for over 50 years. While Appendix 2 joints are safe, this Code contains no design capability to meet specific performance standards with respect to leakage. This requirement has become increasingly important in recent years with the realization that all gaskets leak to some degree. The advent of regulations limiting fugitive emissions has made control of leakage vital to many industrial processes which use toxic or hazardous flow streams. Research funded by the Pressure Vessel Research Council (PVRC) and largely carried out at Ecole Polytechnique in Montreal, Canada, has led to development of a model of gasket leakage performance. Three new performance parameters, ""Gb"", ""a"" and ""Gs"", along with the concept of a tightness parameter which is a function of system pressure and gasket mass leakage rate, allows a simple, but uniform definition of gasket performance for most commonly used materials. The three performance parameters are determined by a standard procedure known as the Room Temperature Test (ROTT). This test is currently undergoing round-robin testing by the ASTM prior to final approval. Using this model of gasket leakage performance, it is possible to design a gasketed joint to ensure that it will not exceed any specified amount of leakage when placed in service. ASME's Special Working Group on Bolted Flanged Joints (SWG-BFJ) are currently codifying this design procedure in the form of Appendix BFJ to Section VIII, Division 1 of the Pressure Vessel Code. The performance data can also be used to determine if an existing joint is capable of attaining a desired performance standard. This paper briefly explains the ROTT model and its development into a design procedure. By selection of a maximum allowable leakage (or minimum tightness) for any application, the designer can determine the assembly stress required on any gasket to achieve this required inservice performances. Further, the designer can explore the performance of various possible gasket materials to permit an optimum selection, not only of the gasket, but also of the flanges, for the particular application. Examples to illustrate the design and analysis procedures and to compare the expected performance of ROTT-based designs relative to Appendix 2 designs, with respect to both leakage and flange and bolting requirements are presented. The consequences of elasto-dynamic in-service behaviour of the bolted joint assembly are also discussed.",,"Bolted joints; Flanges; Leakage (fluid); Room temperature test (ROTT) model; Gaskets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10144260059

Reusing and recycling construction waste reduces the need for raw materials and energy, with corresponding reductions in environmental emissions, aesthetic impacts and damage to natural ecosystems. However, the use of secondary materials also gives rise to environmental and social impacts, particularly in the transport and reprocessing stages. Lifecycle assessment can be used to compare alternative options for the sustainable management of construction waste. Within the assessment, economic valuations of environmental and social impacts provide weightings to enable this comparison. In the past, waste management decisions have been based primarily on financial cost, and there has been no mechanism for taking environmental and social costs and benefits into consideration. Industry and local authorities are increasingly having to take account of a broader range of criteria, and the discipline of environmental economics provides a means by which these 'external' impacts can be quantified and included in decision making alongside financial costs. © 1997 Elsevier B.V.

The administration of a high FlO2 to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients may result in hypercapnia. Recent evidence indicates that the hypercapnia may be due to reversal of preexisting regional hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction resulting in a greater deadspace. This effect would be more pronounced in patients whose initial PaO2 was &lt;60 torr (&lt;7.9 kPa) Design: Single blinded, prospective study. Setting: A medical surgical intensive care unit in a tertiary care, teaching hospital. Patients: COPD CO2-retaining patients. Interventions: Flo2 increased to 0.7. Measurements and Main Results: Twelve intubated COPD patients weaned from mechanical ventilation were studied both at their baseline FlO2 (0.3 to 0.4), and following a 20- min period of exposure to an FlO2 of 0.7. Mean baseline values were: PaO2 of 85 torr (11.3 kPa), PCO2 of 50 torr (7.5 kPa), deadspace of 73%, and respiratory drive normal, as measured by P0.1. Statistical analysis using the paired Student's t-test showed that the PaO2 increased significantly when the FlO2 was increased to 0.7, but there was no significant change in PaCO2, deadspace, or respiratory drive. Conclusion: These results show that following a period of mechanical ventilation with an FlO2 sufficient to maintain a normal PaO2, a further increase in FlO2 does not result in an increased PaCO2 in this group of CO2-retaining COPD patients.","Carbon dioxide; Hypercapnia; Lung diseases; Obstructive; Oxygen inhalation therapy; Respiratory deadspace","carbon dioxide; oxygen; article; artificial ventilation; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical article; clinical trial; human; hypercapnia; intubation; lung dead space; lung function test; physical examination; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal; respiratory drive; single blind procedure; thorax radiography; Aged; Female; Humans; Hypercapnia; Hypertension, Pulmonary; Lung Diseases, Obstructive; Male; Oxygen; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Prospective Studies; Respiration, Artificial; Single-Blind Method; Tidal Volume",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030805983

Important results are: that the temperature increase from average glacial to Holocene conditions was large, approximately 15 °C, with a 20 °C warming from late glacial to Holocene; that the average accumulation rate during the last glacial maximum (between 15 and 30 kyr B. P.) was 5.5 to 7 cm yr-1, approximately 25% of the modern accumulation rate; that long-term (500-1000 years) averaged accumulation rate and temperature have been inversely correlated during the most recent 7 millennia of the Holocene; and that the Greenland Ice Sheet probably thickened during the deglacial transition. The inverse correlation of accumulation rate and temperature in the mid and late Holocene suggests that the Greenland Ice Sheet is more prone to volume reduction in a warmed climate than previously thought and demonstrates that accumulation rate is not a reliable proxy for temperature. The elevation history of the ice sheet is poorly constrained by the model, and independent evidence is needed. We also present a simple estimate of the response time for thinning of the interior region of an ice sheet due to retreat of its margins.

The outflow is traced up to 7.5 kpc above the plane by optical emission line filaments, nonthermal radio continuum emission, associated magnetic fields perpendicular to the galactic plane, and soft X-ray emission from hot gas. Optical spectroscopy exhibits the kinematic signature of an outflow and the observed line ratios indicate that shock heating is the most likely excitation mechanism for the emission line gas. The outflow is well approximated by a 6.5 kpc base (the extent of the central starburst) plus a cone with an opening angle of 30° ± 10°. In the outer disk of NGC 4666 numerous luminous H II regions were detected, which lead to additional outflows (galactic fountains or chimneys) of gas into the halo. Radially the radio halo is much more extended than the central outflow cone and it has an exponential z-scale height at 1.43 GHz of 1.7 ± 0.28 kpc. NGC 4666 is in many respects very similar to NGC 4631, another edge-on galaxy with an extended gaseous halo.","Galaxies: ISM; Galaxies: magnetic fields; Galaxies: NGC 4666; Galaxies: starburst; Radio continuum: galaxies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010183455

In a previous paper, we have shown that during its binding to the DNA site CRE (cAMP- responsive element) the bSD structure was converted into α-helix from an initial random coil conformation [Krebs, D., Dahmani, B., El Antri, S., Monnot, M., Convert, O., Mauffret, O., Troalen, F. &amp; Fermandjian, S. Eur. J. Biochem. 231, 370–380 (1995)]. Our results suggested both a high flexibility and a helical potential in bSD, these two properties seeming crucial for the accommodation of the basic subdomain of c-Jun to its specific DNA targets. In this work, we assessed the conformational variability of bSD through the study of the secondary structures of its NP and CP fragments in trifluoroethanol (TFE)/2H2O mixtures, using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The IR results were critically analyzed in light of our previously reported circular dichroism (CD) and NMR data [Krebs, D., Dahmani, B., Monnot, M., Mauffret, O., Troalen, F. &amp; Fermandjian, S. Eur. J. Biochem. 235, 699–712 (1996)]. Upon addition of TFE, the relative areas of the seven components of the amide I band (1700–1620 cm−1) reflected the conversion of a large amount of random coil conformation into α-helix for the two fragments and bSD. This effect was accompanied by more subtle variations of the less populated structures, in agreement with the results of CD and NMR experiments. The IR results stipulated the conservation of the parent bSD secondary structures in both fragments; however, NP and CP peptides did not display similar random-to-α-helix stabilization pattern upon additions of TFE to aqueous solutions. The profile from CD signal at 222 nm was found sigmoidal for NP and almost linear for CP, while that corresponding to the parent peptide bSD was just in between those of its fragments. Thus, the present study confirms the high flexibility and helix propensity of the c-Jun basic subdomain and suggests that the N- and C-terminal parts of the peptide do not follow the same random-to-helix conversion profile during their complexation with DNA. © 1997 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,"oncoprotein; trifluoroethanol; alpha helix; amino terminal sequence; article; carboxy terminal sequence; circular dichroism; infrared spectroscopy; nuclear magnetic resonance; peptide synthesis; priority journal; protein domain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030936428

This paper provides a brief overview of the measurement and analysis methods used and examples of the results. The VHF measurements were made as part of a link analysis for the broadcast of digital satellite weather images at 137 MHz. The motivation for these measurements was that published man-made noise statistics are probably outdated because they are based on noise measurements made over two decades ago. Since that time, technological advances have changed man-made noise emissions. For example, automotive emissions have been reduced, while emissions from other sources such as unregulated electronic devices (e.g., computers and microwave ovens) and other electrical equipment such as electric motors have probably increased significantly. In addition to the VHF measurement results, we present an example of measured noise statistics at 2460 MHz. At this frequency, dominant noise sources are thought to be microwave ovens. The data we obtained show that there are significant changes in the character of man-made noise which should be considered in the design and implementation of radio systems. Also, additional measurements are necessary to characterize adequately VHF and UHF man-made noise in high technology environments such as modern urban and suburban areas.",,"Bandwidth; Digital signal processing; Probability; Satellite links; Statistical methods; Noise amplitude probability distribution (APD); Signal noise measurement",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030706388

Full implementation of cost-effective efficiency measures, combined with substantial fuel switching from coal and oil to natural gas (NG), will only slightly reduce Canadian CO2 emissions in 2020 compared to 199 l, given the high growth in energy-intensive industries assumed in the reference scenario. To achieve a 50% emission reduction requires more fundamental changes involving, for example, constant economic output from energy-intensive industries (with compensating increases elsewhere in the economy), limiting the increase in total distance travelled by light vehicles, displacement of 30-80% (depending on the region) of the remaining fossil-fuel generated electricity with electricity derived from renewable energy, and use of hydrogen (H2) derived from renewable energy in selected niche markets. The 75% emission-reduction target will require greater use of H2, but replacement of direct use of NG in commercial and residential buildings with H2 would not be required if other measures are implemented to the extent assumed here.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030981211

At 340 ppmv, TEM estimated global NPP of 49.0 1015 g (Pg) C yr-1 and global total carbon storage of 1701.8 Pg C; the estimate of total carbon storage does not include the carbon content of inert soil organic matter. For the reference simulation in which doubled atmospheric CO2 was accompanied with no change in vegetation nitrogen concentration, global NPP increased 4.1 Pg C yr-1 (8.3%), and global total carbon storage increased 114.2 Pg C. To examine sensitivity in the global responses of NPP and carbon storage to decreases in the nitrogen concentration of vegetation, we compared doubled CO2 responses of the reference TEM to simulations in which the vegetation nitrogen concentration was reduced without influencing decomposition dynamics (""lower N"" simulations) and to simulations in which reductions in vegetation nitrogen concentration influence decomposition dynamics (""lower N+D"" simulations). We conducted three lower N simulations and three lower N+D simulations in which we reduced the nitrogen concentration of vegetation by 7,5, 15.0, and 22.5%. In the lower N simulations, the response of global NPP to doubled atmospheric CO2 increased approximately 2 Pg C yr-1 for each incremental 7.5% reduction in vegetation nitrogen concentration, and vegetation carbon increased approximately an additional 40 Pg C, and soil carbon increased an additional 30 Pg C, for a total carbon storage increase of approximately 70 Pg C. In the lower N+D simulations, the responses of NPP and vegetation carbon storage were relatively insensitive to differences in the reduction of nitrogen concentration, but soil carbon storage showed a large change. The insensitivity of NPP in the N+D simulations occurred because potential enhancements in NPP associated with reduced vegetation nitrogen concentration were approximately offset by lower nitrogen availability associated with the decomposition dynamics of reduced litter nitrogen concentration. For each 7.5% reduction in vegetation nitrogen concentration, soil carbon increased approximately an additional 60 Pg C, while vegetation carbon storage increased by only approximately 5 Pg C. As the reduction in vegetation nitrogen concentration gets greater in the lower N+D simulations, more of the additional carbon storage tends to become concentrated in the north temperateboreal region in comparison to the tropics. Other studies with TEM show that elevated CO2 more than offsets the effects of climate change to cause increased carbon storage. The results of this study indicate that carbon storage would be enhanced by the influence of changes in plant nitrogen concentration on carbon assimilation and decomposition rates. Thus changes in vegetation nitrogen concentration may have important implications for the ability of the terrestrial biosphere to mitigate increases in the atmospheric concentration of CO2 and climate changes associated with the increases.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide increase; carbon storage; net primary production; nitrogen concentration; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031470859

Our interdisciplinary working group assesses likely short-term impacts on public health. Methods: We combined models of energy consumption, carbon emissions, and associated atmospheric particulate-matter (PM) concentration under two different forecasts: business-as-usual (BAU); and a hypothetical climate-policy scenario, where developed and developing countries undertake significant reductions in carbon emissions. Findings: We predict that by 2020, 700,000 avoidable deaths (90% CI 385,000-1034,000) will occur annually as a result of additional PM exposure under the BAU forecasts when compared with the climate-policy scenario. From 2000 to 2020, the cumulative impact on public health related to the difference in PM exposure could total 8 million deaths globally (90% CI 4.4-11.9 million). In the USA alone, the avoidable number of annual deaths from PM exposure in 2020 (without climate-change-control policy) would equal in magnitude deaths associated with human immunodeficiency diseases or all liver diseases in 1995. Interpretation: The mortality estimates are indicative of the magnitude of the likely health benefits of the climate-policy scenario examined and are not precise predictions of avoidable deaths. While characterised by considerable uncertainty, the short-term public-health impacts of reduced PM exposures associated with greenhouse-gas reductions are likely to be substantial even under the most conservative set of assumptions.",,"carbon; fossil fuel; article; controlled study; global climate; greenhouse effect; mortality; particulate matter; policy; priority journal; public health; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031573169

Study Design - Prospective clinical study. Animals or Sample Population - Eleven client-owned horses ranging in age from 4 months to 2 years. Methods - Abdominal insufflation was initiated and maintained using a 20 F insufflation tube, attached via a stopcock, to the low pressure regulator on a standard carbon dioxide pressure tank. After trocar and laparoscope placement in the ipsilateral flank the testes were identified. Local anesthesia of the structures to be manipulated was administered through the instrument channel on the operative laparoscope, using a catheter with a needle attached. Testes were grasped with large laparoscopic forceps and exteriorized through the abdominal wall. Ligation and transection of the mesorchium was extracorporeal. The descended testes were removed using a standard standing technique. Results - Complications were minor, including mild colic in one horse. The mean surgical time for standing laparoscopic cryptorchidectomy and castration of these colts was 58.9 ± 24.3 minutes. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Standing laparoscopic cryptorchidectomy, using the instrumentation described, is a safe and practical technique in young horses. ©Copyright 1997 by The American College of Veterinary Surgeons.",,"animal; animal disease; article; body posture; congenital malformation; cryptorchism; horse; horse disease; laparoscopy; male; methodology; orchiectomy; testis; Animals; Cryptorchidism; Horse Diseases; Horses; Laparoscopy; Male; Orchiectomy; Posture; Testis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031179680

The CO2 'huff-n-puff' in well Texaco CVU-97 at Vacuum Field and the repeated 3-D, 3-C seismic surveys were performed from October 30, 1995 to December 27, 1995. The initial 3-D, 3-C survey was acquired from October 28 through November 13. CO2 injection began November 13, 1995 and lasted until December 8, 1995. The 'soak' period extended from December 8 through December 28, after which Texaco CVU-97 was returned to production. The second 3-D, 3-C survey was acquired during the 'soak' period, from December 21 to December 28. The compressional data provides a measure of the bulk rock compressibility, rigidity and density, while shear wave data is sensitive to rigidity and density. The combined use of P-wave, S1 shear and S2 shear seismic data allow different views of the bulk rock properties in the subsurface. Our interpretation methodology strives to use these volumes to delineate spatial variations in the subsurface related to lithology, porosity, pore structure variations related to preferred permeability directions, and variations in pore fluid pressure and properties. Interval traveltime comparisons between the P- and shear volumes are a robust and sensitive indicator of lithology, porosity and pore geometry, and the intensity of fracturing.",,"Carbon dioxide; Injection (oil wells); Lithology; Petroleum reservoirs; Porosity; Seismic prospecting; Carbon dioxide injection; Petroleum reservoir engineering",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030648963

Resting MMOH contains a diferric bis-μ-hydroxodinuclear iron 'diamond core' cluster which is the site of oxygen activation chemistry after reduction. Here it is shown that γ-irradiation of MMOH at 77 K results in reduction of the diiron cluster to an EPR active Fe(II)·Fe(III) mixed valence state. At this temperature, the conformation of the enzyme remains essentially unchanged during reduction, so the EPR-spectrum becomes a probe of the conformation of the diferric state. The γ-irradiated MMOH exhibits EPR spectra that differ in lineshape and saturation properties from those of the mixed valence MMOH generated by chemical reduction in solution; annealing the γ-irradiated sample at 230 K yields the spectra of the chemically reduced sample. This demonstrates that the conformation of diferric MMOH in the vicinity of the diiron cluster changes during reduction to the mixed valence state. The analogous experiment for the MMOB·MMOH complex gives a new mixed valence species following γ-irradiation that differs from all previously reported mixed valence species. Thus, binding of MMOB also causes a change in the conformation of diferric MMOH. It is hypothesized that the structural changes observed for the first time here may involve conversion of the dihydroxo- bridged diamond core structure to one with more readily dissociable bridging oxygen ligands to facilitate reaction with O2 following cluster reduction.",,"oxidoreductase; oxygenase; article; binding affinity; electron spin resonance; enzyme activity; enzyme conformation; gamma irradiation; hypothesis; ligand binding; priority journal; protein binding; protein conformation; radiolysis; temperature sensitivity; Binding Sites; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Gamma Rays; Iron; Oxygenases; Protein Conformation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030904926

Laser surface modification offers a method of improving the corrosion resistance of the components without affecting the bulk properties by producing a novel microstructure having improved properties oh the surface of a material. Surfaces of AISI type 304 stainless steel were laser melted in nitrogen using a continuous wave CO2 laser in order to introduce nitrogen into the surface layer. The pitting resistance, as determined by the potentiodynamic anodic polarisation method in 0-5M NaCl medium, indicated an improvement which was attributed to the increased content of nitrogen, confirmed by secondary ion mass spectrometry analysis. Using a pulsed ruby laser. Nd-YAG laser, and multibeam continuous wave CO2 laser, surfaces of sensitised AISI types 316 and 304 stainless steels were modified. The extent of sensitisation (susceptibility to intergranular corrosion) was assessed by the electrochemical potentiokinetic reactivation test, as well as by metallographic and immersion test methods. An improvement in the intergranular corrosion resistance was obtained after laser surface melting. This was attributed to the elimination of the sensitised heterogeneous microstructure at the surface.

A diffusion-reaction simulation model was used to calculate CO2 profiles in order to check the reliability of the measured profiles. Measured CO2 and O2 profiles showed that, in highly active layers with photosynthetic and respiratory organisms, local equilibrium of the carbonate system cannot be assumed. In such highly active systems, the CO2 profiles were determined by the slow CO2 hydration rate, the biological conversion rates, and the diffusion of all species of the carbonate system. We concluded that measured CO2 profiles cannot easily be extrapolated to describe the total carbonate concentration profile, because CO2 may not be in equilibrium with the rest of the carbonate system, and because a very accurate alignment of pH and CO2 profiles is needed to calculate C(r).

Various intuitive appealing explanations for the observed patterns have been offered, such as structural changes and environmental policy, but these have rarely been empirically investigated. Expanding the reduced-form model with explanatory variables may introduce serious multicollinearity problems, a reason why decomposition analysis is a preferable alternative for investigating the origins of change in emissions. Applying decomposition analysis fails to find evidence for structural changes as an important determinant of the impressive reductions in SO2 emissions of developed economies during the 1980s. Environmental policy, fostered by international agreements, gives a better explanation why pollution curbs downward at high income levels.

Certain alfalfa cultivars spontaneously develop pseudonodules in the absence of bacteria. A transcript, Msca1, expressed in spontaneous and R, meliloti-induced nodules, that codes for a carbonic anhydrase (CA), an enzyme catalyzing the hydration of CO2 has been identified. This is the first CA gene cloned from a non-photosynthetic tissue in plants, Msca1 was activated initially in all cells of the bacterium-induced nodule primordium end was also induced by cytokinin treatment of alfalfa roots. The presence of CA enzymatic activity in different nodule types was demonstrated. Thus, Msca1 is a new early nodulin gene with a function possibly related to the increased amyloplast deposition of the dividing cortical cells. Msca1 transcripts were subsequently found mainly in a peripheral envelope of cells in developing and mature nodules. This novel pattern of gene expression is controlled by the presence of the bacterium inside the nodule. Sucrose synthase and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), other genes of the carbon fixation metabolism, were expressed in the same peripheral cells and even more strongly in the nitrogen-fixing region. Analysis of expression patterns of these genes indicated that early CA function may not be related to carbon fixation through PEPC. CA might be acting in pH regulation and/or CO2/HCO3- transport during nodule initiation.

In soil, several Nitrobacter strains can coexist. It is now well known that in pure cultures these strains are able to use organic carbon for their growth with highly variable efficiencies. Our purpose was to examine the role of nitrite or organic carbon as factors governing the evolution of the structure, the density and the activity of a Nitrobacter community in soil. This study has been performed on a recreated nitrite-oxidizing community consisting of 3 Nitrobacter strains co-inoculated into sterile soil and differing in their metabolic potentialities: a preferentially autotrophic strain (N. agilis strain AG), a preferentially mixotrophic strain (Nitrobacter genomic species 2 strain LL) and a preferentially heterotrophic strain (N. hamburgensis strain X14). Whatever the enrichments performed (0.271 or 1.353 mg NO2--N g-1 dry soil or 1 mg sodium acetate g-l dry soil), we observed a first phase of multiplication of the total Nitrobacter cells until day 7 or 15, and then, a stabilization of the community until the end of the experiment (day 48). The growth and level of stabilization of this Nitrobacter community as well as the competition between strains in the first phase were predominantly controlled by soil nitrite concentration, resulting in a dominance of the more autotrophic strains. The stabilization of the community resulted from a drastic decrease in nitrite-oxidation activity due not only to a direct nitrite limitation but also probably to a limiting O2 effect of the cells' ability to utilize nitrite. The competition was then predominantly monitored by strains' ability to utilize organic carbon for aerobic or anaerobic respiration. The autotrophy/heterotrophy shift strongly modified the result of the competition obtained at the end of the growth stage by inducing drastic declines of the more autotrophic strain and allowing continuous growth of the more heterotrophic strain. This suggests that heterotrophy being more tolerant than autotrophy to environmental changes, organic carbon could be a more permanent structuring factor of the Nitrobacter community than nitrite in soil.","Community structure; Immunofluorescence; Nitrite-oxidation; Nitrobacter; Sterile soil","carbon; nitrite; bacterial community; nitrite-oxidizing bacteria; organic carbon; article; bacterial growth; controlled study; immunofluorescence; nitrification; nitrobacter; nonhuman; oxidation; priority journal; soil; Nitrobacter; Nitrobacter hamburgensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030657845

First, the isothermal reduction by CO and oxidation by NO of the catalysts was studied. Next, the influence of oxygen on the NO conversion was determined. NO is adsorbed on the oxidized catalysts as nitrite/nitrate complexes and as Cu2+-NO. The nitrite/nitrate complexes decompose only in a reducing atmosphere, whereas NO readily desorbs from Cu2+ in He. CO is retained on the catalysts in a CO/NO/He atmosphere. It was found that the conversion of NO is not only limited by O2 in the gas phase, but that NO also competes with subsurface oxygen to oxidize the surface of the catalysts. In other words, NO is only converted when the catalysts are in a reduced state. Since the activity of the Cu-Cr catalyst in NO reduction was found to be higher than that of the Cu catalyst, it is concluded that Cr helps to keep the Cu in a more reduced state. N2O may be formed under dynamic conditions even when it is not observed in the steady state. It was nicely demonstrated that the step-response experiments allow the calculation of the concentrations of the different surface species. These concentrations strongly depend on the reaction conditions. © 1997 Academic Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000661174

After oil addition, the changes in bacterial communities were studied in situ during a nine-month period in austral winter 1993. Weekly sampling in sea ice allowed a regular survey of total, saprophytic, and hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria. A clear seasonality was observed. In uncontaminated samples, maximal values of bacterial biomass occurred during ice formation and just before summer thaw. Minimal bacterial abundance (&lt;105 cells ml-1) was observed during winter. All the results (bacterial abundance, colony-forming units, and most probable number counts of hydrocarbon-utilizing bacteria) clearly revealed a significant response of Antarctic bacterial communities to hydrocarbon contamination. Three orders of magnitude increases of bacterial counts occurred in sea ice after both diesel fuel and crude oil contamination. A concomitant enrichment in oil-degrading bacteria was generally observed from less than 0.001% of the community in uncontaminated samples to 10% after 30 weeks of contamination. Addition of fertilizer (Inipol EAP 22) enhanced both saprophytic and hydrocarbon-utilizing communities. The natural winter decline of saprophytic bacterial abundance was totally absent in sea ice treated with diesel fuel oil supplemented with Inipol.",,"bacteria; bacterial activity; crude oil; diesel; oil pollution; sea ice; seasonal variation; seasonality; Antarctica, Terre Adelie",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030620875

In this paper, an experimental study on the effect of performance variability of catalyst on emissions is presented. Average emissions have been measured using driving cycles representative of different levels of urban traffic, determined by statistical methods on the basis of data detected on-road by an instrumented car. For each driving cycle, representative of a certain traffic level, different thermal starting conditions of catalyst have been tested. These conditions have been determined by the characterization of catalyst performance at steady state and are representative of real catalyst conditions experienced on the road. In particular, the combined effects of real driving cycles (rapid acceleration and deceleration, short trips in which the engine never fully warm up, most time in congested traffic with engine at idling) and of catalyst thermal behaviour on emissions have been investigated. The final aim of the study is to develop a probabilistic approach for emission modelling in which emissions produced for a specific driving cycle in a certain urban zone are predicted on the basis of possible routes to reach the site where the cycle is to be performed. © 1997 Society of Automotive Engineers.

This law requires any feed mill that qualifies as a major pollutant source (i.e. by emitting more than 90.7 tonnes (100 tons) of a regulated pollutant annually) to obtain from its state air pollution regulatory agency (SAPRA) a federal operating permit (FOP). Currently, annual emissions are determined using emission factors published in the 1988 AP-42 and 1995 interim AP-42. Due to the absence of scientifically based data, these emission factors grossly over estimate the emissions for a feed mill and could categorize a large number of these facilities as major sources of particulate matter. If a facility is determined to be a major source, then they are subject to monetary fees imposed by the CAAA for each ton of particulate matter emitted annually. One emission source common to most feed mills associated with cattle feed yards is the exhaust from the cyclone separating steam flaked grain.

When studying the reaction kinetics by heating from room temperature, solid state reactions and poorly defined melting points may obscure the starting point of the reaction. In order to eliminate this problem, an experimental technique was devised whereby two molten slags could be melted independently, and then mixed, to provide a well defined starting point from which to begin taking measurements. Two crucibles were mounted in a vertical reaction cylinder. The upper, mild steel, crucible had a bottom pouring plug which was sealed by a steel stopper rod. A fayalite mixture was contained in this crucible. The lower crucible contained an Al2O3-CaO-SiO2-ZnO solution. Once the two slags had been melted, the steel stopper rod was removed from the upper crucible. The upper, reduced slag (fayalite in equilibrium with the upper steel crucible), drained into the lower crucible where the two slags were mixed by submerged argon stirring. Dip samples were taken to measure the zinc content of the final mixture as a function of time. The experimental procedure will be described, as well as results of experiments which were conducted on synthetic slags.

Although it contains somewhat different requirements for hazard classification, engineering controls and labeling, the ANSI Z136.1 standard defers to the CDRH standard. The CDRH standard became effective in August, 1976 and was amended, in 1978 and also in 1985. In the early 1990s, US experts met to formulate an approach to bring the requirements of the CDRH standard and those of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard, IEC 825, into closer agreement in order to lower barriers to international trade and to remove any excessive compliance burdens on manufacturers. In 1993, the CDRH published, formally in the Federal Register and informally, a Notice of Intent to amend the CDRH standard. Responses to those notices have now been analyzed and informal draft amendments were distributed in 1996. This draft is now being prepared for formal issuance as a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Meanwhile, the IEC standard was amended in 1993 and republished as IEC 825-1; these amendments created considerable controversy since they resulted in over classification of the hazard of many products, especially light emitting diodes (LEDs) that have a large divergence and increased source dimensions. Additional amendments are now being developed to correct this problem. The CDRH has carefully monitored developments in the IEC and actively participated in its proceedings as a guide in developing its own proposal. This paper describes the major changes that are being proposed for the CDRH standard and presents some rationale for the major changes. The more significant changes include expansion of applicability to include LEDs, reduced emission durations for classification, revised measurement procedures for hazard classification, reduced performance requirements for lower power visible radiation products, and revised requirements for medical products.","Laser product standards; Laser safety; United States Food and Drug Administration","Light emitting diodes; Radiation hazards; Standards; Laser product standards; Laser safety; air pollutant; article; environmental monitoring; equipment; equipment design; food and drug administration; health care management; human; laser; legal aspect; maximum allowable concentration; practice guideline; standard; United States; Air Pollutants, Radioactive; Annual Reports; Environmental Monitoring; Equipment Design; Equipment Safety; Guideline Adherence; Guidelines; Humans; Lasers; Maximum Allowable Concentration; United States; United States Food and Drug Administration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031283163

Under the Energy Efficiency Act, regulations have been developed for a wide range of equipment. The Energy Efficiency Regulations, which came into effect in February 1995, apply to equipment imported into Canada and equipment manufactured in Canada and shipped from one province to another. Canada's energy-efficiency regulatory process differs significantly from that of the United States in a number of ways. The Canadian regulations, for example, have different verification, reporting, and importing requirements. Important distinctions also exist with respect to the legislative authority for the Canadian regulatory program. Nevertheless, despite the differences in approaches, processes, climate, energy prices and policy objectives, Canadian regulations are still greatly influenced by regulatory activities and trends in the United States. The North American equipment market is an integrated one, with a constant two-way flow of products across the Canada-US border. As a result, the market domination by US equipment manufacturers has a strong impact on energy-efficiency levels in Canada. One of the key future thrusts of Canadian regulators will be to pursue greater harmonization of regulatory requirements within Canada and among Canada, the United States, and Mexico, as well as globally.

However, their high diesel particulates and NO x emissions remain major concerns. An eight cylinder direct injection diesel engine was connected to a partial flow particulate sampling mini-dilution tunnel. Six different grades of diesel fuels were studied for their regular emissions as well as smoke and particulate emissions. Each fuel was tested at three engine speeds and full load. This paper presents the results of these tests which includes analysis of the effects of load, cetane number, 90% distillation temperature, and density for steady state conditions. A correlation was developed for converting smoke numbers in Hartridge Smoke Units (HSU) to the specific particulate emissions by evaluating results of all fuels tests. Another correlation was also developed for diesel particulates and NOx emissions trade-off. The authors studied the effect of oxygen-enriched combustion to reduce the particulate emissions. However, oxygen addition leads to increase in NOx emissions. An oxygen-enriched diesel combustion model and NO emissions model were developed to get better understanding of NO formation mechanism.

Tru-Scint®AD(T)M, a 99mTc-mAb-170H.82 immunoconjugate, has previously been shown to localize in various human adenocarcinomas. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of this immunoconjugate in the pre-operative assessment of axillary lymph nodes in patients with known breast adenocarcinoma. Sixteen patients with documented primary breast cancer were injected intravenously with 1 mg of immunoconjugate (radioactivity 1.8 GBq) and imaged 22-24 hrs post-injection. Both planar and single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) images were obtained and reviewed in a blinded fashion. Imaging results were compared with surgical and pathological findings. Seven of 16 patients were found to have histologically positive axillary nodes: 5 of these sites were detected by immunoscintigraphy (sensitivity = 71%). Nine patients had pathologically disease-free axillary nodes: only 1 of these was misidentified as positive by immunoscintigraphy (specificity = 89%). These results suggest that immunoscintigraphy with 99mTc-mAb-170H.82 has promise in the detection of axillary lymph node involvement in patients with breast cancer. Further studies are warranted to define the role of immunoscintigraphy in axillary staging.","99mTc-mAB-170h.82; Axillary imaging; Breast adenocarcinoma; Immunoscintigrapy; Tru-Scint®AD(T)M","antibody conjugate; monoclonal antibody; technetium 99m; adult; aged; article; axillary lymph node; breast adenocarcinoma; cancer scintiscanning; clinical article; diagnostic accuracy; female; human; immunoscintigraphy; intravenous drug administration; lymph node metastasis; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; single photon emission computer tomography; Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Axilla; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Lymph Nodes; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Organotechnetium Compounds; Prospective Studies; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8544232152

Fluorescence quantum yields (Φf) and lifetimes (τf) of the compounds were measured in these solvents. Unlike 9-anthroic acid (9-AA), as reported in the literature, no large Stokes-shifted fluorescence emission band was observed for 9-ACA and 9-MCA in neutral organic solvents or water. The absence of large Stokes-shifted emission in the case of 9-ACA and 9-MCA suggests the existence of a charge-transfer emitting state in 9-AA in which the carboxyl group is nearly coplanar with the aromatic ring. The Φf values for both compounds increase as a function of hydrogen-bonding capacity of the solvents. In near neutral to slightly acidic solutions, 9-ACA exists mainly in the zwitterionic form. Both 9-ACA and 9-MCA form monoprotonated species in moderately concentrated acid solutions. The acidium cation of 9-AA formed in the excited state in moderately concentrated acid solution reorganizes to produce a carbocation centered at the carbon atom of the carboxyl group. However, there was no indication of the formation of such acidium cations in the case of 9-ACA and 9-MCA even in concentrated perchloric acid medium. The pKas of various prototropic equilibria involved in the ground electronic state of the compounds were estimated. Semiempirical AM1 calculations were performed to obtain the energies of the various configurations of 9-AA and 9-ACA in the ground (S0) as well as in the lowest excited singlet (S1) electronic state. The results suggest that the COOH group is oriented at an angle of ∼55° with respect to the aromatic ring in the S0 state in both the molecules. However, in the S1 state, it approaches coplanarity with the aromatic ring. The calculated bond lengths, charge densities, and dipole moments suggest that the resonance charge transfer from the aromatic ring to the COOH group increases in the S1 state of 9-AA. However, despite the decrease of twist angle of the COOH group, no significant charge transfer was observed in 9-ACA. The charge density data indicate that the ring nitrogen and the carbonyl oxygen of the COOH group become more basic upon electronic excitation.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242405114

The potential reductions in fleetwide motor vehicle emissions from scrappage of all older light-duty vehicles in a typical urban area's fleet are analyzed, and the sensitivity of those reductions to the timing of the program's implementation and to alternative assumptions about more intensive use of vehicles remaining in the fleet are explored. The cost-effectiveness of such a program in reducing ozone precursor emissions is investigated and the reliability of estimates of the program's effectiveness developed by using the MOBILE5a vehicle emissions model are evaluated.

The continuum is deeply eclipsed and shows asymmetries as a result of the presence of a bright-spot. We derive a new ephemeris and, by measuring the eclipse width, we are able to constrain the inclination to i &gt; 75° and the disc radius to RD &gt; 0.6L1. In common with other members of its class (of which it is the prototype), SW Sex shows single-peaked emission lines which show transient absorption features and large phase shifts in their radial velocity curves. In addition, the light curves of the emission lines show a reduction in flux around phase 0.5 and asymmetric eclipse profiles which are not as deep as the continuum eclipse. Using Doppler tomography, we find that most of the line emission in SW Sex appears to originate from three sources: the secondary star, the accretion disc and an extended bright-spot. The detection of the red star allows us to constrain the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the secondary to KR &gt; 180 km s-1 and hence the component masses to M1 ∼0.3-0.7 M⊙ and M2&lt;0.3M⊙. The Doppler maps suggest a simple new model for SW Sex, in which the dominance of single-peaked line emission from the bright-spot over the weak double-peaked disc emission gives SW Sex its single-peaked profiles and forces the radial velocity curves to follow the motion of the bright-spot and thus exhibit large phase shifts. The transient absorption features in the Balmer line profiles are mostly artefacts of the complex intertwining of the emission components from the secondary star, bright-spot and accretion disc and involve little true absorption. While the accretion disc and secondary star components of this model appear to be secure, the dominant bright-spot component fails in one important area - its inconsistency with the Balmer line light curves. The eclipse profile requires the material emitting the Balmer lines to (a) be eclipsed as early as phase 0.8, (b) not be as deeply eclipsed as the continuum, and (c) exhibit a flat-bottomed eclipse and then come out of eclipse very sharply around phase 0.05. Although it is possible to explain the early ingress with a raised disc rim downstream from the bright-spot, the rapid egress is difficult to account for without speculating either that there are regions of strong Balmer absorption in the disc, the changing visibility of which during eclipse alters the shape of the light curve, or that there is Balmer emission from above the orbital plane which shares the velocity of the bright-spot. © 1997 RAS.","Accretion, accretion discs; Binaries: eclipsing; Binaries: spectroscopic; Novae, cataclysmic variables; Stars: individual: SW Sex",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040776791

We analyzed 24 vegetative and regenerative traits of the 100 most abundant species along a steep climatic gradient. Based on plant traits and standard multivariate techniques, we identified eight PFTs. Our results confirmed, over a wide range of climatic conditions, the occurrence of broad recurrent patterns of association among plant traits reported for other floras; namely trade-offs between high investment in photosynthesis and growth on the one hand, and preferential allocation to storage and defence on the other. Regenerative traits were only partially coupled with vegetative traits. Using easily-measured plant traits and individual species cover in 63 sites, we predicted main community-ecosystem processes along the regional gradient. We hypothesized likely impacts of global climatic change on PFTs and ecosystems in situ, and analysed their probabilities of migrating in response to changing climatic conditions. Finally, we discuss the advantages and limitations of this kind of approach in predicting changes in plant distribution and in ecosystem processes over the next century.","Argentina; Climate change; Plant functional trait; Regional gradient",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039655565

The slow recovery is attributed to the reoxidation and release of stored sulphur in catchments. Reduced sulphur retained in previous years when sulphur deposition was higher is exposed to air and oxidized during severe droughts, then exported during subsequent wet periods. Elevated stream SO42- concentrations and export rates occur in the autumns of years with prolonged severe droughts, particularly in catchments with extensive wetlands. Drought in our study catchments occurred in years following strong El Niño events. When the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) was strongly negative (1976-77, 1982-83, 1986-87, 1991-92, 1993-94) the frequency of occurrence of drought the following summer in small catchments with shallow overburden was extremely high. A lake's rate of recovery from acidification depends upon the amount of excess reduced S that has been stored in anoxic zones in the catchment (largely a function of the extent of wetlands) during years of elevated S deposition rates, and the frequency and severity of droughts. If long-term changes in global or regional climate alter the frequency or magnitude of El Niño-related droughts, the recovery of acidified lakes will be affected. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Acidification; El Niño; Global change; Southern Oscillation (SOI) Index; Sulphate","Acid rain; Climate change; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Lakes; Sulfur dioxide; El Nino phenomenon; Lake acidification; Southern oscillation index (SOI); Drought; acidification; drought; El Nino/Southern Oscillation; lake recovery; sulphate concentration; Canada, Ontario; rain; sulfur dioxide; acidification; air pollution; canada; climate; conference paper; lake; north america; pollution control; seasonal variation; water pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030609241

Variables such as violence, climate, and governmental price and credit policies are used to explain changes in private investment in irrigation across regions and over time. Violence negatively affects private investment. Climate affects the investment such that in regions with favorable climate conditions, investment in irrigation is less attractive, and appropriate government crop-price and credit policies promote investment in irrigation.",,"agricultural investment; crime; developing country; economic policy; environmental conditions; investment behaviour; irrigation; irrigation investment; macroeconomic policy; private investment; social instability; violence; water economics; Colombia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030618036

Measurements of the gas evolution were used to calculate the reduction rate. It was found that the reduction rate increased with increasing melt temperature and graphite addition. A decrease in either the diameter or the height of the pellets resulted in a significant increase in the reduction rate. The reductant particle size, however, had a very limited effect on the reduction kinetics. The reduction mechanisms were interpreted on two scales - pellet size and chromite grain size. On the former scale the effect of heat and mass transfer was significant in controlling the early stage of reduction of large pellets. On the latter scale gas diffusion was also very likely to be rate-controlling in the early stage, with an apparent activation energy estimated at 373 kJ/mol, whereas gas diffusion together with solid-state diffusion of chromium and/or iron through oxide phases may lead to mixed control in the late stages, with apparent activation energies calculated at 257 kJ/mol for the gas diffusion and 620 kJ/mol for the solid-state diffusion.

K1S 5B6, Canada","In ODP Hole 815A, located along the edge of the Townsville Trough and marginal to the Marion Plateau of northeast Australia, dolomite forms about 5-20 wt % of carbonate within a distal part of a muddy contourite succession of Pliocene (2.6-4.0 Ma) age. Integration of seismic, lithic, and biostratigraphic data identifies a history of current-controlled episodic deposition subsequently shut down during rapid subsidence by ∼ 2.6 Ma. Overlying pelagic-periplatform sediment contains no or trace amounts of dolomite. High-order, rhythmic (1-5 m thick) variation in dolomite, quartz, and carbonate content within the contourite succession defines a past, high-order stratigraphic variation in diagenetic potential for dolomite. δ13C values of dolomite reflect incorporation of at least two sources of bicarbonate mixed with seawater: (1) in more carbonate-rich sediment, δ13C values (1 to -2.0‰) indicate likely contribution from dissolution of metastable carbonate; (2) in more siliciclastic-rich sediment, with locally elevated total organic content, δ13C values (-4 to -6‰) reflect contribution from organic-matter diagenesis. The majority of δ18O values of dolomite over the entire contourite succession vary between 3.2 and 2‰, and are interpreted to reflect near-surface to shallow (tens of meters) subsurface, marine-derived diagenesis. A few dolomites with lower (2 to 0‰) values are restricted to two stratigraphic intervals, and reflect one or some combination of the following processes: a second stage of dolomitization at greater depths; near-surface diagenesis with much warmer bottom waters; or burial diagenesis with mixture of meteoric-and marine-derived pore fluids. Magnesian calcite is absent today in the contourite succession. However, the depositional and diagenetic frameworks of the contourite succession suggest that metastability of aragonite and magnesian calcite, variable current activity, and seawater diffusion across the sediment-water interface all promoted dolomitization. Compilation of dolomite stratigraphy along slopes off northeast Australia illustrates that dolomite distribution in Hole 815A is one of four intervals (D1-D4) in strata younger than 4 Ma: D1, 0.3-0.8 Ma; D2, 1-1.3 Ma; D3 (D3a, ∼ 1.8 and D3b, 2.0-2.4 Ma); and D4, 2.6-4.0 Ma. The stratigraphy is linked to temporal variation in supply of shelf- and pelagic-derived metastable carbonate regulated by changes in paleoceanography, eustasy, and tectonics. D1, D3b, and D4 are in sediments with ages similar to previously documented dolomitization stages in shallow-water platforms elsewhere in the world, and suggest a coincidence between elevated diagenetic potential for deep-water dolomitization in platform margins and substantive changes in oceanic volume transport linked to eustatic change in sea level.

Two cases exist in frontal thrust belts. In the first, more common case, the uplift rate of the external folds is higher than the subsidence rate of the foredeep. In the second case the fold uplift is less than the regional subsidence. The total fold uplift may be considered as the fold uplift rate minus the regional subsidence rate; this value can be either positive or negative. Positive total fold uplift occurs when folds rise faster than regional subsidence and the envelope of the fold crest rises towards the hinterland of the accretionary wedge. In the opposite case, negative total fold uplift, the envelope dips towards the hinterland because folds rise more slowly than regional subsidence. In the first positive case, the folds are deeply eroded and the onlap of the growing strata moves away from the fold crest if the sedimentation rate is lower than the fold uplift rate in marine or alluvial environments. In the second negative case, where folds rise at lower rates than the regional subsidence, the onlap moves towards the fold crest if the sedimentation rate is higher than the fold uplift rate. This is also the more favorable case for hydrocarbon traps where growth strata can seal the fold. Moreover the fast subsidence rates in the foredeep provide a higher thermal maturation. This second tectonic setting is commonly associated with accretionary wedges forming along west-directed subduction zones, which are characterized by high subsidence rates in the foredeep or trench, due to the fast 'eastward' roll-back of the subduction hinge (e.g. Apennines, Carpathians, Banda arc). © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Fold uplift; Regional subsidence; Sedimentation rate","Geomorphology; Geophysical prospecting; Sedimentation; Subsidence; Tectonics; Accretionary wedges; Fold uplifts; Regional subsidence; Sedimentation rate; Thrust belts; Petroleum geology; fold uplift; palaeogeography; sedimentation rate; subsidence; thrust belt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031104058

In California, the number of violations of the carbon monoxide air quality standard during the three winters associated with the program was dramatically lower than during any winter prior to the program. Because meteorological conditions during the program were very favorable for dispersion of pollutants, any analysis of the impacts of the program must account for the influence of variable meteorological conditions.

This new process consists of three reaction steps: (a) hydrogasification of biomass, (b) steam reforming of the produced gas with additional natural gas feedstock, and (c) methanol synthesis of the hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced during the previous two steps. The H2-rich gas remaining after methanol synthesis is recycled to gasify the biomass in an energy neutral reactor so that there is no need for an expensive oxygen plant as required by commercial steam gasifiers. Recycling gas allows the methanol synthesis reactor to perform at a relatively lower pressure than conventional while the plant still maintains high methanol yield. Energy recovery designed into the process minimizes heat loss and increases the process thermal efficiency. If the Hynol methanol is used as an alternative and more efficient automotive fuel, an overall 41% reduction in CO2 emission can be achieved compared to the use of conventional gasoline fuel. A preliminary economic estimate shows that the total capital investment for a Hynol plant is 40% lower than that for a conventional biomass gasification plant. The methanol production cost is S0.43/gal for a 1085 million gal/yr Hynol plant which is competitive with current U.S. methanol and equivalent gasoline prices.

The ice source is deposition from vapor, and the ice sinks are gravitational settling and sublimation. Effective particle sizes for ice distributions are related empirically to temperature. Radiative properties are evaluated as functions of ice path and effective size using approximations to detailed radiative-transfer solutions (Mie theory and geometric ray tracing). The distributions of atmospheric ice and their impact on climate and climate sensitivity are evaluated by integrating the SKYHI GCM (developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory) for six model months. Most of the major climatological cirrus regions revealed by satellite observations appear in the GCM. The radiative forcing associated with ice clouds acts to warm the Earth-atmosphere system. Relative to a SKYHI integration without these clouds, zonally averaged temperatures are warmer in the upper tropical troposphere with ice clouds. The presence of ice produced small net changes in the sensitivity of SKYHI climate to radiative perturbations, but this represents an intricate balance among changes in clear-, cloud-, solar-, and longwave-sensitivity components. Deficiencies in the representation of ice clouds are identified as results of biases in the large-scale GCM fields which drive the parameterization and neglect of subgrid variations in these fields, as well as parameterization simplifications of complex microphysical and radiative processes.",,"atmospheric dynamics; climate regulator; GCM; ice cloud; large scale",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031391549

Under pressure all compounds dissolved in polymers reveal a significant enhancement of the luminescence emission in the low-pressure region. The degree of increase is strongly dependent on the type of polymer. DMABA exhibits both fluorescence and phosphorescence, whereas BP and DCBP molecules show only phosphorescence. For all these molecules a model based on the increase with increasing pressure of the amount of π,π* character in the initially predominately n,π* triplet state is proposed to account for the observed increase of the emission intensity. In the case of DMABA it is proposed that the increase of the π,π* character in the triplet state increases the emission intensity in two concurrent steps: by an increase of the radiative rate from the triplet state and by a decrease of the intersystem crossing rate between singlet and triplet states. The first factor increases phosphorescence intensity, and the second one effects the fluorescence. In the case of BP and DCBP, where the intersystem crossing process is very fast, the increase of pressure increases mainly the radiative rate of the lowest triplet state. In contrast to the polymer matrices, the emission intensity of these compounds strongly decreases under pressure in their crystalline environment. This is explained in terms of the increasing role of the nonradiative processes due to a strong coupling of the vibronic states of the triplet to the environment. The observed decrease in luminescence intensity in the polymers at high pressures has the same explanation.",,"Aromatic compounds; Electronic density of states; Fluorescence; Light emission; Molecular structure; Organic polymers; Phosphorescence; Pressure effects; Benzophenone; Dichlorobenzophenone; Dimethylamino benzaldehyde; Pressure induced emission; Luminescence of organic solids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031075317

Harmonisation up to EU standards in Budapest needs significant solutions in the field of sewerage and wastewater treatment. These solutions would mean considerable costs. This study analyses different development scenarios, and their costs. The investigated scenarios are the following: - autonomous development (Scenario 1) in this scenario all the population of Budapest will be connected to sewerage, and new wastewater treatment capacity will not be built. The calculated P and N emissions by population are in Table 4; - stand-still scenario (Scenario 2) in this scenario we hypothesize, that the nutrient emission will not increase. The estimated values of N, P emission of this scenario are in Table 5; - 25% emission reduction (Scenario 3) in this case the limit factor is the N too. To the 25% N reduction 1.5 million PE size primary and secondary new treatment and 300 thousand PE N elimination capacity should be built. In this scenario the P discharge is less than in the present by 53%. The estimated nutrient discharge by population is in Table 6; - 50% emission reduction (Scenario 4) in this scenario 1.5 million PE size new primary and secondary sewage treatment capacity, over it 1.3 million PE nitrification-denitrification, and 200 thousand PE chemical phosphorus elimination capacity in South Budapest WWTP are needed. The values of P, N emissions in this case are in Table 7; - harmonisation up to EU standards (Scenario 5) this scenario gives very strict requirements. This would mean a demand for 1.5 million PE size new primary and secondary, 2 million PE nitrification-denitrification, and over it 2 million PE biological-chemical phosphorus elimination sewage treatment capacity. There is not any reality to build it until 2000. The significant investment of building 550 km sewer, around 100 pump stations, 30 km pressure conduits and a new wastewater treatment plant need phased implementation. The values of the estimated nutrient discharge by population is in Table 8. The investment costs of sewage treatment at different scenarios are in Table 9.

Absorption and steady state fluorescence studies of these dyes at the air-water interface reveals the formation of aggregates at the air-water interface. Detailed studies revealed the formation of J-aggregates in the case of TR and both J- and H-aggregates in the case of BCOC. Polarized fluorescence studies confirmed that the dye molecules were highly oriented at the air-water interface. Surface pressure dependent fluorescence emission studies showed extensive quenching of the TR fluorescence that has been attributed to an efficient energy transfer from the monomeric species of TR to their aggregates which are nonfluorescent. In the case of BCOC, fluorescence emission occurs only from the J-aggregates of BCOC as the H-aggregates are nonfluorescent. Mixed films of BCOC and TR with DPPC show unique behavior. Even at very low concentration of TR, the BCOC fluorescence is completely quenched and the sensitized fluorescence from TR dominate, thus indicating efficient energy transfer from BCOC to the TR moieties. With an increase in the surface pressure, the same features are found to predominate and the quenching of TR fluorescence is attributed to the generation of TR aggregates caused as a result of compressing the monolayer. At higher surface pressures, the characteristics of the TR fluorescence are found to disappear and the fluorescence characteristics of BCOC dominate. One explanation of such behavior could be the deactivation of BCOC via the radiative pathway and inefficent energy transfer from the aggregates of BCOC to the aggregates of TR. This study therefore establishes that FRET can be a useful tool for studying aggregation in supramolecular LB assemblies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039057798

As ensuing production began to decline, a regional synthesis of the basin was undertaken to evaluate the remaining hydrocarbon potential. This program focused on sequence stratigraphy and the petroleum system approach, and required several years of effort. As a result, a new type of stratigraphic play was defined and successfully drilled, quickly appraised, and recognized as a gas giant, named Peciko Field. Simultaneously, sedimentological observations of the modern Mahakam Delta and its close relationship to the underlying Miocene Delta, strongly suggest that subsurface thinly bedded productive sandstones would be widespread and continuous reservoirs. Systematic pressure analyses were utilized to assist in the understanding of the hydrodynamic effects within the developing Tunu Gas Field, and to expand this concept throughout the basin. The interplay between the regional study and the geological, reservoir, and production knowledge derived from the two developing fields enhanced the reserve figures for those fields, and had a direct bearing on their highly and increasingly efficient drilling appraisal programs. 3D seismic helped identify gas sands in the distal faulted setup of the basin, and is expected to contribute greatly to the ultimate understanding of hydrocarbon accumulations in the Mahakam. The 'creaming curves' illustrate the early high level of maturity reached for oil discoveries in the Mahakam. Fifteen years later, the maturity for gas discoveries is far from levelling out, thanks to a new working model that has changed the long term future of the province. © 1998 The Executive Board of the World Petroleum Congress.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33645520564

In addition, valuable materials in pollution control dusts and sludges which are captured from the iron and steel making process are processed through the sinter plant to make the product steel. There is a scarcity of emission data for sinter plants in the literature. EPA's AP-42 contains emission factors for only particulate and CO. In addition, the tests supporting these factors are a few decades old. The Air and Waste Management Association's Air Pollution Engineering Manual contains some additional information on Sulfur Dioxide and Nitrogen Oxides emissions. To develop the emission inventory for the National Acid Precipitation Program, some emission factors were developed for the gaseous criteria pollutants, but these factors are poorly documented and are not consistent with contemporary stack tests. As a part of the Ozone State Implementation Plan process, partially as a result of the application of the emission factors developed for NAPAP which are reported in EPA's AIRS data base, sinter plants have been identified as major sources of ozone precursors. In order to better understand the actual emissions from sinter plants, a number of stack tests have recently been completed on most of the sinter plants in the United States.

In this paper, I review X-ray spectral properties of Cyg X-1. Usually, Cyg X-1 is in the low state (hard spectral state), in which the energy spectrum in 2 - 10 keV is roughly represented with a power-law function, and sub-second short-term variations are significant. The continuum of the low state energy spectrum is consistent with the superposition of a power-law function with an exponential cut-off and its reflection component by an optically thick accretion disk. Thermal Comptonization of soft photons by hot plasma is a likely model for the intrinsic power-law emission. Iron K-emission lines have been reported, and study of those emission lines have a potential to verify strong gravitational fields around a black hole. However, the line emission is not prominent, as opposed to the cases of AGNs, and the line parameters are dependent on the choice of the continuum model. To determine the continuum spectral shape precisely and disentangle the iron line emission, observations having both high spectral resolution and wide energy coverage will be required.

This technique is tested for a simple box model of the climate system. Two ""perfect"" models of the ocean and the atmosphere are available. These are coupled to form an ocean-atmosphere model representing the true climate system. This climate system is simulated by a climate model which is also constructed by coupling those two perfect models. This time, however, both models are run first separately as models of the atmosphere and the ocean. In that case, ""observations"" from the climate system are prescribed at the ocean surface in the uncoupled models. It is assumed that these observations are imperfect. A drift results, when these models are coupled to form an ocean-atmosphere stimulation model. A flux adjustment scheme is implemented to remove this drift. It is argued that the merits and shortcomings of the flux correction technique can be assessed more clearly this way than by coupling imperfect models as is done normally. Sensitivity tests are performed where either radiation parameters are changed or a salt anomaly is implanted. Model parameters are chosen such that the ocean has a thermally direct circulation in the unperturbed climate state. It is found that the flux correction technique is performing satisfactorily as long as the imposed perturbations are small enough so that the ocean circulation does not change its sense. If, however, the model climate is close to the transition to an indirect circulation, then the flux correction technique is unreliable. The predictions of the coupled model with flux correction may deviate substantially from the response of the climate system in that case.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0343281084

Our goal is to stimulate discussion of the factors controlling distributions of C4 plaints today, historically, and under future elevated CO2 environments. Understanding the distributions of C3/C4 plants impacts not only primary productivity, but also the distribution, evolution, and migration of both invertebrates and vertebrates that graze on these plants. Sixteen separate studies all indicate that the current distributions of C4 monocots are tightly correlated with temperature: elevated temperatures during the growing season favor C4 monocots. In contrast, the seven studies on C4 dicot distributions suggest that a different environmental parameter, such as aridity (combination of temperature and evaporative potential), more closely describes their distributions. Differences in the temperature dependence of the quantum yield for CO2 uptake (light-use efficiency) of C3 and C4 species relate well to observed plant distributions and light-use efficiency is the only mechanism that has been proposed to explain distributional differences in C3/C4 monocots. Modeling of C3 and C4 light-use efficiencies under different combinations of atmospheric CO2 and temperature predicts that C4-dominated ecosystems should not have expanded until atmospheric CO2 concentrations reached the lower levels that are thought to have existed beginning near the end of the Miocene. At that time, palaeocarbonate and fossil data indicate a simultaneous, global expansion of C4-dominated grasslands. The C4 monocots generally have a higher quantum yield than C4 dicots and it is proposed that leaf venation patterns play a role in increasing the light-use efficiency of most C4 monocots. The reduced quantum yield of most C4 dicots is consistent with their rarity, and it is suggested that C4 dicots may not have been selected until CO2 concentrations reached their lowest levels during glacial maxima in the Quaternary. Given the intrinsic light-use efficiency advantage of C4 monocots, C4 dicots may have been limited in their distributions to the warmest ecosystems, saline ecosystems, and/or to highly disturbed ecosystems. All C4 plants have a significant advantage over C3 plants under low atmospheric CO2 conditions and are predicted to have expanded significantly on a global scale during full-glacial periods, especially in tropical regions. Bog and lake sediment cores as well as pedogenic carbonates support the hypothesis that C4 ecosystems were more extensive during the last glacial maximum and then decreased in abundance following deglaciation as atmospheric CO2 levels increased.","Carbon isotope ratio; Global change; Light-use efficiency; Photosynthesis; Quantum yield","Dicotyledoneae; Invertebrata; Liliopsida; Vertebrata",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030810041

The thermoelectric force can generate cellular motion in a layer of liquid semiconductor not only when the heating is from below, but also when the heating is from above, where the excitation of different forces is not possible. The action of thermoelectricity is most intense in thin layers. Attention is drawn to the establishment of conditions for the excitation of convective thermoelectricity and the effect of thermoelectricity on the conditions for excitation by well-known, previously studied forces. Curves of neutral stability are presented, from which one can assess the contributions of each effect to the conditions of excitation. Particular attention is paid to elucidating the possibility of motion observed in experiments on the distribution of a liquid semiconductor (semimetal) by laser radiation. It is shown that including the thermoelectric effect permits an explanation for the presence of convection in a melted region subject to heating from above.

Treatment of 2b with t-BuOK and C2Cl6 at -78° leads to the chemoselective introduction of a Cl substituent in Me-C(1) (see 5b in Scheme 1). Formation of the corresponding triphenylphosphonium salt 7b via the iodide 6b (Scheme 2) allowed a Wittig reaction with cinnamaldehyde in the two-phase system CH2Cl2/2N NaOH. Transformation of the 4,5-dicarboxylate of 2b into the corresponding pseudo-ester 10b allowed the selective reduction of the carbonyl function at C(4) with DIBAH to yield the corresponding 4-carbaldehyde 11b (Scheme 3). Wittig reaction of 11b with (benzyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide led to the introduction of the 4-phenylbuta-1,3-dienyl substituent at C(4). The combination of both Wittig reactions led to the synthesis of the 1,4-bis(4-phenylbuta-1,3-dienyl)-substituted heptalene-5-carboxylate (all-E)-17b (Scheme 5). In a similar manner, by applying a Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction, followed by the Wittig reaction, the donor-acceptor substituted heptalene-5-carboxylate (E;E)-22b was synthesized (Scheme 7). Most of these new heptalenes are in solution, at room temperature, in thermal equilibrium with their double-bond shifted (DBS) isomers. In the case of (all-E)-17b and (E;E)-22b, irradiation of the thermal equilibrium mixture with light of λ = (439 ± 10) nm led to a strong preponderance (&gt; 90%) of the DBS isomers 17a and (E;E)-22a, respectively (Schemes 6 and 7). Heating of the photo-mixtures at 40° re-established quickly the thermal equilibrium mixtures. Heptalenes-carboxylates (all-E)-17a and (E;E)-22a which represent the off-state of a 1,4-conjugative switch (CS) system show typical heptalene UV/VIS spectra with a bathochromically shifted heptalene band III and comparably weak heptalene bands II and I which appear only as shoulders (Figs. 4 and 5). In contrast, the DBS isomers (all-E)-17b and (all-E)-22b, equivalent to the on-state of a 1,4-CS system, exhibit extremely intense heptalene bands I and, possibly, II which appear as a broad absorption band at 440 and 445 nm, respectively, thus indicating that the CSs (all-E)-17a⇌(all-E)-17b and (E;E)-22a⇌(E;E)-22b are perfectly working.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001303866

Methods: Smear layer-covered dentin specimens prepared from third molars immediately after extraction were imaged by tapping mode AFM and analyzed by MIR-FTIR spectroscopy. The same specimens were subjected to conditioning treatments with CA Agent (Kuraray), Scotchbond Etchant (3M Dental Products) and Scotchbond MP Etchant (3M Dental Products) gels and then imaged and analyzed again. The extent of dentin decalcification at the uppermost 2 μm region was calculated from the percentage reduction in the -PO4/amide I peak area ratio of conditioned specimens relative to their individual smear layer-covered references. These results were compared by ANOVA and Scheffé statistical analyses. The conformational changes of dentin type I collagen at the region were studied qualitatively by deconvoluting the amide I bands of MIR-FTIR spectra and assigning the band components to carbonyl hydrogen bonding states related to the α-helix structure. Results: All the conditioners removed the smear layer, funneled the tubules, increased the intertubular roughness and contaminated the dentin surfaces with residues from irreversibly adsorbed thickening agents. Conditioned dentin surfaces showed a reduction in orthophosphates and carbonates and an increase in amide I, II and III groups. CA Agent manifested a significantly lower extent of dentin decalcification than Scotchbond etchants (p &lt; 0.05). Collagen conformational changes involved a decrease in intermolecular hydrogen bonded amide I carbonyls associated with the α-helix structure and enhancement of imide carbonyls hydrogen bonded to water, which suggest collagen denaturation. Significance: Apart from dentin decalcification, the acidic conditioners induced considerable changes on dentin collagen conformation mostly associated with denaturation processes. In addition, irreversibly adsorbed residual thickeners substantially modified the morphology and composition of dentin surfaces. These findings show the complex interaction pathways between conditioners and dentin surfaces and the great potential of modern in situ imaging and analysis techniques in probing these interactions.",,"amide; citric acid; collagen; maleic acid; maleic acid derivative; phosphoric acid; analysis of variance; article; chemistry; comparative study; dental acid etching; dental surgery; dentin; drug effect; infrared spectroscopy; metabolism; pH; protein conformation; regression analysis; surface property; tooth disease; Acid Etching, Dental; Amides; Analysis of Variance; Citric Acid; Collagen; Dentin; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Maleates; Phosphoric Acids; Protein Conformation; Regression Analysis; Smear Layer; Spectroscopy, Fourier Transform Infrared; Surface Properties; Tooth Demineralization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030622320

Environmental conditions were simulated in a controlled-environment experiment on the basis of data collected in the habitat of the two species in the southern Namib desert. Experiments included one or more periods of hot bergwind, which frequently occurs in this region. When water was readily available, daily net CO2 fixation was similar in the two species. This result confirms that the daily CO2 fixation of CAM plants is as high as that of morphologically similar Q3 plants adapted to the same habitat. As expected, both species reduced CO2 fixation and water loss through transpiration during simulated hot bergwind periods and their WUE values increased.

Patients with unipolar depression show impaired performance on the Tower of London planning task. Positron emission tomography, which has previously identified resting state blood flow abnormalities in depression, was used to investigate neural activity associated with performance of this task in depressed patients and normal controls. Methods. Six patients with unipolar depression and six matched controls were scanned while performing easy and hard Tower of London problems in a one-touch computerized paradigm and while performing a perceptuomotor control task. Results. The patients in this study showed an expected task-related performance deficit compared with normal subjects. In normal subjects, the task engaged a network of prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, posterior cortical areas and subcortical structures including the striatum, thalamus and cerebellum. Depressed patients failed to show significant activation in the cingulate and striatum; activation in the other prefrontal and posterior cortical regions was significantly attenuated relative to controls. Crucially, patients also failed to show the normal augmentation of activation in the caudate nucleus, anterior cingulate and right prefrontal cortex associated with increasing task difficulty. Conclusions. These findings provide evidence for cingulate, prefrontal and striatal dysfunction associated with impaired task performance in depression. The present results are consistent with a central role of cingulate dysfunction in depression as well as suggesting impaired frontostriatal function.",,"amitriptyline; citalopram; dosulepin; imipramine; lithium; moclobemide; paroxetine; adult; article; blood flow; brain blood flow; cingulate gyrus; clinical article; computer analysis; controlled study; corpus striatum; electroencephalogram; female; human; major depression; male; planning; positron emission tomography; prefrontal cortex; task performance; thalamus; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Case-Control Studies; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Corpus Striatum; Depressive Disorder; Female; Frontal Lobe; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Intervention Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Problem Solving; Tomography, Emission-Computed; Volition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030800191

The resulting MS data provide paleoclimate estimates that are in excellent agreement with independently published paleoclimatic trends for early-middle Holocene time. Basically, MS variations are attributed to variations in climate-controlled pedogenesis and the production of magnetic mineral phases, including maghemite, outside the cave. These soils are then washed, blown or tracked into the cave where they accumulate, creating the MS changes observed in the samples recovered. Low MS magnitudes indicate times of cooler/drier climate resulting from reduced pedogenesis, while warmer/wetter times yield higher pedogenetic rates and thus higher MS magnitudes. It is clear from the Konispol Cave results that some caves provide ideal, protected environments from which high-resolution, paleoclimatic records can be extracted. Composite sections from excavations within a single region can yield a relatively continuous, long-term climatic proxy that can be routinely correlated to artefacts recovered from these or other protected excavations within the same region. © 1997 Academic Press Limited.","Albania; Holocene; Magnetic susceptibility; Neo-glacial; Paleoclimate; Pedogenesis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000869610

This paper examines the air quality effectiveness of selected traffic management measures implemented in European cities. Traffic management measures attempt to reduce total vehicle emissions by creating situations where vehicle engines operate efficiently, by eliminating congestion and smoothing traffic flows. They attempt to reduce the use of private vehicles by encouraging a modal switch from cars to public transport, cycling and walking and by applying measures to minimize the distances between home, work, shops and leisure facilities. Factors influencing the choice and the effectiveness of traffic management measures are discussed such as economic considerations, attitudes of the public, national constraints, and alternative goals for such measures (e.g. lessening congestion in order to improve mobility; reducing motor vehicle accidents). This paper highlight that there are a limited number of assessments available concerning the air quality effectiveness of specific measures in a variety of urban settings. One problem experienced in studies attempting to assess the air quality impacts of traffic management schemes is that rarely is one measure implemented on its own, rather a combination of complementary measures is introduced.",,"Air pollution control; Exhaust gases; Gas emissions; Traffic control; Urban planning; Traffic management measures; Vehicle emissions; Air quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031370117

The manipulation experiment (at Abet, in north-western Wales, UK) was part of the European NITREX project and involved five years of additions of inorganic nitrogen to the spruce stand. The model (MERLIN) is a catchment-scale, mass-balance model that simulates both biotic and abiotic processes affecting nitrogen in ecosystems. The structure of MERLIN includes representations of the inorganic soil, one plant compartment and two soil organic compartments. Fluxes in and out of the simulated ecosystem and transfers between compartments are regulated by atmospheric deposition, hydrological discharge and biological processes such as plant uptake, litter production, immobilization, mineralization, nitrification and denitrification. Rates of nitrogen uptake, cycling and release among pools are regulated by carbon productivity, inorganic nitrogen availability and the C:N ratios of the organic pools. Inputs to the model are temporal sequences of carbon fluxes and pools, hydrological discharge and external sources of nitrogen. The NITREX experiment at Abet began in 1990 with weekly additions of ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) at a rate of 35 kg N ha-1 yr-1. Data were collected from both control and treatment plots within the stand. The site-intensive data from the control plots at Aber were augmented by data taken from a chronosequence of 20 Sitka spruce stands and data from a survey of 5 moorland catchments in the same region to provide calibration data for the model. The data were used to establish current conditions at the Aber site and to reconstruct historical sequences of carbon fluxes and pools from 1900 to the present day with which to drive the model. The reconstructed sequences included an increase in nitrogen deposition and a vegetation change from moorland to plantation forest in 1960. The calibrated model was then used to predict the effects of the experimental nitrogen additions begun in 1990. MERLIN successfully reproduced the observed increase in NO3 leaching from aging spruce stands that results from forest maturation and increased nitrogen deposition (as inferred from the chronosequence and forest survey data in the region). MERLIN also correctly predicted the increases in soilwater NO3 concentrations, the changes in nitrogen content of tree and soil organic matter pools, and the changes in nitrogen fluxes that occur in spruce stands in response to increased nitrogen inputs (as observed in the nitrogen addition experiment).","Acidification; Forest ecosystems; Models; Sitka spruce","acidification; forest ecosystem; leaching; mass balance; MERLIN model; NITREX project; nitrogen deposition; UK, Wales, Gwynedd, Aber; Picea sitchensis; Pinaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030614196

Calculating the absorption/gain via the spontaneous emission formula and performing the broadening within the latter circumvents certain artifacts for both level and transition broadening. When using κ-independent relaxation times, Gaussian (non-Markovian) broadening functions are superior to Lorentzian (Markovian) ones. In contrast to transition broadening, level broadening may even enhance the gain over its whole spectral width. In contrast to Lorentzian transition broadening, Gaussian transition broadening yields a blue shift of the gain maximum. The direction and magnitude of the spectral shift arising from Gaussian level broadening depends on the degree of degeneracy of the electron and hole bands involved. The level broadening can have a significant influence on the carrier statistics, which, consequently, has to be included into a consistent treatment. Thus, the phenomenological model functions depend distinctly on which kind of relaxation process is faster, energy or phase relaxation. For GaAs-like semiconductors, the application of transition broadening - even when using the spontaneous emission formula - to cases of dominant intraband relaxation yields significant numerical deviations from the correct treatment of level broadening. Broadening the energy levels requires an additional convolution integration. We will present an approximation, which yields excellent results for the gain in GaAs-like semiconductors. This enables one to include the significant effects of level broadening without increasing the numerical effort and leads to favorable formulae for experimental data fitting and device modeling.","Modeling; Relaxation processes; Semiconductor lasers","Amplification; Computer simulation; Markov processes; Relaxation processes; Semiconducting gallium arsenide; Semiconductor materials; Spectrum analysis; Spectral shift; Semiconductor lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031123729

Few previous studies have addressed the question of whether mercury deposition has increased continuously to the present or whether it has declined in recent decades. We present stratigraphic data from a suite of Minnesota lakes that indicate mercury deposition peaked in the 1960s and 1970s, at least for the upper Midwest. Recent declines, which appear in both rural and urban lakes, are not evident in sediment cores from remote coastal lakes in southeastern Alaska. Because the Alaskan sites provide an integrated sample of mercury pollution in the Northern Hemisphere, these results imply that global mercury emissions have not abated and that decreased inputs to Midwestern lakes are caused by reduced emissions from regional sources. U.S. inventory data suggest that decreased emissions likely resulted from reduced industrial use of mercury, use of pollution-control technologies that incidentally capture mercury, a shift from coal to natural gas for commercial and residential heating, and a decrease in uncontrolled waste incineration. Increased stack height and other factors that favor long-distance transport could be partially responsible for the trend.",,"lake water; mercury; natural gas; article; contamination; control system; environmental impact assessment; geography; incineration; nonhuman; pollution control; sediment; water pollution; atmospheric deposition; long range transport; mercury; pollution control; USA, (Midwest); USA, Alaska",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030618482

An equal molar mixture of methanol and isobutanol would be an ideal feedstock for production of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) for use as an additive to gasoline to increase the octane number and reduce air pollution. Of the reaction conditions examined, the higher temperature, 440°C, and higher pressure, 1500 psig, result in the highest isobutanol production rate over most of the catalysts examined. The effect of the K promoter loading also was examined. Increasing the amount of K from 0 to 1 wt% increases the hydrocarbon by-product rate, but the addition of 3 or 5 wt% K decreases the hydrocarbon by-product rate consequently increasing the selectivity to total alcohols. Increasing the K loading above 3 wt%, however, raises the methanol-to-isobutanol mole ratio. The use of the 3 wt% K-containing catalyst results in the lowest methanol-to-isobutanol mole ratio of 1.5 which is near the desired value of 1.0 for MTBE synthesis. An isobutanol production rate of 103 g/kg-cat/hr is attained using a 1 wt% K-promoted Zn/Cr spinel catalyst. Surface-characterization studies were performed on the 3 wt% K-containing catalyst. Ion-scattering spectroscopy data reveal that the outermost surface layer of the fresh catalyst consists of C, O, Cr, and Zn. Since the catalysts are reduced prior to testing in the reactor, surface studies also were performed after reducing the catalyst in 1 × 10-7 Torr of H2 for 4 hr at 250°C. The addition of the alkali is necessary for higher alcohol synthesis (HAS), and the pretreatment results in migration of the K promoter to the outermost surface layer where the catalytic reactions occur. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data are consistent with these results and also reveal that the near-surface regions of the nontreated and H2-treated samples consist primarily of ZnO. The K is present as K2Cr2O7 or K2CrO4. Although the outermost atomic layer of the reduced catalyst contains a large amount of K, relatively little is observed in the near-surface region using XPS, indicating that most of the K is located at the surface. The catalytically active surface for HAS consists of alkali species lying on top of a ZnO phase. The chemical state of the Cr species is altered during reaction. The K2Cr2O7 or K2CrO4 present on the fresh and reduced catalyst is converted to Cr2O3, Cr(OH)x and Cr0 with age, but no other phases of Zn other than ZnO are observable before or after aging. The Zn/Cr spinel is not important for activity toward isobutanol production and acts only as a high-surface-area support. © 1997 Academic Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0006513296

The experimental approach consisted in setting up multimodal vibrational nonequilibrium in shock-heated CO2/N2/Ar mixtures and measuring the rate of CO2 decomposition by means of high-precision time-resolved atomic resonance absorption spectroscopy (ARAS) of oxygen atoms formed early in the vibrational relaxation. Measurements were taken in mixtures containing 2000 ppm CO2 and N2 and in 10%N2+Ar at temperatures 2326-2855 K and pressures 0.75-2.59 atm. A tentative analysis of the obtained data has led us to conclude that the rate of CO2 decomposition can be qualitatively described in terms of a macroscopic rate constant for dissociation dependent on the vibrational temperature T3 of low-lying levels of the antisymmetric mode. For the purpose of quantitative description of CO2 dissociation at vibrational nonequilibrium we developed a numerical model combining an exact approach taking into account vibrational levels of reacting molecules with the ""ladder"" approximation of this molecule. The underlying principle of this model allowing for intramodal and intermodal energy exchange and dissociation is that relaxation of low-lying vibrational levels of CO2 should be modelled with a pinpoint accuracy, while higher-excited states of all the modes should be described within the ""ladder"" approximation. A kinetic dissociation mechanism involving interaction of highly excited states of CO2 and N2 is proposed, and the rate constants for the included energy exchange processes are evaluated.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10444283524

All observed spectra contained significant [Ne V] and [Fe VII] lines. The spectra of the Seyfert nuclei (but not the radio galaxies) showed also [Fe X], [Fe XI], and in some cases [Fe XIV] emission. Our data confirm that the FHILs are on average broader and blueshifted relative to the lines of lower ionization stages. The amount of the blueshift was found to be correlated with the line widths. Large blueshifts were observed only for lines with high FWHM. An analysis of the line ratios indicates for the FHIL producing plasma an average electron temperature of about 7 × 104 K. Comparing our results with ROSAT data we found a correlation between the X-ray spectral index and the strength of the FHILs.

The extent of ventilation of the mantle depends upon the duration and size of opening of an occllisible pore known as the pneumostome. In Helix aspersa and Helix pomatia, pneumostomal size and frequency of opening are exquisitely sensitive to CO2. Respiratory CO2 chemosensitivity resides in a discrete region of the subesophageal ganglia. The discharge pattern of many neurons in the chemoreceptor area changes during stimulation with CO2. However, the electrophysiological response to CO, stimulation alone does not discriminate between CO2 chemoreceptor cells and CO2-insensitive neurons active in the pneumostomal response to CO2. We identified a subset of CO2-sensitive neurons from the larger population of neurons active during CO2 stimulation. . The action potential discharge frequency of CO2 chemosensory neurons increased in response to CO2 stimulation. An increased discharge frequency of CO2-sensitive neurons was associated with increased pneumostomal opening, and both the size and the frequency of pneumostomal opening increased during CO, stimulation. Injecting depolarizing current into individual chemosensory neurons elicited opening of the pneumostome in the absence of CO2. Action potential generation in response to CO2 was independent of synaptic transmission. Removal of individual CO2-sensitive cells or inhibition of action potential generation in CO2-sensitive cells reduced or eliminated pneumostomal responses to CO2. CO2 sensitivity in chemoreceptor cells required extracellular calcium, but not sodium. Substituting barium for calcium supported chemoreceptor activity. In summary, we have identified respiratory related, chemosensory neurons that are CO2 sensitive in the absence of synaptic input.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746007546

The enzyme is involved in the pathway of carbon dioxide reduction to methane and catalyzes the transfer of formyl from formylmethanofuran to tetrahydromethanopterin. Results: The crystal structure of Ftr, determined to a resolution of 1.73 Å, reveals a homotetramer composed essentially of two dimers. Each subunit is subdivided into two tightly associated lobes both consisting of a predominantly antiparallel β sheet flanked by α helices forming an α/β sandwich structure. The approximate location of the active site was detected in a region close to the dimer interface. Conclusions: The adaptation of Ftr against high lyotropic salt concentrations is structurally reflected by a large number of negatively charged residues and their high local concentration on the surface of the protein. The salt-dependent thermostability of Ftr might be explained on a molecular basis by ionic interactions at the protein surface, involving both protein and inorganic salt ions, and the mainly hydrophobic interactions between the subunits and within the core.","crystal structure; formyltransferase; halophilic enzymes; hyperthermophilic enzymes; methanogenic Archaea; Methanopyrus kandleri",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031570334

The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments required the addition of fuel oxygenates to gasoline in areas where the level of carbon monoxide exceeded national ambient air quality standards. In the South Coast Air Basin gasoline containing oxygenated compounds has been in use since the late 1980's. One oxygenated fuel additive most often selected by producers to meet the requirements is methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE). However, large production numbers associated with MTBE production, combined with the compound's high water solubility, chemical stability, and toxicity, make it a potentially important groundwater pollutant.

After one year of operation, one of the biofilters spontaneously developed the ability to degrade MTBE.

The hydrated films so derived consist of an amorphous organic phase in which the metal cations and nitrate anions are homogeneously dispersed. Heating to temperatures above 200 °C leads to film dehydration followed by an auto-catalyzed oxidation reaction whereby the bound nitrate oxidizes the organic matrix leaving behind an intact stoichiometric and crystalline metal oxide film. Films are characterized using AFM, XRD, and optical methods. Transformation processes in these films have been studied in detail by means of spectroscopic ellipsometry and laser induced fluorescence from films doped with a suitable rare earth probe ion such as Sm+3. In the latter case, the measured fluorescence emission spectra are used to identify the hydrated, dehydrated, amorphous and crystalline metal oxide phases which evolve during processing. These transformations also have been induced upon visible CW laser irradiation at fluences in excess of 1 MW/cm2. Under these conditions, the film dehydrates and compacts within the footprint of the incident laser beam rendering this region of the film water insoluble. Post irradiation washing of the film with water removes all vestiges of the film outside of the beam footprint suggesting a possible use of this technique for lithography applications. Films subjected to laser irradiation and post irradiation heating have been characterized with respect to thickness, phase composition, crystallite size and optical constants. ©2004 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Laser induced fluorescence; Lithography; Microstructure; Phase transformation; Thin film; Topology; Zirconia","Amorphous films; Crystalline materials; Crystallite size; Doping (additives); Emission spectroscopy; Fluorescence; Heating; Hydrates; Hydration; Irradiation; Laser damage; Laser optics; Lasers; Lithography; Metal refining; Metallic compounds; Metals; Microstructure; Optical constants; Optical materials; Rare earth elements; Semiconducting silicon compounds; Silica; Spectroscopic ellipsometry; Thin film devices; Thin films; Topology; Zirconia; Zirconium; Applications.; Aqueous solutions; Catalyzed oxidations; Crystalline metals; CW lasers; Deposited metals; Earth probes; Fluences; Fluorescence emissions; Hydrated films; Incident laser beams; Laser induced fluorescence; Laser irradiations; Metal cations; Nitrate anions; Optical methods; Organic matrixes; Phase transformation; Post irradiations; Precursor metals; Silicon substrates; Spin casts; Transformation processes; Zirconium dioxide films; Oxide films",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58149280580

At the peak load, the ozone nonattainment required NOx reduction from baseline levels necessary to meet the presumptive limit for cyclone boilers in this regulation is 56%.

Boiler No. 43's maximum continuous rating (MCR) is 550,000 pounds per hour of steam flow (or approximately equivalent to 60 MWe). Because of the compact boiler design, there is insufficient furnace residence time to use coal or oil as the reburn fuel, thus making it a prime candidate for gas reburn.

One is to set up specific reserves, funding the establishment, demarcation, and guarding of these units. Monitoring, in this case, consists of the relatively straightforward process of confirming that the forest stands in question continue to exist. In Amazonia, where large expanses of tropical forest still exist, the reserve approach has the logical weakness of being completely open to ""leakage"": with the implantation of any given reserve, the people who would have been deforesting in the reserve area will probably continue to clear the same amount of forest somewhere else in the region. The second approach is through policy changes aimed at reducing the rate of clearing, but not limited to specific reserves or areas of forest. This second approach addresses more fundamental aspects of the tropical deforestation problem, but has the disadvantages of not assuring the permanence of forest and of not resulting in a visible product that can be convincingly credited to the existence of the project. In order for credit to be assigned to policy change projects, functioning models of the deforestation process must be developed that arc capable of producing scenarios with and without different policy changes. This requires understanding the process of deforestation, which depends on monitoring in order to have information as a time series. Information is needed both from satellite imagery and from on-thc-ground observations on who occupies the land and why the observed changes occur. Monitoring must be done by individual property if causal factors are to be identified reliably; this is best achieved using a database in a Geographical Information System (GIS) that includes property boundaries. Once policy changes arc made in practice, not only deforestation but also the policies themselves must be monitored. Decrees and laws are not the same as changes in practice; the initiation and continued application of changes must therefore be confirmed regularly.

But empirical evidence for such trade-offs is scant, which has called into question the likelihood of nonallopatric speciation. Here, we report on the second in a series of studies testing for host-related selection on pupal life-history characteristics of apple- (Malus pumila L.) and hawthorn- (Crataegus mollis L. spp.) infesting races of the Tephritid fruit fly, Rhagoletis pomonella (Walsh). In particular, we examine the effects of winter length on the genetics of these flies. We have previously found that the earlier fruiting phenology of apple trees exposes apple-fly pupae to longer periods of warm weather preceding winter than hawthorn-fly pupae. Because R. pomonella has a facultative diapause, we hypothesized that this selects for pupae with more recalcitrant pupal diapauses (or slower metabolic/development rates) in the apple-fly race. A study in which we experimentally manipulated the length of the prewintering period for hawthorn-origin pupae supported this prediction. If the period preceding winter is important for apple- and hawthorn-fly pupae, then so too should be the length (duration) of winter; the rationale for this prediction is that 'fast developing' pupae that break diapause too early will deplete their energy reserves and disproportionately die during long winters. To test this possibility, we chilled apple- and hawthorn-origin pupae collected from a field site near Grant, Michigan, in a refrigerator at 4°C for time periods ranging from one week to two years. Our a priori expectation was that longer periods of cold storage would select against allozyme markers that were associated with faster rates of development in our earlier study. Since these electromorphs are typically found at higher frequencies in hawthorn flies, extending the overwintering period should favor 'apple-fly alleles' in both races. The results from this 'overwinter' experiment supported the diapause hypothesis. The anticipated genetic response was observed in both apple and hawthorn races, as allele frequencies became significantly more 'apple-fly-like' in eclosing adults surviving longer chilling periods. This indicates that it is the combination of environmental conditions before and during winter that selects on the host races. Many tests for trade-offs fail to adequately consider the interplay between insect development, host plant phenology, and local climatic conditions. Our findings suggest that such oversight may help to explain the paucity of reported fitness trade-offs.","Allozymes; Apple maggot fly; Host races; Natural selection; Negative genetic fitness trade-offs; Overwintering diapause; Sympatric speciation","fitness; phytophagous insect; speciation; trade-off; winter duration; Grant; Michigan; USA; Animalia; Crataegus; Crataegus mollis; Crataegus mollis; Diptera; Diptera; Drosophila melanogaster; Hexapoda; Insecta; Malus pumila; Malus pumila; Malus x domestica; Rhagoletis pomonella; Rhagoletis pomonella; Rhagoletis pomonella; Rosaceae; Rosaceae; Tephritidae; Tephritidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031408601

Our grid of line emission spans 8 orders of magnitude in gas density and 14 orders of magnitude in ionizing flux in an effort to identify the optimal conditions in which these lines form. We show that coronal lines form at distances from just outside the broad-line region to ∼400L1/234.5 pc, in gas with ionization parameter -2.0 ≲ log U(H) ≲ 0.75, corresponding to gas densities of 102-108.5 cm-3, with electron temperatures ∼12,000-150,000 K. A large range of distances from the central source implies significant line width variation among the coronal lines.

Several conclusions were drawn from the model applications on the northeast and midwest domains: (1) UAM-IV output was very sensitive to both boundary conditions and mixing heights, (2) ROM-derived boundary conditions were generally inferior to those based on UAM-V output or observations; (3) a combined domain run gave improved simulations in the upwind regions of each domain relative to the single domain runs but did not show a general improvement over the entire domain; (4) there was little difference between UAM-IV and UAM-V performance; (5) the SAIMM prognostic meteorological model was difficult to merge satisfactorily with UAM-IV; and (6) sensitivity runs with 50% emissions reductions in manmade NOx or VOC showed that, in general, VOC reductions always lead to ozone concentration reductions and NOx reductions usually lead to increases in ozone concentration close to large point sources or urban areas.

Whereas CO2 enrichment (1000 μl · l-1) resulted in an increase in the carbon (C) to nitrogen (N) ratio of both the tobacco lines grown in pots with vermiculite, the C/N ratio was only slightly modified when plants were grown in hydroponic culture in high CO2 compared to those grown in air. Constitutive nitrate reductase (NR) expression per se did not change the C/N ratio of the shoots or roots. Biomass accumulation was similar in both types of plant when hydroponic or pot-grown material, grown in air or high CO2, were compared. Shoot dry matter accumulation was primarily related to the presence of stored carbohydrate (starch and sucrose) in the leaves. In the pot-grown tobacco, growth at elevated CO2 levels caused a concomitant decrease in the N content of the leaves involving losses in NO3- and amino acid levels. In contrast, the N content and composition were similar in all plants grown in hydroponic culture. The 35S-NR plants grown in air had higher foliar maximum extractable NR activities and increased glutamine levels (on a chlorophyll or protein basis) than the untransformed controls. These increase were maintained following CO2 enrichment when the plants were grown in hydroponic culture, suggesting that an increase flux through nitrogen assimilation was possible in the 35S-NR plants. Under CO2 enrichment the NR activation state in the leaves was similar in all plants. When the 35S-NR plants were grown in pots, however, foliar NR activity and glutamine content fell in the 35S-NR transformants to levels similar to those of the untransformed controls. The differences in NR activity between untransformed and 35S-NR leaves were much less pronounced in the hydroponic than in the pot-grown material but the difference in total extractable NR activity was more marked following CO2 enrichment. Foliar NR message levels were decreased by CO2 enrichment in all growth conditions but this was much more pronounced in pot-grown material than in that grown hydroponically. Since β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity and message levels in 35S-GUS plants grown under the same conditions of CO2 enrichment (to test the effects of CO2 enrichment on the activity of the 35S promoter) were found to be constant, we conclude that NR message turnover was specifically accelerated in the 35S-NR plants as well as in the untransformed controls as a result of CO2 enrichment. The molecular and metabolic signals involved in increased NR message and protein turnover are not known but possible effectors include NO3/-, glutamine and asparagine. We conclude that plants grown in hydroponic culture have greater access to N than those grown in pots. Regardless of the culture method, CO2 enrichment has a direct effect on NR mRNA stability.","Carbon dioxide enrichment; Carbon/nitrogen ratio; Glutamine; Nicotiana (C and N metabolism); Nitrate; Nitrate reductase","Nicotiana plumbaginifolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030740530

This SSM/I product is one of the components of the blended Global Precipitation Climatology Project rainfall climatology. The primary algorithm used is an 85 GHz scattering-based algorithm over land, and a combined 85 GHz scattering and 19/37 GHz emission over ocean, both of which have been calibrated with ground-based radar data. Errors associated with the SSM/I derived monthly rainfall are characterized through comparisons with various gauge-based, climatological, and other satellite-derived rainfall estimates. During the period of June 1990 to December 1991 the 85 GHz channels aboard the SSM/I failed, so no monthly rainfall estimates are available. An alternative algorithm, using a newly developed 37 GHz scattering approach over land, and emission only over ocean, was developed to obtain a continuous record of rainfall estimates for the entire SSM/I time series. Although the 37 GHz scattering algorithm is sensitive to rain rates in excess of 8 mm/h, the correlation between the 37 and 85 GHz monthly estimates over land can be as high as 0.9 (but varies regionally) when comparing both approaches during a period of useable 85 GHz measurements. The error in the monthly rainfall using this algorithm is typically larger in comparison with measurements from rain gauges. Over ocean the emission only algorithm produces a lesser amount of rain than the scattering-based algorithm, most likely attributed to the lack of a proper beam-filling correction. During the period of January 1992 to the present there were two SSM/I satellites in full operation, with sampling times of approximately 0600/1800 and 1000/2200 LT. Comparisons between the single and dual satellites are made and are compared with gauge data sets. In general, it is found that the dual-satellite estimates reduce the RMS errors, although the improvements are both regionally and seasonally dependent.",,"atmospheric instrument; rainfall; SSM/I",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031399677

The EPA is also scheduled to promulgate air toxic regulations for industrial combustion sources by the year 2000. In addition, several states have air toxic regulatory initiatives that affect the gas industry. Because these regulations could have large economic and operational impacts on the gas industry, the Gas Research Institute (GRI) has initiated a multiphase research program. One of the objectives of this program is to determine potential sources of air toxic emissions in the natural gas industry, the quantities of air toxics emitted, and individual species emitted from typical equipment. The primary objective of the testing conducted in this program at gas processing plants was to assess potential air toxic and criteria pollutant emissions associated with combustion equipment, including characterizing the following emission sources: internal combustion (IC) engines, gas turbines, incinerators, heaters, and boilers. The pollutant classes evaluated include aldehydes, criteria pollutants, volatile organic compounds, semi-volatile organic compounds, metals, and reduced sulfur compounds. In addition, unit operational data were obtained during testing. To date, eight field measurement campaigns have been conducted at natural gas pipeline and gas processing facilities. Three (3) of these campaigns involved testing at sour gas processing plants, while two (2) other campaigns focused on emission sources at sweet gas plants. The emission test results for these programs are summarized in this paper. In addition to emissions characterization, the effects of maintenance and performance tuning on emission levels was investigated during one campaign.

For example, EPA now plans to decide by July 1997 whether to make major changes to the current ozone and particulate matter ambient standards - changes which could force utilities to reduce significantly both their nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions. Even if EPA does not adopt new ambient standards, though, many electric utilities still face the prospect of making additional NOx reductions if they are found to be contributing to ozone levels in areas that are not meeting the current ozone ambient standards. Several multi-state groups - notably the Ozone Transport Assessment Group (OTAG) and the Northeast Ozone Transport Commission (OTC) - are evaluating programs that could lead to calls for additional NOx reductions from power plants in ozone nonattainment areas and from plants located outside the nonattainment areas but found to be contributing to ozone levels in those areas. And these multi-state groups are motivated not only by pollution levels they see now, but also by what they fear will be increased pollution levels as a result of deregulation.

Regulation is designed to overcome the deficiencies of market discipline. The decisions of a regulatory agency have impacts for all parties concerned, namely, consumers, management, investors, and community. The economic impact of a regulatory agency has been deeply analyzed. Many researchers have studied the stock-price reaction to announcements of new issues of industrial and utility companies. We examine the stock-price reaction to the announcements of new equity of utilities attempting to operationalize several theoretic models explaining this reaction. Using an event-study method, this examination is conducted while explicitly controlling for the regulatory climate under which these utilities operate. The main findings are: (1) the reaffirmation that the price reaction of stocks of utilities is negative; and (2) no significant influence of regulatory regimes on the price reaction was detected. The second finding is quite unanticipated Some speculative explanations are offered for the absence of impact of regulatory climate. It appears that stock market participants are sophisticated enough to do their own ‘due diligence’ and do not consider the overseeing by state public service commissions as relevant for stock valuation. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6044248398

Hanging gardens are unusual, mesic cliff communities occurring where water seeps from the sandstone bedrock in an otherwise extremely arid region; there is very limited overlap in species distributions inside and outside these gardens. Solar exposure in hanging gardens varied with orientation and one of the gardens (Ribbon Garden) was shaded throughout the day. The leaf δ13C values of plants in hanging gardens were significantly more negative than for plants from either nearby ephemeral wash or riparian communities. In Ribbon Garden, the observed δ13C values were as low as -34.8‰, placing them among the most negative values reported for any terrestrial plant species growing in a natural environment. Hanging garden plants were exposed to normal atmospheric CO2 with an average δ13C value of -7.9‰ and so the low leaf δ13C values could not be attributed to exposure to a CO2 source with low 13C content. There was a seasonal change toward more negative leaf δ13C values at the end of the growing season. The observed leaf δ13C values were consistent with photosynthetic gas exchange measurements that indicated unusually high leaf intercellular CO2 concentrations associated with the relatively low light levels in hanging gardens. Thus, extremely negative leaf δ13C values would be expected if significant amounts of the seasonal carbon gain occur at light levels low enough to be near the light compensation point. Maximum observed photosynthetic rates varied with light levels at each of the gardens, with maximum rates averaging 20.3, 14.6, and 3.1 μmol m-2 s-1 at Double Garden, Lost Garden, and Ribbon Garden, respectively. Leaf nitrogen contents averaged 18.5 mg g-1 in species from the more shaded hanging gardens (Lost and Ribbon). When expressed on a leaf area basis, nitrogen contents averaged 117 mmol N m-2 at Lost Garden and 65 mmol N m-2 at Ribbon Garden (shadiest of the two gardens). Leaf nitrogen isotope ratios averaged -2.3‰ (range of -0.7 to -6.1‰), suggesting that most of the nitrogen was derived from a biological fixation source which is most likely the Nostoc growing on the sandstone walls at the seep. These values contrast with leaf nitrogen isotope ratios of 5-9‰ which have been previously reported for arid zone plants in nearby ecosystems.","13C/12C; Desert ecology; Photosynthesis; Stable isotopes; Water use",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030769014

This increased investment may put an undue financial burden on a cotton gin depending upon the air pollution abatement strategy selected. An airflow model was developed that lists the approximate volume rates of flow from each of ten process system exhausts of a 'standard' gin. The 1996 AP-42 emission factors were modified to correspond to the 'standard' gin with ten exhausts. The airflow model was used in conjunction with the modified 1996 AP-42 emission factors to approximate emission concentrations from each of the exhausts. It was a premise of this research that a cotton ginner could utilize abatement systems selectively to reduce their AER by identifying the exhausts with the highest emission concentrations. After the identification of problematic exhausts, gins can approach the task of reducing their emissions with a minimum cost of compliance. In addition, states utilizing Process Weight Tables (PWT) can also utilize the airflow model to determine AERs and permitted emission factors. Source sampling data obtained from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) were used to demonstrate the utility of the procedures and to compare emission factors calculated using the air model.

The global source of NOx production by lightning is not well known and estimates vary from 3 to 650 Mt NO2/yr. In this paper the role of regional and episodic emissions of NOx from lightning is examined with a three-dimensional chemistry transport model, and a parameterization of the emissions is proposed, linking it to the intensity of latent heat generation in convection calculated in a numerical weather prediction model. The parameterization is scaled to give an annual global emission of 16 MtNO2/yr. The resulting distribution of the concentration of NOx, ozone, OH and nonmethane hydrocarbons is compared for the free troposphere over the northern hemisphere with the results of a calculation where the total NOx emissions from lightning were about the same but were fixed in time and space over the 18 days' calculation (June 18 to July 5, 1995). The maximum differences in the free tropospheric concentrations are significant: for NOx, OH and nonmethane hydrocarbon of the same order of magnitude as the concentrations themselves, for ozone 1 order of magnitude less than the ozone concentration. This means that NOx emissions from lightning may cause a variability in free tropospheric composition which makes it quite difficult to distinguish the importance of other sources of free tropospheric NOx from that of lightning in periods when lightning occurs.",,"chemical composition; lightning; nitrogen oxides; troposphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031425354

The target area is required to meet a challenging set of engineering system design requirements and user needs. The target area must provide the appropriate conditions before, during, and after each shot. The repeated introduction of large amounts of laser energy into the chamber and subsequent target emissions represent new design challenges for ICF facility design. Prior to each shot, the target area must provide the required target illumination, target chamber vacuum, diagnostics, and optically stable structures. During the shot, the impact of the target emissions on the target chamber, diagnostics, and optical elements is minimized and the workers and public are protected from excessive prompt radiation doses. After the shot, residual radioactivation is managed to allow the required accessibility. Diagnostic data is retrieved, operations and maintenance activities are conducted, and the facility is ready for the next shot. The target area subsystems include the target chamber, target positioner, structural systems, target diagnostics, environmental systems, and the final optics assembly. The engineering design of the major elements of the target area requires a unique combination of precision engineering, structural analysis, opto-mechanical design, random vibration suppression, thermal stability, materials engineering, robotics, and optical cleanliness. The facility has been designed to conduct both x-ray driven targets and to be converted at a later date for direct drive experiments. The NIF has been configured to provide a wide range of experimental environments for the anticipated user groups of the facility. The design status of the major elements of the target area is described. © 1997 SPIE.

Fourteen Sprague-Dawley rats divided into TBI (CCI; 4.02 ± 0.14 m/s velocity; 2.5 mm deformation), sham, and control groups were studied 24 hours after TBI or surgery. Perfusion maps were generated during normocarbia (PaCO2 30 to 40 mm Hg) and hypocarbia (PaCO2 15 to 25 mm Hg). During normocarbia, CBF was reduced within a cortical region of interest (ROI, injured versus contralateral) after TBI (200 ± 82 versus 296 ± 65 mL · 100 g-1 · min-1, P &lt; 0.05). Within a contusion-enriched ROI, CBF was reduced after TBI (142 ± 73 versus 280 ± 64 mL · 100 g-1 min-1, P &lt; 0.05). Cerebral blood flow in the sham group was modestly reduced (212 ± 112 versus 262 ± 118 mL · 100 g-1 · min-1, P &lt; 0.05). Also, TBI widened the distribution of CBF in injured and contralateral cortex. Hypocarbia reduced cortical CBF in control (48%), sham (45%), and TBI rats (48%) versus normocarbia, P &lt; 0.05. In the contusion-enriched ROI, only controls showed a significant reduction in CBF, suggesting blunted CO2 reactivity in the sham and TBI group. CO2 reactivity was reduced in the sham (13%) and TBI (30%) groups within the cortical ROI (versus contralateral cortex). These values were increased twofold within the contusion-enriched ROI but were not statistically significant. After TBI, hypocarbia narrowed the CBF distribution in the injured cortex. We conclude that perfusion MRI using arterial spin-labeling is feasible for the serial, noninvasive measurement of CBF and CO2 reactivity in rats.","Controlled cortical impact; Magnetic resonance imaging Perfusion; Rat; Traumatic brain injury","animal experiment; article; blood flow velocity; brain blood flow; brain injury; brain perfusion; brain scintiscanning; isotope labeling; male; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; rat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030797924

The emphasis was on the assessment of long-term effects of different impact scenario combinations. The models were calibrated to measured values of soil and streamwater chemistry as well as forest biomass and growth increment. Deposition scenarios were based on atmospheric transport models. The effects of the three main driving forces (climate, deposition and forest harvesting) showed complex interactions, which were not always easy to interpret. Climate change (high change scenario), considerable emission reductions, and the clearcut scenario, were almost equally significant for parameters related to acidification effects. Considerable emission reductions resulted in either a slight improvement (streamwater pH) or steady-state (soil base saturation) compared with the current situation. The most negative response was predicted for the high climate change scenario, where high nitrogen immobilisation dependence on temperature was assumed. With the exception of the clearcut scenario, a clear increase in NO3 leaching in the long run was predicted for the site until the year 2050. Although the scenarios are hypothetical, they demonstrate the combined effects of elevated deposition inputs and climate change for the N leaching and accumulation processes.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031526384

In the first case the number and origin (native or exotic) of species is important, as well as the geographic scale of the study (local or regional). The functional approach considers the ecological groups (epigeic, endogeic, anecic), which have different effects on soil function. Studies in Mexico, Peru and India reveal that agroecosystem earthworm communities (as compared with those in the undisturbed ecosystem) have lower species richness, lower number of native species, lower number of ecological groups and a predominance of endogeics. Therefore the role of endogeic species in intensifying agroecosystems is likely to be more important for soil function, especially because they act as ecosystem engineers and through their mutualistic interactions with microflora, selective ingestion of soil particles, high rates of ingestion and production of casts, galleries, burrows and chambers can affect nutrient and organic matter dynamics and other pedological processes. Epigeic and anecic species do not appear to be as widespread in agricultural systems and their dependence on a litter layer for survival implies that litter management practices must be implemented for their role in soil function to be of importance. The role of earthworms in enhancing primary production depends on the synlocalization (in the same place) and the synchronization (at the same time) of their activities with the period and the sphere of active root growth and nutrient demands. Several field studies have found significant yield increases with earthworm inoculation, though more research is needed. Incorporation of information on earthworm life histories, field population variations, ecological strategies and short and long term effects on soil properties, in addition to plant and environmental factors (climate, soil, cropping period and management of the agroecosystem), are essential to properly assess the potential role of a particular earthworm species on plant production. Future research must focus on describing the role of native species and their interaction with or replacement by exotic species (belonging to the same or to a different ecological group) in soil function and agroecosystem productivity. ©1997 Elsevier Science B.V.","Agroecosystems; Biodiversity; Earthworms; Soil function","Pheretima sieboldi; agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031402953

Remote optical devices offer the most promise to satisfy these objectives while the operator remains safely under permanently supported roof. A second generation remote optical methanometer (ROM) has been designed and is undergoing laboratory evaluation at the Pittsburgh Research Center. It operates on the principle of differential absorption of the 'u3' fundamental absorption band of methane centered at 3.31 μm in the infrared region of the spectrum. The new instrument improves upon the previous prototypes via the use of a gas correlation technique and a refinement of the amplifier and gating circuitry. A specially designed 0.4-m-diameter variable length gas mixing tunnel was constructed and instrumented with CH4 sampling capability to calibrate the ROM. Experiments have demonstrated the ability of the detector to respond to various conditions of CH4 (pct.m) at distances as great as 12 m.

Nitrogen may be emitted by ammonia volatilization, and as nitrous oxide, nitric oxide and dinitrogen during nitrification, biological denitrification and chemodenitrification. Nitrogen emitted to the atmosphere as ammonia may be returned to the biosphere and recycled thus adding to the nitrous oxide and nitric oxide burden in the atmosphere. Thus ammonia volatilization needs to be controlled as well as nitrification-denitrification to limit emission of nitrogen oxides. Many approaches have been suggested for controlling losses of fertilizer N including optimal use of fertilizer form, rate and method of application, matching N supply with demand, supplying fertilizer in the irrigation water, applying fertilizer to the plant rather than the soil, and use of slow-release fertilizers. While these techniques have the potential to increase the effectiveness of the applied N none of them have a large impact on gaseous loss of N. However, the results of recent experiments in tropical and temperate regions with flooded rice, and irrigated cotton, wheat and maize show that use of newly developed urease and nitrification inhibitors has the capacity to prevent loss of N and increase the yield of crops.","Fertigation; Fertilizer; Foliar application; Nitrification inhibitors; Slow release; Supply and demand; Urease inhibitors","Gossypium hirsutum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; agricultural soil; fertilizer; irrigation; nitrogen emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031406729

The treatment objectives were 1) to improve volumetric conformance in this CO2 flood by reducing excessive CO2 breakthrough through fractures and 2) to increase oil recovery from the associated producers. Local reservoir characteristics indicate the need for a large-volume treatment to achieve these goals. The required treatment volume is beyond the economic limits of standard gel systems. Foam-gel technology is one way to economically achieve in-depth conformance improvement at Rangely by replacing 60% to 80% of the liquid phase by the less expensive CO2 phase. A new gelled foam system was specifically designed for application to Rangely conformance problems. The field-tested surfactant/gel system was designed according to the following criteria: (1) to produce strong and robust gelled foams under the harsh pH conditions of a CO2 flood, (2) to provide enough gelation delay to achieve the injection of a large foam volume with manageable injectivity reduction and (3) to considerably reduce the unit cost of the treatment fluid relative to standard non-foamed gel systems. This paper describes the methodology used to design and test the optimum gelled foam system for Rangely. Laboratory results are presented to support the chemicals system selection, including gelation kinetics experiments, surfactant selection and core floods with supercritical CO2 at field conditions. The candidate well selection process is described, including injection profile surveys, offset well response and bypassed reserves calculation. Data taken during the injection phase of the program, including injectivity history and on-site quality control monitoring of the chemical system behavior are given.

Artificial neural networks based on three different learning paradigms were studied as a means of predicting acute toxicity to trout (5 days exposure to wastewaters) using input data from two simple microbiotests requiring only 5 or 15 min of incubation. These microbiotests were 1) the chemoluminescent peroxidase (Cl-Per) assay, which can detect radical scavengers and enzyme-inhibiting substances, and 2) the luminescent bacteria toxicity test (Microtox®), in which reduction of light emission by bacteria during exposure is taken as a measure of toxicity. The responses obtained with the trout bioassay, the Cl-Per and the Microtox® test were analyzed through statistical correlation (Pearson product-moment correlation), unsupervised learning by a self-organizing network, and assisted learning by the backpropagation and the Boltzmann machine (probabilistic) paradigms. No significant correlation (p < 0.05) was found between the responses obtained with either the Cl-Per assay (p = 0.121) or the Microtox® (p = 0.061) microbiotest and those resulting from the trout bioassay. The self-organizing network was able to identify by itself a maximum of five classes that were more or less relevant for predicting toxicity to fish: class 1 contained 2 samples that were toxic to fish, class 2 contained 2/3 samples that were toxic, class 3 showed 6/8 samples that were non toxic, class 4 contained 5/6 samples that were non-toxic and class 5 comprised one sample that was toxic. Supervised learning with backpropagation analysis yielded two kinds of networks that hold potential. The first one was able to predict the actual toxic wastewater concentration with an overall performance of 65% when fed fresh data, while the second one, which was designed to differentiate between toxic and non-toxic effluents, exhibited a much better performance (90%). However, the probabilistic network also proved to be a very good predictive model for toxicity to fish, with an overall performance of 90%. Although more data are needed, the network based on the backpropagation paradigm seems to be a better predictor or classifier of trout toxicity when used with the Cl-Per and the Microtox® microbiotests.","Artificial neural networks; Microbiotests; Prediction; Wastewater toxicity to fish","peroxidase; chemoluminescent peroxidase assay; microbiotest; Microtox; neural network; toxicity; wastewater; article; artificial neural network; bioassay; chemoluminescence; ecotoxicology; nonhuman; prediction; toxicity testing; trout; waste water; water pollution; Algorithms; Animals; Artificial Intelligence; Chemiluminescent Measurements; Computer Simulation; Industrial Waste; Neural Networks (Computer); Predictive Value of Tests; Sewage; Trout; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Lethrinidae; Salmonidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030882389

It discusses the different categories of hydropower plants in view of the two main sources of GHG emissions: first, direct and indirect emissions associated with the construction of the plants; second, emissions from decaying biomass from land flooded by hydro reservoirs. In terms of GHG emissions, this paper shows that, in most cases, hydropower is a good alternative to fossil fuelled power generation. For hydropower plants in cold climate, a typical GHG emission factor is 15 g CO2 equivalent/kWh, which is 30-60 times less than the factors of usual fossil fuel generation. For some hydropower plants in tropical climates, theoretical calculations have shown that reservoir emissions could be very high. However, no measurements of emissions were taken from tropical reservoirs and the current level of research does not allow for a reliable evaluation. Research is urgently needed in humid tropical climates.

We discuss here the necessity and the practical application of fitting some of the potential parameters in order to reproduce the N2O experimental dipole moment value as well as the experimentally observed N2O⋯N2O and N2O⋯Ar equilibrium geometries. We first show that, as in the case of atomic projectiles, a very efficient capture by collision of the N2O molecules by the argon clusters is observed, independently of the initial molecular orientation. Studying trajectories over tens of nanoseconds then gives evidence that the N2O molecules move independently on the surface of the argon clusters, and that the molecules migrate randomly through jump displacements on the surface of the clusters. We observe a very high N2O mobility and we explain the influence of the argon cluster outer-layer structure on mobility. Collisions of the N2O molecules on the surface of the argon clusters result in a sequential and fast clustering. The geometries of the energetically stable (N2O)m microclusters have been characterized. Using the formula of Perrin, we calculate and interpret single N2O diffusion coefficients and (N2O)m microcluster diffusion coefficients, whose values are 1 to 100 times lower than in the liquid state. Finally, we extend our results to larger argon clusters, such as Ar1000, through a random walk model taking place on the surface of a sphere, which enables us to calculate mean encounter times between particles. We thus interpret the fluorescence quenching that occurs in chemical reactions taking place on finite-size argon clusters. © 1997 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001122462

In contrast to earlier findings, we detected several protonation states of oxygen-carrying complexes in the pH range 7-11.2. The active species in oxygen uptake is the CoL2 complex already suggested in the Co(II)-histamine-O2 system; however, in the case of pseudopeptides, both CoLH-1 and CoL2H-1 complexes can take up oxygen.

In the case of the Co2(Hist)4(OH)(O2) complex, among the 20 possible geometrical isomers, at least six can be distinguished by their imidazole proton signals. The most abundant isomers have axial-equatorial imidazole coordination, presumably on steric grounds.

Correos 419, E-18008 Granada, Spain","The ArC/XylS family of prokaryotic positive transcriptional regulators includes more than 100 proteins and polypeptides derived from open reading frames translated from DNA sequences. Members of this family are widely distributed and have been found in the gamma subgroup of the proteobacteria, low- and high-G+C-content gram-positive bacteria, and cyanobacteria. These proteins are defined by a profile that can be accessed from PROSITE PS01124. Members of the family are about 300 amino acids long and have three main regulatory functions in common: carbon metabolism, stress response, and pathogenesis. Multiple alignments of the proteins of the family define a conserved stretch of 99 amino acids usually located at the C-terminal region of the regulator and connected to a nonconserved region via a linker. The conserved stretch contains all the elements required to bind DNA target sequences and to activate transcription from cognate promoters. Secondary analysis of the conserved region suggests that it contains two potential α- helix-turn-α-helix DNA binding motifs. The first, and better-fitting motif is supported by biochemical data, whereas existing biochemical data neither support nor refute the proposal that the second region possesses this structure. The phylogenetic relationship suggests that members of the family have recruited the nonconserved domain(s) into a series of existing domains involved in DNA recognition and transcription stimulation and that this recruited domain governs the role that the regulator carries out. For some regulators, it has been demonstrated that the nonconserved region contains the dimerization domain. For the regulators involved in carbon metabolism, the effector binding determinants are also in this region. Most regulators belonging to the AraC/XylS family recognize multiple binding sites in the regulated promoters. One of the motifs usually overlaps or is adjacent to the -35 region of the cognate promoters. Footprinting assays have suggested that these regulators protect a stretch of up to 20 bp in the target promoters, and multiple alignments of binding sites for a number of regulators have shown that the proteins recognize short motifs within the protected region.",,"arabinose; transcription factor; amino acid sequence; binding site; consensus sequence; dimerization; DNA protein complex; evolution; gene expression; gene expression regulation; nonhuman; promoter region; protein localization; review; sequence homology; transcription initiation; transcription regulation; Cyanobacteria; Gammaproteobacteria; Negibacteria; Posibacteria; Prokaryota; Proteobacteria",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031452318

Across species, top-canopy leaves in full sun at midday exhibited a strong correlation between PRI and ΔF/Fm', a fluorescence-based index of photosystem II (PSII) photochemical efficiency. PRI was also significantly correlated with both net CO2 uptake and radiation use efficiency measured by gas exchange. When species were examined by functional type, evergreens exhibited significantly reduced midday photosynthetic rates relative to annual and deciduous species. This midday reduction was associated with reduced radiation use efficiency, detectable as reduced net CO2 uptake, PRI, and ΔF/Fm' values, and increased levels of the photoprotective xanthophyll cycle pigment zeaxanthin. For each functional type, nutrient deficiency led to reductions in both PRI and ΔF/Fm' relative to fertilized controls. Laboratory experiments exposing leaves to diurnal courses of radiation and simulated midday stomatal closure demonstrated that PRI changed rapidly with both irradiance and leaf physiological state. In these studies, PRI was closely correlated with both ΔF/ Fm' and radiation use efficiency determined from gas exchange at all but the lowest light levels. Examination of the difference spectra upon exposure to increasing light levels revealed that the 531 nm Δ reflectance signal was composed of two spectral components. At low irradiance, this signal was dominated by a 545-nm component, which was not closely related to radiation use efficiency. At progressively higher light levels above 100 mmol m-2 s-1, the 531-nm signal was increasingly dominated by a 526-nm component, which was correlated with light use efficiency and with the conversion of the xanthophyll pigment violaxanthin to antheraxanthin and zeaxanthin. Further consideration of the two components composing the 531-nm signal could lead to an index of photosynthetic function applicable over a wide range of illumination. The results of this study support the use of PRI as an interspecific index of photosynthetic radiation use efficiency for leaves and canopies in full sun, but not across wide ranges in illumination from deep shade to full sun. The discovery of a consistent relationship between PRI and photosynthetic radiation use efficiency for top-canopy leaves across species, functional types, and nutrient treatments suggests that relative photosynthetic rates could be derived with the 'view from above' provided by remote reflectance measurements if issues of canopy and stand structure can be resolved.","Functional type; Photochemical reflectance index; Photosynthetic down-regulation; Radiation use efficiency; Xanthophyll cycle","light-use efficiency; photochemical reflectance index; photosynthesis; pigment; solar radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031451402

Green Street, Urbana, IL 61801, United States","A 9 M⊙ stellar model of Population I composition is evolved from the hydrogen-burning main sequence to the thermally pulsing ""super"" asymptotic giant branch stage, where it has an electrondegenerate core composed of an inner oxygen-neon (ONe) part of mass ∼ 1.066 M⊙ and an outer carbon-oxygen (CO) layer of mass ∼0.05 M⊙ and is experiencing thermal pulses driven by helium-burning thermonuclear flashes. The carbon-burning phase of the 9 M⊙ model is in many respects similar to, but differs importantly from that of a 10 M⊙ model studied earlier. In both cases, carbon is ignited off center, and a series of carbon flashes accompanied by a convective shell occur. In contrast to the 10 M⊙ model, the 9 M⊙ model experiences the second dredge-up phenomenon (the penetration of the base of the hydrogen-rich convective envelope inward into helium- and carbon-rich material) near the beginning rather than near the end of the carbon-burning phase. The first carbon-burning flash causes helium burning to shut down and the release of gravothermal energy (compressional and thermal energy) between the helium-carbon discontinuity and the base of the convective envelope plays a dominant role in the dredge-up event. Beginning with the third carbon-burning shell flash, the ""flame front, "" defined as being coincident with the base of the convective shell, propagates inward with a speed close to theoretical predictions that relate flame speed to local thermodynamic, opacity, and energy-generation rate characteristics. Ahead of the inward moving front, most of the nuclear energy released in a ""precursor flame"" goes into heating and expanding matter. As the precursor flame moves toward the center, its radial thickness decreases and, to follow the progress of the front with standard techniques, both the spatial grid size and the time step must be continually decreased. Following the front gives one the opportunity to ponder Zeno's paradox, which is averted because the thickness of the precursor flame remains finite. On reaching the center, the carbon-burning flame reverses direction and continues moving outward until it is within ∼0.03 M⊙ of the helium-burning shell. After carbon burning is completed, 12C remains at a finite abundance throughout the electron-degenerate core of mass ∼ 1.116 M⊙ and is more abundant than 20Ne in the outer ∼0.05 M⊙ of this core. Over most of the ONe interior of both the 9 and 10 M⊙ models, 23Na is more abundant than 24Mg, but the maximum 12C abundance in the 9 M⊙ model ONe interior (X[12C] ∼ 0.048) is significantly larger than in the 10 M⊙ model (X[12C] ∼ 0.012). For an ONe white dwarf that accretes enough matter to reach the Chandrasekhar limiting mass, this may make the difference between total explosive disruption (large 12C abundance) and collapse to neutron-star dimensions (small 12C abundance). The abundances in the CO part of the core have relevance for understanding the abundances in the ejecta of classical novae produced by massive ONe white dwarfs in close binaries. In the outer ∼ 0.014 M⊙ of the CO part of the core, the abundances of all neon isotopes are much less than solar, and 25Mg and the neutron-rich isotopes made during the formation of 25Mg are at a total abundance equal to the initial abundance of CNO elements in the model. As in the 10 M⊙ case, thermal pulses occasioned by helium shell flashes begin after hydrogen is reignited and the carbon-burning luminosity drops below ∼100 L⊙. The time between pulses is ∼400 yr, roughly twice as large as in the 10 M⊙ model. After the ejection of the hydrogen-rich envelope as a planetary nebula, the remnant of the 9 M⊙ model is expected to evolve into a white dwarf of mass ∼1.15 M⊙, the outer ∼0.08 M⊙ of which is composed of carbon and oxygen. © 1997.

The objective of the research reported here is to obtain more information about the role this amino acid plays in allosteric regulation of this enzyme. To do this, sitedirected mutagenesis has been done resulting in the following substitutions: Tl 881, T188W, T188C, T188K and T188S. This study focuses on the serine mutant. Isoelectric focusing showed that the Tl 88S mutant enzyme has the same pi as the wild-type. Similar experiments with the other mutants showed that only the Tl 88K, which is catalytically inactive, has a different pi. Initial kinetic analyses of the Tl 88S mutant shows that it is allosterically activated by both acetyl coenzyme A and FBP, but, unlike the wild-type enzyme, activation by these two regulators is not synergistic. Analyses, of the purified mutant enzyme in sucrose gradients in the presence of no regulators, aspartate, and with a complete reaction mixture minus added bicarbonate was done to determine the aggregation state of the enzyme. Both the mutant enzyme Tl 88S and the wild type enzyme showed the same profile. They exist as dimers in the absence of regulators and tetramers in the presence of the complete reaction mixture. Despite similar physicochemica! properties it appears that the regulation of the Tl 88S mutant on-nrml* tc different frntn thf wiM-tvnp.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750274396

Extending the traditional approach of using domain-wide maximum ozone values as the metric for guiding the development of emission control strategies, the new metrics incorporate attributes of the spatial and temporal pervasiveness and the severity of the ozone episodes considered for strategy development, as well as the impact on potential exposures to ozone. The usefulness of using various alternative criteria to better understand the directionality of the impact of emission controls is demonstrated via a set of 26 simulations of a three-day period of the severe July 1988 episode over the New Jersey-Philadelphia-Delaware Valley area. These simulations model the effect of across-the-board reductions of VOC and NO by 25, 50, 75, and 100% of the base case. The impact of these reductions is found to be dependent on the control objective (e.g., reduction of exposure vs. reduction of the maximum) as well as on the targeted level of the control objective (e.g., reduction of exposures below 120 ppb vs. reduction of exposures below 80 ppb). © 1997 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.",,"Air pollution; Air quality; Computer simulation; Environmental impact; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Volatile organic compounds; Ground level ozone; Photochemical air pollution; Air pollution control; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air pollution; air quality standard; algorithm; article; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; meteorology; pollution control; population exposure; priority journal; simulation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031215113

These results have been shown to be very sensitive to the prescription of the albedo shift associated with conversion from forest to a replacement land cover. Modelers have so far chosen to use an ""impoverished grassland"" scenario to represent the postforest land surface. This choice maximizes the shifts in land surface parameters, especially albedo (fraction of incident shortwave radiation reflected by the surface). Recent surveys show secondary vegetation to be the dominant land cover for some deforested areas of the Amazon. The characteristics of secondary vegetation as well as agricultural land covers other than pasture have received little attention from field scientists in the region. This paper presents the results of field measurements of radiation flux over various deforested surfaces on a small farm in the eastern Amazonian state of Para. The albedo of fields in active use was as high as 0.176, slightly less than the 0.180 recently determined for Amazonian pasture and substantially less than the 0.19 commonly used in GCM simulations of deforestation. For 10-yr-old secondary vegetation, albedo was 0.135, practically indistinguishable from the recently published mean primary forest albedo of 0.134. Measurements of surface temperature and net radiation show that, despite similarity in albedo, secondary vegetation differs from primary forest in energy and mass exchange. The elevation of midday surface temperature above air temperature was found to be greatest for actively and recently farmed land, declining with time since abandonment. Net radiation was correspondingly lower for fields in active or recent use. Using land cover analyses of the region surrounding the study area for 1984, 1988, and 1991, the pace of change in regional-mean albedo is estimated to have declined and appears to be leveling at a value less than 0.03 above that of the original forest cover.",,"afforestation; albedo; land surface; radiation balance; radiation flux; Brazil, Amazon River; Brazil, Para State",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031419623

Various approaches have been followed in order to analyse the adsorption data (Langmuir, t-method, Dubinin-Radushkevich, Horvath-Kawazoe and density functional theory). The combination of these methods has allowed us to perform a full characterization of the samples in the micropore and mesopore ranges. The density functional approach has been especially useful, since it provides information for both the micropore and mesopore ranges simultaneously. Impregnation of the activated-charcoal-support with Ni or Co nitrates produces the expected loss of specific surface area and specific pore volume. Thermal treatment in nitrogen at 573 K gives a relatively surprising high recovery of textural properties, particularly in the micropore range, which has been related to the poor dispersion of the supported NiO and CoO particles. Treatment of the samples at 723 K gives an additional low increase in external surface area and micropore volume with respect to the 573 K treated samples. This behaviour has been discussed in terms of both a volume reduction of the supported particles and the creation of new microporosity, which may be produced during the carbon-promoted reduction of NiO and CoO to the metallic state that takes place under treatment in nitrogen at 723 K. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The effect of the reactant composition on the reaction rate was specifically studied by changing the P0H2/P0CO2 ratio between 9.0 and 0.3. It was found that different reagents become rate limiting depending upon pressure. While in a H2-rich region the rate increases strongly with CO2 partial pressure and is zero order in hydrogen, under low P0H2/PCO2 ratios the reaction is less active and is strongly positive order in hydrogen and low order in carbon dioxide. The experimental data were modeled by considering that the reaction proceeds through a surface redox mechanism, copper being the active metal. A good agreement between experimental and calculated data was obtained by assuming that in the redox mechanism either the dissociative CO2 adsorption (H2-rich region) or both the CO2 dissociation and the water formation (H2-lean region) determine the rate of the overall reaction. Based on previous studies performed on copper crystal surfaces, such a change in kinetics may be explained by assuming that under H2-rich atmosphere a surface structural or phase transition occurs involving a change in reactivity with respect to CO2 dissociation.","CuO/Zno/Al2O3 catalysts; Kinetics and mechanism; Reverse water-gas shift reaction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041104491

The Rhine Ruhr area is the largest and most populated urban agglomeration in Germany with about 10 million inhabitants. As a center of coal mining, metal processing and chemical industry the area was highly polluted and environment protection is still an important task for the region. Development of the air pollution in the area. Air pollution has been effectively reduced during the last decades: For most of the important pollutants a reduction of more than 75% could be reached since 1980. The main reasons for that success are: Reduction of the output of metallurgical industry and power plants, substitution of coal by natural gas and oil for domestic firing, closing of blast furnaces and coking plants. Attempts to reduce the traffic derived immissions were partly superimposed by the growth of its volume so that nitrogen oxides several hydrocarbons and soot could not be reduced as effectively as other pollutants. Sources of contamination and site-specific problems. Comparing the immissions at different sites clearly demonstrates the importance of several industrial sources and road traffic for air pollution. At several sites industrial sources still cause severe pollution as can be shown for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and benzene near a coking plant as well as for heavy metals near zink and lead smelting plants (1). Background pollution. Measurements at stations outside highly populated areas indicate that the background pollution is 30 to 80% lower than the immission in the Rhine Ruhr area. A combination of these data with the composition of organic compounds at the different stations can also indicate the sources of pollution, again showing the relatively growing importance of road traffic for air pollution. Deposition of particulate matter and heavy metals. If total suspended matter (TSP) is sampled particles with an aerodynamic diameter up to about 40 μm are collected. Measuring deposition using the Bergerhoff technique also larger particles are cought in the sampling pot. Because the distribution of larger particles in air is less homogenous than that of TSP deposition sampling is the ideal method to identify local sources of air and soil pollution. The most important sources of dust and heavy metals in Duisburg can be shown using this method (2). Cancer risk caused by air pollution. The German ""Länderausschuß für Immissionsschutz"" (state committee for environment protection) established target values for cancerogenous compounds in air in order to maintain the cancer risk below 1:2500 and 1:1000, respectively after a 70 years exposure (3). Even after the strong reduction of air pollution the 1:2500 target values were exceeded in some cases for cadmium, benzo[a]pyene, benzene and soot. First measurements of PM10 give hints about the concentration of fine paniculate matter in the region.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747475219

The well failed. Poor gas shows were recorded at a depth of 126feet. This gas flowed at a rate of 4000 ft3 day-1.There were also minor indications of brown and green oil but no commercial production.

Used mostly by the oil industry to map promising formations for exploration and production of hydrocarbons, a variety of instruments have been developed that can be lowered down drill holes to extract information about the subsurface geology. In the last decade, advances in computers, software, and data transmission have greatly increased the amount and quality of data that such instruments can provide. Relatively new instruments that image the borehole wall with high resolution can reveal layers and faults that previously could be seen only in core sections. Downhole measurements play a crucial role in linking core data with regional geophysical surveys and in providing data where core sections could not be obtained. Examples of recent scientific applications and approaches are presented that address previous problems with data quality and changes in properties over time after a hole is drilled. The role of downhole measurements is discussed for two broad areas of research: the structure and composition of the Earth's crust, most of which is formed at mid-ocean ridges, and past changes in Earth's environment recorded in the deep-sea sediments overlying the crust. Finally, new emerging technologies and experiments that promise significant advantages over current methods for downhole measurements in marine geology and geophysics are discussed.",,"Boreholes; Geology; Geophysics; Marine applications; Structural geology; Submarine geology; Composition of the Earth; Downhole measurements; Emerging technologies; Exploration and productions; Extract informations; Geophysical surveys; Scientific applications; Subsurface geology; Deepwater drilling; deep sea drilling; downhole measurement; marine geology; marine geophysics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031430620

This survey gathered information on site characteristics, awareness of mandates and incentives for AFV operation, and AFV purchase intentions. The survey also contained stated preference tasks in which fleet decision makers simulated fleet-replacement purchases by indicating how they would allocate their choices across a 'selector list' of hypothetical future vehicles. A discrete choice model was estimated to obtain preference tradeoffs for fuel types and other vehicle attributes. The overall tradeoff between vehicle range and vehicle capital cost in the sample was $80/mile of range, but with some variation by fleet sector. The availability (density) of off-site alternative fuel stations was important to fleet operators, indicating that fleets are willing to trade off more fuel infrastructure for changes in other attributes, e.g. increased capital or operating costs, or more limited vehicle range. Public fleets (local and county government) were the most sensitive to the capital cost of new vehicles. Along with schools, they are the only fleet sector where reduced tailpipe emission levels are a significant predictor of vehicle choice. Fleet operators in the private sector base their vehicle selection less on environmental concerns than on practical operational needs. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

More than 50 ambient hydrocarbon species, including C2-C10 alkanes, C2-C6 alkenes, benzene and a select group of alkylated aromatics, and isoprene were analyzed using these techniques with an estimated accuracy of ±20%. The instrumental limit of detection was ∼20 parts per trillion carbon (pptC). Quality assurance of the analysis was performed, in part, via participation in the Nonmethane Hydrocarbon Intercomparison Experiment (NOMHICE). The NOMHICE results showed that for the majority of the target hydrocarbon species the percent differences between our analyses and those of the referee group were &lt;10% for the standard mixtures and &lt;20% for the whole air sample. Analyses of the hydrocarbon data indicate that WFM is routinely in the path of aged photochemical regional air masses which have been influenced by urban emission upwind of the site. The distribution of hydrocarbon species observed at WFM matches that of mobile sources. The seasonal variation of anthropogenic hydrocarbons at WFM is consistent with the expected seasonal variation in OH. The observed changes in the ratios of toluene/benzene from the summers of 1994-1995 are indicative of a greater reduction in the benzene emissions relative to toluene emissions over this period. One possible explanation for this change is the introduction of reformulated gasoline in many areas in the region starting in 1995. The concentrations of naturally emitted isoprene show a strong seasonal variation and temperature dependence.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001668279

Time-resolved Trp phosphorescence can now be detected following rapid mixing of protein solutions with a time resolution of 10 ms and a sensitivity in terms of chromophore concentration down to 0.1 μM. Calibration tests with mononumeric and multimeric proteins proved that in all cases the delayed emission is not affected by artefacts that could arise from either enrichment of trace impurities along the flow lines or deformation of the macromolecules by the shear stress of laminar flow. To illustrate the potential of Trp phosphorescence in the stopped-flow to detect the time evolution of protein conformation the interaction of urea and guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) with the native structure of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase (LADH) has been re-examined under conditions of rapid denaturation. Remarkable differences in the action of the two denaturing agents has been confirmed by the phosphorescence lifetime (τ(P)) of the internal Trp residue (W314). Whereas in urea, up to 8 M, τ(P), is not minimally perturbed, in GdnHCl it decreases sharply and progressively from 800 ms down to 23 ms in 6 M solutions. Such reduction of τ(P) implies that in the region of W314 the polypeptide structure has become highly loose and flexible prior to the major unfolding transition. Therefore, denaturation of LADH in GdnHCl, as opposed to urea, proceeds from a partly unfolded intermediate conformation of the protein. Other characteristics of this intermediate state are a partial loss of tertiary structure, as revealed by the circular dichroism of the aromatics, and an almost complete inhibition of the catalytic activity. Control experiments with equimolar NaCl demonstrate that τ(P), the tertiary structure and the catalytic activity are affected to a much smaller extent and that, therefore, salt effects do not account for the difference between urea and GdnHCl. Finally, measurements of the unfolding reaction emphasize that the kinetics of LADH denaturation are heterogeneous with both denaturing agents. From the constancy of τ(P) during the course of the reaction it is concluded that the multiphasic behavior is a manifestation of multiple unfolding pathways owing to a plurality of stable LADH conformations.",,"alcohol dehydrogenase; guanidine; urea; article; enzyme conformation; enzyme denaturation; horse; nonhuman; phosphorescence; priority journal; protein folding; protein stability; Alcohol Dehydrogenase; Animals; Circular Dichroism; Guanidine; Horses; Kinetics; Liver; Luminescent Measurements; Protein Conformation; Protein Denaturation; Protein Folding; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Sodium Chloride; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Spectrum Analysis; Tryptophan; Urea; Equus caballus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031415225

The regular character of their dynamics makes it possible to recognize the following phases in the evolution of this group: the phase of extensive divergence (Arenig-Caradoc), the acme phase (Caradoc-Ashgill), the decline phase (Ashgillian-Silurian), and the relic phase (DevonianCarboniferous). The order Cryptostomida is one of the inadaptive groups of Paleozoic bryozoans that shows the acceleration of the rate of extensive divergence in the Arenig-Llandeilo, outbreak of intense divergence in the Caradoc, mass extinction in the Late Ordovician, deep decline in the Silurian, and a relic state in the DevonianCarboniferous. The global change in the dominant bryozoan taxa in the Silurian could be caused by a high degree of ecological specialization of the Ordovician dominants resulting from strong intraspecific competition.

A historical survey of reactivations in colluvial deposits at selected sites in the region suggested that increased activity was taking place in response to extreme rainfall events, possibly related to long-term climatic changes. The importance of natural and anthropogenic processes along critical hydrogeological boundary conditions in relation to this activity is then reviewed and one example of urban landsliding from Grassano in the Basento valley is described. Local structure, such as faulting, was shown to be especially important in the location of both groundwater discharge (springs) and the landsliding. The landslide activity in the town was also shown to be related to a period of population expansion and possible domestic water leakages following the provision of a pumped supply. It is suggested that these anthropogenic processes reduce the usefulness of empirical links between landslide frequency, rainfall extremes or other explanations involving climatic change. Finally, a strategy for landslide management based on the use of hydrogeological conceptual models and GIS technology is proposed.","Aquifers; Geological hazards; Hydrogeological controls; Landslides","anthropogenic effect; GIS; hazard mitigation; hydrogeology; landslide; landslide management; management approach; natural hazard; slope stability; Italy, Basilicata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030762125

The historical climatic and hydrological series provide a perfect tool to depict a variety of environmental situations, liable to correspond to a certain temperature change, i.e. produce synthetic climatic and hydrologie pictures on the realistic data available for the period with such climatic change. An application of this approach in Scandinavia has shown that already a small rise in the mean annual temperature of ≈ 1°C, can cause notable changes in the river flow regime. Application of this approach is, however, often limited by the scarcity of long climatological and hydrological series, representing different environments. Another limitation is a poor knowledge about the influence of low frequency components (trends) of several decades or more, which might have a significant influence on the development of both climatological and hydrological series. The modelling approach can produce series of any desired length. However, the results of model studies heavily depend on the accuracy and relevance of the used model and climate scenarios. The modelling approach in the impact studies of climate change has two types of uncertainties. The first one concerns uncertainty in the climate model simulations, especially on a regional scale. Validation of the results of these models at present faces some serious obstacles, especially what concerns relevant hydrological ""ground truth"". The second type concerns hydrological models used for forecasting of effects of climate change on river runoff. The paper offers a review of some important findings for a regionalized Scandinavian data set and discusses a number of essential problems and challenges connected to the studies of hydrological impacts of a possible climate change.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031510325

A chemical evolution code - including infall of primeval gas, thermal and gravitational energy balance, and a galactic wind - follows the SF rate, the gas fraction and the metallicity, basic ingredients for the stellar population synthesis. The latter is performed with a grid of integrated spectra for single stellar populations (SSP) of different ages and metallicities, in which the effects of dusty envelopes around AGB stellar are included. The residual fraction of gas in the galaxy is divided into two phases: the star forming molecular clouds and the diffuse medium. The relative amount is a model parameter. The molecular gas is sub-divided into clouds of given mass and radius: it is supposed that any SSP is borne within the cloud and progressively escapes it. The emitted spectrum of the star forming molecular clouds is computed with a radiative transfer code. The diffuse dust emission (cirrus) is derived by describing the galaxy as an axially symmetric system, in which the local dust emissivity is consistently calculated as a function of the local field intensity due to the stellar component. Effects of very small grains, subject, to temperature fluctuations, as well as PAH are included. The model is compared and calibrated with available data of starburst galaxies in the local universe, in particular new broad-band and spectroscopic ISO observations. It will be a fundamental tool to extract information on global evolution of the stellar component and of ISM of galaxies from observations covering four decades in A. The combination of observations from HST, Keck. ISO and ground-based optical, IR and sub-mm telescopes already provided several objects at relevant z with spectral information oil this large λ range.

Rhizodeposition, including root exudation can influence plant growth directly by making cations available for uptake through processes such as chelation or indirectly by influencing soil microbial activity. It is important to gain knowledge about the range of compounds released and the factors influencing their release, to understand their effects on the microbial community and enable development of techniques to enhance microbial activity. The increasing growth of trees in various land use systems is coupled with a limited knowledge of the interactions between nutrient availability and tree growth. This highlights the need for a greater understanding of factors affecting nutrient availability in these systems. The purpose of this paper is to review the various strategies which are used to measure rhizodeposition by plants and demonstrate that root exudates are an important component of carbon loss from plants and that they may have a more important role in nutrient acquisition and plant growth than previously thought. The paper will discuss the character of carbon loss from trees in comparison to annual plants and discuss the increasing evidence of the importance of non-nutrient components of root exudates as host specific recognition signals. The factors affecting exudate release and the impact of these compounds on nutrient availability will be discussed. The limitations of previous studies of rhizodeposition and root exudation through omission of a mycorrhizal component, and the need for further research in this neglected area, will be highlighted. Manipulation of plant-microbial interactions is discussed in relation to improving or maintaining plant growth in sustainable systems.","Microorganism; Rhizosphere carbon flow; Root exudates; Tree","carbon flow; microbial activity; nutrient availability; rhizosphere; root exudation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031424371

The project planning phase must be formulated within a strategic framework that envisions the final knowledge base and products to be produced. While the basic framework for basin analysis projects is similar, each plan will be unique for a number of reasons. The project design must consider the geographic size of the area, genetic basin(s) type and age, geologic complexity, data availability and the amount of previous exploration. The project design mimics the geologic events that create a hydrocarbon system-how a basin forms, fills and matures through time. The geologic analysis flows from plate scale to regional to basin to play analysis while integrating across geologic sub-disciplines. The plate scale analysis constrains the genesis of the families of basins and serves as input to more detailed integrated geologic analysis at the regional basin and play scales. When that understanding is achieved, analysis of the elements of the hydrocarbon system-hydrocarbon source and quality, maturation and yield, and migration into viable reservoirs with effective traps and seals can be better understood.

Park, South Street, Crewkerne, Somerset TA18 7HJ, United Kingdom","Thermal history is a major factor in determining hydrocarbon prospectivity in the Irish Sea region. Early application of Apatite Fission Track Analysis (AFTA®) to exploration wells revealed early Tertiary palaeotemperatures around 110°C or more. More recent studies in the Irish Sea and adjacent areas, using a combination of AFTA and vitrinite reflectance (VR), have revealed at least three additional palaeo-thermal episodes: pre-Permian (&gt;290 Ma), late Permian to mid-Triassic (260 to 220 Ma) and Early Cretaceous (140 to 110 Ma). Other evidence of early paleo-thermal effects, for which timing is only constrained to the interval 300 to 150 Ma, may reflect these or additional episodes. In some areas, early effects involved extremely high palaeogeothermal gradients. Early Cretaceous gradients are unconstrained due to a lack of wells in which palaeotemperatures reflect this episode. Early Tertiary palaeotemperatures derived from AFTA and VR in wells from the southern part of the East Irish Sea Basin define a consistent linear depth profile with a gradient of only 10°C km-1. Wells from the north of the region also define a broadly consistent profile but with a much higher gradient. The low gradients are thought to reflect flow of hot fluids while the high gradients to the north may be associated with igneous activity in that region. Our preferred interpretation of the early Tertiary palaeo-thermal effects involves a combination of burial by around 1.5 to 2 km of post-Triassic sediment and the thermal effects of hot fluid flow, probably from north to south and associated with igneous activity. This interpretation is consistent with geological evidence and is supported by structural data, sonic velocity data and geochemical observations. Different combinations of these episodes lead to a wide variety of thermal history styles across the region. The southern part of the East Irish Sea Basin, containing major accumulations of oil and gas, is characterized by the most suitable thermal history conditions for generation and preservation of hydrocarbons to the present day. In adjacent regions, thermal histories are more complex, and those identified to date are generally less suitable particularly for preservation of hydrocarbons to the present day. Future exploration in these areas will require a thorough understanding of the thermal history of Carboniferous source rocks in order to define the most prospective regions.",,"Carboniferous",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346541590

If there is to be a solution, technology must play a central role. This paper presents the results of an assessment of the potential for cost-effective technological changes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the U.S. transportation sector by the year 2010. Other papers in this session address the same topic for buildings and industry. U.S. transportation energy use stood at 24.4 quadrillion Btu (Quads) in 1996, up 2 percent over 1995 (U.S. DOE/EIA, 1997, table 2.5). Transportation sector carbon dioxide emissions amounted to 457.2 million metric tons of carbon (MmtC) in 1995, almost one third of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (U.S. DOE/EIA, 1996a, p. 12). Transport's energy use and CO2 emissions are growing, apparently at accelerating rates as energy efficiency improvements appear to be slowing to a halt. Cost-effective and nearly cost-effective technologies have enormous potential to slow and even reverse the growth of transport's CO2 emissions, but technological changes will take time and are not likely to occur without significant, new public policy initiatives. Absent new initiatives, we project that CO2 emissions from transport are likely to grow to 616 MmtC by 2010, and 646 MmtC by 2015. An aggressive effort to develop and implement cost-effective technologies that are more efficient and fuels that are lower in carbon could reduce emissions by about 12% in 2010 and 18% in 2015, versus the business-as-usual projection. With substantial luck, leading to breakthroughs in key areas, reductions over the BAU case of 17% in 2010 and 25% in 2015, might be possible. In none of these case are CO2 emissions reduced to 1990 levels by 2015.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Technology; Transportation; Carbon dioxide emission; Emission reduction; Greenhouse gas; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031346706

Climate Prediction Res., Meteorological Office, Bracknell, United Kingdom","A time-dependent climate-change experiment with a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model has been used to study changes in the occurrence of drought in summer in southern Europe and central North America. In both regions, precipitation and soil moisture are reduced in a climate of greater atmospheric carbon dioxide. A detailed investigation of the hydrology of the model shows that the drying of the soil comes about through an increase in evaporation in winter and spring, caused by higher temperatures and reduced snow cover, and a decrease in the net input of water in summer. Evaporation is reduced in summer because of the drier soil, but the reduction in precipitation is larger. Three extreme statistics are used to define drought, namely the frequency of low summer precipitation, the occurrence of long dry spells, and the probability of dry soil. The last of these is arguably of the greatest practical importance, but since it is based on soil moisture, of which there are very few observations, the authors' simulation of it has the least confidence. Furthermore, long time series for daily observed precipitation are not readily available from a sufficient number of stations to enable a thorough evaluation of the model simulation, especially for the frequency of long dry spells, and this increases the systematic uncertainty of the model predictions. All three drought statistics show marked increases owing to the sensitivity of extreme statistics to changes in their distributions. However, the greater likelihood of long dry spells is caused by a tendency in the character of daily rainfall toward fewer events, rather than by the reduction in mean precipitation. The results should not be taken as firm predictions because extreme statistics for small regions cannot be calculated reliably from the output of the current generation of GCMs, but they point to the possibility of large increases in the severity of drought conditions as a consequence of climate change caused by increased CO2.",,"atmosphere/ocean coupling; carbon dioxide doubling; climate change; drought; precipitation; soil moisture; Europe, (South); North America, (Central)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031464240

In many places the amount of rainfall during the period of rapid crop growth is less than the potential rate of evaporation, so that depletion of stored soil water is commonplace. The rate of mineralization of nitrogen (N) from organic matter and the processes of nutrient loss are closely related to the availability of soil water. Results from Kenya indicate the rapid changes in nitrate availability following rain. Nutrient supply has a large effect on the quantity of radiation intercepted and hence, biomass production. There is considerable scope for encouraging canopy expansion to conserve water by reducing evaporation from the soil surface in environments where it is frequently rewetted, and where the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil is sufficient to supply water at the energy limited rate (e.g. northern Syria). In regions with high evaporative demand and coarse-textured soils (e.g. Niger), transpiration may be increased by management techniques that reduce drainage. Increases in atmospheric [CO2] are likely to have only a small impact on crop yields when allowance is made for the interacting effects of temperature, and water and nutrient supply.",,"carbon dioxide; crop yield; nutrient supply; rainfall; water supply; Kenya; Niger; Syria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030829454

It assumes a Chapman profile of vertical brightness distribution and various horizontal structures. Simple geometric cases are described to illustrate the dependence on the altitude, atmospheric scale height, and central meridian planetary longitude (CML) of an idealized auroral morphology seen from Earth orbit. The numerical simulation makes it possible to assess the importance of limb brightening and the contribution from high altitude auroral emission located behind the planetary limb. As an application of the simulation model, four images obtained with the Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 (WFPC2) on board the Hubble Space Telescope are used to determine the characteristics of their auroral (discrete and diffuse) structures. The apparent brightness distribution along the arcs can only be reproduced if intrinsic longitudinal (or local time) variations are introduced, in addition to the path length effects of the viewing geometry. A composite average auroral distribution is built by mapping 10 WFPC2 images from the same dataset. It illustrates the dichotomy frequently observed between a narrow single structure arc at System III longitudes larger than 180° (or morning sector) and the multiple arc and broad diffuse emission at longitudes less than 180° (or afternoon sector). It is shown that the equatorial auroral emission boundary is located between the 6RJand the 30RJmagnetic field line footprints of the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) O6model. © 1997 Academic Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031206092

In aqueous solutions, the FeIP state is relatively stable for the tetrakis(N-methyl-2-pyridyl)porphyrin at high pH but is shorter lived in neutral and acidic solutions. The FeIP state of tetrakis(N-methyl-3-pyridyl)porphyrin and tetrakis(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)-porphyrin are short-lived at any pH. Decay of FeIP is accelerated by H+ and by CO2, probably via reaction with the Fe0P state formed upon disproportionation of Fe1P. These reactions may lead to formation of H2 and CO, respectively, and to formation of the chlorin, FeIIPH2, as a side product. The FeIP state is also observed as a stable product in several organic solvents. This is observed by photolysis of iron tetraphenylporphyrin and several of its derivatives (e.g., trimethyl-, dichloro- and pentafluorophenyl), mainly in dimethylformamide and acetonitrile solutions, using triethylamine as a reductive quencher. Further photoreduction in the presence of CO2 results in catalyzed reduction of CO2 to CO and formation of (CO)-FeIIP.

They are the northern part of the European arc of the Carpathian and Sudety Mountains, extending about 700 km along the southern Polish border. They are of medium height (about 1500 m, maximum 2600 m a.s.l.), and have diversified climate, geology, soils, vegetation, and anthropogenic impacts. The forest vegetation of the Sudety and Carpathian Mountains form three elevational zones. Forests occur in the foothills (as high as about 600 m a.s.l.), the lower mountain forest zone (as high as about 1250 m a.s.l.) and the upper montane forest zone (as high as 1500 m a.s.l.). The original lower mountain forests consisted mainly of fir (Abies alba Mill.) and beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), while upper montane forests contained spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.). Centuries of economic activity have changed the species composition of mountain forests. Spruce has increased considerably, and the percentage of fir and beech has decreased significantly. In the Sudety and western part of the Carpathians spruce is the most prevalent (as high as 83%), while in the eastern part of the Carpathians it does not exceed 10%. The percentage of beech in the Sudeten and western Carpathian forests is less than 20%, while it is about 40% in the eastern part of the Carpathians. Severe weather conditions, frequently poor habitats, and improper management and considerable air pollution occurring in the past 50 years, followed by infestations of primary and secondary insects and spread of parasitic fungi, have led to considerable destruction of these mountain forests. According to forecasts the area of totally, destroyed and severely damaged mountain forests will increase considerably through 2010. Deterioration of forest health will proceed from west to east. Protection of forest health against deterioration requires reduction of industrial emissions, changing existing forests into genotypes that are less sensitive to air pollution and more compatible with local habitats, and recultivation of deteriorated forests.","Carpathian mountains; Forest health; Sudety mountains","air pollution; beech; forest health; mountain forest; Norway spruce; silver fir; air pollution; article; climate; environmental monitoring; forest; fungus; geology; insect; plant growth; poland; soil; species; tree; vegetation; Poland, Carpathians; Poland, Sudety Mountains; Abies; Abies alba; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica; Fungi; Hexapoda; Insecta; Picea; Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344589314

It enables emissions reduction measures to be implemented at an organisational level which is commensurate with the differing resource levels of discrete subregions or country groups and with the decision-making powers of the key players. It also encourages a polycentric approach to energy policy which reduces the dependence of the developing 'South' on the industrialised 'North'.

The electronic effects of all main group elements on the stability of these compounds were systematically investigated and the calculated data is compared with experimental data. There are three electronic mechanisms by which a formally electron deficient center can be stabilized: (i) positive σ-induction by an electropositive element, (ii) π-donation from non-bonding electron pairs and (iii) positive hyperconjugation. One criterion for the stability of the cation is the stabilization energy calculated according to the isodesmic reaction: H3-nC(XHm)n⊕ + nCH4→nH3CXHm+CH3 ⊕. Stabilization energies obtained by isodesmic reactions may be problematic because of ground state effects of the species involved in the reactions. Nevertheless it was found that all the α-heteroelements from groups 1, 2, and 13 to 17 stabilize a carbenium ion with respect to the parent methenium ion CH3⊕! For the alkali and alkaline earth metals this stabilization can be explained by positive σ-charge transfer, where the positive charge on the central carbon is reduced. For group 13, the stabilization consists of a mixture between σ-effects and hyperconjugation. It is generally believed that the most efficient stabilizing effect evoked by a heteroatom adjacent to a formally electron deficient carbon center is due to π-charge transfer from a free electron pair on the heteroatom. Remarkably, the CLi3+ ion and the guanidinium ion, C(NR2)3+, are the most stable carbenium ions with respect to CH3+ and they demonstrate that σ-donation can be as efficient as π-donation. The decrease in the calculated stability in the series of mono-substituted carbenium ions (H2X)CH2⊕f where X=N, P, As and Sb, is due to an increase in the energy which is needed for planarization of the H2X group in order to allow effective π-donation. However, when the planarization energies are taken into account, π-donor centers from the higher periods are not worse π-donors than elements from the second period! Generally, the influence of an α-heteroatom on the stability of a carbenium ion changes strongly along a period but hardly changes within a group. Even very electronegative elements can stabilize a carbocation by σ-attraction due to a large contribution of the Coulomb term to the binding energies. Analysis of the Laplacians of the electron density showed, however, that a minimum of charge transfer by π-donation of the electronegative α-heteroatom is necessary in order to concentrate sufficient charge in the C-X binding region and form a highly polar but localized bond. Furthermore, an overview of various experimental methods used to synthesize α-heteroelement substituted carbenium ions is given and some principles of their reactivity are discussed. © 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.","Ab initio calculations; Carbenium ions; Carbocations; Heteroatoms; Isodesmic reactions; Laplacians; Preparations; Stabilization energies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040842118

Photoluminescence (PL) of Er3+ ions and Er-induced defects was studied at liquid helium and higher temperatures. A strong diffusion of erbium and interdiffusion of gallium and aluminum ions are observed [at the boundary of GaAs/ AlGaAs quantum wells (QWs)] which leads at high erbium concentrations to degradation of the QWs and macroscopic (average) leveling of erbium and aluminum concentrations over the whole semiconductor structure. From high-resolution PL spectra the existence of three types of Er centers is deduced, which differ by positions of fine structure lines, PL lifetimes, and temperature dependence. The results indicate that these centers are accompanied by the appearance of three types of carrier traps with binding energies of 20, 50, and about 400 meV, respectively. The experiments show evidence that carriers captured into these traps control the Auger excitation of Er ions assisted by multiphonon emission of local phonons. Temperature quenching of erbium PL is controlled by depopulation of defect states in the case of Auger excitation via the most shallow hole trap (20 meV) and by competition of multiphonon nonradiative capture with the Auger transitions in the case of the deepest defect (400 meV). De-excitation processes of excited f electrons accompanied by generation of electron-hole pairs were also considered. Such processes are especially important in the case of resonance excitation.

Temperature quenching of erbium luminescence is controlled by depopulation of defect states in the case of Auger excitation via the most shallow hole trap (20 meV) and by competition of multiphonon nonradiative capture with the Auger transitions in the case of the deepest defect (400 meV). Besides erbium luminescence at 1.54 μm, we have observed luminescence of erbium ions from upper excited states at 0.82 and 0.98 μm which demonstrates the possibility to realize a three-level scheme of light emission.","AlGaAs; Erbium; Photoluminescence; Temperature quenching","Binding energy; Crystal defects; Erbium; Molecular beam epitaxy; Phonons; Photoluminescence; Semiconducting gallium arsenide; Semiconductor doping; Thermal effects; Aluminum gallium arsenide; Auger excitations; Semiconducting aluminum compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12844283530

A peninsular Florida tornado outbreak was defined as the occurrence of four or more tornadoes in 4 h or less. Thirty-five outbreak cases were identified. After a review of all available synoptic data for each case, they were categorized into three basic types: 1) those associated with extratropical cyclones (27 cases), 2) those associated with tropical cyclones of tropical storm or hurricane strength (5 cases), and 3) those associated with hybrid cyclones having both tropical and extratropical characteristics (3 cases). A detailed climatology covering spatial and temporal aspects of outbreak characteristics was completed. Mean severe weather indices, thermodynamic soundings, and hodographs were produced for each outbreak type. Case studies of each type of outbreak are presented to complement the climatology and mean environment information. It was found that tornado outbreaks account for 3.4% of all tornado days but caused 61% of all tornado deaths and 62% of tornado injuries. Most tornado deaths occurred in trailers or mobile homes. Extratropical outbreak tornadoes were most common from midmorning to early afternoon, while tropical outbreak tornadoes occurred mostly in the afternoon and evening. The outbreaks produced a much greater percentage of strong and violent tornadoes compared to the general tornado population. Hybrid outbreaks were the most consistently dangerous of the three types of outbreaks. Fundamental differences and similarities among the three outbreak environments are presented using mean soundings and case studies. The basic ingredients for tornado development in each type of outbreak were found to be the presence of strong low-level winds and shear, and enough instability to support thunderstorm development.",,"statistical analysis; tornado; United States; Accidents; Climatology; Data reduction; Statistics; Thunderstorms; Wind effects; Hodographs; Mean severe weather indices; Thermodynamic soundings; Tornadoes; cyclone; extratropical cyclone; tornado outbreak; tropical cyclone; USA, Florida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5844222145

The likelihood of tectonic breaching is related to closure style, being highest for structural inversions, and lowest for footwall fault blocks. The magnitude of tectonic breaching depends upon the extent of wrench faulting, youngest age of deformation, and stratigraphic position of reservoir levels with respect to the neutral surface of inversion folds. Variation in aquifer overpressure can also be related to regional pressure dounains and depth of the reservoir, enabling prediction of maximum hydrocarbon columns. In structures where crestal reservoir pressures coincide with leak-off test fracture pressures, it is commonly assumed that the extent of hydrocarbon columns has been regulated by hydraulic breaching. However, within the GEA, there is no evidence that significant volumes of formerly trapped hydrocarbons have been released by this process. An alternative explanation, referred to as pressure-inhibited charge, is that in some cases downward migration from overpressured, organic-rich top seals ceases at the point where pressure equilibrium is reached with the underlying reservoir. As a result, the height of the hydrocarbon column remains constant without inducing hydraulic breaching. Capillary leakage does not appear to be a significant process at pre-Cretaceous levels within the GEA. A possible exception concerns leakage during relatively shallow depths of burial from reservoirs which sub-crop the Chalk Group. Spatial variations in seal effectiveness can be summarised in terms of a top-seal chance domain map. © 1997 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0011781949

Biomass can supply heat and electricity, liquid and gaseous fuels. A number of developed countries derive a significant amount of their primary energy from biomass: USA 4%, Finland 18%, Sweden 16% and Austria 13%. Presently biomass energy supplies at least 2 EJ year-1 in Western Europe which is about 4% of primary energy (54 EJ). Estimates show a likely potential in Europe in 2050 of 9.0-13.5 EJ depending on land areas (10% of useable land, 33 Mha), yields (10-15 oven-dry tonnes (ODt) ha-1), and recoverable residues (25% of harvestable). This biomass contribution represents 17-30% of projected total energy requirements up to 2050. The relative contribution of biofuels in the future will depend on markets and incentives, on continuous research and development progress, and on environmental requirements. Land constraints are not considered significant because of the predicted surpluses in land and food, and the near balance in wood and wood products in Europe. There is considerable potential for the modernisation of biomass fuels to produce convenient energy carriers such as electricity, gases and transportation fuels, whilst continuing to provide for traditional uses of biomass; this modernisation of biomass and the industrial investment is already happening in many countries. When produced in an efficient and sustainable manner, biomass energy has numerous environmental and social benefits compared with fossil fuels. These include improved land management, job creation, use of surplus agricultural land in industrialised countries, provision of modern energy carriers to rural communities of developing countries, a reduction of CO2 levels, waste control, and nutrient recycling. Greater environmental and net energy benefits can be derived from perennial and woody energy cropping than from annual arable crops which are short-term alternative feedstocks for fuels. Agroforestry systems can play an important role in providing multiple benefits to growers and the community, besides energy. In order to ameliorate CO2 emissions, using biomass as a substitute for fossil fuels (complete replacement, co-firing, etc.) is more beneficial from social and economic perspectives than sequestering the carbon in forests. Case studies are presented for several developed countries and the constraints involved in modernising biomass energy along with the potential for turning them into entrepreneurial opportunities are discussed. It is concluded that the long term impacts of biomass programmes and projects depend mainly on ensuring income generation, environmental sustainability, flexibility and replicability, while taking account of local conditions and providing multiple benefits, which is an important attribute of agroforestry-type systems. Biomass for energy must be environmentally acceptable in order to ensure its widespread adoption as a modem energy source. Implementation of biomass projects requires governmental policy initiatives that will internalise the external economic, social and environmental costs of conventional fuel sources so that biomass fuels can become competitive on a 'level playing field'.","Biomass energy; Carbon sequestration; Environment; Fossil fuel substitution; Land use; Rural economy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030999797

The 6k integration produces enhanced continental warmth during summer and cold during winter. Changes in atmospheric temperature gradients brought about by the surface response lead to altered jet stream structures and transient eddy activity, which in turn affect precipitation patterns. Tropical ""monsoon""-type circulation patterns are also affected, also leading to altered precipitation. Many of the changes in hydrology mimic the geological record remarkably well: the Sahel is much wetter, as are the midwestern United States and the Mediterranean regions; California and northern Europe are drier. Processes leading to the model's surface responses in both temperature and hydrology are described in detail.

In Russia timber volume has been estimated regularly and systematically as part of the former Soviet Union's forest inventory system. To determine the accuracy of using a volumetric approach to determining forest carbon pools, we developed allometric equations for the dominant trees (5 taxa) of two regions (Vologda and Volgograd) of Russia. Using these allomctric equations and the phytomass/volume ratios previously developed to exploit the volume inventory data, we compared the forest carbon content of 51 forest stands of varying ages, composition and structure estimated using the two approaches. Carbon estimates for the Vologda region were on average 8% (±4% 95% CI) greater using the volume approach than the allomctric approach, and 4% greater (±4%) in the Volgograd region. The greatest difference was for pine dominated stands (-15%) and the least for birch dominated stands (+1%). We also compared the carbon estimated for the 26 Vologda stands utilizing allomctric equations developed for the same genera growing in similar forest types in North America. The North American allometric equations predicted slightly higher carbon content on average as compared to the Russian derived equations (2% ± 4).

Summer cyclones generate highest waves, but sea breezes are the dominant mode of wave generation. Waves and swell tend to occur episodically and independently in any month, and the peak frequency shifts during the wave generation process, so that a representative spectrum formed by simple averaging of spectra would be grossly oversmoothed. To overcome this, the monthly climatology is presented in terms of reference spectral shapes (the Ochi and Hubble 1976 North Atlantic formulations) that are most likely to occur for particular frequency bands and ranges of significant wave height. Measured spectra may then be selected as representative spectra from groupings associated with the most likely reference shapes, with further criteria such as spectral width being used to define what is typical.

Not until mid-1996 did the European Community propose the EU Stage III emission standards for implementation in 2000. Further reductions were proposed as EU Stage IV for the year 2005. [1] Taxation incentives are currently being discussed for vehicles which will achieve Stage IV standards prior to 2005. In conjunction with a modification of the European emissions test, these new standards represent a closer alignment and coordination with the requirements of legislation in the United States of America and California. Comparable to the American FTP (Federal Test Procedure), the new EU Test Cycle eliminates the 40-second sustained idle phase, with emission testing to begin immediately with engine cranking.

Average diesel particulate exposures in underground coal mines using diesel-powered equipment ranged from 0.1 to 2.1 mg/m3. Average diesel particulate exposures in underground metal and nonmetal mines ranged from 0.3 to 1.6 mg/m3. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview on worker exposure to diesel particulate matter (DPM) and to discuss the effect of control technology on that exposure. Worker exposure has been assessed from in-mine diesel particulate measurements. The effect of control technology has been evaluated by a systems approach, which includes engine emission rate, mine ventilation system, and the effectiveness of engine after treatment devices. Studies conducted by the Mine Safety and Health Administration and the Bureau of Mines show that the primary means currently employed by the mining industry to control worker exposure to DPM include mine design, ventilation, engine maintenance, and the use of low sulfur fuel. Additional reductions in exposure can be obtained through the use of electronic engine technology. Commercially available after treatment devices are capable of reducing DPM by 25 to 95 percent. Reductions in exposure to DPM are dependent on the application of available engine emission control technology and modifications to mine ventilation systems. © 1997, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

However, M. thermoautotrophicum synthesizes carbon monoxide as a by-product during methanogenesis. In this study, sulfate-reducing bacteria utilizing the acetyl-CoA/carbon monoxide-dehydrogenase pathway were able to form 14CO2 from 14CH4 containing 14CO. 14C-labelled carbon monoxide was removed from 14CH4 by oxidation over hopcalite to carbon dioxide and fixation in sodium hydroxide solution. Measurable formation of 14CO2 from purified 14C-labelled methane by sulfate-reducing bacteria was not observed. Therefore, reported anaerobic methane oxidation rates in marine habitats measured with 14CH4 from M. thermoautotrophicum are inclined to include carbon monoxide oxidation rates. Anaerobic oxidation of 14CH4 by sulfate-reducing and acetogenic bacteria and methanogenic archaebacteria was tested. Only methanogenic species produced up to 900 ppm 14CO2 from 14CH4 applied. This observation and the absence of methane oxidation by sulfate-reducing bacteria sustain the hypothesis that methanogenic archaebacteria in a syntrophic community might be responsible for the oxidation of methane in anaerobic habitats.","anoxic environment; early diagenesis; methane oxidation; methane-sulfate transition; methanogenesis","anoxic conditions; anoxic environment; bacteria; carbon monoxide; methane; oxidation; Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030620732

In addition, a comparison of sample mean values between the WIND cases and a climatological sample (CLIM) is made using a standard t test to determine which variables are significantly different between the two samples. This study seeks to determine if the synoptic-scale-derived fields play a significant role in producing severe wind for a region in which subsynoptic effects, attributed to uneven terrain, are important. The WIND sample environment had the following important differences when compared to CLIM: 1) more convergent wind in the lower troposphere (700-mb moisture and wind convergence), 2) greater moisture at 500 mb (dewpoint, mixing ratio), 3) greater positive vorticity advection (500 mb) and differential vorticity advection (700-500 mb), 4) a larger lapse rate based on various stability indices, 5) more southerly component flow at levels from 500 to 200 mb, 6) higher absolute vorticity at levels from 300 to 200 mb, 7) greater 500-mb wind speeds, and 8) larger thermal advection (warm) at 200 mb. Taken together, the statistical results combined with examination of individual cases and composite maps, suggest that severe wind events in Utah are commonly associated with an approaching upper-level trough system that provides enhanced lift, increased thermal instability, and increased midlevel moisture. These changes to the environment, when added to the normally dry, well-mixed, neutrally stratified boundary layer of the afternoon-evening hours, likely promotes high-based convection with severe downbursts at times. Discriminating effects on the subsynoptic scale cannot be determined in this study since only the standard upper-air station network of observations is employed and no surface data is used. Sample mean differences are small and intrasample variability is large, so results must be used with considerable caution in forecasting applications.",,"Atmospheric turbulence; Boundary layers; Climatology; Statistical methods; Wind; Proximity soundings; Subsynoptic effects; Trough system; Upper air fields; Weather forecasting; atmosphere; climate; wind; atmosphere; climate; wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031153889

The measurement method, which simultaneously collects three-dimensional velocity data through a quartz cylinder, allowed a volumetric evaluation of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) inside an automotive engine. The results were animated on a UNIX workstation, using a 3D wireframe model. The data visualization software allowed the computation of TKE isosurfaces, and identified regions of higher turbulence within the cylinder. The mean velocity fields created complex flow patterns with symmetries about the center plane between the two intake valves. High levels of TKE were found in regions of high shear flow, attributed to the collisions of intake flows. During the compression stroke the higher TKE was located around the momentary center of the cylinder volume. The TKE inside the cylinder decayed exponentially with time.

The models, in principle, were run in the mode in which they are normally used, with their own input data and process descriptions. No attempt has been made to harmonize the input data. The study focused on the simulation of a six day episode (31 July-5 August, 1990) with relatively high observed ozone levels over northwest and central Europe (up to 140 ppbv) and which ended by a frontal passage. The study was mainly restricted to an analysis of the behaviour at four receptor sites across the centre of each modelling domain. Differences in yearly averaged anthropogenic emissions are in the order of 10% only. However, episode specific hourly emissions, both anthropogenic and biogenic, show much larger differences. Here up to 40% differences for anthropogenic emissions are found for central Europe while biogenic emissions differ even up to a factor 2-3. The meteorological data base for all models is created from the synoptic measurement network by different techniques. This can result in quite different model inputs as e.g. the value of the mixing height or trajectories. Other model inputs, e.g. dry deposition velocities or photolysis frequencies, show much closer agreements than expected from their derivation through different parameterizations. Model performance for the regional scale could only be observed for ozone. In central Europe, the large-scale ozone patterns are quite similar for all models. Here the temporal evolution at some receptor sites shows also a reasonable agreement with observations. However, in case a multi-component evaluation is possible it can be expected that differences between models can be revealed to a greater detail than was possible here. The model responses to emission reductions show substantial differences although the direction of the responses generally agree. The most complex model (EURAD) has the most pronounced response to anthropogenic emission reductions. The treatment of the biogenic emissions can have a large impact on scenario simulations.","Emission reduction response; Intercomparison; Regional air quality models","Photochemical dispersion model; Regional modeling; Air pollution control; Industrial emissions; Mathematical models; Meteorology; Ozone; Photochemical reactions; Air quality; ozone; air pollution; air quality; anthropogenic emission; human activity; methodological comparison; model comparison; modelling approach; ozone; ozone level; photooxidant dispersion; pollution monitoring; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; atmospheric dispersion; calculation; conference paper; dry deposition; europe; model; photolysis; priority journal; Europe",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031260248

Here we present data for nine model ecosystems of spruce (Picea abies) on natural nutrient-poor montane forest soil (0.7 m2 of ground and 350 kg weight). Each system was composed of six 7-year-old (at harvest) trees each representing a different genotype, and a herbaceous understory layer (three species). The model ecosystems were exposed to three different CO2 concentrations (280, 420, 560 μl l-1) and three different rates of wet N deposition (0, 30, 90 kg ha-1 year-1) in a simulated annual course of Swiss montane climate for 3 years. The total ecosystem biomass was not affected by CO2 concentration, but increased with increasing N deposition. However, biomass allocation to roots increased with increasing CO2 leading to significantly lower leaf mass ratios (LMRs) and leaf area ratios (LARs) in trees grown at elevated CO2. In contrast to CO2 enrichment, N deposition increased biomass allocation to the aboveground plant parts, and thus LMR and LAR were higher with increasing N deposition. We observed no CO2 x N interactions on growth, biomass production, or allocation, and there were also no genotype x treatment interactions. The final leaf area index (LAI) of the spruce canopies was 19% smaller at 420 and 27% smaller at 560 than that measured at 280 μl CO2 l-1, but was not significantly altered by increasing N deposition. Lower LAIs at elevated CO2 largely resulted from shorter branches (less needles per individual tree) and partially from increased needle litterfall. Independently of N deposition, total aboveground N content in the spruce communities declined with increasing CO2 (-18% at 420 and -31% at 560 compared to 280 μl CO2 l-1). N deposition had the opposite effect on total above ground N content (+ 18% at 30 and + 52% at 90 compared to 0 kg N ha-1 year-1). Our results suggest that under competitive conditions on natural forest soil, atmospheric CO2 enrichment may not lead to higher ecosystem biomass production, but N deposition is likely to do so. The reduction in LAI under elevated CO2 suggests allometric down-regulation of photosynthetic carbon uptake at the canopy level.

This was accomplished using laboratory 14C tracer methods and natural plankton assemblages. The annual biomass of picoplankton (&lt;2 μm), nanoplankton (2-20 μm) and microplankton (&gt;20 μm) averaged 60,389 and 100 μg C l-1, respectively, while corresponding rates of C uptake averaged 7,51 and 13 μg C l-1 h-1. The biomass of microzooplankton (40-200 μm) and macrozooplankton (&gt;200 μm) averaged 18 and 60 μg C l-1, respectively, while C uptake rates by these herbivore groups averaged 2 and 3 μg C l-1 h-1. There were no strong seasonal patterns in any of the plankton metrics. The ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton C uptake averaged 7% over the course of the study. This low value is typical of that observed in eutrophic temperate lakes with small zooplankton and large inedible phytoplankton, and indicates ineffective C transfer in the grazing food chain. On a single occasion, there was a high density (&gt;40 l-1) of Daphnia lumholtzii, a large-bodied exotic cladoceran. At that time, zooplankton community C uptake was &gt;20 μg C l-1 h-1, and the ratio of zooplankton to phytoplankton C uptake was near 30%. If D.lumholtzii proliferates in Lake Okeechobee and the other Florida lakes where it has recently been observed, it may substantially alter planktonic C dynamics.",,"carbon dynamics; lake; nutrient cycling; nutrient uptake; Florida; Lake Okeechobee; USA; Daphnia; Daphnia lumholtzii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031471475

The technology associated with particulate traps has been under development for more than twenty years, however past experiences have tended to show that regeneration systems are expensive and often suffer from durability problems. In this paper we report on an alternative approach in which a continuous low-temperature chemical reaction mechanism is employed. The system based on this technology consists of a special oxidation catalyst upstream of a particulate trap. Over the catalyst some of the engine-out NO emission is oxidised to NO2. NO2 is active for the continuous oxidation of soot collected in the trap above about 250 °C. As a result of this regeneration process the trap is always very lightly loaded with soot and the back-pressure level is therefore very low. The oxidation catalyst naturally also leads to very low emissions of CO and hydrocarbons. The overall conversion rates from raw gas to tailpipe for a vehicle fitted with such a system are typically in excess of 90% for CO, HC and particulate matter. There is a small reduction of NOx, typically between 3% and 8%. The successful operation of a system based on this technology requires the use of virtually sulphur free fuel. For this reason the earliest work was done in Sweden where the so-called ""Swedish Environmental Class 1 diesel"" is the principle transport fuel. This fuel has a maximum sulphur content of 10ppm. About 1800 systems are in operation in Europe to date, a wide variety of engine types and applications having been tested. The maximum recorded mileage on a single vehicle is 390,000 km. In addition to the Swedish experience, the cities of Paderborn, Wiesbaden, London and Oxford have small fleets of vehicles with systems in operation. A large European bus manufacturer has commissioned a durability test on the system involving a fleet of fifty vehicles1.

In fact, the USEPA is developing Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for publicly owned facilities that receive and treat sewage and wastewater from residential, commercial, and industrial generators. Once promulgated, this standard will require POTWs to limit and control HAP emissions. One option available for the control of HAP emissions from wastewater facilities is the use of the internal combustion (IC) engine-generator systems to convert wastewater off-gas to energy. Single or multiple IC engines can be arranged to utilize wastewater off-gas in place of natural gas and diesel fuel to produce electricity. The electricity generated can then be used to power the treatment facility or sold to the local utility. These systems utilize an otherwise wasted energy resource while significantly reducing HAP and VOC emissions from the wastewater treatment process.

The venturi/vortex scrubber uses a patented drain assembly to pull plating solution, air with toxic particulates above the solution, and unpopped bubbles of generated gases down with a gravity generated vortex effect. The recirculated plating solution acts as the scrubbing liquid and air agitation is eliminated. Separated gases are passed through a condenser/filter to remove any remaining fumes. The device is almost entirely constructed of CPVC. This device offers several advantages over conventional end-of-pipe systems including significantly lower cost, no wastewater, no extensive ventilation system, and emissions are recycled. The system can be is easily retrofitted to existing tanks, however, a loose fitting tank lid is recommended. A pilot demonstration has been performed at Benet Laboratory, Watervliet, NY (U.S. Army) with a 1500 gallon chromic acid electroplating tank and 1500 Amps of applied current. Overall chromium emissions results were 0.00002 mg/Amp-hr, surpassing the stringent California State requirement of 0.006 mg/Amp-hr. Emission prevention by capturing unpopped bubbles is the method in which this system reduces the most emissions. The system met current ambient worker safety standards.

It is an interglacial, a state typical of only 10% of the past few million years. It is a time of relative sea-level stability after a rapid 130-m rise from the lowstand during the last glacial maximum. Physical geologic processes are operating at unusual rates and much of the geochemical system is not in a steady state. During most of the Phanerozoic there have been no continental ice sheets on the earth, and the planet's meridional temperature gradient has been much less than it is presently. Major factors influencing climate are insolation, greenhouse gases, paleogeography, and vegetation; the first two are discussed in this paper. Changes in the earth's orbital parameters affect the amount of radiation received from the sun at different latitudes over the course of the year. During the last climate cycle, the waxing and waning of the northern hemisphere continental ice sheets closely followed the changes in summer insolation at the latitude of the northern hemisphere polar circle. The overall intensity of insolation in the northern hemisphere is governed by the precession of the earth's axis of rotation, and the precession and ellipticity of the earth's orbit. At the polar circle a meridional minimum of summer insolation becomes alternately more and less pronounced as the obliquity of the earth's axis of rotation changes. Feedback processes amplify the insolation signal. Greenhouse gases (H2O, CO2, CH 4, CFCs) modulate the insolation-driven climate. The atmospheric content of CO2 during the last glacial maximum was approximately 30% less than during the present interglacial. A variety of possible causes for this change have been postulated. The present burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and cement manufacture since the beginning of the industrial revolution have added CO2 to the atmosphere when its content due to glacial-interglacial variation was already at a maximum. Anthropogenic activity has increased the CO2 content of the atmosphere to 130% of its previous Holocene level, probably higher than at any time during the past few million years. During the Late Cretaceous the atmospheric CO2 content was probably about four times that of the present, the level to which it may rise at the end of the next century. The results of a Campanian (80 Ma) climate simulation suggest that the positive feedback between CO2 and another important greenhouse gas, H2O, raised the earth's temperature to a level where latent heat transport became much more significant than it is presently, and operated efficiently at all latitudes. Atmospheric high- and low-pressure systems were as much the result of variations in the vapor content of the air as of temperature differences. In our present state of knowledge, future climate change is unpredictable because by adding CO2 to the atmosphere we are forcing the climate toward a ""greenhouse"" mode when it is accustomed to moving between the glacial-interglacial ""ice- house"" states that reflect the waxing and waning of ice sheets. At the same time we are replacing freely transpiring C3 plants with water-conserving C4 plants, producing a global vegetation complex that has no past analog. The past climates of the earth cannot be used as a direct guide to what may occur in the future. To understand what may happen in the future we must learn about the first principles of physics and chemistry related to the earth's system. The fundamental mechanisms of the climate system are best explored in simulations of the earth's ancient extreme climates. © Springer-Verlag 1997.","Climate change; Cretaceous; Holocene; Paleoclimatology; Quaternary",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-53249144578

To derive more information about the molecular interpretation of the thermodynamic data, we performed additional experiments for a series of detergents, C12EOn with n = 3-8 and dependent on temperature (for C12EO8). The data can be discussed in terms of a three-stage model (bilayers, coexistence, micelles) considering nonideal mixing within the aggregates. The mixing properties are determined by packing effects controlling the hydration of the headgroups, the water exposure of the hydrocarbon core, and the order of the hydrocarbon chains. Additionally, two types of systematic deviations from the simple three-stage behavior are found for low n and low detergent contents in the bilayer.

An experimental reductant delivery system provided supplementary hydrocarbons for the reduction of NOx. Initially, diesel fuel was used as the supplementary reductant. Early experiments resulted in a 10 to 17 percent reduction in NOx emissions when tested using the heavy-duty engine transient Federal Test Procedure (FTP), and a 30 to 40 percent reduction at selected steady-state catalyst inlet temperatures. A fuel economy penalty of five percent was measured for initial FTP experiments. Emissions of total hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter (PM) tended to increase during initial experiments with the addition of the supplemental reductant, but these emissions decreased with the incorporation of improved catalyst formulations and reductant fuel spray calibrations. Additional experiments were performed with ethanol and toluene as supplemental NOx reducing agents. Emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) were measured and found to increase when NOx emissions were reduced. Steady-state emissions tests revealed a very narrow temperature window for NOx reduction.

Their extrapolation to the entire globe often involves large uncertainties. In this paper, we present an inverse modeling approach which can be used to deduce information on methane sources and sinks from the temporal and spatial variations of atmospheric methane mixing ratios. Our approach is based on a three-dimensional atmospheric transport model which, combined with a tropospheric background chemistry module, is also employed to calculate the global distribution of OH radicals which provide the main sink for atmospheric methane. The global mean concentration of OH radicals is validated with methyl chloroform (CH3CCl3) observations. The inverse modeling method optimizes the agreement between model-calculated and observed methane mixing ratios by adjusting the magnitudes of the various methane sources and sinks. The adjustment is constrained by specified a priori estimates and uncertainties of the source and sink magnitudes. We also include data on the 13C/12C isotope ratio of atmospheric methane and its sources in the model. Focusing on the 1980s, two scenarios of global methane sources are constructed which reproduce the main features seen in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (NOAA/CMDL) methane observations. Differences between these two scenarios may probably be attributed to underestimated a priori uncertainties of wetland emissions. Applying the inverse model, the average uncertainty of methane source magnitudes could be reduced by at least one third. We also examined the decrease in the atmospheric methane growth rate during the early 1990s but could not uniquely associate it with changes in particular sources. © Copyright 1997 by the American Geophysical Union.",,"3D model; atmospheric sink; atmospheric transport; CMDL; methane cycle; NOAA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031451340

The model extends our previous work by including scattering in the radiative heat transfer. Our results show that significant thermal gradients will form in the top few hundred microns of particulate materials on the surfaces of the Moon and Mercury. Their presence alters spectral contrast and creates emission maxima in the transparent regions of the spectra. The results also show that thermal gradients cause the wavelength position of the Christiansen emission peak to shift by as much as 0.5 μm with variations in thermal conductivity and grain size, in agreement with previous laboratory investigations. These wavelength shifts are due to increased emission in the transparent regions of the spectrum which are superimposed upon the emissivity signature. The results are applied to telescopic spectra of the surfaces of the Moon and Mercury and can account for certain features seen in these data. Additional calculations show that thermal gradients will be minor on the surface of Mars and negligible for Earth.

In the western part of the study area (Barranca del Tigre section), Cenomanian shallow-marine limestones (mainly subtidal facies) with abundant benthic fauna (mainly foraminifera) pass upwards to a 7-m-interval of Turonian open-marine nodular limestones with few benthic organisms and then to dark-grey and black laminated pelagic limestones and marls. In the west-central part (Axaxacoalco section), Cenomanian restricted shallow-marine limestones (intertidal to subtidal facies) change abruptly upwards to Turonian black and dark-grey laminated pelagic limestones and marls with only pelagic fauna (calcisphaerulids, planktonic foraminifera, and radiolaria). In the eastern part of the study area (Zotoltitlán section), Cenomanian restricted shallow-marine limestones (mainly intertidal facies) are overlain by 45 m of open-marine limestones showing up-section a rapid decrease in benthic diversity until only calcisphaerulids and echinoderm fragments occur. Overlying these rocks, there are 65 m of nodular shaly limestones in thick strata with renewed benthic fauna, 80 m of shaly and silty limestones intercalated with claystones and some siltstones, and finally, dark grey/black laminated pelagic limestones and marls. The facies successions in the stratigraphic sections suggest the progressive drowning of the Guerrero-Morelos Platform around the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary. We attribute the drowning of some parts of the platform to the occurrence of the Cenomanian-Turonian anoxic event. The impingement of anoxic waters over the platform could produce the drastic reduction of the carbonate producing benthos observed in the stratigraphic sections and therefore a reduction in carbonate accumulation rates. Subsidence and the late Cenomanian-earliest Turonian sea-level rise were then able to drown the platform. This occurred first in the western part, where subtidal conditions dominated and an irreversible drowning occurred, allowing the deposition of organic-rich pelagic sediments over pre-existing shallow-marine carbonates. At the same time, the eastern part, where intertidal conditions dominated, changed to open-marine conditions, shallow first and deep later. Here, a temporal restoration of shallow open-marine carbonate sedimentation resulted, but eventually this region was also drowned, probably by the interplay of terrigenous-clastic supply to the platform and a new impingement of anoxic waters. © 1997 Academic Press Limited.","Anoxic event; Cenomanian-Turonian boundary; Guerrero-Morelos Platform; Mexico; Platform drowning","Calcisphaerulidae; Echinodermata; Foraminifera; anoxic event; carbonate platform; Cenomanian/Turonian boundary; Cretaceous; drowning; stratigraphy; Mexico, Guerrero State, Huitziltepec",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031405496

In order to better understand the environmental impacts associated with such a strategy, a methodology has been developed to quantify mortality suffered by marine zooplankton passing through a CO2-enriched sea water plume. Predicted impact depends on the mode of injection, with scenarios which disperse the CO2 showing the least impact. Benthic impacts also depend on the injection mode, with localized effects expected for any scenario in which the plume contacts the bottom.

The purpose of this study is to predict the potential response of the forest-tundra ecotone in Rocky Mountain National Park to future climate change using data on historical episodes of establishment in patch forest openings of the forest-tundra ecotone. We hypothesized that recent seedling establishment in patch forest openings of the forest-tundra ecotone, not balanced by mortality, was triggered by a warm, but wet period following the end of the Little Ice Age ca. A.D. 1850. At four sampling locations distributed throughout the Park, we determined dates of establishment among patch forest trees using increment cores and basal disks. We studied the relationship between establishment dates in relation to historical climate records using t-tests and logistic regression. In Rocky Mountian National Park, tree invasion in patch forest openings is episodic in nature, concentrated between 1951-1964, and is not balanced by mortality, suggesting more than a short-term change in the ecotone. On the basis of the climate record, t-tests, and logistic models, we concluded that both high temperatures and high snow depths must occur simultaneously for several years in order to generate climatic conditions suitable for tree establishment. The historic climate record indicates that a warmer and wetter period occurred during the 1950s and 1960s, but climate data are unavailable before 1880. According to proxy climate records, it appears that the regional climate of the southern Rocky Mountain region has been both warmer and wetter since the end of the Little Ice Age (ca. A.D. 1350-1850). We conclude that these climatic conditions may be related to the tree invasion we observed in patch forest openings of Rocky Mountain National Park.",,"climate change; climate record; climatic change; forest-tundra ecotone; forest/tundra; palaecolimate; palaeoclimate; paleoclimate; tree establishment; USA, Colorado, Rocky Mountain National Park",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030613435

The formation has been buried to a depth of 6 km, has experienced temperatures of over 200°C, and presently contains 78% H 2S, 20% CO 2, and 2% CH 4. Three distinct stages of burial diagenesis correspond to three phases of organic matter maturation. Pre-oil window diagenesis was dominated by precipitation of prebitumen calcite cement. Diagenesis in the oil window was characterized by precipitation of saddle dolomite and anhydrite in water-filled layers and by formation of solid bitumen in the oil column. Diagenesis in the gas window was dominated by thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR) resulting in hydrocarbon destruction, anhydrite dissolution, large amounts of H 2S, CO 2, and S° generation, and postbitumen calcite cementation. During TSR, anhydrite reacted with H 2S to produce S°, which in turn reacted with CH 4 to generate more H 2S in a self-reinforcing cycle. The lack of metal cations to stabilize H 2S as metal sulfides, availability of sufficient sulfate to generate H 2S, and a closed system to prevent H 2S from escaping resulted in the continuation of the TSR cycle until nearly all hydrocarbons were consumed. In Mississippi, concentration of H 2S is nearly zero in Smackover hydrocarbon reservoirs that have experienced temperatures of 120°C for more than 50 m.y, suggesting that TSR is not a kinetic (time-dependent) process. High H 2S concentrations initiate at temperatures above 140°C and increase with temperature, indicating that TSR is a thermodynamic phenomenon. Reported high H 2S concentrations at low temperatures (80-120°C) from other locations may be explained by the following processes: (1) migration of H 2S into these reservoirs, (2) high geothermal gradients or local thermal perturbations in the past, (3) a biochemical origin for the H 2S, or (4) exposure of these reservoirs to temperatures greater than 150°C and a rapid uplift. In Black Creek field, burial cementation and pressure solution resulted in total destruction of porosity and permeability in limestone reservoirs, but not in dolomite reservoirs, which still possess up to 20% porosity and 100 md permeability. Secondary porosity was not created as a result of hydrocarbon migration. Abundant CO 2 derived during hydrocarbon destruction resulted in calcite cementation rather than carbonate dissolution. Late, secondary porosity development in carbonates may be related to acids generated by metal sulfide precipitation.",,"Bituminous materials; Calcite; Dissolution; Hydrocarbons; Hydrocracking; Hydrogen sulfide; Mechanical permeability; Oil bearing formations; Organic minerals; Porosity; Precipitation (chemical); Simulation; Anhydrites; Burial diagenesis; Calcite cementation; Hydrocarbon destruction; Hydrocarbon migration; Organic matter maturation; Preoil window diagenesis; Saddle dolomite; Solid bitumen; Thermochemical sulfate reduction (TSR); Petroleum geology; anhydrite; burial diagenesis; hydrocarbon destruction; hydrogen sulphide; Jurassic; USA, Mississippi, Black Creek Field",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030806358

The predominance of local land ownership, the absence of large industrial employers and a small population hwee religion and ethnicity eased potential class differences created a climate conducive to collective action in Port Athur. The degree of conflict or cooperation that characterized local social relations inevitably extended to the operation of the municipal government and shaped the ways in which citizens perceived their municipality and its role within the community. This was of paramount importance as Ontario municipal law bound the municipal administration to the will of the majority of the taxpayers by requiring that all money by-laws and franchise agreements be voted upon. The accountability feature of the Municipal Act, coupled with a convergence of local interests under the rubric of boosterism, convincedPort Arthur residents to pioneer municipal enterprise in the early 1890s. The creation of one of the first municipally owned and operated electric street railways in the world was the innovation of small-scale land owners disillusioned with the boodling habit of the town's elite. The emerging consensus in favour of municipal enterprise was such that by 1901, not even the formidable Bell Telephone Company could dissuade Port Arthur inhabitants.

Policy formulation is no longer confined to just responding to an existing set of environmental conditions, but involves taking into account how the decision might affect the original set of environmental conditions to which the original policy was formulated as a response. We discuss how certain policies could be developed, using the results from two integrated scientific models which incorporate parameters reflecting two air issues: (1) climate change, and (2) stratospheric ozone depletion. Model results suggest very clearly that these two air issues are not scientifically independent from each other. Following a single-issue policy would lead to inconsistencies and undesirable consequences in other related issues. Thus, the policy decision process has now become complex. One of the sources of this complexity is the uncertainty in the response of the environmental system to certain policy decisions, complexity arising from the fact that the environmental system is highly nonlinear and evolving. Model results indicate that it is essential for the policy formulation process to be flexible enough to take into account the nonlinear evolutionary nature of the environmental system. A policy must reflect, and be tailored to, the dynamical history and present state of the system, if it is to be effective in influencing the future evolution of the system.",,"ozone; climate; conference paper; decision making; environmental impact assessment; model; policy; stratosphere; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Ozone layer; Public policy; Ozone depletion; Climate change; climate change; environmental policy; ozone depletion; policy approach; stratospheric ozone",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030609237

Complex 2 was fully characterized on the basis of microanalytical, 1H and 195Pt NMR spectroscopic, and X-ray crystallographic data. The reaction of 1 with a large excess of NaBH4 results in the formation of an equilibrium mixture of 2 and fac-[PtHMe3(bu2bpy)] (3). Complex 3 was characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy in solution but could not be isolated in pure form due to the ease of reversion to 2. Both complexes 2 and 3, which have no ligand than can easily dissociate, are thermally stable to reductive elimination of methane (both in solution and, in the case of complex 2, in the solid state) and to isotopic exchange within Pt(D)CH3 groups, thus giving strong support to the theory that both reactions must occur from within a five-coordinate intermediate.

IXPS has also been used to compare different core cleaning and conditioning treatments of oil wet North Sea reservoir core samples. Results show that hot solvent cleaned core has a reduced mean carbon surface composition density relative to core that has been mild solvent cleaned.

We generally found that the quality of naturally senesced leaf litter (i.e. concentrations of C, N and lignin; C:N, lignin:N) of a variety of native plant species produced in alpine, temperate and tropical communities maintained at elevated CO2 (600-680 μl l-1) was not significantly different from that produced in similar communities maintained at current ambient CO2 concentrations (340 355 μl l-1). When this litter was allowed to decompose in situ in a humid tropical forest in Panama (Cecropia peltata, Elettaria cardamomum, and Ficus benjamina, 130 days exposure) and in a lowland temperate calcareous grassland in Switzerland (Carex flacca and a graminoid species mixture; 261 days exposure), decomposition rates of litter produced under ambient and elevated CO2 did not differ significantly. The one exception to this pattern occurred in the high alpine sedge, Carex curvula, growing in the Swiss Alps. Decomposition of litter produced in situ under elevated CO2 was significantly slower than that of litter produced under ambient CO2 (14% vs. 21% of the initial litter mass had decomposed over a 61-day exposure period, respectively). Overall, our results indicate that relatively little or no change in leaf litter quality can be expected in plant communities growing under soil fertilities common in many native ecosystems as atmospheric CO2 concentrations continue to rise. Even in situations where small reductions in litter quality do occur, these may not necessarily lead to significantly slower rates of decomposition. Hence in many native species in situ litter decomposition rates, and the time course of decomposition, may remain relatively unaffected by rising CO2.","Alpine and temperate grassland; C:N ratio; CO2 enrichment; Lignin:N ratio; Tropical rainforest","carbon dioxide enrichment; decomposition; leaf litter; lignin; nutrient cycling; Panama; Carex curvula; Carex flacca; Cecropia peltata; Cecropiaceae; Cyperaceae; Elettaria cardamomum; Ficus benjamina; Moraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030618241

Box 4048, Prairie View, TX 77446-4048, United States","A new technique of calculating the Euler potentials α and β based on the geometrical relations between the magnetic field structure and Euler potentials [Huang and Yu, 1995] was used to determine the α and β coordinates of Neptune's magnetic field. The result is a mathematical definable coordinate system for a field of which the nondipole terms are nonnegligible. A framework is thus established for future studying of plasma dynamics such as particle drifts and plasma convection. The magnetic field model used is the Goddard Space Flight Center/Bartol Research Institute's I8E1 model. The full I8E1 model was used to investigate the significance of the higher-degree multipoles beyond the octupole (up to the eighth degree in the spherical harmonic expansions), particularly near the planet's surface. The results were compared to those of the O8 model, which is a simplified version of the I8E1. We found that the higher-degree terms do not change significantly the overall results of the O8. However, on the planet's surface, footprints of inner drift shells fall into a few concentrated areas, opening more regions into which no particle from these drift shells can precipitate. Close examination of these ""open"" regions indicates that they are isolated magnetic field systems that may trap particles locally. Our results entail new interpretation of the Voyager 2 UV spectrometer measurements on the planet's nightside surface emissions. Particle precipitation emissions are found to be concentrated on the areas into which the drift shells collapse. These areas of high concentration of drift shell footprints and emissions indicate that the strong emissions are due to high particle downflux into these regions of high magnetic field intensity. Our results suggest that magnetic moments higher than the octupole may constitute nonnegligible components of the magnetic field of planets that have high nondipole terms, such as Neptune and Uranus. For Neptune the high-degree terms should be included for studying plasma processes within two planetary radii.

Chem. 1, D-95440 Bayreuth, Germany","Perfluoro-surfactants form the same types of micelles and micellar phases as hydrocarbon surfactants. It is shown that a considerable share of the different micellar phases that potentially exist in surfactant solutions can be formed with a single perfluoro-surfactant by adding different additives to the same starting solution. Spherical micelles exist in solutions of perfluoro-sulfonic acid. This compound is a strong acid both in the monomer and in the micellar state and the micelles have a large dissociation degree. Solutions of this surfactant have a low viscosity up to high concentrations. When a solution of N(C2H5)4OH is added to a solution of perfluorosulfonic acid entangled threadlike micelles are formed. For a 100 mM solution one obtains instantaneously upon mixing a highly viscoelastic solution that shows the recoil-effect. In the experiment the acid is neutralised and the N+(C2H5)4-counterions bind strongly to the micellar interface. As a consequence, the cmc of the surfactant is shifted to lower values and the spheres grow into overlapping rods. The viscoelastic perfluoro-surfactant solutions show the same scaling laws as hydrocarbon surfactants. N+(C2H5)4-counterions bind strongly to both the perfluorosulfonic and the perfluorocarboxylic acid but not to hydrocarbon surfactants. Viscoelastic perfluoro-surfactant solutions can also be prepared by neutralising perfluorocarboxylic acids with partially substituted alkylammonium salts. Perfluorocarboxylic acids are strong acids in the monomer state but weak acids in the micellar state, i.e. the micelles are actually completely associated and the surfactant forms bilayer structures like vesicles above the cmc. The vesicles entrap surfactant- and the dissociated counter-ions from the bulk and - as a consequence - the conductivity of the perfluorocarboxylic acid passes over a sharp maximum at the cmc of the surfactant with increasing concentration. The viscoelastic properties of solutions with entangled threadlike micelles are lost by solubilisation of perfluorinated oils. This can be demonstrated by adding C7F16 to the viscoelastic solution which was obtained in the first experiment. The perfluoro-additive is solubilised by the micelles, enforces a rod-sphere transition and - as a result - a low viscosity solution is obtained.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000323057

Comparison of the resulting 6 cm continuum images show that the radio jet has undergone a lateral counterclockwise rotation of ∼6°-12° on the plane of the sky. The model of jet parcels on independent trajectories is difficult to reconcile with these observations and leads us to consider a path-oriented jet (i.e., younger parcels follow the same path as older parcels). Comparison of the most recent radio image with a nearly contemporaneous HST/FOC ultraviolet image at ∼2330 Å suggests that the ultraviolet emission lies along the leading side of the rotating radio jet. In conjunction with a proper motion analysis of the jet material that yields empirical space-velocity and resulting acceleration-magnitude relationships as a function of distance from the central source, we evaluate the observational results in terms of a schematic model in which the jet emission consists of plane-parallel isothermal shocks along the leading edge of rotation. In such a radiating shock, the ultraviolet-emitting region is consistent with the adiabatic region in the form of a high-temperature, low-density sheath that surrounds the cooled postshock radio-emitting region. Within the context of the schematic model, we obtain the temperatures, densities, and pressures within the preshock, adiabatic, and postshock regions as a function of distance from the central source; the physical parameters so derived compare favorably to previously published estimates. We obtain a total jet mass of 3.1 × 10-5 M⊙ and an age of ∼115 yr. We evaluate the model in the context of its density-boundary condition, its applicability to an episodic or quasi-continuous jet, and angular momentum considerations. © 1997.

The code is a hybrid code comprising a zero-dimensional plasma dynamics and a one-dimensional thermal analysis of in-vessel components. The code evaluates the time evolution of plasma parameters and temperature distributions of in-vessel components. As the plasma-safety interface model, we proposed a robust plasma physics model taking into account updated data for safety assessment. For example, physics safety guidelines for beta limit, density limit and H-L mode confinement transition threshold power, etc. are provided in the model. The model of the in-vessel components are divided into twenty temperature regions in the poloidal direction taking account of radiative heat transfer between each surface of each region. This code can also describe the coolant behavior under hydraulic accidents with the results by hydraulics code and treat vaporization (sublimation) from plasma facing components (PFCs). Furthermore, the code includes the model of impurity transport form PFCs by using a transport probability and a time delay. Quantitative analysis based on the model is possible for a scenario of plasma passive shutdown.

The possible adverse effects of MTBE on human health is a major public concern. However, informational on the metabolism of MTBE inhuman tissues is laking. The present study demonstrates that human liver is active in metabolizing MTBE to tert-butyl alcohol (TEA), a major circulating metabolite and a marker for exposure to MTBE. The activity is localized in the microsomal fraction (125 ± 11 pmol TBA/min per mg/protein, n = 8) but not in the cytosol. This activity level in human liver microsomes is approximately one-half of the value in rat and mouse liver microsomes. Formation of TBA in human liver microsomes is NADPH-dependent, and is significantly inhibited by carbon monoxide (CO), an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, suggesting that CYP enzymes play a critical role in the metabolism of MTBE in human livers. Both CYP2A6 and 2E1 are known to be constitutively expressed in human livers. To examine their involvement in MTBE metabolism, human CYP2A6 and 2E1 cDNAs were individually coexpressed with human cytochrome P450 reductase by a baculovirus expression system and the expressed enzymes were used for MTBE metabolism. The turnover number for CYP2A6 and 2E1 was 6.1 and 0.7 nmol TBA/min per nmol P450, respectively. The heterologously expressed human CYP2A6 was also more active than 2E1 in the metabolism of two other gasoline ethers ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) and tert-amyl methyl ether (TAME).

Existing data on organic carbon and suspended solids concentrations collected between 1989 and 1993, during routine monitoring by the River Purification Boards (RPBs) in Scotland and the National River Authorities (NRAs) in England and Wales, were used with annual mean flows to estimate fluxes of dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC and POC) in British rivers. Riverine DOC exports during 1993 varied from 7.7-103.5 kg ha-1 year-1, with a median flux of 31.9 kg ha-1 year-1 in the 85 rivers for which data were available. There was a trend for DOC fluxes to increase from the south and east to the north and west. A predictive model based on mean soil carbon storage in 17 catchments, together with regional precipitation totals, explained 94% of the variation in the riverine DOC exports in 1993. This model was used to predict riverine DOC fluxes in regions where no organic carbon data were available. Calculated and predicted fluxes were combined to produce an estimate for exports of DOC to tidal waters in British rivers during 1993 of 0.68 ± 0.07 Mt. Of this total, rivers in Scotland accounted for 53%, England 38% and Wales 9%. Scottish blanket peats would appear to be the largest single source of DOC exports in British rivers. An additional 0.20 Mt of organic carbon were estimated to have been exported in particulate form in 1993, approximately two-thirds of which was contributed by English rivers. It is suggested that riverine losses of organic carbon have the potential to affect the long-term dynamics of terrestrial organic carbon pools in Britain and that rivers may regulate increases in soil carbon pools brought about by climate change. © 1997 by John Wiley &amp;Sons, Ltd.","Flux estimates; Modelling; Riverine organic carbon; Soil carbon","Dissolved organic carbon; Organic carbon particles; Carbon; Climate change; Computational methods; Mathematical models; Particles (particulate matter); Peat; Precipitation (meteorology); Rivers; Suspensions (fluids); Water pollution; DOC; organic carbon; river water quality; soil carbon; UK",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031097146

Tests showed very little increased turbidity within 50 feet of the dredge area. This was critical because the area is used for shrimp, oyster and other commercial fishing. The technique was so effective that discovery of additional contamination, which nearly doubled the required dredge volume, did not require an extension of the three week project duration. Time was critical because the project was conducted in April, 1992 and any material dredged after May 8 may have incurred the cost of incineration for disposal rather than placement in a landfill. The dredged solids were dry enough to pass the paint filter test. Some lime was added to minimize exposure losses during transportation. The project required coordination of dredging, solidification, trucking, sampling and analyses.

But many people are not quite sure of the facts of global warming. The purpose of this article is to explain simply what is known, what we are uncertain about and what action might be taken. Regarding the science of global warming the basic principles are well established. Because of the increase in concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere resulting from human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, the global average temperature near the surface is rising. It is also expected that the hydrological cycle will become more intense which means that the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts will tend to increase. Because, however, of the complex feedbacks which occur in the climate system, detailed regional projections of climate change remain very uncertain. Many actions can be taken, however, at little or no cost which can assist in reducing anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide. Plans also need to be made to achieve the more substantial reductions which will almost certainly be required in the longer term.

Australia, as a signatory to the Climate Change Convention, has agreed to stabilize emissions of these gases at 1990 levels. There is a need to identify options that may reduce emissions from all industry sectors including those emissions arising from agricultural activities such as wheat cropping. The wheat cropping systems of the Wimmera region of Victoria studied here are likely to be significant net emitters of greenhouse gases with average annual emissions equivalent to 1350 to 2150 kg of carbon dioxide per hectare. Choosing stubble retention wheat cropping systems could reduce the average net emissions per hectare by up to 37% depending on the systems used. More importantly though, the stubble retention cropping systems which have lower emissions also tend to have greater yields, and thus may produce up to four times the grain yield per unit emissions than other systems such as conventionally tilled, continuous wheat. This indicates that there is significant potential to adapt wheat cropping systems to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective way. This capability may be enhanced by tactical management decisions that change fertilizer inputs depending on soil moisture levels at sowing or on seasonal forecasts based on factors such as the Southern Oscillation Index. This approach is also likely to have financial and risk management benefits. Loss of soil carbon was the most substantial component of the emissions budget for all cropping systems (63 to 84% of total emissions), followed by nitrous oxide emissions (from 12 to 42%) with methane forming a relatively small component (from 0.003 to 17%). Emissions from fossil fuel combustion (from 0.8 to 8%) and from burning crop stubble (from 0 to 21%) formed relatively small components of the emissions budget. Policy issues are discussed including the removal of barriers to adoption of the more sustainable, low- emission systems identified in this study.Increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases as a result of human activities affect the discernible changes in global climate.

The dipolar coupling constant of a C-H pair, hence the bond distance, and the relative orientation of the chemical-shift tensor to the C-H vector can all be determined for the protonated carbons with a single measurement. As the sample turns at only about 30 Hz in a MAT experiment, the SLF patterns obtained approach those of a stationary sample, and an accuracy in the measurement similar to that obtained on a stationary sample is expected. The technique is demonstrated on 2,6-dimethoxynaphthalene, where the 13C-1H separated-local-field powder patterns for the six chemically inequivalent carbons are clearly identified and measured. The observed dipolar coupling for the methoxy carbon is effectively reduced by the fast rotation of the group about its C3 symmetry axis.

It uses photoelectric charging of the substrate particles by a pulsed light source. The yield of such charging near photoelectric threshold depends on the state of the surface with submonolayer sensitivity. If the substrate particles are suspended in a gas at ambient conditions, a time resolution of a few milliseconds is achieved. As an example, we measured the thermal desorption of perylene (C20H12) from sodium chloride (NaCl) and carbon particles. The first-order rate constant of perylene desorption from NaCl particles was determined for temperatures between 66.3 and 86.0°C. The time required for the reduction of the perylene concentration to 1/e of the initial value was found to be td = 396 ms for T = 66.3°C and td = 36 ms for T = 86.0°C. The desorption activation energy was determined to Ed = 122.9(3.0) kJ/mol. This value is in excellent agreement with the result obtained by an equilibrium method and taken from the literature.1 Thermal desorption of perylene from the surface of carbon particles was studied for temperatures between 67.5 and 104.5°C. The obtained time constants are larger than for NaCl particles. (At T = 83.0°C the time constant is td = 94 ms compared to td = 54 ms for perylene desorption from NaCl particles.) Thermal desorption from carbon particles cannot be explained in terms of a single desorption activation energy. The experimental data are interpreted as desorption from a distribution of adsorption sites with different desorption activation energies.",,"Activation energy; Aerosols; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Photoconductivity; Reaction kinetics; Sodium chloride; Substrates; Perylene; Thermal desorption; Ultrafine aerosol particle; Desorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031556679

An examination of the Canadian government's own data for carbon dioxide and methane emissions from energy sources indicates why the Canadian stabilization target cannot be met: gross emissions are increasing, per capita emissions are increasing, and emissions in terms of gross domestic product are showing minimal change.

A two-phased model approach was used. The first phase was the generation of predicted sea-surface temperature anomalies for the low-latitude Pacific Ocean obtained from the Cane and Zebiak coupled model. The second phase involved superimposing these anomalies upon the climatological sea-surface temperatures used in a global climatic model in order to force climatic perturbations unique to 1992. The differences between the outputs of this model and the same model run with climatological sea-surface temperature permit identification of possible climatic changes for 1992. An ensemble approach was used involving 10 runs each of 1 year's duration for both climatological and perturbed conditions. This procedure was used to allow for chaotic influences to be included in the model output. Such influences in the model arise from the divergence of forecast projections in phase space rather than being attributable to stochastic processes. The impact of chaos on the predictions is illustrated in a number of cases. A succinct summary of the prodictive skill for rainfall anomalies, probably the most difficult climatic variable to predict satisfactorily, is provided. A number of regional situations is examined in some detail to indicate the potential skill that exists with this two-phased approach for situations of both above and below average rainfall. Some noticeable failures also occurred that were attributed to the underlying climatology of the global climatic model being inadequate, rather than to a deficiency in the technique. As would be expected from the limited oceanic region for which sea-surface temperature anomalies were predicted the climatic predictions were restricted basically to areas influenced by ENSO events. Although there is room for considerable improvements in the results presented here, the two-phased technique represents a viable, simple, and relatively economic interim method for generating multi-seasonal predictions for the immediate future.","Chaos; ENSO; Global models; Predictions","climate prediction; El Nino/Southern Oscillation; global-scale; multi-seasonal predictions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030927546

Univ. of Agricultural Sciences, S-904 03 Umeå, Sweden","More than 200 angiosperms, distributed in 25 genera, develop root nodule symbioses (actinorhizas) with soil bacteria of the actinomycetous genus Frankia. Although most soils studied contain infective Frankia, cultured strains are available only after isolation from root nodules. Frankia infects roots via root hairs in some hosts or via intercellular penetration in others. The nodule originates in the pericycle. The number of nodules in Alnus is determined by the plant in an autoregulated process that, in turn, is modulated by nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphate. Except in the genera Allocausarina and Casuarina, Frankia in nodules develops so-called vesicles where nitrogenase is localized. Sporulation of Frankia occurs in some symbioses. As a group, actinorhizal plants show a large range of anatomical and biochemical adaptations in order to balance the oxygen tension near nitrogenase. In symbioses with well aerated nodule tissue like Alnus, the vesicles have a multilayered envelope composed mainly of lipids, bacterio-hopanetetrol and their derivatives. This envelope is assumed to retard the diffusion of oxygen into the nitrogenase-containing vesicle. In symbioses like Casuarina, the infected plant cells themselves, rather than Frankia, appear to retard oxygen diffusion, and high concentrations of haemoglobin indicate an infected region with a low oxygen tension. At least in Alnus spp., ammonia resulting from N2 fixation is assimilated by glutamine synthetase in the plant. The carbon compound(s) used by Frankia in nodules is not yet known. Nitrogenase activity decreases in response to a number of environmental factors but recovers upon return to normal conditions. This dynamism in nitrogenase activity is often explained by loss and recovery of active nitrogenase and has been traced to loss and recovery of the nitrogenase proteins themselves. Recovery is partly due to growth of Frankia and to development of new vesicles in the Alnus nodules. In the field, varying conditions continuously affect the plants and the measured rate of N2 fixation is a result not only of the conditions prevailing at the moment but also of the conditions experienced over preceding days. N2 fixed by actinorhizal plants is substantial and actinorhizal plants have great potential in soil reclamation and in various types of forestry. Several species are also useful in horticulture.","Environmental effects; Frankia; N2 fixation; Nodules; Oxygen","actinorhiza; bacteria; nitrogen fixation; Allocasuarina; Alnus; Betulaceae; Casuarina; Casuarinaceae; Frankia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031285315

As a test of the reliability of the X-ray abundances in systems dominated by thermal emission from hot gas in collisional ionization equilibrium, we compare Fe abundances determined independently from the Fe L and Fe K emission regions in simple one- and two-temperature thermal fits to ASCA X-ray spectra of the elliptical galaxy M87 and five galaxy clusters. We find that the Fe L and Fe K abundances are consistent within or near their 90% confidence errors, which would not necessarily be the case if there were severe problems with the atomic physics or with the instrument calibrations. Our data cover a range of plasma temperatures kT = 2-4 keV, where the Fe L emission arises primarily from Fe xxin and xxiv and the Fe K emission arises primarily from Fe xxv. There is also a contribution from less ionized gas at lower temperatures in M87. For M87, the abundances from Fe K are systematically lower by 30%-50% than those from Fe L, and the differences are attributable to the complicated temperature structure in the central cooling flow. Allowing for the possibility of excess absorption of the emission from the cooling flow increases the systematic offset of the Fe L and Fe K abundances to 40%-80% in the simple model we consider. The cluster spectra, on the other hand, are for nearly isothermal regions outside any central cooling flow and the abundances have no systematic offset. The consistency between the Fe K and Fe L abundances, which is also seen in other clusters and in the corona of Ar Lac, indicates that whatever atomic physics uncertainties exist in the current codes are not likely to render Fe abundance measurements unreliable within the ∼30%-50% agreement we find for the systems we examined. The results using various thermal emission codes differ by 15%-20%, showing the level of scatter due just to different assumptions about the atomic physics. The atomic rates for H- and He-like ions, which are relevant for the determination of abundances in elements other than Fe, are more accurately known than those for less ionized species that dominate the complicated Fe L emission. In light of the support our results give to the abundances derived from ASCA data for clusters and bright elliptical galaxies, we consider briefly the plausibility of subsolar abundances in elliptical galaxies. © 1997.

Our mean results are in agreement with the PET results in that we saw similar bilateral activations. The present results are compared with our previously published fMRI study of a verbal fluency task, which had also been proposed by Frith et al. to elicit a ""willed action"" response. We find a clear separation of activation foci in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for the sensorimotor (Brodmann area 46) and verbal fluency (Brodmann area 45) tasks. Hence, assigning a particular activated region to ""willed action"" is not supported by the fMRI data when examined closely because identical regions are not activated with different modalities. Similar modality linked activations can be observed in the original PET study but the greater resolution of the fMRI data makes the modality linkages more definite.","Brodmann areas 6, 8, 9, 24, 32, 45, and 46; Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; Human brain mapping; Positron emission tomography; Verbal fluency","adult; article; brain mapping; cognition; electroencephalogram; female; human; human experiment; image quality; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; sensorimotor function; verbal behavior; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Prefrontal Cortex; Task Performance and Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030917157

For summer irrigated crops such as maize, the yield reductions and the exacerbated problems of irrigation water availability simulated with climate change may force the crop out of production in some regions. For winter dryland crops such as wheat, productivity increased significantly in some regions, suggesting a northward shift of area suitable for wheat production in future climates. The study considered strategies for improving the efficiency of water use based on the optimization of crop management decisions in a CO2-driven warmer climate. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change; Maize; Spain; Vulnerability; Wheat",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342971026

It is established that the generation of acoustic emission at stresses close to the yield limit depends on the carbon content of the steel and the progress of carbide formation (the tempering temperature). In addition to the carbide phase, the generation of acoustic emission calls for the presence of mobile dislocations which are formed in the course of the γ-α transformation at quenching. It is hypothesized that a certain contribution to the generation of acoustic emission in the case of tensile deformation comes from the processes of microcracking associated with the carbide phase, which are nonexistent in the case of compressive deformation.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031480655

It is also an industrially important producer of cellulolytic and ,hemicellulolytic enzymes. In this work carbon source regulation of cellulase and hemicellulase gene expression was studied at the transcriptional level. Expression of cellulase genes was found to be controlled by separate induction and repression controls in T. reesei. Genes encoding cellobiohydrolases (cbh1 and cbh2) and endoglucanases (egl1, egl2, and egl5) were coordinately induced on media containing cellulose, sophorose, lactose or cellobiose. Glycerol and sorbitol were non-inducing, non-repressing carbon sources for cellulase transcription, and glucose repressed expression of the genes coding for cellulases and hemicellulases. Depletion of glucose provoked expression of genes encoding cellulases and many hemicellulases. The cre1 gene coding for the glucose represser was isolated from T. reesei and T. harzianum. The CREI protein is a DNA-binding protein, which is similar to the glucose repressors CREA of Aspergillus nidulans and A. niger, and the MIG1 and MIG2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, particularly in the DNA-binding region which comprises two zinc fingers of the Cys2His2 type. The T. reesei strain Rut-C30 expressed a mutated form of the cre1 gene and was defective in glucose repression of cellulase and hemicellulase gene expression. Introduction of the native cre1 gene into the Rut-C30 strain conferred glucose repression of these genes, demonstrating that glucose repression is mediated by the cre1 gene in T. reesei. Functional analysis of the cellulase promoter cbh1 was carried out using the E. coli lacZ gene as a reporter. A series of deletions and site-specific alterations were created in the promoter. Targeted mutagenesis of certain putative CREI-binding sites resulted in derepression of lacZ expression in the presence of glucose, showing that these sites are involved in mediating glucose repression of the cbh1 promoter. Disruption of CREI-binding sites did not impair induction of the cbh1 promoter by sophorose, and expression from very short promoter derivatives could still be induced by sophorose.","Cbhl; Cellulase; Crea; Crel; Fungi; Gene technology; Glucose; Hemicellulase; Transcriptional regulation; Trichoderma",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5244331030

This indicates that the role of income in explaining pollution dynamics is limited. With appropriate policies, pollution level can be kept low even during the initial stage of economic growth.

Essentially all the emission can be ascribed to carbon and deuterium. Because the majority of the most intense lines, which lie at wavelengths above 1100 Å, are not accessible to the present instrumentation, extensive use has been made of collisional-radiative (CR) calculations for level populations of the important ions in order to relate the total radiated power to shorter wavelength transitions. In beam-heated plasmas, the fraction of radiation detected from carbon along the VUV spectrometer view is usually between 50% and 80% of the total. Carbon densities are estimated from a simplified approach to modelling the emission using a one-dimensional transport code. For partially detached plasmas the concentrations range from 2%-6% of the electron density; but in attached plasmas it appears that carbon may supply most of the electrons in the divertor region just below the X point.

Ltd.","An exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system that recirculates a portion of the exhaust gas back to the intake system is effective in reducing nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from diesel engines. However, improved control accuracy over the EGR flow rate is required, because an excessively large flow rate causes emissions of particulate matter (PM) to increase. In recent years, direct injection (DI) diesel engines have also been used on ordinary passenger cars, because their fuel economy is superior to that of indirect injection (IDI) diesel engines. Since DI engines are more sensitive to the EGR flow rate than their IDI counterparts, improving the accuracy of EGR flow rate control has become even more significant. This study concerned an EGR control algorithm based on the results of calculations performed with an engine model capable of representing the dynamic states of the intake and exhaust systems. The aim of this research was to find a method for improving the control accuracy of the EGR flow rate under both steady-state and transient operating conditions. Based on analyses of actual engine data and through the use of a control system CAD program, an algorithm was found for estimating the intake and exhaust pressures accurately, which are important parameters for EGR flow rate control. As a result, useful knowledge was obtained for controlling the EGR flow rate more accurately.

Box 30677, Nairobi, Kenya","It is argued in this paper that two fundamental economic processes prevent resource-poor farmers in tropical countries from managing soil carbon in a sustainable manner. The first process is related to the fact that soil carbon and tropical forests are part of the natural capital of these countries and of the world community. As a consequence, the interests of resource-poor farmers in tropical countries, of these countries themselves and of the world community conflict. This implies that levels of adoption of sustainable soil carbon management practices which are optimal from the perspective of resource-poor farmers are sub-optimal from a regional and global perspective. The second process regards the nature of sustainable soil management practices. These practices are investments in natural capital which bring about net benefits to farmers only after four to six years. Absolute poverty levels in tropical countries make it very difficult for farmers to undertake such investments. It follows that even perfectly informed and rational resource-poor farmers will not voluntarily adopt socially optimal levels of soil carbon management in tropical countries. Policy interventions are a means of ensuring that soil carbon is managed in such a socially optimal and sustainable fashion in these countries. Two principles are proposed for developing effective, equitable and appropriate policy options. The first is tho beneficiary-compensates principle, which requires that society in tropical countries and in industrialized countries should compensate resource-poor farmers in tropical countries for adopting soil carbon management practices. The second principle is that international and national policy options need to be well articulated and that sets of complementary policies should be put in place for greater effectiveness. Policies alleviating rural poverty and pressures to deforest are as policies specially targeted at soil carbon management. Finally, research priorities for soil and biological scientists are derives from the analysis. These priorities necessitate the creation of interdisciplinary teams of soil, biological and social scientists. This is perhaps an even greater challenge for the scientific community than the achievement than the achievement of the research agenda itself.","Economic policy; Soil carbon management","agricultural sustainability; carbon content; developing country; policy; soil carbon; soil management; soil nutrients; sustainable development; tropics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030779189

The oxygen abundance in the central, brightest part of the galaxy is found to be 12 + log (O/H) = 7.33 ± 0.01, only slightly greater than the oxygen abundance in the most metal-deficient BCG, I Zw 18. We show that the N/O, Ne/O, S/O, and Ar/O abundance ratios in SBS 0335-052 are close to those derived for other BCGs, suggesting that heavy-element enrichment in the H n region is due to massive-star evolution. However, we find an O/Fe abundance ratio close to that in the Sun, at variance with values derived for other BCGs. The helium abundance derived from the He I 4471, 5876, and 6678 A emission lines, taking into account collisional and fluorescent enhancement, is Y = 0.245 ± 0.006, close to the value of the primordial helium abundance, Yp = 0.243 ± 0.003, derived by Izotov, Thuan, &amp; Lipovetsky. We detect auroral [O III] λ4363 emission in the inner part of the H II region with a diameter of 14″, or 3.6 kpc, and find that the H III region inside this diameter is hot, Te ∼ 20,000 K. The oxygen abundance in this region is nearly constant [12 + log (O/H) = 7.1-7.3], with a gradual decrease to the outer part of H II region, implying effective mixing of ionized gas on short timescales. We study the distribution of the nebular He II λ4686 emission line and find that it is not produced by main-sequence O stars or Wolf-Rayet stars. Possible excitation mechanisms for this line, such as massive X-ray binaries and shocks, are discussed. We also discuss the origin of blue, underlying, extended low-intensity emission detected in SBS 0335-052 in V, R, and I images. The blue V-I and R-I color distributions suggest that a significant contribution to the extended low-intensity envelope is due to ionized gas emission. This is evidence that SBS 0335-052 is a young galaxy experiencing its very first burst of star formation. However, we find that the observed equivalent width of H/J emission in the extended envelope is 2-3 times lower than the value expected in the case of pure gaseous emission. Furthermore, we find that the widths of Hγ and H/β are narrower than the instrumental profiles; this could be explained by the presence of underlying stellar absorption from A stars. These findings suggest that, along with the young (∼107 yr) blue stellar clusters in the center of the galaxy, an older stellar population of age ∼108 yr may be present in the extended envelope of SBS 0335-052 having a total mass of ∼107 M⊙, 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the neutral gas mass but comparable with the total mass of stars in blue young stellar clusters observed in the center of the galaxy. We conclude that SBS 0335-052 is a young nearby dwarf galaxy with age ∼108 yr. © 1997. The American Astronomical Society.

It can be applied at the level of neighborhoods, cities and even small regions in order to exploit the synergies between urban design objectives for livable cities and energy management objectives of minimizing energy use and its associated environmental effects for a given standard of living. CEM encompasses (i) land use planning, (ii) transportation management, (iii) site design, and (iv) local energy supply and delivery planning. While traditional energy management focuses on energy using equipment and buildings, CEM also considers the urban land use and infrastructure level. This study applies CEM to four representative communities in British Columbia, Canada, over the period 1995 to 2010, and compares the results to a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. The aggregate effect is a decrease in energy service costs and energy consumption of 15-30%, and in air emissions (CO2 and NOx) of 30-45%. The methodology and results, with respect to one aspect of CEM - land use planning - are extrapolated to the provincial level in order to estimate total CO2 emission reduction potential. CO2 emissions are reduced by 17% from BAU. Additional approximate calculations (restricted to land use planning) suggest that on a global scale CEM can be an important element in the greenhouse gas emission reduction strategy, especially given the dramatic urban growth anticipated in developing countries in the coming decades. Implementation of CEM requires an array of policy initiatives from governments at all levels, as the following examples illustrate. National and provincial (state) governments can (i) change the legislation governing regional and municipal land use planning, (ii) tie infrastructure grants to CEM type municipal investments, and (iii) provide information support and fiscal incentives for developers. Regional and municipal governments can (i) change zoning objectives, (ii) encourage specific types of developments through development charges and tax incentives to developers, and (iii) work with energy and other utilities to encourage particular energy forms and delivery systems. © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

In those years, the long-run perspective of European climate policy was geared to the idea of a carbon tax, while the US and OPEC formed a blocking coalition. Meanwhile, the US has adopted a more open altitude to climate policy, but it is highly unlikely that a substantial carbon tax will be implemented in the US in the foreseeable future. Forming a political consensus around this instrument has proved very difficult in Europe as well. Clearly, a fresh approach to climate policy is warranted. We argue that this approach should consist of putting into place a process of sequential decision making which is flexible. Innovative and participatory. Such a process would lead beyond existing alternatives of taxation and regulation as defined by a seemingly omniscient political authority. Its rationale lies in the recognition of a 'cost barrier' which can be surmounted by the combination of patient multilateral negotiation, innovative business initiatives, and resonance with public opinion. The European Union is in an excellent position to take on a leading role in establishing such a process. Europe's special opportunity lies in the fact that her citizenry is supportive of ambitious climate policy as nowhere else in the world.

The deposition medium was either a gaseous flow of pure nitrogen or nitrogen-helium mixtures or cold remote plasma of nitrogen (CRNP) or of nitrogen-hydrogen mixtures (CRNPH). Fourier transform IR (FTIR) spectra of the deposited films show a very efficient nitrogen fixation with C-N bands characteristic of tetrahedral carbon.

During disruptions at high beta μ where μ ≡ plasma pressure/magnetic pressure, short (order of μs) and intense bursts of electron cyclotron emission (ECE), an order magnitude above thermal levels, are observed in the second harmonic electron cyclotron frequency range, which corresponds to 100s of GHz in the Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor tokamak. A unique combination of two, fast, 500 kHz, 20-channel grating polychromator instruments, located at different toroidal positions, is used to measure the emission and characterize these bursts. New insights into the three-dimensional dynamics of these disruptions and the accompanying bursts of ECE have been obtained. Bursts of ECE occur at the beginning of the thermal quenches and exhibit strong toroidal asymmetries. Bursts are localized to the vicinity of the ballooning mode, a fast growing (few ms) medium toroidal mode number (n= 10-20) precursor, localized toroidally, poloidally, and radially, which triggers the disruptions. Fast-particle losses occur with the explosive growth of the ballooning mode, followed by plasma/wall interaction. Bursts of ECE occur shortly afterwards, within 10s of μs of the fast particle losses. An explanation of the bursting is presented which is consistent both qualitatively and quantitatively, with observations predicting, for example, radiation enhancement factors of ≈10. Bursting can be explained not in terms of enhanced excitation of emission but rather in the reduction of absorption of thermal emission. Bursting is consistent with a modification to the electron distribution function fe due to a rapid energy or particle exchange between hot electrons and cold electrons from the edge, momentarily reducing the velocity gradient of fc in the thermal region. Large edge localized mode events also exhibit bursts of ECE due to a similar sequence of events. © 1997 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3342939454

These rules are intended to apply to the treatment of a wide range of non-aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygenated and chlorinated VOCs, and are currently being used to provide an up-to-date mechanism describing the degradation of a range of VOCs, and the production of secondary oxidants, for use in a model of the boundary layer over Europe. The schemes constructed using this protocol are applicable, however, to a wide range of ambient conditions, and may be employed in models of urban, rural or remote tropospheric environments, or for the simulation of secondary pollutant formation for a range of NO(χ) or VOC emission scenarios. These schemes are believed to be particularly appropriate for comparative assessments of the formation of oxidants, such as ozone, from the degradation of organic compounds. The protocol is divided into a series of subsections dealing with initiation reactions, the reactions of the radical intermediates and the further degradation of first and subsequent generation products. The present work draws heavily on previous reviews and evaluations of data relevant to tropospheric chemistry. Where necessary, however, existing recommendations are adapted, or new rules are defined, to reflect recent improvements in the database, particularly with regard to the treatment of peroxy radical (RO2) reactions for which there have been major advances, even since comparatively recent reviews. The present protocol aims to take into consideration work available in the open literature up to the end of 1994, and some further studies known by the authors, which were under review at that time. A major disadvantage of explicit chemical mechanisms is the very large number of reactions potentially generated, if a series of rules is rigorously applied. The protocol aims to limit the number of reactions in a degradation scheme by applying a degree of strategic simplification, whilst maintaining the essential features of the chemistry. These simplification measures are described, and their influence is demonstrated and discussed. The resultant mechanisms are believed to provide a suitable starting point for the generation of reduced chemical mechanisms.","Free radical reactions; Mechanisms; Modelling; Oxidants; Ozone; Secondary pollutants; Tropospheric chemistry; VOC oxidation","free radical; ozone; volatile organic compound; air pollution; article; boundary layer; chemical reaction; degradation; Europe; model; priority journal; troposphere; Air pollution; Boundary layers; Computer simulation; Database systems; Degradation; Free radical reactions; Hydrocarbons; Oxidation; Ozone; Peroxides; Troposphere; Volatile organic compounds; Secondary air pollutants; Tropospheric oxidation; Atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric degradation; oxidation; ozone; protocol; radical; troposphere; VOC",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030617274

Three of these binaries have small or no excess emission at λ=1-5 μm but large excess emission at longer wavelengths, suggesting cleared regions within circumbinary disks. The inferred sizes of these gaps or holes are consistent with theoretical predictions for dynamical clearing by stellar companions. In contrast, the binary AK Sco has a power-law SED with no evidence of reduced near-infrared emission. Nonetheless, a strong 9.8 μm silicate emission feature suggests the presence of optically thin dust, and the near-infrared emission can be produced by very small amounts (∼ 10-9 M⊙) of material within a gap or hole. Thus a dynamically cleared region may exist in AK Sco but is not required by the data. That three of these binaries (and several other short-period pre-main-sequence binaries) have near-infrared excesses indicative of hot material near the stars is significant given that circumstellar disk radii are limited to less than 0.06 AU (or several stellar radii). The spatial distribution of the near-infrared-emitting material may not be disk-like. Continued replenishment is necessary, perhaps from circumbinary disks. Circumbinary disk masses around short-period pre-main-sequence binaries range from 0.06 M⊙ to less than 10-4 M⊙. The larger disk masses are sufficient to substantially influence the binaries' orbital eccentricities during their pre-main-sequence lifetimes. © 1997 American Astronomical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000938452

The kinetic and mechanistic parameters of lumped VOC reactions recalculated using the LFV emissions profiles are noticeably different From those based on default emissions profiles, indicating the importance of tailoring the parameters to specific regions. The sensitivities of ozone concentrations to total and speciated VOC and NO(x) emissions as well as to the NO2/NO(x) ratios are determined. Significant VOC model species are identified based on the impact of their emissions on ozone formation in the LFV. Of note is the importance of the emissions of a lumped class of aromatics, ARO2, which contains mostly isomers of xylene and trimethylbenzene and is derived chiefly from the use and distribution of gasoline fuels. The ARO2 emissions make the largest contribution of all model VOC species to the ozone levels in the urban plume. The results indicate that reduction of ARO2 emissions alone could achieve significant reduction of ozone levels in the LFV. Base case emissions of NO(x) (NO or NO2) in the LFV contribute negatively to the ozone formation.

The Arctic is believed to be particularly sensitive to global climate change that may result from increases in so-called greenhouse gases. Greenhouse warming scenarios using ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (GCMs) tend to predict enhanced warming in the polar regions, with the Arctic expected to warm about 3-4°C during the next half-century1. Some GCMs even show a complete or near-complete removal of the summer ice cover in the Arctic2. Thus, systematic, long-term observations of the Arctic ice cover may be useful for the early detection of global climate change3. The need is clearly indicated for operational climate monitoring of the Arctic ice cover, in the principles and framework of EuroGOOS. In particular, such a monitoring system fits well within the Climate Monitoring, Assessment and Prediction module. Also, because the Arctic ice cover greatly affects fisheries in the marginal seas, offshore oil and gas activities, and transport operations, such monitoring has relevance to the Marine Meteorological and Oceanographic Operational Services module. Here we describe 1) the existing climate monitoring program of the Arctic ice cover, developed by the Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center (NERSC), Bergen, Norway, and 2) the potential for improvements, including the use of other observations and models of the Arctic ice cover. © 1997 Elsevier B.V.

Dayton Street, Madison, WI 53706-1695, United States","Motivated by the circumstantial evidence of the pervasive nature of the ""general coldness"" of climate model simulations, a theoretical analysis is made of the model response expected from the presence of both physical and aphysical sources of entropy under the joint conditions that the net flux of energy through the upper and lower boundaries of the atmosphere and the isentropic temporally, areally integrated entropy source must vanish. These joint conditions are essential for a simulated global climate state to be without drift. The application of these conditions in the presence of positive definite aphysical entropy sources leads to the conclusion that the model-simulated climate state will be characterized by a general coldness, in particular in the upper polar troposphere and lower tropical troposphere as observed in 104 out of 105 possible outcomes from 35 different simulations by 14 climate models. In assessing the magnitude of this effect, a 10°C bias in mean temperature corresponds with a relatively small error of 4% in the mean heat addition of an isentropic layer. This correspondence reveals the extreme sensitivity of a climate model's temperature response to aphysical entropy sources introduced by spurious numerical dispersion/diffusion, Gibbs oscillations, parameterizations, and other factors. In accurately simulating hydrologic and chemical processes, this difficulty is compounded in the sense that the saturation specific humidity doubles for each additional 10°C increase in temperature and the inherent strong dependence of both processes on temperature, pressure, and amount of water substances - vapor, liquid, and ice. A strategy that makes climate simulations tractable is that numerical trade-offs occur among the various parameterizations of the components of heat addition. These trade-offs allow models to be tuned to simulate a reasonable state achievable for given resolution, numerics, and parameterizations. Oreskes et al. label this step ""calibration"" and suggest that in such situations, ""empirical adequacy is forced."" The results of this analysis in combination with Carathéordary's statement of the Second Law reveals in the strict sense that the presence of positive definite aphysical sources of entropy in a climate model precludes the simulation of unbiased distributions of the heat addition and temperature. Since in the strict sense the true state cannot be simulated, several questions follow: are reasonable states of global and regional climate change simulated for the right reasons; just what are reasonable states; and how are the right reasons to be determined in view of the trade-offs among the several components of parameterized heat addition?",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001362108

Sensitivity to the direct effects of climate change were evaluated using a climate-space approach to delineate the range of thermal conditions tolerable by each species. Sensitivity to indirect effects were evaluated by quantifying the association of each species to the current vegetation distribution within the continental USA and using this association to assess whether wildlife species distributions might shift in response to vegetation shifts under climate change. Results indicate that altered thermal conditions alone should have little or no effect on the wildlife species' distributions as physiological tolerance to heat load would allow them to survive. Analyses of the effects of vegetation change indicate that deer and chipmunks should retain their current distributions and possibly expand westward in the USA. For Elk and ground squirrels, there is a possibility that their current distributions would shrink and there is little possibility that each species would spread to new regions. This work emphasizes that the distributions of the four mammalian species are likely to be influenced more by vegetation changes than by thermal conditions. Future efforts to understand the effects of global change on wildlife species should focus on animal-habitat and climate-vegetation linkages. © 1997 Blackwell Science Ltd.","Chipmunk; Climate change; Elk; Ground squirrel; Habitat association; Species distributions; White-tailed deer","carbon dioxide enrichment; chipmunk; climatic change; Columbian ground squirrel; elk; white tailed deer; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031402084

While these enzymes, known as acid and neutral trehalases, share a strict specificity for trehalose, they are nevertheless rather different in subcellular localisation and in several biochemical and regulatory properties. The function of these apparently redundant activities in the same cell was not completely understood until recently. Biochemical and genetic studies now suggest that these enzymes may have specialised and exclusive roles in fungal cells. It is thought that neutral trehalases mobilise cytosolic trehalose, under the control of developmental programs, chemical and nutrient signals, or stress responses. On the other hand, acid trehalases appear not to mobilise cytosolic trehalose, but to act as 'carbon scavenger' hydrolases enabling cells to utilise exogenous trehalose as a carbon source, under the control of carbon catabolic regulatory circuits. Although much needs to be learned about the molecular identity of trehalases, it seems that in fungi at least one class of acid trehalases evolved independently from the other trehalases.","Fungi; Metabolism; Stress response; Trehalase; Trehalose","trehalase; trehalose; enzyme analysis; fungus; hydrolysis; nonhuman; priority journal; review; stress; Fermentation; Fungi; Hydrolysis; Trehalase; Trehalose; Fungi",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030774462

In contrast, most air pollution controls concentrate on permanent curtailments of emissions. The argument is put forth that episodic emission control strategies can be an effective supplement to traditional measures, at a fraction of the cost. Questions regarding the legality of epidosic controls are discussed. In addition, the forecasting and modeling implications of episodic controls are considered. Several areas have implemented episodic air pollution controls or used accurate short-term forecasts to warn the public through health advisories of pending air pollution events. Some of these success stories are highlighted. A scheme for assisting the prediction of emissions reductions based on the degree to which episodic measures are voluntary or mandatory is proposed. This method nay help resolve emission reduction credit and enforcement plans and conformity more likely. The transportation sector has the potential to make episodic measures successful. Furthemore, some of these measures are eligible for federal transportation dollars. The potential for funding transportation-related episodic controls is explored. While episodic controls cannot replace traditional controls, they can be an incremental or short-term solution that may evolve into, or be used in conjunction with, other plans.

We present results of three-dimensional simulations of the atmospheres of such planets, and comment on their possible habitability. Near the ground, a thermally direct longitudinal cell exists, transporting heat from the dayside to the nightside. The circulation is three-dimensional, with low-level winds returning mass to the dayside across the polar regions. Aloft, the zonally averaged winds display a pattern of strong superrotation due to these planets' finite (albeit small) rotation rate. With terrestrial values of insolation, a CO2/H2O atmosphere collapses, or condenses on the surface of the darkside, when surface pressure is approximately 30 mb, this value being much lower for a N2atmosphere. This temperature contrast is also sensitive to factors such as gravity, planetary radius, and IR optical depth τ. These results question the suitability of the concept of a habitable zone around M dwarfs that is independent of planetary parameters. If CO2partial pressure is controlled by the carbonate-silicate cycle, we find that these planets should have a minimum surface pressure of 1000-1500 mb of CO2, as this is the minimum pressure needed to support stable liquid water on the darkside at the inner edge of the habitable zone. We finally conclude that planets orbiting M stars can support atmospheres over a large range of conditions and, despite constraints such as stellar activity, are very likely to be habitable. © 1997 Academic Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031256572

Both equilibrium and transient climate change projections for southern Africa are considered. Warming projected over southern Africa is within the range of globally averaged estimates. Uncertainties associated with the parameterization of convection ensure that projected changes in rainfall at GCM grid scales remain unreliable. However, empirical downscaling approaches produce rainfall changes consistent with synoptic-scale circulation. Both downscaling and grid-scale approaches indicate a 10-15% decrease in summer rainfall over the central interior which may have important implications for surface hydrology.

The amount of CO2 emissions from China may surpass that of the United States within 20-30 years, making China the world's largest source of greenhouse gases by 2020. Currently, renewable energy resources (except for hydropower) account for only a fraction of China's total energy consumption. However, China has abundant solar energy resources. More than two thirds of China receives an annual total insolation that exceeds 5.9 GJ/m2 (1,639 kWh/m2) with more than 2,200 hours of sunshine a year. Wind energy potential in China is about 3,200 GW, of which 253 GW is deemed technically exploitable. China has a wide range of biomass resources that can be used for energy supply and high temperature geothermal resources suitable for power generation located mainly in Tibet and Yunnan provinces. Renewable energy technologies have been actively deployed in China. Although PV power stations have not being connected to the national grid, total installed capacity was 3 MW in 1994. Solar water heaters are by far the largest solar thermal application in China with a total installed capacity of 3.3 million m2 in 1994. By the end of 1995, total installed capacity of grid-connected wind power plants had reached 36 MW. Also, over 140,000 small wind generators ranging in size from 50 W to 5 kW have been deployed with a total installed capacity of 17 MW. China is a world leader in the development and application of anaerobic technologies for the production of fuel gas and waste treatment and has by far the largest biomass gasification R&amp;D capacity in the. Although renewable energy is projected to play a small role in future electricity generation, it is expected to be much more significant in the total energy sector. Under one scenario, renewable energy other than hydro provides up to 4% of the total energy supply and 88 million tons of carbon emission reduction by 2020. The estimated growth in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as serious local and regional environmental pollution problems caused by combustion of fossil fuels, provide strong arguments for the development of renewable energy resources.

The strained InGaAs quantum well (QW) laser, implemented on a nearly optimally oriented (311)B-GaAs substrate, incorporates a reduced Al-content, quasi-phase matched (QPM) single guiding GaAs layer (SGL) structure, a novel double-tapered horizontal waveguide with high reflection-coated cleaved facets, and a metallization- free emission window at the center of the device. The horizontal geometry serves to increase the ratio of fundamental power density within the SHG-region to that at the facets, thereby increasing the laser optical power at the onset of catastrophic optical damage (COD) at the facets. Simulations indicate that surface blue emission (on the order of 14 W/cm2 peak, corresponding to 50 (mu) W for a 10 micrometers X 100 micrometers emission window) can be obtained from a compact device, with a moderate taper angle of 3 degree(s), operating well below the COD limit.

Toward this end, an economic model was developed for CO2 recovery from power-plant flue gas and its delivery to microalgae ponds. A design basis was devised for recovering CO2 from flue gas emitted by a typical 500 MW power plant located in the Southwestern United States. For the standard process, which included monoethanolamine (MEA) extraction, compression, dehydration, and transportation to the ponds, a delivered CO2 cost of $40/t was estimated. The model was also used to evaluate the efficacy of directly using the flue gas, however, this option was found to be more expensive. The economics of microalgae cultivation using power-plant flue gas can be evaluated by integrating this model for CO2 recovery with a previously developed model for microalgae cultivation. The model predictions for a long-term process are: a lipid cost of $1.4/gal (unextracted) and a mitigation cost of $30/t CO2 (CO2 avoided basis). These costs are economically attractive and demonstrate the promise of microalgal technology. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.","CO2 mitigation; Economic analysis; Flue gas; Lipid production; Microalgae cultivation; Monoethanolamine (MEA) process; Power plant",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000354706

Highly reduced peridotites can be interpreted as relict from earlier lower f(O2). The f(O2) values recorded by 'fertile' and less modified spinel peridotites from Mongolia, Baikal and Tien-Shan show that the redox state of the lithosphere beneath central Asia and Tien-Shan is heterogeneous on a scale of 2-3 log units, mainly in the range between the WM and IW + 1 oxygen buffers. These data provide evidence for the presence of a lower-f(O2) regime of carbon-bearing mantle beneath the Baikal rift zone and Tien-Shan, and the oxidation of diapirs ascending from the asthenosphere. The 'dry' xenoliths from Mongolia primarily reflect closed system behavior in the upper mantle, the f(O2) of which is buffered by ferric-ferrous redox equilibrium. The observed evolution of f(O2) values is closely linked to the distribution of volatile species in the mantle. H2O and CO2 are the dominant volatiles for the more depleted and oxidized part of peridotites, and CH4 for the more reduced and less modified part. It is proposed that the upper mantle was originally more reduced and has become progressively more oxidized, resulting perhaps largely from the preferential loss of hydrogen and carbon during melting. The oxygen budget of the upper mantle results from the opposing contributions of crustal recycling and transfer of carbon-bearing material from the deep mantle. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",,"carbon; mantle; peridotite; redox conditions; upwelling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030724845

One is a low crystalline carbon, and the other is a highly crystalling carbon. The XPS spectra measured in this study suggest that the chemical compositions of the surface film formed on the highly crystalline carbon depends on the type of solvent. The carbon surface was almost bare when using propylene carbonate. On the other hand, a well-defined surface film mainly consisting of LiOH was formed in a mixed solvent of ethylene carbonate and diethyl carbonate. When the low crystalline carbon was used, the surface films formed in both electrolytes were a well-developed layer mainly consisting of LiOH. The electrochemical characteristics of these carbon materials in the two electrolytes showed that irreversible reactions were suppressed by the formation of a well-developed LiOH layer. These results suggested that such a well-developed LiOH layer formed on carbon materials has a function to suppress the irreversible reactions occurring on carbon materials during the first cathodic reduction process.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001435013

In addition to the scoping questions of when, where, and how much to reduce GHG emissions, there are also issues of how these GHG reductions are to be achieved. Methods being explored include emission caps, carbon taxes, efficiency standards, voluntary programs, and others. In the U.S., the Climate Change Action Plan is based primarily upon voluntary actions, and creates numerous partnerships between government and industry to improve energy efficiency and reduce GHG emissions in all sectors of the economy. The Plan reflects the belief that voluntary approaches are more likely to produce quicker and more cost-effective results than rigid command-and-control approaches. While the voluntary nature of the Climate Change Action Plan is an appropriate framework for the U.S., it is also in part a reflection of the political, institutional, and economic structure of the country. Other countries, having different underlying conditions, may find such a voluntary approach more or less workable. This paper compares the U.S. experience with voluntary programs to that of other countries as they also move toward longer-term GHG policies. This selected review of voluntary actions shows how voluntary programs have been a vital component of many nations' efforts to reduce GHG emissions. Additionally, by being proactive, private sector companies are demonstrating environmental stewardship and accelerating the introduction of new ideas.",,"Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Industrial emissions; International cooperation; Climate change mitigation; Air pollution control",Conference Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031374049

The CERES-Maize model, embedded in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT 3.0), was used for the crop simulations, with current and possible future management practices. Equilibrium doubled CO2 climate change scenarios were derived from the GISS, GFDL, and UKMO general circulation models (GCMs); a transient scenario was developed from the GISS GCM transient run A. These scenarios predict consistent increases in air temperature, small increases in solar radiation and precipitation changes that vary considerably over the study regions in Greece. Physiological effects of CO2 on crop growth and yield were simulated. Under present management practices, the climate change scenarios generally resulted in decreases in maize yield due to reduced duration of the growing period at all sites. Adaptation analyses showed that mitigation of climate change effects may be achieved through earlier sowing dates and the use of new maize varieties. Varieties with higher kernel-filling rates, currently restricted to the central regions, could be extended to the northern regions of Greece.

To date, these techniques do not account for severe constraints which exist for the world's boreal forest. Using composite AVHRR imagery collected over Alaska, we demonstrate how several factors influence the time-series normalized vegetation difference index (NDVI) signatures developed for the boreal forests in this region, including the effects of: (1) clouds and atmospheric haze; (2) climate variations on plant phenology; (3) fire on forest succession; and (4) forest stand patch size with respect to system resolution. Based on the analysis of AVHRR composite data from Alaska, the results of this study show: (1) clouds and haze have distinct effects on the intra-seasonal NDVI signature; (2) there are significant interseasonal variations in NDVI signatures caused by variations in the length of the growing season as well as variations in precipitation and moisture during the growing season; (3) disturbances affect large areas in interior Alaska and forest succession after fire results in significant variations in the inter-seasonal NDVI signatures; and (4) much of the landscape in interior Alaska consists of heterogeneous patches of forest which are much smaller than the resolution cell size of the AVHRR sensor, resulting in significant sub-pixel mixing. Based on these findings, the overall conclusion of this study is scientists using AVHRR to map land cover types in boreal regions must develop approaches which account for these sources of variation. © 1997 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"Forestry; Imaging techniques; Moisture; Pattern recognition; Precipitation (meteorology); Radiometers; Time series analysis; Advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR); Boreal forests; Remote sensing; AVHRR; boreal forest; composite image; forest; image analysis; NDVI; remote sensing; vegetation cover; USA, Alaska",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031180205

The well-documented urban/rural difference in lung cancer incidence and the detection of known carcinogens in the atmosphere gave rise to the hypothesis that long-term exposure to air pollution may have an effect on lung cancer risk. However, problems inherent in assessing adequately the exposure of interest led to considerable difficulties in evaluating this effect. Routinely measured air pollutants do not include, as a rule, established carcinogens, and air pollution measurements usually come from fixed-site monitors, making it difficult to estimate individual exposures, especially long-term. The nature of the exposure and associated measurement problems made ecologic comparisons a natural way to approach the study of air pollution effects on lung cancer risk. The descriptive/ecologic studies which have been undertaken after 1950 often had problems with inadequate control of confounding, but, on the whole, provided evidence compatible with the hypothesis that urban and industrial air pollution may have an effect on lung cancer risk. The results of several case-control and cohort studies are described in the present review with emphasis on the exposure metric used. These studies, which control for important potential confounders, suggest that urban air pollution may be a risk factor for lung cancer, with estimated relative risks in the order of up to about 1.5 in most situations.","Air pollution; Lung cancer","arsenic; benzo[a]pyrene; carbon monoxide; carcinogen; chromium derivative; environmental chemical; fuel; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; petroleum; sulfur dioxide; tobacco smoke; air pollution; air quality; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer risk; carcinogenicity; case control study; human; industry; long term exposure; lung cancer; monitoring; priority journal; review; risk factor; rural area; urban area; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carcinogens; Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; Confounding Factors (Epidemiology); Ecology; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Evaluation Studies; Female; Humans; Incidence; Longitudinal Studies; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Risk Factors; Rural Health; Urban Health",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030855006

Design: Analysis of time series data on daily number of deaths from all causes and concentrations of sulphur dioxide and particulate matter (measured as black smoke or particles smaller than 10 μm in diameter (PM10) and potential confounders. Setting: 12 European cities in the APHEA project (Air Pollution and Health: a European Approach). Main outcome measure: Relative risk of death. Results:In western European cities it was found that an increase of 50 μg/m3 in sulphur dioxide or black smoke was associated with a 3% (95% confidence interval 2% to 4%) increase in daily mortality and the corresponding figure for PM10 was 2% (1% to 3%). In central eastern European cities the increase in mortality associated with a 50 μg/m3 change in sulphur dioxide was 0.8% (-0.1% to 2.4%) and in black smoke 0.6% (0.1% to 1.1%). Cumulative effects of prolonged (two to four days) exposure to air pollutants resulted in estimates comparable with the one day effects. The effects of both pollutants were stronger during the summer and were mutually independent. Conclusions: The internal consistency of the results in western European cities with wide differences in climate and environmental conditions suggest that these associations may be causal. The long term health impact of these effects is uncertain, but today's relatively low levels of sulphur dioxide and particles still have detectable short term effects on health and further reductions in air pollution are advisable.",,"sulfur dioxide; air pollution; article; city; climate; environmental exposure; health; human; mortality; particulate matter; priority journal; risk; smoke; western europe; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Europe; Humans; Mortality; Particle Size; Risk Assessment; Seasons; Smoke; Sulfur Dioxide; Urban Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644325151

This type of additive-reductive carbonyl dimerization is now possible using alkoxy(alkyl)tungsten(v) complexes with aromatic, heteroaromatic, or α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. When a corresponding phenyl complex was employed in a test experiment, it was revealed that an aliphatic ketone could be used as the substrate in this reaction. A second interesting type of reaction is the transformation of CH3 ligands into μ-CH2 ligands, which occurs during the treatment of MeLi or Me3Al with molybdenum or tungsten chlorides (oxidation states VI and V, for Mo additionally IV) at low temperatures with liberation of CH4. Here, the question arises as to whether the intermediate involved has a terminal CH2 ligand (Schrock carbene complex) or a μ-CH3 ligand (CH3 bound by a two-electron three-center bond to two metal atoms). Of all the μ-CH2 complexes obtained, those which were synthesized by the action of MeLi on molybdenum chlorides can be recommended as reagents for carbonylmethylenation of aldehydes and ketones. They display high selectivity, very low basicity, a surprising resistance to protons, they are readily available, can be easily modified and, as regards their selective behavior, they have been investigated more thoroughly than other readily accessible carbonylmethylenation reagents of comparable selectivity. The results of NMR spectroscopic investigations on the structure of the μ-CH2 complexes, and associcated reaction mechanisms are discussed.

In this process, a mixed culture of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) utilizes inexpensive carbon sources, such as sewage digest or synthesis gas, to reduce FGD gypsum to hydrogen sulfide. The sulfide is then oxidized to elemental sulfur via reaction with ferric sulfate, and accumulating calcium ions are precipitated as calcium carbonate using carbon dioxide. Employing anaerobically digested municipal sewage sludge (AD-MSS) medium as a carbon source, SRBs in serum bottles demonstrated an FGD gypsum reduction rate of 8 mg/L/h (109 cells)-1. A chemostat with continuous addition of both AD-MSS media and gypsum exhibited sulfate reduction rates as high as 1.3 kg FGD gypsum/m3·d. The increased biocatalyst density afforded by cell immobilization in a columnar reactor allowed a productivity of 152 mg SO4-2/L·h or 6.6 kg FGD gypsum/m3·d. Both reactors demonstrated 100% conversion of sulfate, with 75-100% recovery of elemental sulfur and chemical oxygen demand utilization as high as 70%. Calcium carbonate was recovered from the reactor effluent on precipitation using carbon dioxide. It was demonstrated that SRBs may also use synthesis gas (CO, H2, and CO2) in the reduction of gypsum, further decreasing process costs. The formation of two marketable products - elemental sulfur and calcium carbonate - from FGD gypsum sludge, combined with the use of a low-cost carbon source and further improvements in reactor design, promises to offer an attractive alternative to the landfilling of FGD gypsum.

Surprisingly, broad substrate specificity was observed in the reaction of aminotransferases with hydrophobic substrates. The catalytic efficiency increased with an increase in the side chain length of straight or branched-terminal aliphatic substrates. The straight-chain substrates catalysed with maximal efficiency were the 7-carbon substrate in the case of AspAT and the 8-carbon substrate for AroAT and DY18. Consecutive addition of single methylene groups to the substrate had a constant effect on the stabilization energy of the transition state relative to the unbound state. The dependency of binding energy on each methylene group is usually interpreted as indicating hydrophobicity of the active site. However, we observed that AroAT and DY18 had different dependencies although both enzymes have the same residues in the substrate-binding pocket. For substrates with more than 7 carbons, the aminotransferases did not strictly distinguish between substrates with straight and branched side chains. These results suggest that the recognition of manifold hydrophobic substrates of different shapes might require not only the hydrophobicity of the active site but also enzyme flexibility.","Aromatic amino acid aminotransferase; Aspartate aminotransferase; Hydrophobic interaction; Protein dynamics; Substrate specificity","aromatic amino acid; aspartate aminotransferase; chimeric protein; article; catalysis; enzyme specificity; enzyme stability; enzyme substrate complex; Escherichia coli; hydrophobicity; molecular dynamics; molecular recognition; nonhuman; Escherichia coli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030871363

Factors accelerating corrosion were considered to be heavy metal (zinc and lead) chlorides, unburned carbon in deposits, and reduction of the gas atmosphere formed by the increase of unburned gas components and the decrease of oxygen (O2). Laboratory tests confirmed that increasing these factors increased the corrosion rate of carbon steel (CS). These tendencies were in good agreement with those in actual furnaces.

The Al/80% Ni-20% Cr spray coating maintained excellent durability for &gt; 3 years, and its effectiveness in corrosion prevention was confirmed. This coating system has been applied at seven plants. Main deterioration factors affecting the coating layer were considered to be formation of corrosion scale and a decrease in bonding strength at the boundary surface between the coating layer and base metal that resulted from penetration of corrosive gas components through blow holes in the coating layer.","Bonding strength; Coatings; Corrosion rate; Fireside corrosion; Furnaces; Heavy metal chloride; High-temperature corrosion; Incineration; Metal spray coating corrosion test; Municipal waste; Waterwall tubes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000701922

These loads often increase substantially during storms when streamflow is also increased. Another issue concerns the discharge of about 2,000 pounds per day of ammonia from the treatment plants during the early winter season, when streamflow is frequently less than the average winter flow. This study focused on the capacity of the river to assimilate oxygen-demanding loads under winter streamflow conditions during the 1992 water year, with an emphasis on peak-flow conditions in the river, as well as winter base-flow conditions during November 1992. Concentrations of dissolved oxygen throughout the main stem during the winter remained high relative to the State standard for Oregon of 6 milligrams per liter, except during periods of streamflow less than 500 cubic feet per second and temperatures greater than 10 degrees Celsius (°C). The most important factors controlling oxygen consumption during winter low-flow conditions (streamflow from 500 to 2,000 cubic feet per second) were carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand from wastewater treatment plants and tributaries, and input of oxygen-depleted waters from tributaries. In spite of increased ammonia loads, nitrification was not significant because of the cold water temperature and reduction in residence time. During peak-flow conditions (streamflow greater than 2,000 cubic feet per second), oxygen depletion was negligible; the effect of increased oxygen-demanding loads was minimized by the greatly reduced travel time and increased dilution associated with the increased streamflow. During winter low-flow conditions, the combined mean load of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand from the wastewater treatment plants was essentially equivalent to the combined mean load from the tributaries. The total mean load increased by twofold during peak-flow conditions, relative to winter low-flow conditions. This increase in carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand was exclusively from the tributaries, because the combined mean load from the wastewater treatment plants actually decreased. During the base-flow period in November 1992 (streamflow less than 300 cubic feet per second, conditions that would be expected to occur once every 3 to 4 years), concentrations of dissolved oxygen at river mile 3.4 consistently fell below 6 milligrams per liter. A hydrodynamic water-quality model was used to identify the processes depleting dissolved oxygen, including sediment oxygen demand, nitrification, and carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand. Sediment oxygen demand was the most significant sink for oxygen during this period, accounting for more than 50 percent of the oxygen demand. Nitrification was important, but not as significant, accounting for nearly 30 percent of the oxygen demand. The effect of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand, about half of which was from the wastewater treatment plants, was slight due to the low rate of in-river decay. These results suggest that further reductions in loads of carbonaceous biochemical oxygen demand from the treatment plants during the base-flow period would have little effect on oxygen concentrations in the river. Hypothetical scenarios were simulated to evaluate the effect of different loading strategies employed by the treatment plants in the basin during winter base-flow conditions. Streamflow and temperature were determined to be significant factors governing the capacity of the river to assimilate oxygen-demanding loads. For the range of loads simulated, at water temperatures between 12 to 13°C, streamflows near 350 cubic feet per second are required to maintain dissolved oxygen concentrations in the river above the State standard. When water temperatures increase to 18°C, streamflows must increase to 500 cubic feet per second to maintain concentrations above the standard.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5844305736

This study sought to reduce the uncertainty in estimates of CH4 emissions from rice cultivation in China by improving the quantification of the effects of management practices (intermittent drainage and fertilizer inputs) on emissions. These results were spatially extrapolated with digital maps of type of rice using new estimates of organic matter and fertilizer inputs, as well as estimates of soil drainage. The estimated total annual CH4 emissions from rice agriculture in China in 1990 were 9.9 ± 3.0 × 1012 g. If intermittent drainage practices were adopted on 33% of the poorly drained soils used for rice cultivation in southern China, the estimated emissions would be 8.9 ± 2.7 × 1012 g CH4 yr-1. Reducing projected organic matter inputs by 50% as a sensitivity analysis to reflect the trend for reduced use of organic fertilizer, resulted in emissions of 9.6 ± 2.9 × 1012 g CH4 yr-1, with 8.7 ± 6 × 1012 yr-1 emitted with 33% adoption of intermittent drainage on poorly drained paddies. Although intermittent drainage has been shown to reduce emissions by 50%, the area of rice that is relatively easy to drain and re-flood is not very large. The use of intermittent drainage with better drained paddies is limited because of problems with re-flooding and it is also limited with very poorly drained paddies that are difficult to drain. The 10% emission reduction predicted with 33% adoption of intermittent drainage practices, while not large, is conservative and may be possible to realize. These CH4 emissions results are relative estimates because the uncertainty remains large due to a lack of emissions measurements from paddies in more regions and a lack of detailed information about organic fertilizer application rates. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Climate and soil carbon; Factors of soil carbon pools; Soil classification; Soil organic carbon; Spatial analysis","emission reduction; methane emission; rice paddy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031411288

In this work we intended to use the UNIQUAC instead of the UNIFAC method as GE model in SRK equation of state.

For comparison of these mixing rules, the carbon dioxide binary mixtures have been chosen because carbon dioxide has numerous applications in supercritical fluid processes. The missing interaction parameters of UNIFAC and UNIQUAC were estimated through the regression of experimental vapor-liquid equilibrium data. For comparison of UNIQUAC-based mixing rules with each other, the interaction parameters of 51 carbon dioxide binary systems have been determined. Furthermore, a comparison between UNIFAC- and UNIQUAC-based SRK equation of state is presented. The results show that all of the UNIFAC- and UNIQUAC-based mixing rules, with parameters derived from VLE, can be used for reliable calculations of phase equilibrium. It is shown that the PSRK/UNIQUAC mixing rule can correlate the data for the best VLE results. Also, it is shown that the use of the second-order mixing rule in UNIQUAC-based SRK equation of state does not necessarily improve the results of VLE calculations. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.","CO2 binary systems; Cubic equations of state; GE mixing rules; UNIFAC; UNIQUAC; Vapor-liquid equilibrium","Binary mixtures; Carbon dioxide; Equations of state; High temperature properties; Mathematical models; Mixing; Group contribution method; Huron-Vidal mixing rule; Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation; Phase equilibria; carbon dioxide; equilibrium; mixing rule",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031430460

The upgraded processor calculates the magnitudes of the individual terms in the thermodynamic equation solved by the TIGCM as a function of 3-D space and model time. In a first study using the new capability, the lower thermospheric heating and cooling terms have been examined for a diurnally reproducible TIGCM run for moderate geomagnetic activity, solar maximum, December solstice conditions. Thermal terms calculated for geomagnetically quiet and active TIGCM runs have also been examined to investigate the geomagnetic activity dependence of the important nitric oxide (NO) radiational cooling term. Finally, the one-dimensional global mean model of Roble and Dickinson (1989) has been used to calculate the effects on the lower thermospheric thermal balance caused by the combination of natural and anthropogenic forcings projected over the next 30 yr. The principal results of this study of lower thermospheric energetics are as follows. (1) Lower thermospheric heating and cooling terms have complex morphological dependencies on latitude, longitude, altitude, geomagnetic activity, and season. (2) For the highest altitudes considered (∼ 175 km), heating caused by minor species chemistry plays the most important role in sunlit conditions, with direct solar EUV heating and Joule heating having secondary roles. The primary cooling terms at these altitudes are adiabatic expansion, NO cooling, and downward heat conduction. (3) At ∼ 125 km altitude, direct solar insolation and Joule heating are the most important heating terms, with compressional heating also contributing significantly in the winter hemisphere. The NO and CO2 radiational terms are roughly equal in magnitude and together dominate the cooling, with adiabatic expansion being of significance at high summer latitudes. (4) At the lowest altitudes considered (∼ 103 km), direct solar insolation, heat conduction, and adiabatic compressional effects dominate the heating. The dominant cooling term here is caused by CO2 radiation, with heat advection and adiabatic expansion in the summer hemisphere playing minor roles. (5) The important NO cooling rates can double globally for high levels of geomagnetic activity, with values at low latitudes rising from ∼160K/day to ∼400K/day at ∼150 km altitude. (6) Solar-cycle-dependent changes in NO radiational cooling and EUV heating tend to cancel each other out near ∼ 150 km altitude. In this altitude region, long-term temperature reductions caused by anthropogenic CO2 increases may become more readily measurable, owing to the smaller masking effects of solar activity variations. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Observations of target areas were made in pairs in the two wavelength ranges 1257-1293 Å and 1587-1621 Å. Spectra in the long wavelength range are dominated by emissions of the H2Lyman band system and show well separated rotational features, which we have used to determine the temperatures of the auroral emission regions. Spectra in the short wavelength range are mostly due to emission in the H2Lyman and Werner band systems, but their intensities are reduced by hydrocarbon absorption. The brightest spectral pair was observed toward an area with longitude 155° and jovicentric latitude 58° when the central meridian longitudes (CMLs) were 191° and 203°. This area was found to be bright in our previous HST observations in 1993 and in HST faint object camera images. Assuming that electron impact excitation is the major source of the jovian aurora, we estimate total emission rates in the Lyman band system of about 270 and 46 kR for the long and short wavelength spectra of the pair, respectively. The attenuation of emission rate in the short wavelength spectrum implies a methane column density of about 3 × 1016cm-2, and a temperature of about 450 K is inferred from the long wavelength spectrum of the brightest pair. For all six pairs of observed spectra, we estimate methane column densities in the range (1-7) × 1016cm-2, which, when compared to a standard mid-latitude model, corresponds to a pressure range from a few μbar to a few tens of μbar. The temperatures derived are in the range 400-850 K with a possible tendency toward lower temperatures for higher methane column densities. This tendency and the uncertainty in the temperatures derived may indicate that the temperatures increases rapidly with altitude around the methane homopause in the auroral regions. © 1997 Academic Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031185102

This research evaluated how plant phytochemical responses to enriched atmospheric CO2 are affected by the availability of soil nitrate (NO3-) and how these chemical changes, in turn, alter the performance of a tree-feeding folivore. Seedlings of three deciduous tree species - quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), red oak (Quercus rubra), and sugar maple (Acer saccharum) - were grown in ambient (355 μL/L) or elevated (650 μL/L) CO2 in combination with low (1.25 mmol/L) or high (7.5 mmol/L) soil NO3- availability. After 60 d, foliage was analyzed for changes in nutrients and allelochemicals likely to be influenced by the availability of CO2 and NO3-. Penultimate gypsy moth larvae (Lymantria dispar) were reared on foliage (aspen and maple) to determine how performance would be affected by host chemical changes. Using the framework of carbon-nutrient balance (CNB) theory, we tested three hypotheses regarding the impact of CO2 and NO3- availability on plant chemistry and insect performance: (1) nitrogen-based compounds will decrease, and carbon-based compounds will increase in response to elevated CO2 and/or low NO3-; (2) aspen will exhibit the greatest change in C:N ratios, and maple the least; and (3) phytochemical changes will influence gypsy moth performance, with larvae fed aspen being affected more than those fed maple. Concentrations of nitrogen and soluble protein decreased, whereas concentrations of starch, condensed tannins, and ellagitannins increased, in response to elevated CO2 and/or low NO3-. Responses of simple carbohydrates and phenolic glycosides were variable, however, suggesting that foliar accumulations of ""dynamic metabolites"" do not follow the predictions of CNB theory as well as do those of stable end products. With respect to Hypothesis 2, we found that absolute (net) changes in foliar C:N ratios were greatest for aspen and least for oak, whereas relative (proportional) changes were greatest for maple and least for aspen. Thus, Hypothesis 2 was only partially supported by the data. Considering Hypothesis 3, we found that elevated CO2 treatments had little effect on gypsy moth development time, growth rate, or larval mass. Larvae reared on aspen foliage grown under elevated CO2 exhibited increased consumption but decreased conversion efficiencies. Gypsy moth responses to NO3- were strongly host specific: the highest consumption and food digestibility occurred in larvae on high-NO3- aspen, whereas the fastest growth rates occurred in larvae on high-NO3- maple. In short, our results again only partially supported the predicted pattern. They indicate, however, that the magnitude of insect response elicited by resource-mediated shifts in host chemistry will depend on how levels of compounds with specific importance to insect fitness (e.g., phenolic glycosides in aspen) are affected. Overall, we observed relatively few true interactions (i.e., nonadditive) between carbon and nitrogen availability vis à vis foliar chemistry and insect performance. Tree species, however, frequently interacted with CO2 and/or NO3- availability to affect both sets of parameters. These results suggest that the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on terrestrial plant communities will not be homogeneous, but will depend on species composition and soil nutrient availability.","Acer saccharum; Carbon dioxide; Carbon-nutrient balance; Herbivory; Lymantria dispar; Nitrate; Nitrogen; Plant-insect interactions; Populus tremuloides; Quercus rubra; Resource availability; Tannins","carbon dioxide; gypsy moth; larval performance; nitrate; phytochemistry; quaking aspen; red oak; sugar maple; Acer saccharum; Aceraceae; Fagaceae; Lepidoptera; Lymantria dispar; Lymantriidae; Populus tremuloides; Quercus rubra; Salicaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030841790

The Utility Forest Carbon Management Program (UFCMP) is a voluntary initiative developed by the Edison Electric Institute, with support from 55 electric utilities, to expand utility industry efforts to manage CO2 via forestry projects, both domestic and international. With slightly over $2.4 million committed, 40 of these companies have established a non-profit corporation called the UtiliTree Carbon Company to sponsor five projects.

Historically, methane emissions from the U.S. gas industry have been based on sparse data, incorrect assumptions, or both. As a result, the estimate of the contribution these emissions make to the global methane inventory could be inaccurate. For this reason the assertion that global warming could be reduced by replacing coal and oil fuels with natural gas could not be defended. A recently completed, multi year study conducted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Research and Development and the Gas Research Institute had the objective of determining methane emissions from the U.S. gas industry with an accuracy of ± 0.5% of production. The study concluded that, in the 1992 base year, methane emissions from the industry were 314 ± 105 Bscf or 6.04 ± 2.01 Tg (all conversions to international units are made at 15.56°C and 101.325 kPa).","Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Methane emissions; U.S. natural gas industry","coal; fossil fuel; methane; natural gas; oil; emission; fossil fuel; gas industry; air pollution; article; climate; combustion; greenhouse effect; industry; united states; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Fossil Fuels; Industry; Methane; United States; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030783161

The net photosynthetic rate at saturating light and ambient CO2 (C(a)) of 35 Pa decreased with increasing leaf Mn concentrations. The carboxylation efficiency, derived from the difference in CO2 assimilation rate at intercellular CO2 pressures attained at C(a) of 13 Pa and 0 Pa, decreased with greater leaf Mn accumulation. Net photosynthetic rate at saturating light and saturating CO2 (5%) also declined with leaf Mn accumulation while the maximum quantum yield of O2 evolution at saturating CO2 was not affected. The maximum efficiency of PSII photochemistry (F(v)F(m)) was little affected by Mn accumulation in white birch leaves over a wide range of leaf Mn concentrations (2-17 mg g-1 dry weight). When measured in the steady state of photosynthesis under ambient air at 430 μmol quanta m-2 s-, the levels of photochemical quenching (qP) and the excitation capture efficiency of open PSII (F'(v)/F'(m)) declined with Mn accumulation in leaves. The present results suggest that excess Mn in leaves affects the activities of the CO2 reduction cycle rather than the potential efficiency of photochemistry, leading to increases in Q(A) reduction state and thermal energy dissipation, and a decrease in quantum yield of PSII in the steady state.","Betula platyphylla van japonica; Carboxylation efficiency; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Mn toxicity; Photosynthesis; Quantum yield; White birch","Betula platyphylla",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030769673

In spite of substantial improvements, automobile exhaust still remains one of the major sources of ozone precursors, reactive organic gases and oxides of nitrogen. One strategy for dealing with this emission source is to use fuels that have lower reactivities than conventional gasoline. Thus, a wide range of fuels (and associated vehicle technologies) have been proposed to implement this approach, including reformulated gasoline, methanol and ethanol enhanced fuels, compressed natural gas, liquid propane fuel, among others. The degree of ozone reduction expected from these fuels has only been estimated using reactivity scales which are largely based on modeling results. Further truth testing of model performance is thus required. The present project is being conducted to help validate the predicted ozone forming potential of exhaust mixtures by experimental means and to evaluate the reaction products formed during the photochemical oxidations. In this work, exhaust from vehicles operating on reformulated fuels was generated using the Federal Test Procedure. Exhaust was collected during the first 124 seconds of the FTP and was then injected into a 9,000 L Teflon irradiation chamber. Irradiations were conducted at a reactive organic gas (ROG)/NOX ratio of 5.5 to accentuate differences in hydrocarbon composition. In cases where the initial ratio was less than the target ratio, an ROG exhaust surrogate was added. The results of irradiations of exhaust mixtures from a single vehicle operated with reformulated gasoline are presented along with time series profiles for the major photochemical reaction products including ozone, nitrogen dioxide, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), nitric acid, and tertiary-butyl formate. Mechanisms for forming these products from the major exhaust precursors are also considered.",,"Acetone; Exhaust gases; Formaldehyde; Gasoline; Nitrates; Nitric acid; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Photochemical reactions; Acetaldehyde; Peroxyacetyl nitrate; Reactive organic compounds; Reformulated fuels; Atmospheric chemistry",Conference Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031380267

In addition, investigators found radon, arsenic, cadmium, iron, manganese, trihalomethanes, and several other volatile organic chemicals in the wells, but only radon and arsenic posed a significant health risk. In 1995, 16 wells were closed because chemicals were found in them. Twenty-six of 248 (10.5%) active wells and 24 of 43 (55.8%) closed wells contained multiple contaminants, excluding nitrate. Between 1988 and 1993, concentrations of trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and nitrates increased in selected wells. Daily, monthly, and bimonthly variations in the concentrations of tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, and nitrate were often considerable. Granulated activated carbon filtration reduced trichloroethylene levels in well water by 91%–95%, and the author examined its usefulness as a remedial measure.

The species-specific models characterize an individual's probability of mortality as a function of recent growth (a surrogate for whole-plant carbon balance). Interspecific comparisons of survival under low growth rates (i.e., suppression) provide a quantitative measure of the effective shade tolerance of these tree species. In particular, the more shade tolerant species exhibited more rapid decays in mortality probability with increased radial growth. The broad and continuous range in shade tolerance ranking was as follows: Thuja plicata Donn ex D. Don > Tsuga heterophylla (Raf.) Sarg. = Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt. > Picea glauca (Moench) Voss x Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carriere > Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm. > Populus tremuloides Michx. > Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa (Torr. and A. Gray) Brayshaw = Betula papyrifera Marsh. At low growth rates, mortality varied between T. plicata and B. papyrifera by more than an order of magnitude. For some species, the three replicate sites exhibited significant variation, suggesting that shade tolerance may vary with site conditions (presumably soil moisture in our study sites). The mortality models are consistent with previous qualitative categorizations into shade tolerance classes and parallel the dominance of different species in postdisturbance succession. Our results suggest that species differences in noncatastrophic mortality are critical to understanding and predicting forest dynamics.",,"aspen; balsam poplar; lodgepole pine; paper birch; sapling mortality; shade tolerance; Sitka spruce; subalpine fir; western hemlock; western red cedar; white spruce; Canada, British Columbia; Abies lasiocarpa; Betula papyrifera; Betulaceae; Picea glauca; Picea sitchensis; Pinaceae; Pinus contorta latifolia; Populus balsamifera trichocarpa; Populus tremuloides; Salicaceae; Thuja plicata; Tsuga heterophylla",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030618287

Assessments of economic possibilities and short- and medium-term mitigation measures show that the focus of forestry mitigation strategies should be to improve and promote the current carbon sequestration activities. One baseline forestry scenario and four other scenarios were developed for the period 2000-2040. Each scenario includes all forested areas but provides separate analyses of thirty ""forestry eco-regions."" Three types of forest management are included in the scenarios: clear-cut logging and reforestation, selective logging and thinning, and measures to prevent and manage fires. The baseline scenario results in a constant net sink of about 150 MtC/yr. Increasing clear-cut logging using current forestry practices will cause a rapid drop in the net sink. A modest increase in clear-cut logging together with active forest fire and selective logging measures could lead to a slight increase in the net sink. Based on these scenarios, regional forestry priorities are identified for Russia's Climate Change Action Plan. The priorities by region include: (i) creating economic mechanisms to increase forestry effectiveness in the logging areas now being cut, (ii) providing assistance for natural reforestation for the European-Ural region, (iii) promoting a forest fire protection system for Central and Northeast Siberia, and (iv) limiting clear-cut logging and creating a market for forestry efficiency in South Siberia and Primorie and Priamurie. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Carbon sequestration; Reforestation; Carbon; Climate change; Fire protection; Revegetation; Logging (forestry); carbon sequestration; environmental policy; forestry mitigation; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031084796

The protein model lias been reduced to the α-carbon trace restricted to a high coordination lattice. The sequences of model Iieteropolyiners contain two types of mers: hydropliobic/nonpolar (H) and hydrophilic/polar (P). Interactions of HH and PP pairs were assumed to be negative (weaker attractions of PP pairs) while the contact energy for HP pairs was equal to zero. All sequence-specific short-range interactions have been neglected in the present studies. It has been found that hoinopolyineric chains undergo a smooth collapse transition to a dense globular state. The globule lacks any signatures of local ordering that could be interpreted as a model of protein secondary structure. Heteropolymers with the sequences of hydrophilic and liydrophobic residues characteristic for a- and -type proteins undergo a somewhat sharper (though continuous) collapse transition to a dense globular state with elements of local ordering controlled by the sequence. The helical pattern induces more secondary structure than the -type pattern. For all examined sequences the level of local ordering was lower than the average secondary structure content of globular proteins. The results are compared with other theoretical work and with known experimental facts.

Both spark-ignition and compression-ignition engines benefit from the application of catalytic converters for the elimination of their main pollutants. Catalysts are further employed in various forms as regeneration aids in particulate filters of diesel engines. The especially demanding exhaust gas conditions prevailing in each engine application pose challenging problems to the emissions control engineer. The attainment of strict emissions regulations requires highly active and durable catalysts, as well as optimized exhaust system design and engine controls. This paper reviews the potential of catalytic systems in automobile emission control. The review covers the catalyst technology applicable in each case, the operating principles and performance characteristics, durability aspects and considerations regarding the interactions between catalyst performance and engine management. The concise presentation of related mathematical model equations provides insight into the catalytic mechanisms and the physical phenomena involved.

As with other mesothermal gold provinces, the Meguma gold deposits are well suited to such a study because carbonate is the next most abundant phase after quartz in these mesothermal lode gold deposits. All vein types have been sampled for quartz and carbonate and, in addition, all compositional and textural varieties of carbonate have been sampled. Vein quartz is of uniform isotopic composition with most δ 18O values between 10.2 to 17.6 per mil (avg ca. 14‰), except for one deposit (West Gore Sb-Au) where values go to 19.4 per mil. There is no systematic variation for quartz within a deposit or position within the Meguma Group stratigraphy. Vein carbonate δ 18O values range from 11.8 to 27.5 per mil, with most in the 13 to 16 per mil range. The relatively 18O-enriched carbonates reflect exchange with low-temperature fluids based on analyses of quartz-carbonate pairs that indicate disequilibrium fractionation (Δ quartz-carbonate ≤ 0); this is best illustrated by the strong negative correlation between δ 18O carbonate and Δ quartz-carbonate. The δ 18O water is estimated at 10 ± 3 per mil for a temperature of vein formation of 350° to 400°C and using the appropriate mineral-water fractionation equations. Whereas δ 18O water values partly overlap the field for magmatic fluids, the values are wholly consistent with a metamorphic fluid, and it is considered unlikely that a primary magmatic fluid signature has been substantially modified due to wall-rock influences given that mesothermal gold systems are sites of high fluid/rock ratios. Vein carbonate has δ 13C values of -13.1 to -25.9 per mil, but a slight negative correlation between δ 13C carbonate and Δ quartz-carbonate suggests that the primary values lie in the range -20 to -25 per mil. Thus, the Δ 13C values indicate a reduced, biogenic source for the carbon. Oxidation of the reduced carbon, as indicated by CO 2 in fluid inclusions, may have occurred via hydrolysis of graphite or dissolution of carbonate minerals, both of which occur in the wall-rock lithologies of the Meguma Group, the latter of which has the appropriate isotopic composition. The initial 87Sr/ 86Sr of the vein fluid, estimated from the analyses of 52 vein carbonates (17 deposits) and four tourmalines (three deposits), ranges from 0.70118 to 0.72284 and within deposits considerable variation is observed. There is insufficient data to quantify the extent of the low-temperature overprint which has modified the C and O isotope data, although it is likely that some influence is present. Nevertheless, the data cannot be reconciled by a source confined exclusively to the Meguma Group, which suggests, therefore, involvement of another reservoir(s). The isotopic heterogeneity can be explained by variable amounts of contamination of a primary fluid with radiogenic Sr derived from Meguma Group lithologies by interaction along the fluid path or at the site of vein formation concomitant with wall-rock alteration; as discussed above, a dominantly magmatic source is not considered feasible. This fluid source is suggested to be within the structural basement to the Meguma Group, and the Liscomb gneisses are the favored source based on the combined results of the Sr isotope data presented herein and previously published Pb isotope data. Collectively, the data indicate that a primary fluid of metamorphic origin has had its isotopic signature variably modified due to interaction with different reservoirs. The most affected isotopic systems are C and S (based on earlier work on δ 34S values) which are abundant as graphite carbonate and sulfides in the Meguma wall rock, respectively. The range in 87Sr/ 86Sr values of the fluid also reflects contamination, but this was quite variable. The uniform δ 18O water value for the fluid indicates that this was the least affected isotopic system, except for the later exchange of carbonate at low temperatures.",,"carbon; gold; isotopic composition; mineralization; mineralizing fluid; oxygen; strontium; Canada, Nova Scotia, Meguma Terrane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031442849

In the U.S., building energy consumption accounts for nearly one third of total primary energy consumption and related greenhouse gas emissions. The cost for these energy services, or end-uses, was over $200 billion in 1997. This paper summarizes a detailed assessment of the achievable cost-effective potential for reducing carbon dioxide emissions in 2010 in the U.S. residential and commercial buildings sector based on the preliminary results of a study completed by the authors for the U.S. Department of Energy (LBNL, ORNL, ANL, NREL, and PNNL, 1997) Our analysis shows that substantial reductions in future greenhouse gas emissions can be realized through the use of more energy-efficient technologies and processes at a net reduction in the total cost of energy services. In an efficiency scenario, in which renewed efforts are undertaken to promote energy efficiency through enhanced public and private-sector R&D and market transformation activities, energy use drops by 1.9 quadrillion Btu (5%) from business-as-usual (BAU) levels and carbon emissions decline by 25 MtC (4%) from BAU forecasted levels. This represents a savings of $18 billion in fuel costs in 2010, which is purchased with an annualized incremental cost of $7 billion in efficiency improvements. In a high efficiency/low carbon scenario, which reflects an even greater commitment to reduce carbon emissions, results in 4.0 quads (11%) less energy use and 91 MtC (16%) fewer carbon emissions than the BAU scenario in 2010. This high efficiency/low carbon scenario represents a savings of $33 billion in fuel costs in 2010 resulting from an annualized incremental expenditure of $14 billion on efficiency improvements.",,"Apartment houses; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Office buildings; Technology; Carbon dioxide emission; Emission reduction; Greenhouse gas; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031363920

This presents a particular threat to the accessibility and quality of life of urban areas. Motorways are gradually grinding to a halt and hoards of commuters face the daily ritual of kilometre-long traffic jams. When the public debate on transport and the environment was at its most vocal at the end of the 1980s and increasing calls were being made to accord public transport a greater role, NS presented its plans for the future, Rail 21 and Rail 21 Cargo. At the heart of these plans lies a major product improvement that is to pave the way for a growth in rail transport. The plans are in tune with government policy on this matter which aims to stimulate public transport and discourage the use of cars. In order to put Rail 21 and Rail 21 Cargo into effect, Dutch railway infrastructure is undergoing a significant expansion between 1990 and 2010 with additional tracks being laid and new rail routes and fly-overs constructed. NS Railinfrabeheer (=NS Rail Infrastructure)is the body responsible for carrying out this task. In a country as densely populated as the Netherlands, a considerable amount of time is required to plan and construct new infrastructure. This is because any expansions in railway infrastructure have to comply with the framework of environmental legislation in force. Although there is unanimity on the fact that train transport is more environmentally friendly than road transport, new infrastructure plans always encounter a barrage of public resistance. One of the major reasons for this hostility is the fear of noise pollution. NS Railinfrabeheer has therefore drawn up its own environmental policy that is geared towards sustainable business management. One of the spearheads of this is the reduction of noise emissions in stations and on the open track.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5844366588

Chemical composition with an emphasis on concentrations and deposition rates of nutrients were evaluated on seasonal, annual, and long-term basis. Long-range transport dominated the atmospheric deposition at site I, whereas local sources were relatively more important at site II. The average annual bulk deposition rates were 10 and 14 kg ha-1 for total nitrogen (TN), 0.15 and 0.24 kg ha-1 for total phosphorus (TP), and 17 and 20 kg ha-1 for organic carbon at sites I and II, respectively. NH4-N was the major component of TN (&gt; 40%), NO3-N represented ~ 35%, and organic nitrogen contributed by ~ 23% to the TN deposition. Concentrations and deposition rates of nutrients showed pronounced annual cycles; concentrations reached the maximum values in late winter and early spring, deposition rates from April to August. These cycles are explained by the seasonality of both precipitation and nutrient sources (agriculture, residential heating sources, pollen, soil dust). The concentrations and/or deposition rates of NH4-N and NO3-N doubled and more than tripled, respectively, in the Czech Republic between 1958 and the mid-1980s. The concentrations and deposition rates of sulphate decreased at site I already in the 1980s, probably as a result of the general trend of decreasing sulphur emission in Europe, while this trend was surpassed by local sources at site II. However, a sharp decline in both N and S concentrations and deposition rates occurred in the early 1990s, due to the reduced emissions of ammonia, NO(x), and SO2, in Central European post-communist countries after the 1989 political and economical changes.","Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Phosphorus; Precipitation chemistry","carbon; nitrogen; phosphorus; sulfur; air sampling; article; czech republic; dry deposition; europe; pollution transport; precipitation; priority journal; seasonal variation; Ammonia; Atmospheric composition; Carbon; Chemical analysis; Chemical bonds; Climatology; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Sampling; Sulfur compounds; Nutrient deposition rates; Air pollution; atmospheric deposition; nitrogen; organic carbon; phosphorus; precipitation quality; seasonal variation; wet deposition; Czech Republic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030617215

Plant P., Karl-Liebknecht-Straße 25, 14476 Golm, Germany","Altering stomatal function by a guard cell-targeted transgenic approach with the aim of increased stress tolerance and crop yield requires knowledge of the natural fluctuations of stomatal gene expression under stress conditions. We developed a fast method for the isolation of RNA from epidermal fragments of potato leaves (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Desiree), demonstrated that this RNA preparation is highly enriched in guard cell transcripts and used this method to investigate the response of gene expression in guard cells to mild drought stress. Drought was applied in planta by withholding water over a period of 2-4 days. In the following work responses observed under these conditions are called 'long-term' in contrast to immediate (short-term) stomatal opening and closing responses to environmental stress. We observed both gene-specific increases and decreases of steady-state transcript levels. In particular, the mRNA levels of sucrose synthase and sucrose-phosphate synthase were elevated 5.5-fold and 1.4-fold, respectively. In contrast, expression of an inwardly rectifying K+ channel from guard cells (kst1) and of a plasma membrane H+-ATPase (pha2) was reduced to 26% and 36%, respectively, of the expression in watered controls. In addition, expression of vacuolar invertase, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (large subunit), cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a sucrose/H+ cotransporter, and a novel isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase were also reduced. Other genes exhibited unaltered expression. Compared with the response in whole leaves, the transcript levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, vacuolar invertase, and cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were regulated guard cell specifically. Most importantly, changes in steady-state transcript levels were complete before the onset of a decrease in leaf water potential, when drought-induced stomatal closure was already obvious. These data support the hypothesis that a systematic drought-stress signal acts not only on short-term stomatal movements but also on long-term gene expression in guard cells. Such long-term changes in gene expression might contribute to the fine-tuning of guard cell responses to environmental stimuli.",,"carbon; complementary DNA; plant RNA; water; article; cytology; gene; gene expression regulation; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; molecular genetics; potato; transgenic plant; Carbon; DNA, Complementary; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Molecular Sequence Data; Plants, Genetically Modified; RNA, Plant; Solanum tuberosum; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031127339

Some plots received mineral fertilizer at a rate of N-deposition commonly measured in low altitude parts of Europe. Here we present a summary of results and data from the final harvest. Above-ground biomass measured after the completion of growth in the fourth season of treatment was not affected by CO2 enrichment as was found by previous biometric estimates, but mean below-ground biomass was slightly stimulated (+ 12%, n.s.). In contrast, net CO2 uptake per unit land area was strongly stimulated by CO2 enrichment at the beginning of the experiment, and during the early part of each season. However, the CO2 stimulation decreased during the later part of each growing season. By year four, also mid-season differences in CO2 uptake per unit land area had disappeared. Neither microbial biomass, soil respiration in the laboratory, nor in situ land-area-based CO2 evolution during the 10 week growing season increased under elevated CO2. The total biomass N-pool and free soil nitrate and ammonium (capture by ion exchange resin bags) remained unaffected, whereas leaf nitrogen concentration was reduced and nonstructural carbohydrate concentration increased under elevated CO2 in forbs. These differences in tissue composition largely disappeared during senescence and litter formation. Despite low CO2 responsiveness at ecosystem level, species responses differed in terms of nitrogen, carbohydrates, tillering and flowering, suggesting the possibility for long-term changes in community structure. Addition of NPK equivalent to 40 kg N ha-1 a-1 had massive effects on all plant traits studied, but did not enable stimulated growth under CO2 enrichment. However, when fertilizer and CO2 enrichment were provided jointly, soil microbes were stimulated, indicating a co-limitation by carbon and nutrients (most likely nitrogen). Since responses to elevated CO2 were absent in both warm and cold growing seasons, we conclude that this late successional plant community is carbon saturated at current atmospheric CO2 concentrations for reasons not directly related to nutrient supply and climate. Perhaps, contrary to our expectation, evolutionary adjustments of this 'old' ecosystem to the life conditions at high altitudes caused carbon to become a surplus resource today.","Alps; Biodiversity; Biomass production; Carbohydrates; Ecosystem physiology; Elevated carbon dioxide; Herbivory; Mycorrhiza; Nitrogen; Photosynthesis; Respiration; Soil micro-organisms","aboveground biomass; alpine grassland; belowground biomass; carbon dioxide enrichment; grassland; microbial biomass; soil; Alps; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030753548

To avoid this drawback the technology of laser gas-powder cladding (LGPC) is proposed which includes the action of CW CO2 laser radiation, electric arc and variable magnetic field on material. Electric arc creates current in melt and is considered as additional source of energy. The variable magnetic field interacting with current in melt provides the electromagnetic agitation (EMA) of melt. Thus the hydrodynamic processes in melt are the superposition of thermo-capillary process that is typical for LGPC, EMA and electric arc pressure. The coating of self fluxing powder on Ni base on carbon steel has been gotten. The study revealed that proposed technology allows to avoid completely the formation both the hot and cold cracks. The former is explained by reduction of temperature ductility interval (TDI) of cladded alloy, by the increase of its plasticity in TDI and by reduction of thermal tensile stresses. The second is connected with absence of stress concentrators in coating and formation of compressed stresses in the layer. It is shown that the character of the stressed state depends on EMA parameters (arc current and value of magnetic induction).",,"Carbon dioxide lasers; Carbon steel; Continuous wave lasers; Crack propagation; Electric arcs; Electric currents; Electromagnetic field effects; Hydrodynamics; Laser applications; Nickel; Powder coatings; Thermoanalysis; Electromagnetic agitation (EMA); Laser gas powder cladding (LGPC); Temperature ductility intervals (TDI); Cladding (coating)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031368571

Proper design of the burner reduces NOx emissions by moderating the flame temperature with furnace gas recirculation.

The purpose of this paper is to couple these issues in consistent, integrated scenarios, using the IMAGE 2.0 model as an integrating tool. Scenarios of gradual stabilization of atmospheric CO2 at 350 and 450 ppm are compared to a baseline of no policy action in which CO2 concentration increases to 777 ppm. Under the stabilizaton scenarios substantially smaller areas of wheat and millet, as well as nature reserves, are threatened by climate change, especially in temperate regions. The amount of sea level rise is also reduced under the stabilization scenarios. However, climate continues to change under the stabilization scenarios and therefore some 'residual' climate impacts occur. Hence the integrated scenarios indicate that stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations at or slightly above current levels will lessen impacts as compared to baseline levels, but not eliminate them. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate convention; Crop production; Greenhouse gas emissions; Impact indicators; Natural vegetation; Sea level rise; Stabilization of greenhouse gases",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2142752635

Such a response could increase belowground C allocation, particularly in trees with an indeterminate growth pattern such as Populus tremuloides. Rooted cuttings of P. tremuloides were grown in ambient and twice ambient (elevated) CO2 and in low and high soil N availability (89 ± 7 and 333 ± 16 ng N g-1 day -1 net mineralization, respectively) for 95 days using open-top chambers and open-bottom root boxes. Elevated CO2 resulted in significantly higher maximum leaf photosynthesis (A(max)) at both soil N levels. A(max) was higher at high N than at low N soil in elevated, but not ambient CO2. Photosynthetic N use efficiency was higher at elevated than ambient CO2 in both soil types. Elevated CO2 resulted in proportionally higher whole leaf A in the lower three-quarters to one-half of the crown for both soil types. At elevated CO2 and high N availability, lower crown leaves had significantly lower ratios of carboxylation capacity to electron transport capacity (V(c)(max)/J(max)) than at ambient CO2 and/or low N availability. From the top to the bottom of the tree crowns, V(c)(max)/J(max) increased in ambient CO2, but it decreased in elevated CO2 indicating a greater relative investment of N into light harvesting for the lower crown. Only the mid-crown leaves at both N levels exhibited photosynthetic down regulation to elevated CO2. Stem biomass segments (consisting of three nodes and internodes) were compared to the total A(leaf) for each segment. This analysis indicated that increased A(leaf) at elevated CO2 did not result in a proportional increase in local stem segment mass, suggesting that C allocation to sinks other than the local stem segment increased disproportionally. Since C allocated to roots in young Populus trees is primarily assimilated by leaves in the lower crown, the results of this study suggest a mechanism by which C allocation to roots in young trees may increase in elevated CO2.","Carbon allocation; Elevated CO2; Nitrogen; Photosynthesis; Populus tremuloides","Populus tremuloides; Populus tremuloides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030934638

Simulations were performed using 1987 emission data and meteorological data released by the California Air Resources Board. Exhaust emission data at TLEV, LEV and ZEV levels were used in the analysis. The results show that a reduction in reactive organic gases (ROG) has a large effect on reducing the ozone concentration. The ozone reduction effects of alternative fuels like methanol or compressed natural gas can also be analyzed at the same stage as exhaust emissions from conventional gasoline vehicles by applying the maximum incremental reactivity index to correct measured ROG data. The ROG/NO(x) ratio at the time of peak ozone concentration correlates well with the ozone level, suggesting that a reduction in NO(x) emissions does not always lower the ozone concentration.","Low-emission vehicles; Ozone; Simulation model","methanol; natural gas; nitrogen oxide; ozone; air quality; article; exhaust gas; meteorology; model; priority journal; simulation; United States; Air pollution; Exhaust gases; Ground vehicles; Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone layer; Low emission vehicles; Reactive organic gases; Air quality; air; emissions; simulation; vehicles; air pollution; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission; low emissions vehicle; modelling approach; ozone; simulation model; vehicle; vehicle emissions; USA, California",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030617365

Selection of appropriate cover crops to increase SOC requires an adequate knowledge of the quality and quantity of plant biomass produced and its rate of decomposition in soil. This study examined the SOC and carbohydrate concentrations in soil as affected by several leguminous and nonleguminous cover crops after 6 yr of a corn (Zea mays L.) cover crop double cropping system in a temperate, humid region. The vegetation in the control treatment without cover crops was primarily shepherd's-purse [Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medikus]. The cover crops had a variable effect on SOC and soil carbohydrate concentrations due to a significant difference in total organic C and carbohydrate produced by the cover crops. The buried bag technique showed that the biomass C from the aboveground biomass of the cover crops decomposed rapidly in the soil with a half-life averaging 30.9 ± 9.4 (SD) d in 1992 and 55.2 ± 7.8 (SD) d in 1993. The decomposition of carbohydrate in the aboveground biomass in the soil was also rapid with an average half-life of 40.0 ± 13.1 (SD) d in 1992 and 50.5 ± 11.8 (SD) d in 1993. The overriding cover crop effect on SOC and carbohydrate was due to the magnitude of the C inputs from the cover crops. With more than 4 Mg ha-1 of top biomass, cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) and annual ryegrass (Lolium multifiorum Lam.) were better suited as winter cover crops for building SOC levels in this region than Austrian winter pea (Lathyrus hirsutus L.), hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), and canola (Brassica napus L.).",,"Brassica; Brassica napus var. napus; Capsella bursa pastoris; Lathyrus; Lathyrus hirsutus; Lolium; Lolium multiflorum; Phaseolus (angiosperm); Pisum sativum; Secale cereale; Sinapis arvensis; Vicia villosa; Villosa; Zea mays; Biomass; Carbohydrates; Carbon; Composition; Crops; Cultivation; Decay (organic); Decomposition; Reaction kinetics; Annual ryegrass; Buried bag technique; Cereal rye; Corn; Humid region; Soil organic carbon; Tillage; Winter cover crops; Soils; carbohydrate; cover crop; macroaggregate; organic carbon; organic matter; soil fertility; Austria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030614192

In case of homogeneous accretion, volatiles contained in each planetesimal are likely subjected to partitioning among gas, silicate melt, and molten metallic iron at significantly high temperatures and pressures in such a massive molten region. Each phase would subsequently form the proto-atmosphere, -mantle, or -core, respectively. Such chemical reprocessing of H and C associated with core formation, which is followed by both degassing from mantle and atmospheric escape, may result in a diverse range of H2O/CO2 in planetary surface environments, which mainly depends on the H and C content relative to metallic iron in planetary building stones. This may explain inferred difference in volatile distribution between the Earth's (relatively H2O-rich, CO2-poor) and the martian (H2O-poor, CO2-rich) surface environments. Such volatile redistribution may be systematically described by using the retentivity of H2O, ξ, defined as follows: ξ = 1 - ([CO]0 + 2[CH4]0 + 2[C(gr)]0)/[H2O]0, where [i]0 represents mol number of species i partitioned into non-metallic phases, that is, gas and silicate melt in impact-induced molten region. When ξ &gt; 0.5, relatively H2O-rich and CO2-poor surface environment may eventually evolve, although a small portion of H2O partitioned into the non-metallic phases are possibly consumed by subsequent chemical reactions with reduced C-species with producing CO2 and H2. When ξ &lt; 0.5, on the contrary, H2O consumption by the above reactions and selective loss of H2 to space may result in relative H2O-depleted and CO2-rich surface environment. Given the building stone composition by the two-component model by Ringwood (1977) and Wänke (1981), ξ is found to decrease with increasing the mixing fraction of the volatile-rich component: ξ &gt; 0.5 for the mixing fraction smaller than about 15-20% and, ξ &lt; O for the mixing fraction larger than about 20-30%. This is not significantly dependent on temperature and pressure in molten region and H/C ratio in the building stone. The estimated mixing fraction of the volatile-rich component, about 10% for the Earth and 35% for Mars, is consistent with the observed difference in volatile distribution between the surfaces of both planets. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",,"accretion; atmospheric escape; carbon; core formation; degassing; hydrogen; planetary formation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030779376

About 400 ha of a mixed oak - pine forest burned in the summer of 1983 and part of it also suffered from a repeat fire in the summer of 1989. Different trends for each parameter and for each slope aspect (north and south) were observed indicating different fire intensities and frequencies, and different physical conditions characterizing each of the slope aspects. Species richness on the northern slope was the highest 2-4 years after fire followed by a decrease with time elapsed since fire. A recurrent fire on the southern slope caused a decrease in species richness two years after fire, which increased a year later to the level observed in the unburned forest. Species diversity, however, increased after fire on both aspects, reaching lower values 10 years later and then increased again, but still to values lower than those obtained 2-4 years after fire. The rate of change is higher on the southern slope than that on the northern one.

Planar and single-photon emission tomographic (SPET) data from 40 patients (41 studies) imaged with both a single- and a dual-isotope protocol were analyzed. Rest injected 201Tl (pure-Tl) images were acquired using 20% windows at 70 and 166 keV about 15 min after the 201Tl injection. Patients were then stressed, and at peak stress 99mTc-sestamibi was injected. About 30 min later 99mTc data were recorded with a 20% window center at 140 keV, and simultaneous 201Tl (dual-Tl) data were recorded with a single 20% window centered at 80 keV. Total myocardial counts based on SPET data in the dual-Tl images were increased by 18.61% ± 2.91% (SEM) (range: -12.8% to 84.1%) compared to pure-Tl images. Region of interest analysis revealed the greater increase in counts in the apical region and the least in the lateral wall. Pure Tl and dual-Tl images were visually evaluated for image quality (IQ) on a five-point scale (0 = unacceptable to 4 = excellent). Dual-Tl IQ was lower than that of pure-Tl in 61% of cases, and similar in 37% (12% of the pure-Tl and 41% of the dual-Tl images fell into the 0 and 1 categories). Thallium perfusion abnormalities were of similar extent in 70% of segments, less severe in 18%, and more severe in 12%. There was an inverse correlation with patient weight, such that patients weighing more than 180 lbs had substantially worse images than those below this cutoff value. While dual-tracer images are of lower quality, they are interpretable if the patient is not severely overweight.","Dual isotope; Myocardial perfusion; Simultaneous acquisition; Technetium-99m sestamibi; Thallium-201","isotope; methoxy isobutyl isonitrile technetium tc 99m; article; blood rheology; body weight; clinical article; controlled study; exercise test; heart muscle perfusion; human; image analysis; image quality; intermethod comparison; rating scale; rest; single photon emission computer tomography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030898552

The approach uses the shape of the phytoplankton absorption spectrum and the initial slope of the photosynthesis-irradiance curve, determined in board-band illumination. This method assumes that the shape of the absorption spectrum is similar to that of the corresponding action spectrum, when non- photosynthetic pigments are absent, or negligible. The method was tested by constructing action spectra at different stations sampled across the North Atlantic, in five biogeochemical provinces. To assess the performance of the method, the constructed action spectra were compared with the results of measurements made at the same stations. The agreement between the measured and the constructed action spectra was good. Both the measured and constructed action spectra were partitioned into their respective provinces. In each province, a representative spectrum was estimated as the average of all the action spectra measured in the province. Again, the agreement between measured and constructed action spectra was good. It is concluded that the simplified procedure developed here provides an efficient way of estimating the photosynthetic action spectrum for natural phytoplankton populations, and could be used in the computation of primary production at local or large spatial scales. ©2005 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Absorption spectrum; Action spectrum; Biogeochemical provinces; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Primary production","Absorption; Absorption spectra; Algae control; Biogeochemistry; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Energy absorption; Forestry; Light absorption; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Spectrum analysis; Action spectrum; Band illuminations; Biogeochemical provinces; Conventional methods; North atlantic; Photosynthetic pigments; Primary production; Simplified procedures; Spatial scales; Absorption spectroscopy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58049146766

Visual transduction in vertebrate rod outer segments is initiated by photon capture by the rhodopsin chromophore, triggering a series of changes characterized by changes in the visible absorption spectrum of rhodopsin Structural changes in the rod outer segment (ROS) membranes resulting from the bleaching cascade were examined by infrared spectroscopy Methods. The integrity and purity of ROS, disk and plasma membranes preparations were confirmed using SDS-page, Western blot, FTIR, UV-spectroscopy and biochemical assays. Membranes samples were bleached with light from a Tungsten lamp. Results. A change in the intensity and frequency of the protein amide A band (likely coupled with hydroxyl groups) upon light-exposure in the membranes studied indicate the sensitivity of this band to conformational changes induced by the phototransduction process. Analysis of the amide I, II and III bands indicate no major secondary structural change in protein conformation suggesting that only tertiary or quaternary changes take place upon bleaching Perturbation of the acyl chain bands indicate that changes in the phospholipid environment is a secondary event in the rhodopsin photocascade. Prolonged exposure to light (-30 hrs or more) essentially introduced irreversible changes in membrane fluidity and hydrocarbon order similar to those observed in conditions of retinal dystrophy or oxidative stress. Conclusions. Infrared spectroscopy showed changes in protein conformation that could be important in the meta II-III transition state of the bleaching process.

Organic carbon flux data normalised to a depth of 2000 m exhibits a range of an order of magnitude in areas outside the polar domains (0.38 to 4.2 g/m2/y). In polar regions the range is wider (0.01-5.9 g/m2/y). Latitudinal trends are not apparent for most components of the flux although calcite flux exhibits a poleward decrease. Limited data from polar regions show fluxes of opaline silica not significantly higher than elsewhere. The variability of flux over annual cycles was calculated and expressed as a Flux Stability Index (FSI) and the relationship between this and vertical flux of material examined. Somewhat surprisingly there is no significant relationship between FSI and fluxes of dry mass, organic carbon, inorganic carbon or opaline silica. At each site, net annual primary production was determined using published satellite derived estimates. There is a negative but weak relationship between FSI and the proportion of primary production exported to 2000 m (e2000 ratio). The most variable of the non-polar environments export to 2000 m about twice as much of the primary production as the most stable ones. Polar environments have very low e2000 ratios with no apparent relationship to FSI. At primary production levels below 200 g C/m2/y there is a positive correlation between production and organic carbon flux at 2000 m but above this level, flux remains constant at about 3.5 g C/m2/y. A curve derived to describe this relationship was applied to estimates of annual primary production in each of 34 of the open ocean biogeochemical provinces proposed by Longhurst et al. (1995). Globally, open ocean flux of organic carbon at 2000 m is 0.34 Gt/yr which is 1% of the total net primary production in these regions. This flux is nearly equally divided between the Atlantic, Pacific and Southern Oceans. The Indian and Arctic oceans between them only contribute 5% to the total. The eight planktonic climatological categories proposed by Longhurst (1995) provide a most useful means of examining the data on flux and its variability. A characteristic level of FSI was found in each category with highest levels in the tropics and lowest levels in the Antarctic. There is also a characteristic level of export ratio in each category with the highest in mensoonal environments (1.7%) and the lowest in Antarctica (0.1%).",,"deep sea sediment; deep water; particle flux; particulate flux; primary production; regional/temporal variations; seasonal variation; suspended sediment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030826811

Design: Prospective, consecutive study. Setting: 12 intensive care units in six towns in Northern Bavaria. Patients and participants: A total of 55 apnoea tests were performed on 55 consecutive patients as part of the determination of brain death, 27 without and 28 with CO2 augmentation. Interventions: Apnoea tests following oxygenation with 100% O2 either after reduction of ventilatory volume (A) or after insufflation of CO2 during normoventilation (B). In each case, an arterial partial CO2 pressure of at least 8 kPa was documented. Results: All apnoea tests were without serious adverse effects (hypoxia, newly induced cardiac arrhythmia, cardiac asystole). An increased dopamine infusion rate was deemed necessary in only one case of group (A) because of marked systolic hypotension (&lt; 8 kPa). Individual variation of systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) did not exceed + 62 to -46% and + 49 to 52% respectively, in group (A) and + 35 to -57% and + 40 to -48% respectively, in group (B).

In contrast to forcing with prescribed fluxes, the bulk forcing utilizes the evolving model sea surface temperatures and monthly atmospheric fields based on reanalyses by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and on satellite data products. The vertical mixing in the oceanic boundary layer is governed by a nonlocal K-profile parameterization (KPP) and is matched to parameterizations of mixing in the interior. The KPP scheme is designed to represent well both convective and wind-driven entrainment. The near-equilibrium solutions are compared to a baseline experiment in which the surface tracers are strongly restored everywhere to climatology and the vertical mixing is conventional with constant coefficients, except where there is either convective or near-surface enhancement. The most profound effects are due to the bulk forcing boundary conditions, while KPP mixing has little effect on the annual-mean state of the ocean model below the upper few hundred meters. Compared to restoring boundary conditions, bulk forcing produces poleward heat and salt transports in better agreement with most oceanographic estimates and maintains the abyssal salinity and temperature closer to observations. The KPP scheme produces mixed layers and boundary layers with realistically large temporal and spatial variability. In addition, it allows for more near-surface vertical shear, particularly in the equatorial regions, and results in enhanced large-scale surface divergence and convergence. Generally, topographic effects are confined locally, with some important consequences. For example, realistic ocean bottom topography between Greenland and Europe locks the position of the sinking branch of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation to the Icelandic Ridge. The model solutions are especially sensitive to the under-ice boundary conditions where model tracers are strongly restored to climatology in all cases. In particular, a factor of 4 reduction in the strength of under-ice restoring diminishes the abyssal salinity improvements by about 30%.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001413417

Many macroeconomic studies, based on both global and national models, have been made of how emissions can be reduced with the help of taxes and the consequent reduction in GDP following the introduction of such taxes. Norway has had a CO2 tax for five years, thereby providing a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of this tax on emissions. The paper provides a counterfactual analysis of energy consumption and emissions if no CO2 taxes had been introduced, compared with the actual situation in which such taxes exist. The effect of a CO2 tax on oil consumption, and thus CO2 emissions, is studied on the basis of partial economic models for various sectors of the Norwegian economy.

This report aims to assist policy makers in the design and implementation of policies, monitoring and management tools to restore air quality in Mumbai (Bombay), India's financial and commercial capital. Annual average TSP concentration has increased about 50 percent from 1981 to 1990, to reach 270 μg/m3. World Health Organization (WHO) and national guidelines for PM10 are frequently and substantially exceeded in Mumbai; 97 percent of the population lives in areas where the WHO air quality guideline for particulate is exceeded. Studies point to the resulting health effects - more cases of colds, chronic bronchitis, asthma and general decline in lung function. Using dose-response equations developed in the United States, this report estimates that air pollution causes 2,800 cases of excess mortality, 60 million respiratory symptom days, and 19 million restricted activity days, at a total cost of Rs.18 billion per year. Applying the essential components of an air quality management system to the problem in Mumbai, this report suggests an action plan containing abatement measures for the short, medium and long terms. Recommended actions fall under two categories - institutional and technical. A single institution with a clear mandate and sufficient resources should be made responsible for air quality management in Mumbai. In addition, capabilities for data gathering and processing should be improved throughout the city. Technically, it is crucial that clean vehicle standards be established and strictly enforced. The switch from dirty to clean fuel, including to unleaded gasoline and low-sulfur diesel, should be completed. Another option for clean vehicles is the introduction of LPG- and CNG-powered vehicles. The use of low-smoke lubrication oil for 2-stroke engines is also an important policy measure. Gross polluters should be identified and penalized. In addition, general traffic management would reduce congestion and pollution. Awareness raising through public and private organizations including educational institutions is key to bringing about policy change on matters of air pollution.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883847429

The measurement technique, developed at Washington State University, enables emission rates to be determined from analyses of 'breath' samples collected while grazing. More than 250 measurements of daily methane emission from 50 sheep (8 months old) were made, with flock-mean emission 18.9 ± 0.8 g hd-1 d-1. Although emissions were weakly correlated with feed intake, they represented a 4.6 ± 0.1% average loss of gross dietary energy. The corresponding mean emission based on 40 measurements of daily emissions from 10 lactating dairy cows was 263 ± 10 g hd-1 d-1, approximately 6.2% of estimated gross energy intake. A notable feature was the large inter-sheep variability in daily methane emission (factor of 1.4 range) that could not be attributed to variable intake. This would appear to suggest an appreciable diversity of methanogenetic response to digestion, and may be significant in the search for strategies to control emissions of this greenhouse gas.","Emission measurements; Grazing livestock; Greenhouse gas; Ruminant methane; Tracer technique","Greenhouse gases; Air pollution control; Greenhouse effect; Methane; Particulate emissions; methane; emission; grazing pasture; livestock; methane; air pollution control; article; bovids; breath analysis; caloric intake; cattle; digestion; methanogenesis; new zealand; nonhuman; priority journal; sheep; New Zealand; Bos taurus; Bovidae; Ovis aries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031238507

We present a high-resolution record from northwest Argentina in which the δ13C values of soil carbonate rise above a threshold of -8‰, suggesting the presence of C4 plants, starting at 7.3-6.7 Ma. δ13C values of fossil teeth from well dated sections in South and North America display a concomitant increase of C4 plants in the diets of large herbivores. These results show that the late Miocene expansion of C4 plants was global, but occurred at different rates in each region. While it is has been suggested that declining pCO2 levels during the late Neogene caused C4 plant expansion, climate change, such as an increase in summer-dominated rainfall regimes globally, is an alternative explanation. The δ18O soil carbonate records from South Asia, East Africa and now also northwest Argentina all show an increase of at least 3-4‰ in the late Neogene, either the result of climate change or of greater evaporation in average grassland soils.","C-13/C-12; Miocene; Paleoclimatology; Paleosols; Teeth; Vegetation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002200077

Organic aerosols are particularly important in western areas of the United States and contribute roughly equally with sulfate aerosols and dust in the total extinction budget. Potential visibility enhancement resulting from various future energy management options that reduce volatile organic carbon and particulate material emissions from fossil-energy-related processes hinges on the relative contribution of the fossil-fuel-derived organic component to the extinction budget. Thus, additional studies are needed to quantify the partitioning of organic carbon between biogenic and fossil sources. Relative humidity (RH) also plays an important role in visibility impairment. It is well known that water soluble aerosol species, such as sulfate and nitrate, can increase light-scattering efficiencies of fine particles by more than an order of magnitude as RH is increased from 20-30% to 90-95%. Organic carbon aerosol has been found to be a mixture of more soluble and less soluble components, but few studies have been performed to evaluate the RH response function of aerosols composed of these components, either separately or in combination, especially at high relative humidities. The purpose of this paper is to describe some experiments that could address the major uncertainties of biogenic and fossil carbon contributions to the fine particle extinction budget and visibility impairment. © 1997 Air & Waste Management Association.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001138813

We present synthetic emission profiles to determine the effects on profile shapes due to factors such as telescope beam size, gas distribution, opacity, and pointing errors. We find that linewidths cease to be useful if the telescope beam resolves the solid body rotation region of the galaxy disk, or if the disk is very optically thick. Opacity is more problematic for edge-on galaxies; at lower optical depths, we find that very often a trough is created in the center of the emission line. We establish guidelines for rejecting spectra as unreliable disk-velocity indicators, and determine what corrections to the measured line widths at 20% and 50% of the peak intensity are best to recover twice the disk rotation velocity. Following the procedure of Bicay &amp; Giovanelli (1986, AJ, 91, 705) we find that the 50% of peak intensity threshold for measuring linewidths (W50p, or FWHM) is the most robust, yielding the smallest measurement errors as a function of signal to noise, and requires the smallest turbulence corrections. © 1997 American Astronomical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039269122

The current regulation plan is evaluated with climates other than the climate for which it was developed and tested. This provides insight into potential conflicts and management issues, development of regulation criteria for extreme conditions, and potential modification of the regulation plan. Transposed climates from the southeastern and south central continental United States are applied to thermodynamic models of the Great Lakes and hydrologic models of their watersheds; these climates provide four alternative scenarios of water supplies to Lake Ontario. The scenarios are analyzed with reference to the present Great Lakes climate. The responses of the Lake Ontario regulation plan to the transposed climate scenarios illustrate several key issues: (1) historical water supplies should no longer be the sole basis for testing and developing lake regulation plans; (2) during extreme supply conditions, none of the regulation criteria can be met simultaneously, priority of interests may change, and new interests may need to be considered, potentially requiring substantial revision to the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909; (3) revised regulation criteria should be based on ecosystem health and socio-economic benefits for a wider spectrum of interests and not on frequencies and ranges of levels and flows of the historical climate; and (4) operational management of the lake should be improved under the present climate, and under any future climate with more variability, through the use of improved water supply forecasts and monitoring of current hydrologic conditions.","Climate change; Climate variability; Lake Ontario; Regulation; St. Lawrence River; Surface water hydrology; Water policy","climate change; hydrological model; lake management; regulatory framework; water supply; Great Lakes; Lake Ontario; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030769599

We have also found that the photoluminescence spectra from our samples undergo an asymmetric temperature-dependent blueshift with increasing pump intensity. The dependence of the photoluminescence spectra on the temperature and degree of excitation are explained in terms of a competition between a saturable confined-electron to confined-hole transition and an excited-state transition involving the ground confined-electron state and the two-dimensional hole continuum associated with the wetting layer.

Attention is focused on the external illumination of the scattering region. The polarization of the reflected component from an externally illuminated slab with finite optical depth is first considered as a model of a single, dense, broad emission-line cloud. A polarization ≲40 per cent (≲10 per cent) is typically computed for J = 0 → 1 (J = 1/2 → 3/2) transitions. Integration over a population of emission-line clouds typically reduces the observed polarization by a factor ∼(0.1-0.3)qBELR, where qBELR is the covering factor for emission lines, while preserving the relative polarizations of different lines. Consequently, the low degree of polarization observed in the red wings of quasar emission lines limits the density of low column density emission-line clouds. Broad absorption lines are associated with outflowing gas of lower density. The polarization of both the transmitted and the reflected radiation is next computed for simple kinematic models of the outflow and the observed integrated polarization in the absorption-line troughs is found to be typically ∼ 10 per cent. An equatorial flow model gives a large degree of polarization (∼0.15) parallel to the symmetry axis in the absorption trough for the doublet transition J = 1/2 → 1/2, 3/2, and the polarized flux is found to extend to the red side. In contrast, we obtain a smaller degree of polarization (∼0.05) perpendicular to the jet axis from a bipolar flow model and the polarized flux is concentrated to the blue side of the line profile. It is predicted that the troughs of singlet J = 0 → 1 lines, such as C III ̈977, should exhibit larger degrees of polarization if this is due to resonance scattering.

A point-like isotropic UV radiation source is assumed, and a simple spherical wind model is adopted for the kinematics of the scattering material from the cool giant. We first investigate the case in which the incident line photons are described by a Gaussian profile having a width of 104 K. We subsequently investigate the effects of the extended ionized region and non-spherical wind models, including a disc-type wind and a bipolar wind. The cases in which the emission source is described by non-Gaussian profiles are briefly studied. Finally, as an additional component for the kinematics of symbiotic stars, the orbital motion of the hot component around the cool giant is included and the effect on the spectropolarimetry is investigated. In this case the polarization direction changes around the red part of the Raman-scattered emission lines, when the observer's line of sight is perpendicular to the orbital plane; no such effect is seen when the line of sight lies in the orbital plane. Furthermore, complex peak structures are seen in the degree of polarization and the polarized flux, which have often been observed in several symbiotic systems including RR Tel. Brief observational consequences and predictions are discussed in relation to the present and future spectropolarimetry of symbiotic stars. It is concluded that spectropolarimetry may provide a powerful diagnostic for the physical conditions of symbiotic stars. © 1997 RAS.","Binaries: symbiotic; Line: profiles; Polarization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0041183212

An analytical tool is needed for optimizing criteria pollutant reductions given the budgetary constraints. The simplest approach is to take costs and pollutant removals to be linear with each strategy's scale of activity, and this is readily solved as a linear programming problem. Another approach is to use a dynamic system of weights which shift with progressive improvements in pollutant emissions. The two approaches yield somewhat different results, suggesting the sensitivity of the solution to the assumed weights. The study also illustrates the importance of a sound methodology for evaluating priorities given to different air quality goals. One such methodology may involve a polling of expert panels and the public to gain insight into the relative importance given to competing emissions reduction goals. An informal polling of resource agency staff was conducted and discussed in this paper. The authors take the position that proper planning involves tracing intermediate steps to the final outcome and not just focusing on the latter.","Emissions control; Environmental systems analysis; Manila; Optimization; Urban air quality; Vehicular emissions","air pollution; article; environmental management; environmental planning; exhaust gas; philippines; Air quality; Cost effectiveness; Linear programming; Optimization; Particulate emissions; Urban planning; Vehicles; Environmental systems analysis; Pollutant reduction; Air pollution control; air quality; developing country; emissions control; emissions reduction; pollution control; traffic pollution; vehicular emissions; Philippines, Luzon, Manila",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030615696

Fossil fuel combustion is responsible for a significant percentage of pollutants emitted globally, and coal will continue to play a major role in the energy portfolios of many countries. This is particularly true for developing countries. This fact has resulted in a major focus on technologies which improve the efficiency of coal combustion and conversion to electrical energy, as well as technologies which directly or indirectly reduce overall emissions. The issues around clean coal technologies (CCT) and their evolution, development and uptake in both developed and developing countries are complex. This paper addresses these issues in a Southern African context, viewed from the policy perspective of developing countries and presented in the framework of electricity supply and demand considerations in the region. The principal climate change policy elements proposed for South Africa are presented in the context of the current electricity supply and demand situation in the region. The means of addressing the supply and demand needs of the region are presented in the context of Eskom's Integrated Electricity Planning (IEP) process including the environmental considerations inherent in decision-making processes.

We present the first controlled-environment measurements of isoprene emission from leaves of tropical forest trees. Our studies were conducted in the Guanica State Forest in Puerto Rico. We report the effects of temperature and light variations on biogenic isoprene emissions during 1995. Maximum emission rates varied among species from 0 to 268 nmol m-2 s-1. Values at the upper end of this range of maximum emission rates are 2-3 times higher than values reported from any temperate taxa. Isoprene emission showed strong sensitivity to light and temperature variations. In contrast to temperate plants, whose emissions tend to saturate at a light intensity of ≃1000 μmol m-2 s-1, emissions from the tropical species increased with light intensity up to 2500 μmol m-2 s-1. The temperature optima for emissions from these plants were similar to those previously reported for temperate plants: ≃40 °C. The high maximum emission rates and lack of light saturation indicate that estimates of isoprene emission from tropical forests need to be revised upwards.","carbon dioxide; emission; gas chromatography; global models; infrared gas analysis; isoprene; light response curve; photo-ionization detector; temperature response curve; tropical dry forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030926938

Monoterpenes are important in plants as carbon-based defensive compounds and in the atmosphere as photochemically reactive compounds that affect ozone and carbon monoxide concentrations. We examined ecological theories of plant allocation to defensive compounds in relation to emission rates of monoterpenes from the foliage of these two species. Monoterpene emission from plants is controlled by the vapor pressure of the monoterpenes within plant tissues, and vapor pressure is controlled by two parameters, air temperature and terpene concentration within the tissues. We measured the concentration of terpenes and nitrogen within foliage and the emission rate from foliage, and demonstrated that emission rate was linearly related to nitrogen concentration and exponentiaIly related to air temperature. Current theories of plant allocation to carbon-based defenses predict an inverse relationship between foliar nitrogen and carbon-based defenses. We found that, under certain circumstances, these theories were sufficient to predict concentrations and emissions, but under other circumstances, the theories did not predict monoterpene concentrations or emissions. These results are discussed in the context of landscape/regional modeling of hydrocarbon emission from vegetation.","Carbon-nutrient balance hypothesis; Concentration; Emission; Growth-differentiation balance hypothesis; Henry's Law; Nitrogen; Picea mariana; Pinus banksiana","Acronicta leporina; Coniferophyta; Paragnetina; Picea mariana; Pinus banksiana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030883936

Surface water DMS concentrations ranged from &lt;0.9 to 9 nM over the sampling grid. DMS sea-to-air fluxes ranged from &lt;0.1 to 23 μmol m-2 d-1, with a mean of 4.7 μmolm-2 d-1 for August. Atmospheric DMS levels measured during the cruise ranged from less than 0.5 nmol m-3 (12 parts per trillion by volume, or pptv) to 25 nmol m-3 (625 pptv) with a mean value of 11.9 nmol m-3 (291 pptv). Results from the 24-hour sampling at the fixed station show that ventilation may represent the most important sink for surface DMS when wind speeds exceed approximately 8 m s-1. The relative magnitude of the biogenic and anthropogenic S components was estimated by comparing sulfur emissions from the gulf to the sulfur emissions from surrounding continental regions and to a sulfur budget calculated by using a Lagrangian box model. The first approach suggests that DMS emissions from the gulf represented at least 4% of total (biogenic plus anthropogenic) sulfur emissions from the Atlantic Provinces in August 1993. A Lagrangian forward motion trajectory shows that these biogenic emissions would affect all the Maritime Provinces and a portion of eastern Quebec. The second approach suggests that the contribution of the gulf to the total sulfur flux may reach 13% when compared with the anthropogenic inflow of sulfur from the Atlantic Provinces impacting the Maritimes. When the transboundary inflow of sulfur from the United States is also taken into account, the contribution of the gulf becomes 8%. Thus DMS emissions from coastal waters may represent a significant source of sulfur to the atmosphere.",,"Vindula arsinoe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000461910

Most organic compounds found in crude and refined petroleum hydrocarbon mixtures are known to degrade under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Biological degradation is believed to be the dominant mechanism of natural attenuation for removal of petroleum hydrocarbons from subsurface in both saturated and unsaturated soil environments. Intrinsic bioremediation was evaluated extensively at two areas (J8 and 5X) of the Guadalupe Oil Field. It was found that a dissolved hydrocarbon plume in the ground water (J8 Area) was effectively controlled and reduced by the process of intrinsic bioremediation, even with the presence of free products. Most part of the dissolved hydrocarbon plume was under an anaerobic condition, where nitrate, sulfate, and iron are found to be alternative electron acceptors for hydrocarbon biodegradation. In unsaturated soil regions (5X Area), aerobic biodegradation is the dominant mechanism for hydrocarbon removal, where oxygen is the terminal electron acceptor. A very high level of biodegradation rate (>10 mg/L/day) was found near aerobic-anaerobic interface. It was observed that intrinsic bioremediation has reduced total hydrocarbons in soil from 37,000 ppm level to less than 100 ppm level in the aerobic soil region.",,"Biodegradation; Environmental protection; Groundwater pollution; Hydrocarbons; Soil pollution control; Abstract only; Intrinsic bioremediation; Oil fields",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030675696

Based on the successful experience for promoting the ISO 9000, standards serials, an expert committee was organized to establish the framework for developing the standardized methodology for assessing the environmental impact of materials, manufacturing processes and other categories over a product's entire life cycle. The primary tasks for DYIT's (at which author is associated) involvement in the project are to: 1. assess and introduce appropriate softwares, 2. validate these softwares with domestic data, 3. establish the domestic data for LCA, 4. establish the domestic framework, 5. establish the educational program of green design, 6. formulate the strategy to promote LCA in the industry sector, 7. compile LCA reference manual for local designers. Green Design based on the framework of LCA techniques is the essence of environmental product design. The centre of attention is not the product itself, but the total life-cycle of the product from the cradle to the grave, or rather, from the cradle to the cradle. The designer no longer designs only the product form of chain. As well as the use phase, attention also has to be paid to the effects of production, distribution and disposal of the product.

The engine used in this study incorporates the features of contemporary medium-to-heavy duty diesel engines and is tuned to US EPA 1994 emission standards. The engine experiments were run using the AVL 8-mode steady-state simulation of the U.S. EPA heavy-duty transient test procedure. The experimental fuels included diesel fuels obtained from different sources with various natural cetane ratings as well as a number of fuels blended by adding two cetane improvers into three base fuels. The two cetane improvers we used were a nitrate-type additive and a peroxide-type additive. Increasing the cetane number resulted in a general decrease in NOx emissions. Similar reductions in NOx emissions were observed with increasing cetane number for all the base fuels irrespective of the cetane improver used in the fuel. This result indicates that the nitrogen introduced by the nitrate-type cetane improver into the fuel does not contribute to NOx formation. The reduction in NOx emissions with increasing cetane number occurred mainly at low load conditions for all fuels. At high load conditions, NOx emissions changed slightly with cetane number. Results with a limited number of fuels showed a possible effect of total aromatic content on NOx emissions. These findings indicate that an increase in cetane number from 45 to 55 combined with a reduction in total aromatic content from 30% to 10% would most likely bring down NOx emissions by 5 to 10%.

A recombinant CsrA protein containing a metal-binding affinity tag (CsrA-H6) was purified to homogeneity and authenticated by N-terminal sequencing, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry, and other studies. This protein was entirely contained within a globular complex of approximately 18 CsrA-H6 subunits and a single ~350-nucleotide RNA, CsrB. cDNA cloning and nucleotide sequencing revealed that the csrB gene is located downstream from syd in the 64-min region of the Escherichia coli K-12 genome and contains no open reading frames. The purified CsrA-CsrB ribonucleoprotein complex was active in regulating glg (glycogen biosynthesis) gene expression in vitro, as was the RNA-free form of the CsrA protein. Overexpression of csrB enhanced glycogen accumulation in E. coli, a stationary phase process that is repressed by CsrA. Thus, CsrB RNA is a second component of the Csr system, which binds to CsrA and antagonizes its effects on gene expression. A model for regulatory interactions in Csr is presented, which also explains previous observations on the homologous system in Erwinia carotovora. A highly repeated nucleotide sequence located within predicted stem-loops and other single-stranded regions of CsrB, CAGGA(U/A/C)G, is a plausible CsrA- binding element.",,"complementary DNA; regulator protein; RNA binding protein; article; biosynthesis; Escherichia coli; gene expression regulation; molecular cloning; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Pectobacterium carotovorum; priority journal; protein purification; RNA binding; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Haemophilus influenzae; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Pectobacterium carotovorum; Recombinant Proteins; Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Repressor Proteins; RNA; RNA, Untranslated; RNA-Binding Proteins; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Erwinia; Escherichia; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli K12; Pectobacterium carotovorum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030841920

It is shown here that MMOR can also exert regulatory effects on catalysis by binding to MMOH or to the binary complex of MMOH and component B (MMOB), another regulatory protein. MMOR alters the oxidation reduction potentials of the dinuclear iron cluster at the active site of MMOH. Although little change is observed in the potential for the first electron transfer to the cluster (E1(°')) = 76 mV), the E2(°')) potential value for the second electron transfer is increased from 21 to 125 mV. This shift provides a larger driving force for electron transfer from MMOR and favors transfer of two rather than one electron as required by catalysis. Similar positive shifts in potential are observed even in the presence of MMOB which has been shown to cause a 132 mV negative shift in the midpoint potential of MMOH in the absence of MMOR. MMOR is also shown to decrease the rate of reaction between the fully reduced MMOH-MMOB and O2 approximately 20-fold at 4 °C. However, the time course of the key catalytic cycle intermediate that can react with substates, compound Q, is unaffected. This implies a compensating faster decay of one or more of the intermediates that occur between diferrous MMOH and compound Q in the reaction cycle, thereby limiting potential nonproductive autodecay of these intermediates. Accordingly, an increase in single turnover product yield is observed in the presence of MMOR. Interestingly, MMOR can cause the redox potential increases, changes in rates, and the increase in product yield when present at only 10% of the concentration of MMOH active sites. Substrate binding is shown to induce negligible changes in the redox potentials. Two alternative regulatory schemes are presented based on (i) thermodynamic coupling of component binding and redox changes or (ii) dynamic interconversion of two states of MMOH promoted by MMOR.",,"methane monooxygenase; regulator protein; article; catalysis; enzyme active site; enzyme regulation; enzyme structure; enzyme substrate complex; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal; thermodynamics; Catalysis; Copper; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Iron; Kinetics; Metalloproteins; Methane; Methylococcaceae; Models, Chemical; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidoreductases; Oxygenases; Thermodynamics; Methylosinus trichosporium; Trichosporium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031004690

The cycle is a modification of an earlier one proposed by the same authors [Lobachyov and Richter, Journal of Energy Resources Technology, 1996, 188]. It retains most of the elements of the previous plant: Conoco CO2 acceptor gasification process, solid oxide fuel cell and state-of-the-art gas turbines. A key difference between the previous and the new cycle is a different heat recovery concept. Instead of using the sensible heat of the cathode exhaust for the coal gasification process, the fuel not oxidized in the fuel cell is burnt to provide this heat. This new concept allows us to simplify the cycle and makes its performance less dependent on the pressure drop in different components of the cycle. Further, it considerably reduces the exergy loss in the gas turbine by eliminating exergetically inefficient turbine blade cooling. The new cycle achieves a gain in the overall efficiency of more than two percentage points under the same operating parameters. At a maximum system pressure of 10 bar and an anticipated solid oxide fuel cell voltage of 0.7 V the overall thermal efficiency is approximately 63%. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.","ASPEN PLUS; CO2 acceptor; Coal gasification; Combined cycle; Solid oxide fuel cell","Coal gasification; Cooling; Gas turbines; Pressure drop; Turbomachine blades; Waste heat utilization; Carbon dioxide acceptor; Coal fueled power plant; Solid oxide fuel cell; Combined cycle power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031259316

These strict regulations prompted the oil industry into increased research to develop new and more attractive ways to deal with small volumes of H2S. Over the past several years, acid gas injection and disposal has developed into an extremely attractive alternative for handling these small volumes of acid gas. Chevron Canada Resources has been a leader in the development of acid gas disposal systems. In 1989, Chevron commissioned the first acid gas disposal facility in the province with the start-up of our Acheson Ethane Recovery Plant just west of Edmonton, Alberta. Using the knowledge gained by this facility after several years of operation, Chevron commissioned their second facility at the West Pembina Gas Plant west of Drayton Valley, Alberta in November 1994. Both of these facilities continue to operate today. Based on the cost and efficiency of these operations, Chevron considers acid gas disposal as an excellent alternative to dealing with low volumes of acid gas. This paper will attempt to provide other operators with some of the experience gained by Chevron in their acid gas disposal facilities. It will outline the design considerations for the facilities, the actual design conditions, some special features, and some operating experience received after the respective periods of operation.",,"Cost effectiveness; Hydrogen sulfide; Industrial plants; Plant layout; Acid gas disposal; Industrial waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030650065

DaD-stability is proved to be verifiable by the graph theory methods developed earlier to analyse qualitative stability in community matrices. DaD-stability thus appears to be a characteristics of the generic compartment scheme rather than a mere property of a particular dynamic model behind it. Two 8-and 9-compartment schemes of the global carbon cycle published elsewhere have been analysed in terms of DaD-stability in their Svicobians. While the original schemes do not meet the sufficient condition of DaD-stability, the most versions of their further aggregation are found to be DaD-stable, thus providing for comparability among the models.","Aggregation; Compartment models; Global carbon cycle; Jacobian; Matrix stability","biogeochemical cycle; ecological modelling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031473116

In this study, the results of SARMAP Air Quality Model (SAQM) simulations in the San Joaquin Valley, California, USA, are used to investigate the applicability of indicator species to assess ozone sensitivities. Threshold criteria of indicator species (NOy, O3/NOz, HCHO/NOy, and H2O2/HNO3) that distinguish various ozone sensitivities are derived.

Such a construct seems to be a natural product of the collapse of dense parts of giant molecular clouds, the vast star-forming regions that pepper the Milky Way and other galaxies. Gravitational, magnetic and thermal forces within the solar nebula forced a gradual evolution of mass toward the center (where the sun formed) and angular momentum (borne by a small fraction of the mass) toward the outer more distant regions of the disk. This evolution was accompanied by heating and a strong temperature contrast from the hot, inner regions to the cold, more remote parts of the disk. The resulting chemistry in the disk determined the initial distribution of organic matter in the planets; most of the reduced carbon species, in condensed form, were located beyond the asteroid belt (the 'outer' solar system).

Four species were detected during thermal desorption of NO adsorbed on CeO2 and ZrO2, namely, NO (m/e = 30), N2 (m/e = 28), N2O (m/e = 44) and O2 (m/e = 32). The TPD profile suggest that there are two types of adsorbed states of NO on the CeO2 and ZrO2 surfaces, one is the weakly adsorbed NO which desorbs at about 170°C and the other is the more strongly adsorbed NO which desorbs at about 450°C. The adsorbed NO undergoes extensive decomposition to form N2, N2O and O2 during thermal desorption. The TPD spectrum obtained after CO2 adsorption on CeO2 are composed of CO2 desorption at 140°C and 440°C. These peaks are assigned to monodentate and bidentate carbonate species in the adsorbed states. After the successive adsorption of NO and CO2 on the CeO2 and ZrO2 surfaces, the intensity of CO2 desorption peak in TPD is weaker than that in the case of single of CO2. However, the intensity of NO desorption is almost the same as in the case of single NO adsorption. This indicated that the preadsorption of NO on cation sites of oxide surfaces affected the surrounding surface oxygen sites and blocked the CO2 adsorption. Furthermore, this also indicates that the interaction of the oxide surface with NO is much stronger than that with CO2.",,"Adsorption; Carbon dioxide; Cerium compounds; Desorption; Nitrogen oxides; Temperature programmed desorption; Zirconium compounds; Cerium dioxide; Zirconium dioxide; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031170389

The C-O bond is shortened by nearly the same amount in HCO+ and QCO+ compared to free CO, while the nearly identical C-O bond lengths of COH+ and COQ+ are longer than in CO. H+ and Q+ have a strong electrostatic effect upon the atom to which they are bonded, which leads to an increased electronegativity of carbon and oxygen, respectively. Inspection of the charge distribution and the natural localized Orbitals shows clearly that the shorter C-O distances of HCO+ and QCO+ and the longer C-O bond lengths of COH+ and COQ+ are due to the changes in the polarization of the bonding orbitals which are caused by the positive charge of H+ or Q+ that are bonded to the molecule. The bonding orbitals of CO are polarized toward the more electronegative oxygen end. A proton or a positive charge at carbon attracts electronic charge from the oxygen atom toward the carbon end, which leads to less polarized σ- and π-bonds and to a more covalent C-O bond. A positive charge or a proton at the oxygen atom has the opposite effect. The calculated curve of the C-O bond length in MCO+ (M = Li, Cu, Ag, Au) as a function of the M+-CO distance shows that the C-O bond becomes shorter in the beginning when the metal cation approaches the carbon atom. There is a turning point at shorter M+-CO distances where the C-O bond becomes longer again. The charge decomposition analysis shows that the position of the turning point is determined by the onset of the metal+ →CO back-donation. A relatively small amount of M+ → CO back-donation is sufficient to lengthen the CO bond. The turning point for the curve of the C-O bond length as a function of the M+-CO distance occurs at a M+-CO value that is shorter than the equilibrium distance for M = Li and Ag, while it is longer for M = Cu and Au. The trends of the bond strengths and M+-CO interactions are explained with the radii and orbital energies of the valence ns and (n -1)d orbitals of the transition metals.",,"Atoms; Bond strength (chemical); Charge transfer; Chemical bonds; Electronic structure; Protons; Quantum theory; Electronegativity; Carbon monoxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031553346

Carbon-source regulation of this promoter was confirmed by a β-galactosidase assay which showed a 31- and 180-fold induction of expression after growth on ethanol or lactate-based media respectively. Two elements matching the CCAAT-binding-factor motif, which is involved in activating transcription on non-fermentable carbon sources, were identified in the putative promoter. Expression was found to be reduced to low levels in otherwise isogenic hap3 and hap4 mutant strains. Thus, this mitochondrial DNA when placed in the nucleus can act as a promoter that is subject to strict carbon-source regulation.

TW16 7LN, United Kingdom","Siliciclastic muds and mudstones commonly contain 5% iron. At deposition, most of this iron is in the oxidized form, FeIII, whereas in ancient mudstones it is predominantly in the reduced form, FeII. In most fine-grained siliciclastic sediments iron reduction is an important process during burial diagenesis. A combination of geochemical and petrologic techniques has been applied to organic-rich mudstones of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation to investigate this valence change. These sediments were collected from a variety of depositional (shallow shelf to deep graben) environments and diagenetic (0.5-4.5 km burial) settings, and our analyses have shown that significant FeIII survives burial to depths of the order of 4 km. At these depths FeIII is located (together with Al) in dioctahedral micaceous clays (notably smectite). In such sites, it is apparent that FeIII is very difficult to reduce. Our data suggest that diagenetic redox reactions are unlikely to be significant in the burial interval 0.5-4.0 km. It is also apparent that substantial iron reduction took place early during burial diagenesis with precipitation of pyrite, siderite, and ferroan carbonates in the sulfate-reduction, methanogenic, and decarboxylation zones, respectively. All these minerals are found in the studied mudstones from the shelf localities. In contrast, within the graben mudstones, pyrite is the dominant FeII-rich mineral species present. We propose that the different style of diagenesis in the two settings was produced by a fraction of the reactive iron (i.e., that contained within soil sesquioxides) being converted to the pyrite prior to sediment remobilization. Resedimentaton then allowed a second phase of sulfate reduction with replenished pore-water sulfate from the anoxic bottom graben waters. The remaining reactive iron was converted to pyrite, thereby preventing precipitation of Fe-rich carbonates in the deeper diagenetic zones. Hence, the diagenetic iron-mineral assemblages in the different facies are quite different. Diagenetic assemblages present in ancient siliciclastic sediments thus offer valuable insights into both sedimentary and diagenetic processes, but the links are complex and must be interpreted with care.",,"diagenesis; iron; Kimmeridgian; mudstone; redox conditions; UK; Carbonates; Carboxylation; Deposition; Offshore oil well production; Pyrites; Redox reactions; Sedimentology; Sediments; Sulfur compounds; Diagenetic assemblages; Diagenetic process; Kimmeridge clay formation; Mineral species; Organic-rich mudstone; Remobilization; Siliciclastic sediments; Sulfate reduction; Sedimentary rocks",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031443022

In order to investigate the effect of external parameters, the plasma parameters were measured with both probe and optical methods. The results indicated that this plasma was in non-equilibrium state (Te»Tg). The metastable argon atoms and thermal electrons are considered as the important elements in generating this plasma and they were measured by the resonant optical absorption method and by the single probe method, respectively. The electron saturation current with RVC was larger than without it, and the RVC temperature was estimated to be about 2400 K from the Richardson-Dushman equation. The concentration of argon metastable atoms was of the order of 1010cm-3 and increased slightly with the argon gas flow. © 1997 Elsevier Science S.A.","High pressure plasma; Metastables; Microwave plasma","Carbon; Cavity resonators; Light absorption; Temperature measurement; Microwave plasmas; Reticulated vitreous carbon; Richardson Dushman equation; Plasma sources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031341697

Expanding Quercus-dominated forests were invaded by Pinus strobus at 10 175 radiocarbon years before present (BP), followed by Tsuga canadensis at 9645, Fagus grandifolia at 8100, Carya at 6200, and Castanea dentata at 3600 BP; ages are averaged over two sites. Large Quercus pollen percentage and influx values are associated with continuous charcoal influx throughout the record, suggesting that fire may have played an important role in the development and maintenance of Quercus in the forest. At Sutherland Pond, a temporary decrease in fire at approximately 9500 BP apparently was a factor enabling expansion of Tsuga canadensis populations. Onset of Euroamerican agricultural practices in the region (approximately AD 1700) is well documented by rises in pollen of Ambrosia, Gramineae and Tubuliflorase and presence of Rumex and Plantago. Domestic/industrial use of Quercus, Pinus and Tsuga canadensis is also recorded by decreased percentages of these trees. Increased charcoal influx during Euroamerican settlement, particularly at Spruce Pond, may be explained by fire in connection with land clearance, wood-related industries (charcoal, iron and brick manufacturing), and operation of railroads (track fires).","AMS radiocarbon dating; climatic history; fire; Holocene; New York; plant macrofossils; pollen; vegetation history","anthropogenic effect; fire history; Holocene climate; Holocene vegetation; Holocene vegtation; human impact; USA, New York, Hudson Highlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030620941

The various criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management put forth by different institutions are critically explored. Specific types of climate change mitigation policies/projects in the forest sector are identified and examined in the light of the general criteria for sustainable forest management. Areas of compatibility and contradiction between the climate mitigation objectives and the minimum criteria for sustainable forest management are identified and discussed. Emphasis is put on the problems of monitoring and verifying carbon benefits associated with such projects given their impacts on pre-existing policy objectives on sustainable forest management. The implications of such policy interactions on assignment of carbon credits from forest projects under Joint Implementation/Activities Implemented Jointly initiatives arc discussed. The paper concludes that a comprehensive monitoring and verification regime must include an impact assessment on the criteria covered under other agreements such as the Biodiversity and/or Desertification Conventions. The actual carbon credit assigned to a specific project should at least take into account the negative impacts on the criteria for sustainable forest management. The value of the impacts and/or the procedure to evaluate them need to be established by interested parties such as the Councils of the respective Conventions. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Carbon offset projects; Climate mitigation; Criteria and indicators; Sustainable forest management","carbon dioxide mitigation; carbon emissions; climate change; emissions control; environmental monitoring; forest management; global environmental change; Joint Implementation; monitoring; sustainable development; sustainable forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031433374

Most of these bursts are observed when the electric antenna is at large angles with respect to the ambient magnetic field. The index of the frequency electric spectra is in the range ∼3.5-4. Much flatter spectra are found for the transverse magnetic fluctuations. The electric to magnetic field ratio is large. Hence either the waves are of predominantly electrostatic nature, or the radiation propagates transverse to the ambient magnetic field, so that the Viking loop antenna underestimates their magnetic components. The bursts typically last several hundred milliseconds. Simultaneous electron observations exhibit the presence of upward suprathermal electrons associated with energetic downgoing electron fluxes having power law energy distribution with index close to 4 in an energy range extending from ∼2 keV up to 70-80 keV. Considering the wave bursts to be electromagnetic, propagating in the Z mode, and locally generated, we suggest that the observations might be explained in terms of a free electron maser mechanism whose free energy source lies in the observed power law energetic electron fluxes.

Furthermore, by this network, we can gather the meteo parameters that characterize the complex aspect of the area of Ravenna.

One of the most important industrial development district is placed in the rural zone of the city and produces the 90% of the global emissions in the same area. In this framework, it becomes a necessity to correlate many different emission scenarios with meteo climatic parameters, in order to plan interventions in case the air concentrations limits of pollutants exceed the pre-alarm level.

The articles came from Chemical Abstracts published since the last review. All of the articles cited were written in or translated into English. Much of the published research on the analytical chemistry of coal during the last two years tended to be focused on coal liquefaction and on the environmental impact of coal processing and combustion. In all of these areas, elemental analysis for trace metals, sulfur, and chlorine played a major role. Several interesting applications of NMR for structural characterization were published. In the area of crude oil and shale oil, new techniques are reported in the characterization of hydrocarbons and asphaltenes in crude and shale oils. Also, new methods are reported for trace element analysis, including new applications of ICPMS. Differential scanning calorimetry has become an accepted method for wax determination, and a number of applications are reported. Heavy oil continues to be an important research area, as refineries move to operate at higher efficiencies and many new crude sources are heavier. Techniques such as GC/MS, LC/MS, LC/ICPMS, and HTGC/MS played an important role in the characterization of these oils. Good progress was made in hightemperature GC, and this allowed the separation of compounds with boiling points as high as 700° C. The GC atomic emission detector has also proven very useful in this area for speciation of metal complexes and compounds containing sulfur and nitrogen. NMR was an important technique for structural determinations and for hydrocarbon type analysis. In the area of natural gas and refined products, new methods and techniques were developed for on-line analysis and process control. Part of this was driven by new regulations for products and emissions, and part was due to rapid developments in chemometrics and modeling techniques. Several good SFC methods are now available for hydrocarbon-type analysis of gasolines, kerosines, and middle distillates. The sensitivity of sulfur-specific detectors for GC use has been improved, and this has allowed progress in the speciation of sulfur compounds in these materials. Several areas in lubrication analysis showed good progress. There are now better methods available for base oil characterization and for rapid analysis of contaminants in used lubricants. The need for better lubricants for use in extreme environments pushed development of methods for analysis of solid lubricant composition and structure. More methods specifically for synthetic lubricants were also developed, as applications for these lubricants have expanded. In the literature dealing with source rocks, a large number of papers dealt with applications related to determining source rock characteristics that can be associated with oil and gas potential. Here, the author points out that a much higher percentage than in the past dealt with exploration activities outside the United States. Other papers dealt with analytical techniques and mathematical modeling that can relate source rocks to organic origin, development, and migration. © 1997 American Chemical Society.",,"Coal; Coal combustion; Coal liquefaction; Crude oil; Differential scanning calorimetry; Environmental impact; Gasoline; Heavy oil production; Hydrocarbons; Information analysis; Metal analysis; Metal complexes; Petroleum geology; Petroleum refining; Solid lubricants; Sulfur compounds; Trace analysis; Trace elements; Atomic emission detectors; Chemical Abstracts; Extreme environment; Lubrication analysis; Speciation of sulfur; Structural characterization; Structural determination; Trace element analysis; Petroleum prospecting",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010317634

The model assumes that entry and efflux of Ci occurs via a CO32- transport system and diffusion of CO2. HCO3- is considered as impermeable. Intracellular Ci is distributed among the species according to the cytoplasmic pH and the calcium concentration. Former models considered entry of HCO3-, and not CO32-, and the intracellular interactions of calcium with CO32- and their implications for the Ci accumulating mechanism were not considered. The model predicts that in the presence of 10-3-10-2 M calcium, at low and moderate external inorganic carbon concentrations, CaCO3 is the main cytoplasmic Ci species, whereas in its absence HCO3- is the main Ci species. Due to sequesteration of CO32- by calcium and low permeability of the cells to CO2, the CO2 concentration is low and no net photosynthesis is observed. Photosynthesis is predicted to occur only at external Ci concentrations higher than 1 mM, where the CO32- transport is saturated and the main source of Ci is diffusion of CO2. This converts the mutant to a CO2 user with a high photosynthetic Km(CO2), unlike the wild type which utilizes external CO32- as a substrate for photosynthesis at low external concentration. The sequesteration of CO32- by Ca2+ efficiently reduces the CO32- and the CO2 accumulation ratio in comparison with that of total Ci resulting in an inward CO2 gradient and reduced CO32- gradient over a wide range of external Ci concentrations. This raises doubts as to whether the transport of Ci as such is an active transport. The simulation predicts that in cases where the affinity of the uptake mechanism for CO32- is higher than that measured for this mutant and the accumulation ratio for Ci is consequently higher, the predicted accumulation ratio for the transported species CO32- remains low. Taking the permeability of the cells to gases to be as low as previously measured, the simulation predicts that O2 may be accumulated in the cytoplasm up to saturation at CO2 saturated photosynthesis rates. This results in a high rate of photorespiration and competitive inhibition of CO2 fixation. Entry of CO32-, accumulation of charged Ci species, Ci utilization and efflux of carbon stimulates ions movements required to compensate the charges of CO32-, HCO3- and CaHCO3+. The model predicts accumulation of cations up to 50 mEq x l-1 or exclusion of the same amount of anions required to electroneutralize the accumulation of charged Ci species in the absence of calcium and up to 28 mEq x liter-1 in the presence of 20 mM calcium. The steady-state CO32- dependent flux of electroneutralizing ions was found to be equal to the steady-state rate of Ci utilization and efflux (photosynthesis, photorespiratory CO2 evolution and CO2 leakage) multiplied by the valency of CO32-. The interconversion of Ci species resulting from Ci utilization and dissipation of Ci involves H+ liberation in the hydration reaction and the dissociation of HCO3- to CO32- or H+ consumption in the conversion of CO32- to HCO3- and dehydration of the latter. The H+ production and the CO32- dependent transport of positive ions are interrelated and are non-monotonously altered in anti-parallel fashion as a function of the external Ci concentration. The presence of calcium reduces the magnitude of both these fluxes.",,"calcium carbonate; calcium ion; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbonic acid; article; bacterial metabolism; bacterium mutant; calcium cell level; carbon dioxide fixation; cell membrane permeability; cell pH; cellular distribution; Cyanobacterium; mathematical model; membrane transport; nonhuman; photosynthesis; priority journal; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cyanobacteria; Synechocystis sp.; Synechocystis sp.

The electrode process was found to be governed by surface chemical steps involving the formation of films of Pb(IV)-containing deposits. Only on glassy carbon and on basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes was a well-defined diffusion-controlled oxidation response observed for Pb(II) benzoate dissolved in acetonitrile and in the presence of an excess of both benzoic acid and pyridine. Benzoic acid acts as a ligand. The role of pyridine in the oxidation process was investigated by comparison of the effect of pyridine with that of 4,4′-bipyridine, 2,2′-bipyridine, and 1,10-phenanthroline. The coordination of the nitrogen donor ligand is suggested to stabilize and trap intermediates in the electrochemical process. The homogeneous oxidation of ethylene glycol by Pb(IV) benzoate coupled to the electrode process is reported; a channel flow cell experiment with data analysis by computer modelling, employing the backwards implicit method, was used to determine the second order rate constants k for the corresponding catalytic EC′-type process in the presence of varying amounts of pyridine. A linear increase of k with pyridine concentration suggests a direct involvement of pyridine in or before the rate determining step in the oxidative cleavage of ethylene glycol. Further, in a study of three insoluble lead-containing materials, PbO2, Pb2O3, and Pb2Fe(CN)6, mechanically attached to a basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrode in the form of microcrystalline particles and immersed in acetonitrile containing benzoic acid and pyridine, the novel catalytic oxidation of ethylene glycol in a heterogeneous electrode process could be detected.

For the quantitative analysis of the XANES spectra, a mathematical procedure based on evolving factor analysis (EFA) has been applied. Correlation with catalytic data shows that copper is fully oxidized in both systems when the conversion of propene is complete and the conversion of NO to N2 reaches its maximum value. The XANES analysis together with comparison of the catalytic behavior of Cu-ZSM-5 with Cu-Al2O3 and Cu-SiO2 systems indicates that the rate limiting step of the reaction takes place on cupic oxides (although other species may also participate). This conclusion is of general significance because it establishes the physical basis for the role of Cu in selective catalytic reduction of NO by hydrocarbons; this explains the recently recognized fact that zeolitic supports do not play an essential role in the reaction and that the mechanism may not involve a Cu2+/Cu1+ redox cycle or, if it does, the cycle is dominated by the oxidized species.

P. fluorescens 2-79RLI was previously genetically modified with an iron regulated ice nucleation reporter, which allowed calibration of ice nucleation activity with siderophore production. Initial experiments examined ice nucleation activity and siderophore production under different growth conditions in vitro. These studies demonstrated that P. fluorescens 2-79RLI could utilize both Fe-citrate and Fe-phytosiderophore as iron sources, suggesting that production of these compounds by plants would increase iron availability for P. fluorescens 2-79RLI in the rhizosphere. Fe demand and Fe stress were further shown to be a function of nutrient availability and were reduced when carbon was limiting for growth. Subsequent experiments extended these observations to rhizosphere cells. Cells were sampled from the rhizosphere and the rhizoplane. Results of a soil microcosm experiment showed that Fe stress was reduced for P. fluorescens 2-79RLI in the barley rhizosphere as compared to the cells in the rhizosphere of lupin.

This physical scheme considers the influence of surface features to compute the erosion threshold and the intensity of the dust emissions. It has been validated by comparison with relevant experimental data. However, it was necessary to extend its applicability and to test its capability to reproduce dust emissions over large arid areas. Specific methods have been developed to determine the parameters required by the dust production model for large-scale applications. The surface features (dimensions of the roughness elements and soil mineralogy) and the wind velocity allow the computation of the roughness lengths of the surface, the size distribution of the erodible soils, and the wind friction velocity. A map of these surface characteristics has been established for the western part of the Sahara. This map coupled to the Europan Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) surface wind fields are used to simulate dust emissions in this desert region. The simulated emissions have been compared to the Infrared Difference Dust Index (IDDI), determined by means of the Meteosat thermal infrared imagery. The simulated dust event frequencies are in good agreement with those observed by satellite. The comparison between the simulated fluxes and the satellite observations for 3 months of the year 1991 has revealed a linear relationship between the logarithm of the simulated flux and the IDDI.

Within the clam communities, the sulfate reduction zone is only 10 cm thick, and Ca and Mg concentrations decrease to values as low as 2.2 mM and 34.5 mM, respectively, at depths less than 30 cm below the sediment-water interface. Less than 5 m outside the communities, the base of the sulfate reduction zone is deeper than the greatest penetration of the cores (-30 cm), and Ca and Mg exhibit only minor changes from seawater values. The sediment exhibits no significant variation in grain size, mineralogy, organic carbon, nitrogen, or carbonate content throughout the region. The composition of pore fluid within clam communities results from upward flow of altered fluid rather than different diagenetic reactions within and outside the communities. Isotopically light dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), with δ13C values ranging from -3.2 to -54.1‰, could reflect carbon sources from either oxidized thermogenic methane and/or a mixture of oxidized microbial methane and solid organic carbon. The C1/(C2+C3) ratios (ranging from 34 to 1142) and the hydrogen and carbon isotopic compositions of methane (δD values of -109 to -156‰; δ13C values of -30.6 to -86.6‰) suggest that methane is primarily microbial but that a minor component could be thermally generated. Any thermogenic methane would have migrated from great depths, possibly &gt;2 km. The presence of methane is likely to contribute to fluid flow by reducing the density of the fluids. Past fluid migration and venting are reflected by widespread carbonate mineralization at the sediment-water interface. This mineralization and the geographic distribution and proportions of microbial and thermogenic methane suggest that vent sites migrate when permeability is reduced during carbonate cementation. These results demonstrate that along with convergent and divergent plate boundaries, transform plate boundaries are characterized by fluid flow and that the flow may be widespread, occurring at sites away from fault zones.",,"fluid flow; geochemistry; pore fluid; pore fluids; sediment chemistry; transform fault; transform plate boundaries; USA, California, Monterey Bay; Vesicomyidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031405506

To determine the environmental consequences of discharges of radioactivity from a large medical research facility into municipal sewage, specifically 131I activity in sewage sludge, and the radiation exposures to workers and the public when sludges are incinerated. Methods. The authors measured radioactivity levels in the sludge at the Ann Arbor, Michigan, Waste Water Treatment Plant following radioiodine treatments of two patients at the University of Michigan hospital complex and performed a series of calculations to estimate potential radiation doses due to releases of 131I from incineration of sewage sludge. Results. Approximately 1.1% of the radioactive 131I administered therapeutically to patients was measured in the primary sludge. Radiation doses from incineration of sludge were calculated to be 0.048 millirem (mrem) for a worker during a period in which the incinerator filtration system failed, a condition that could be considered to represent maximum exposure conditions, for two nine-hour days. Calculated results for a more typically exposed worker (with the filtration system in operation and a 22-week period of incineration) yielded a committed effective dose equivalent of 0.066 mrem. If a worker were exposed to both conditions during the period of incineration, the dose was calculated to be 0.11 mrem. For a member of the public, the committed effective dose equivalent was calculated as 0.003 mrem for a 22-week incineration period. Exposures to both workers and the public were a very small fraction of a typical annual dose (about 100 mrem excluding radon, or 300 mrem with radon) due to natural background radiation. Transport time to the treatment plant for radioiodine was found to be much longer than that of a normal sewage, possibly due to absorption of iodine by organic material in the sewer lines. The residence time of radioiodine in the sewer also appears to be longer than expected. Conclusion. 131I in land-applied sludge presents few health concerns because sufficient decay occurs before it can reach the public; however, incineration, which is done in winter months, directly releases the 131I from sewage sludge to the atmosphere, and even though exposures to both workers and the public were found to be considerably lower than 1% of natural background, incineration of sludge is a pathway for public exposure. Although 131I was readily measurable in sewage sludge, only about 1% of the radioiodine administered to patients was found in the sludge. The fate of the remaining radioactivity has not been established; some may be in secondary and tertiary residuals, but it is quite likely that most passed through the plant and was discharged in dilute concentrations in plant emissions. The behavior of radioiodine and other radioactive materials released into municipal sewerage systems, such as those from large medical facilities, is not yet well understood.",,"iodine 131; article; environmental impact assessment; health care facility; health hazard; priority journal; radiation monitoring; radioactive contamination; risk assessment; sewage disposal; sewer; sludge disposal; Air Pollutants, Radioactive; Incineration; Iodine Radioisotopes; Radiation Dosage; Sewage; United States; Water Pollutants, Radioactive; Water Pollution, Radioactive",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030743271

Box 53999, Phoenix, AZ 85072, United States","Over the past 100 years, there has been a steady increase in man-made emissions of greenhouse gases [(GHGs), such as carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and most halogenated substances] due to human activities including combustion of fossil fuels and deforestation. Scientific studies suggest that these emissions are contributing to increases in atmospheric concentrations of GHGs, which in turn, cause an enhanced greenhouse effect by trapping more of the sun's energy leading to global climate change. Concerns related to GHGs-induced climate change and its accompanying impacts on life on earth and its environment led to the adoption of the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The FCCC has been ratified by over 150 countries, and is now in effect. The FCCC recognized that developed countries, including the United States, have been primarily responsible for most of the man-made GHG emissions to date, and called on them to limit their GHG emissions to their 1990 levels by 2000. On Earth Day 1993, President Clinton committed the nation to meet that goal. A national Climate Change Action Plan was announced in October 1993, containing about 50 different voluntary programs applicable to various sectors of the economy. Because of low oil prices and strong economic performance over the past several years, it is unlikely that the ongoing voluntary efforts will enable the United States to meet its GHG emission reduction goal in 2000. Recently, a consensus position has emerged among the scientific community that man-made GHG emissions appear to be contributing to global climate change. Based on that finding, U.S. Representative, Under Secretary of State Tim Wirth stated at the July 1996 meeting of the ""Conference of Parties"" (COP) of the FCCC, that global voluntary efforts to meet the GHG emission reduction goal have failed. He called for the COP to expedite ongoing international negotiations toward establishing (in 1997) medium-term, realistic, legally-binding GHG emission targets and implementation schedules for each country. Setting a legally binding GHG emission target would have significant impacts on the nation, and especially on the electric utility sector. This article provides a general overview of the U.S. and international efforts toward implementing the FCCC and their potential impacts on the utility industry. A future article is anticipated to address an update on the international negotiations and their potential impacts on other sectors of the U.S. economy, and the rapidly growing GHG emissions from developing countries such as China and India.",,"Global climate change; Greenhouse gases; International negotiations; Climate change; Combustion; Economic and social effects; Electric utilities; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; International cooperation; Societies and institutions; Air pollution control",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031069644

The solvation nonlinearity is attributed to saturation of a dipolar liquid produced by the solute dipole. The treatment explores the perturbation expansion over the solute-solvent dipolar interaction truncated in the form of a Padé approximant. The optical line shape and the free energies along the ET reaction coordinate are related to the chemical potential of solvation of a fictitious solute with a complex-valued dipole moment. Due to solvent dipolar saturation the spectrum of dipolar fluctuations is confined by a band of the width 2Elim. Solvation nonlinearity was found to manifest itself for optical transitions with high dipole moments in the initial state, most often encountered for emission lines. In this case, the spectral line approaches the saturation boundary Elim bringing about ""line squeezing"" and decrease of the line shift compared to the linear response prediction. In the nonlinear region, the line shift dependence on the solute dipole variation Δm switches from the quadratic linear response form ∝ Δm2 to a linear trend ∝| Δm|. The bandwidth may pass through a maximum as a function of |Δm| in the saturation region. Nonlinear solvation results thus in a narrowing of spectral lines. For a transition with solute dipole enhancement, the bandwidth in emission Δe is therefore lower that in absorption Δa: Δe &lt; Δa. As a result, the plot of βΔ2a,e, β= 1/kBT against the Stokes shift ℏΔst demonstrates the upward deviation of βΔ2a and downward deviation of βΔ2e from the linear response equality βΔ2a,e=ℏΔωst. We also explored the nonlinearity effect on charge separation/ charge recombination activation thermodynamics. The solvent reorganization energy was found to be higher for charge separation (λ1) than for charge recombination (λ2). Both are smaller than the linear response result. For the reorganization energies, the discrepancy between λ1 and λ2 is relatively small, whereas their temperature derivatives deviate significantly from each other. The theory predictions are tested on spectroscopic computer simulations and experiment. Generally good quantitative agreement is achieved. © 1997 American Institute of Physics.",,"Activation energy; Approximation theory; Computer simulation; Electron transitions; Electron transport properties; Optics; Saturation (materials composition); Solvents; Spectroscopy; Thermodynamics; Charge recombination; Charge separation; Dipole solvation; Electron transfer activation; Nonlinear effects; Optical spectroscopy; Chemical operations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031210333

Fraser, S.J. Matthews and R.W. Murphy). A seismic- stratigraphic study of the reprocessed regional lines for the offshore Sarawak area was undertaken with the aim of reviewing the present understanding of the tectonics and the palaeo-depositional environments of the Sarawak Basin. The study was integrated with biostratigraphy and wireline-log data from the wells drilled throughout the basin. Seven unconformities were identified within the Tertiary sediments and these were used as the markers for the seismic correlations. Where the unconformities become conformable, well data were used to guide the correlation of the conformities, Palaeoenvironment maps were generated which document the interaction of tectonics and sediments throughout the basin history. The development of the Sarawak Basin commenced in late Oligocene times with deposition along a coastline running in a NW-SE direction, which is almost perpendicular to the present-day coastline. The coastline was oriented to the present-day NE-SW during late Miocene times. Geochemistry of Sarawak Basin oils shows generation of hydrocarbons from land plant dominated source rocks. The distribution of these types of source rocks are favoured in the Coastal Fluvial, Coastal and Lower Coastal Plain environments. The quantity and quality of the source rocks deteriorates with the distance from the coastline. The palaeoenvironment maps illustrate the likely distribution of Sarawak Basin source rocks which will help in effectively planning for future exploration in Sarawak. The study also revealed that the Sarawak Basin was formed as a result of NW-SE-trending right-lateral fault movement during late Oligo-Miocene times. This dextral movement was responsible for creating the NW-SE coastline and divided the offshore Sarawak area into two sub-basins. Deposition and preservation of coastal plain and shallow marine sediments continued in the eastern area while the western area remained as a 'high' until late Miocene times. The dextral strike-slip movement which controlled the evolution of the Sarawak Basin is sub-parallel to a number of lineaments elsewhere in Sarawak. The timing of movement of these suggests progressive younging in an eastward direction. It is also believed the late structuration of the sediments and the formation of structural traps is linked to these tectonic movements.",,"basin evolution; hydrocarbon exploration; sedimentation; tectonic evolution; Malaysia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031545782

However, they are of great interest in other applications such as approximately equals 10 micrometer negative luminescence emitter devices and heterodyne detection of 10.6 micrometer infrared (IR) radiation from carbon-dioxide lasers. Reduction in the series resistances has been achieved by utilizing a device design with a n+ MCT common which should improve the frequency response of these devices. Another design modification, predicted to reduce the leakage current, has been the introduction of low doped, wide band gap regions either side of the (pi) -region. In practice these structures have produced over an order of magnitude improvement in the leakage current characteristics. ©2004 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","Auger suppression; Doping; Heterodyne infrared detectors; MCT; MOVPE growth","Augers; Cadmium; Cadmium alloys; Cadmium compounds; Carrier lifetime; Crystal growth; Detectors; Doping (additives); Frequency response; Gallium alloys; Growth (materials); Heterodyning; Infrared detectors; Mercury (metal); Micrometers; Polarization; Remote sensing; Semiconducting cadmium compounds; Substrates; Tellurium compounds; Thickness measurement; Wireless telecommunication systems; Auger suppression; Doping; Heterodyne infrared detectors; MCT; MOVPE growth; Metallorganic vapor phase epitaxy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-58649108069

Stable emission was observed only after annealing and formation of a conductive Mo carbide layer at the metal-coating interface. Both coated emitters displayed enhanced emission and ""turn-on"" voltages reduced by a factor of 2 as compared to the uncoated emitters. For the graphite coated emitter, the enhancement was attributed to an increase in the field enhancement factor due to the coating morphology. Roughening of the Mo-diamond interface via carbide formation during the annealing step was presumed to have been the cause for the enhanced emission for the diamond coated emitter. The transmission probabilities for the Mo-diamond and diamond-vacuum interfaces were calculated, using the WKB method, based on an emission mechanism from the intrinsic diamond's conduction band minimum. With a field locally enhanced to 108 V/cm, the transmission probability for the diamond-vacuum interface was 108 times larger than that of the Mo-diamond interface.

Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and water were found to be the principal reaction products over unpromoted vanadyl pyrophosphate. Over both the Fe- and Cr-promoted catalysts high formaldehyde selectivity was observed at very low methane conversion levels with HCHO space time yields in the range of 0.5 to 2.0 g/kg-h. As the extent of the reaction was increased selectivity to formaldehyde decreased rapidly and changes in selectivities with conversion indicate a sequential conversion of methane to formaldehyde, CO, then CO2, Macrokinetic parameters for the methane oxidation reaction were determined for the unpromoted catalyst. A simple power law rate expression fit the rate data well over the whole temperature range. The rate of reaction of methane was 0.08 ± 0.02 order in oxygen partial pressure, 0.73 ± 0.07 order in methane partial pressure, and the activation energy was found to be 102 ± 6 kJ/mole. Activation energy was unchanged by promotion with Fe and Cr. Analysis by XPS and ICP-AA indicates that promoters were incorporated equally into the bulk and surface of these catalysts. XPS indicates an increase in the average surface oxidation state of vanadium in the promoted catalysts and XRD shows that promotion causes oxidation of a small fraction of the pyrophosphate to form αII-VOPO4. 31P NMR spin-echo mapping confirms the enhanced formation of V5+ in the promoted samples. The presence of V5+ may therefore be required for the formation of selective products. It is proposed that the role of promoters is to increase the rate of formation of V5+ during activation, or to stabilize V5+ containing domains under the highly reducing methane oxidation conditions. © 1997 Academic Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001743071

The N1s features of XPS spectra of modified surfaces had intensities expected for monolayer coverage. However, the Raman spectra were significantly more intense than expected, implying an increase in scattering cross section upon chemisorption. A likely explanation is resonance enhancement of the carbon/adsorbate chromophore analogous to that reported earlier for dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) chemisorption. Vibrational assignments indicate that the C-C vibration between azobenzene and the carbon surface is in the 1240-1280 cm-1 region, and this conclusion is supported by spectra obtained from [13C]graphite. Observation of depolarization ratios for 4-nitroazobenzene and DNPH on graphite edge plane indicate that NAB is able to rotate about the NAB/carbon C-C bond, while chemisorbed DNPH is not.

However, unambiguous estimates of calculated OH require sufficiently accurate and complete measurements of the key species and physical variables that determine OH concentrations. The Tropospheric OH Photochemistry Experiment (TOHPE) provides an extremely complete set of measurements, sometimes from multiple independent experimental platforms, that allows such a test to be conducted. When the calculations explicitly use observed NO, NO2, hydrocarbons, and formaldehyde, the photochemical model consistently overpredicts in situ observed OH by ∼50% for the relatively clean conditions predominantly encountered at Idaho Hill. The model bias is much higher when only CH4-CO chemistry is assumed, or NO is calculated from the steady state assumption. For the most polluted conditions encountered during the campaign, the model results and observations show better agreement. Although the comparison between calculated and observed OH can be considered reasonably good given the ±30% uncertainties of the OH instruments and various uncertainties in the model, the consistent bias suggests a fundamental difference between theoretical expectations and the measurements. Several explanations for this discrepancy are possible, including errors in the measurements, unidentified hydrocarbons, losses of HOx to aerosols and the Earth's surface, and unexpected peroxy radical chemistry. Assuming a single unidentified type of hydrocarbon is responsible, the amount of additional hydrocarbon needed to reduce theoretical OH to observed levels is a factor of 2 to 3 greater than the OH-reactivity-weighted hydrocarbon content measured at the site. Constraints can be placed on the production and yield of various radicals formed in the oxidation sequence by considering the observed levels of certain key oxidation products such as formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. The model results imply that, under midday clean westerly flow conditions, formaldehyde levels are fairly consistent with the OH and hydrocarbon observations, but observed acetaldehyde levels are a factor of 4 larger than what is expected and also imply a biogenic source. Levels of methacrolein and methylvinylketone are much lower than expected from steady state isoprene chemistry, which implies important removal mechanisms or missing information regarding the kinetics of isoprene oxidation within the model. In a prognostic model application, additional hydrocarbons are added to the model in order to force calculated OH to observed levels. Although the products and oxidation steps related to pinenes and other biogenic hydrocarbons are somewhat uncertain, the addition of a species with an oxidation mechanism similar to that expected from C10 pinenes would be consistent with the complete set of observations, as opposed to naturally emitted isoprene or any of the anthropogenic hydrocarbons examined in the model. Further constraints on the abundance of peroxy radicals are necessary in order to fill the gaps in our understanding of OH photochemistry for the clean continental conditions typical of Idaho Hill.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001357693

We also took advantage of the facility-wide emission cap concept to propose equipment consolidation and to select appropriate sources to apply emissions controls to.

At Loruns, the uppermost Triassic is characterised by bedded carbonates of the Kossen Formation supporting a stenotopic fauna indicative of a shallow sub-tidal environment of normal marine salinity. The Triassic-Jurassic boundary may be represented as a sequence boundary developed on top of a 1.1 m thick red mudstone of the lower Schattwald Shale, which is interpreted to have been deposited in a marginal marine environment, possibly a mud flat. Above the boundary beds, the upper Schattwald Shale is characterised by thin-bedded marl and dark limestone beds with an earliest Hettangian macrofauna dominated by epifaunal filter-feeding bivalves, including ostreids, mytilids and oxytomids, which suggest a shallow, subtidal, salinity-controlled environment typical of an interplatform lagoon. Carbonate production rejuvenated in the later Early Hettangian with development of the Loruns oolite, a shallow subtidal oolitic and oncolitic unit bearing echinoderms indicative of normal marine conditions. Low Th/U ratios from the remainder of the section are a result of reduced thorium in carbonate-rich sediments and not from authigenic uranium in anoxic sediments. In the boundary beds evidence for marine anoxia (or dysoxia) is absent where Th/U values, determined by gamma-ray spectrometry, are above 5. The negative excursion in δ13C and positive excursion in δ18O in the boundary beds may be due to secondary geochemical effects, due to organic diagenesis or the precipitation of caliche during paleosol development. Alternatively, the excursions may reflect a primary geochemical signal recording short-term decline in primary productivity. Comparison in δ18O and δ13C values between the Kossen Formation and Lorfus oolite indicate no significant long-term geochemical changes are evident in the section and suggest that any environmental perturbations were restricted to the boundary beds and possible sequence boundary.","Austria; Extinction; Geochemistry; Jurassic; Palaeoecology; Triassic","geochemistry; palaeoecology; palaeoenvironment; Triassic Jurassic; Austria, Vorarlberg, Loruns; Bivalvia; Echinodermata; Mytilidae; Ostreidae; Oxytomidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031434091

By adapting and applying a stochastic weather generator, we first tested the sensitivity of the CERES-Wheat model to combinations of mean and variability changes of temperature and precipitation for two locations in Kansas. With a 2°C increase in temperature with daily (and interannual) variance doubled, yields were further reduced compared to the mean only change. In contrast, the negative effects of the mean temperature increase were greatly ameliorated by variance decreased by one-half. Changes for precipitation are more complex, since change in variability naturally attends change in mean, and constraining the stochastic generator to mean change only is highly artificial. The crop model is sensitive to precipitation variance increases with increased mean and variance decreases with decreased mean. With increased mean precipitation and a further increase in variability Topeka (where wheat cropping is not very moisture limited) experiences decrease in yield after an initial increase from the 'mean change only' case. At Goodland Kansas, a moisture-limited site where summer fallowing is practiced, yields are decreased with decreased precipitation, but are further decreased when variability is further reduced. The range of mean and variability changes to which the crop model is sensitive are within the range of changes found in regional climate modeling (RegCM) experiments for a CO2 doubling (compared to a control run experiment). We then formed two types of climate change scenarios based on the changes in climate found in the control and doubled CO2 experiments over the conterminous U.S. of RegCM: (1) one using only mean monthly changes in temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation; and (2) another that included these mean changes plus changes in daily (and interannual) variability. The scenarios were then applied to the CERES-Wheat model at four locations (Goodland, Topeka, Des Moines, Spokane) in the United States. Contrasting model responses to the two scenarios were found at three of the four sites. At Goodland and Des Moines mean climate change increased mean yields and decreased yield variability, but the mean plus variance climate change reduced yields to levels closer to their base (unchanged) condition. At Spokane mean climate change increased yields, which were somewhat further increased with climate variability change. Three key aspects that contribute to crop response are identified: the marginality of the current climate for crop growth, the relative size of the mean and variance changes, and timing of these changes. Indices for quantifying uncertainty in the impact assessment were developed based on the nature of the climate scenario formed, and the magnitude of difference between model and observed values of relevant climate variables.",,"carbon dioxide increase; CERES-Wheat model; climate change; crop yield; precipitation; temperature; variation; USA, Kansas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030616924

We observe axially symmetric dust emission structures in IRAS 22272+5435 and IRAS 07134+1005, and tentatively in IRAS 19500-1709, while IRAS 04296+3429 is unresolved with our ∼1″ angular resolution. The well-resolved morphology of IRAS 07134+1005 shows an elliptical outer shell surrounding two aligned peaks that we interpret as limb-brightened peaks of an optically thin, elliptical shell with an equatorial density enhancement. This mid-IR morphology contrasts with that observed in the better studied carbon-rich proto-planetary nebulae, AFGL 2688, AFGL 915, and AFGL 618, which show bright, unresolved cores, probably created by optically thick inner regions, and bipolar extensions that align with their optical reflection nebulosities. Using an axially symmetric dust code and assuming that the dust is composed of 0.01 μm amorphous carbon grains, we model the dust emission images and the spectral energy distributions of these four proto-planetary nebulae and of the young, carbon-rich planetary nebula IRAS 21282+5050, which also has an axially symmetric dust shell and other similarities with the proto-planetary nebulae that have the 21 μm dust feature. Marginally resolved mid-infrared images constrain the dust shell's inner radius, while well-resolved mid-infrared images additionally constrain other geometric parameters of the model (e.g., inclination angles and pole-to-equator mass-loss rate ratios). The modeling reveals that the observed axial symmetry in the dust shells of these objects coincides with an enhanced mass-loss phase (∼3 × 10-5 M⊙ yr-1) during which the equatorial mass-loss rate was a factor of 18-90 higher than the polar mass-loss rate, i.e., an axially symmetric superwind. Our dynamical age estimates indicate that these stars left the asymptotic giant branch approximately 300-1400 years ago, just after the superwind phase. For each object, the size and structure of the dust shell is the same for the sampled wavelengths, with the exception of IRAS 22272+5435 for which the 11.8 μm emission is larger than either the 8.2 or the 9.7 μm emission. IRAS 22272+5435's spectrum has a larger dust feature-to-dust continuum ratio than found in the other objects, and hence its 11.8 μm image is probably dominated by the 11.8 μm feature emission that has different optical properties than the underlying continuum. © 1997.

For the case of laser-induced recrystallization, the integrated infrared absorbances are found to agree with an extrapolation of the calibration curve previously determined for very low substitutional carbon concentrations in Si. We argue that this finding provides strong evidence for the achievement of nearly perfect substitutionality in laser-recrystallized films, even though their carbon concentrations are three orders of magnitude beyond the solubility limit of carbon in Si. This conclusion is found to be consistent with measurements of the intensity of defect-induced Si Raman scattering relative to the Raman intensity of the local carbon mode. The Raman intensity of the local carbon mode at 605 cm-1 relative to the first-order Si Raman line at 521 cm-1 provides an ideal spectroscopic tool for the determination of substitutional carbon concentrations.

Climate changes induced by the doubling of atmospheric CO2 have been predicted for the year 2050 by general circulation models (GCMs) and energy balance models (EBMs). The results obtained suggest that potential changes in air temperature and precipitation may have a dramatic impact on the pattern and magnitude of runoff, on soil moisture and evaporation, as well as on the aridity level of some hydrologic zones of Mexico. However, in other cases climate change is likely to produce a positive effect. Indices were estimated for quantifying the vulnerability of hydrologic regions and of the country as a whole. These vulnerability indices were defined according to criteria previously established for studies of this type. The indices provide information about both the hydrologic zones which are vulnerable even under current climate conditions and others which may be vulnerable to future climate changes.","Climate change; Hydrological balance; Hydrology; Mexico; Thermal balance; Vulnerability","carbon dioxide doubling; climate change; developing country; nature-society relations; river basin; thermal balance; vulnerability assessment; water resources; Mexico",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031390893

Promoting greater energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy is an important element of Canada's National Action Program on Climate Change - the federal-provincial strategy to achieve Canada's commitment to work toward stabilizing greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000. In this regard, an improved understanding of the relationship between energy efficiency, energy use and greenhouse gas emissions will assist policy makers in assessing the progress being made in addressing the issues of global climate change and sustainable development. Natural Resources Canada has developed indicators of changes in the principal factors which influence secondary energy use and emissions over time. This paper utilizes these indicators to review energy use tends in the four secondary energy use sectors (residential, commercial, industrial and transportation), with particular emphasis on the industrial sector. This review covers the period from 1990 to 1995. The year 1995 was chosen because it is the most recent year for which actual energy use data are available. The year 1990 is the base year of Canada's environmental goal, in accordance with the Framework Convention on Climate Change. A more comprehensive and detailed presentation of these indicators can be found in Energy Efficiency Trends in Canada 1990 to 1995. This report is an update of Energy Efficiency Trends in Canada which was published by Natural Resources Canada in April 1996.",,"Climate change; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Industrial economics; Greenhouse gas emissions; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031346059

For all of them, of great importance is a correct parameterization of the energy and momentum transport from the surface. Mainly, the land-surface schemes have been developed in order to parameterize land-surface variations both on daily and annual time scales. In this paper we describe the Land Air Parameterization Surface Scheme (LAPS) designed for use in atmospheric models and mainly for use in simulations of thermal circulations. It has two modules for parameterizing the processes at the boundary-layer interface: one for a bare surface and one for a vegetated one. Incorrect parameterization of land-surface processes and prescription of the surface parameters in atmospheric modeling, can result in artificial changes of horizontal gradient of the sensible heat flux. Thus, an error in horizontal temperature gradient within the lower atmosphere may be introduced. Of course, the reliability of the model depends on the quality of boundary-layer scheme implemented and its sensitivity to the bare soil and vegetation parameters. In this study, the sensitivity of the LAPS scheme to parameterization of bare soil processes, ground roughness length, vegetation parameters (stomatal resistance, leaf area index and canopy height) and albedo, has been examined. Tests based on time integrations using real data were performed. For sensitivity tests with the non-plant module the data sets for June 3, 1981; June 4, 1982; June 11, 1982 and June 24, 1982 from the experimental site at Rimski Šančevi (Yugoslavia) were used. The performance of the vegetation module was tested by employing the data set for September 8, 1988 measured at the experimental site of De Sinderhoeve (The Netherlands). The computed latent heat flux and the ground temperature outputs were compared with the observations. Finally, the sensitivity of the LAPS scheme to the prescribed parameters was examined by using a simple statistical analysis.",,"boundary layer; LAPS; soil/vegetation coupling; surface roughness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031446941

Cloud radiative forcing over the subtropics is parameterized using an empirical relation between stratus cloud cover and the difference in potential temperature between 700 mb (a level that is above the trade inversion) and the surface. This relation includes the empirical negative correlation between SST and low cloud cover and is potentially a positive feedback to climate forcing. Since potential temperature above the trade inversion varies in unison across the Tropics as a result of the large-scale circulation and because moist convection relates tropospheric temperature within the convecting region to variations in surface temperature and moisture, the subtropical potential temperature at 700 mb depends upon surface conditions within the convecting region. As a result, subtropical stratus cloud cover and the associated feedback depend upon the entire tropical climate and not just the underlying SST. A simple tropical model is constructed, consisting of separate budgets of dry static energy and moisture for the convecting region (referred to as the ""warm"" pool) and the subtropical descending region (the ""cold"" pool). The cold pool is the location of stratus low clouds in the model. Dynamics is implicitly included through the assumption that temperature above the boundary layer is horizontally uniform as a result of the large-scale circulation. The tropopause and warm pool surface are shown to be connected by a moist adiabat in the limit of vanishingly narrow convective updrafts. Stratus low cloud cover is found to be a negative feedback, increasing in response to doubled CO2 and reducing the tropically averaged warming in comparison to the warming with low cloud cover held fixed. Increased low cloud cover is shown to result from the increased difference in surface temperature between the warm and cold pools, and the increased low-level static stability over the warm pool, equal to the increase in potential temperature along the moist adiabat originating in the warm pool mixed layer.",,"climate change; climate forcing; cloud cover; convection; low cloud; stratus; thermostat; tropics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031445221

Using a combination of EPR and FTIR spectroscopies, three distinct mechanisms of product formation have been identified. At temperatures below 18 K, product formation is dominated by direct photolysis of F2-CH4 heterodimers, resulting in formation of closed-shell complexes HF-CH3F. A small fraction of reaction intermediate, a nonplanar methyl radical trapped in the reaction cage with HF and F, is also formed. This intermediate decays to product on a time scale of 103 s at 13 K after the photolysis period. Above 20 K, photogenerated F atoms undergo thermally activated diffusion in argon, and they react with isolated CH4 molecules to form CH3-HF complexes. The rate constant for this process is ∼10-25 cm3 s-1 at 20 K, and exhibits an activation energy of 1.7 kcal/mol. A third reaction channel involves reaction of F with CH4 to generate isolated planar methyl radicals by escape of the HF product from the reactive site.

In this study, the patterns of response in the surface climatology of a coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation model forced by increases in carbon dioxide alone is compared with those obtained by increasing carbon dioxide and aerosol forcing. The simulations are run from early industrial times using the estimated historical forcing and continued to the end of the twenty-first century assuming a nonintervention emissions scenario for greenhouse gases and aerosols. The comparison is made for the period 2030-2050 when the aerosol forcing is a maximum. In winter, the cooling due to aerosols merely tends to reduce the response to carbon dioxide, whereas in summer, it weakens the monsoon circulations and reverses some of the changes in the hydrological cycle on increasing carbon dioxide. This response is in some respects similar to that found in simulations with changed orbital parameters, as between today and the middle Holocene. The hydrological response in the palaeosimulations is supported by palaeoclimatic reconstructions. The results of changes in aerosol concentrations of the magnitude projected in the scenarios would have a major effect on regional climate, especially over Europe and Southeast Asia. © 1997 American Meteorological Society.",,"aerosol; aerosol impact; climate change; climate modification; global warming; nature-society relations; sulphate aerosol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031464644

Under the requirements of the Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency has set standards for six specific pollutants, often referred to as 'criteria' pollutants. Although dramatic air pollution episodes associated with evident excess mortality are now unlikely in much of the world, outdoor air pollution continues to be linked with an increase in cardiorespiratory events, particularly in susceptible populations. Analyses for many cities in the United States and other countries have shown that daily mortality counts are associated with indexes of particulate matter in outdoor air; there is supporting evidence from studies of morbidity, including rates of hospitalization and of visits to emergency rooms. Ozone and acidic aerosols may be responsible for acute and chronic respiratory morbidity, and questions remain regarding the relationship of nitrogen dioxide exposure and the risk of respiratory infections. Low levels of Carbon monoxide can lead to worsening of anginal symptoms, perhaps ventricular arrhythmias, and possibly increased hospital admissions for congestive heart failure. Approaches for limiting the health risks of breathing polluted outdoor air in sensitive individuals have received little study. Current understanding of the determinants of exposure suggests that modifying activity patterns to limit time outside during episodes of pollution represents the most effective strategy. Pulmonary physicians should be able to advise their patients and their communities concerning the risks of outdoor air pollution and on approaches for reducing these risks.","Air pollution; Carbon monoxide; Nitrogen dioxide; Ozone; Particulate matter","alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; atropine; cromoglycate disodium; indometacin; nedocromil; orciprenaline; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality standard; angina pectoris; congestive heart failure; health hazard; heart ventricle arrhythmia; human; lung disease; medical specialist; morbidity; particulate matter; review; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030884457

Computer program CALIB 3.0.3c is used to correct and calibrate the conventional radiocarbon dates in a simulation using varied values for marine carbon and reservoir effects for each sample. This produces substantial variance in the results and. therefore, difficulties for chronological interpretation. For example, reasonable input values for ΔR and percent marine carbon yield dates that overlap the first European contact (A.D. 1533), despite the absence of historic documentation of the Las Palmas mortuary complex. Further research on reservoir effects and paleodiet is needed in order to interpret radiocarbon determinations on cape region human remains. Moreover, our findings have serious implications for the proper application of radiocarbon dating to samples from other regions subject to reservoir effects.

A transect stretching from three forested upland sites to an open graminoid fen contained within a black spruce (OBS) palsa was compared with a similar transect from upland lichen and Sphagnum moss sites to wetland mire and pond sites adjacent to an active beaver pond (BP). Mean seasonal CH4 (dark CO2) fluxes were -0.51 (7.99), -0.14 (10.3), 0.15 (8.68), and 2.83 (8.22) mg/m2/d (g/m2/d) from the OBS feather moss, lichen, sphagnum moss, and fen sites. Mean seasonal CH4 (dark CO2) fluxes were -1.58 (9.16), 2.03 (7.62), 1144, and 153 mg/ m2/d (g/m2/d) from the BP lichen, sphagnum moss, mire, and pond sites. Rates of CH4 oxidation typical of uplands were observed at all sites except for the BP mire and pond. CH4 efflux was observed in all sites. Rates varied by 4 orders of magnitude along the transition from the driest uplands to moist uplands to inundated wetlands. A high water table appears to be necessary for a strong CH4 source. Low soil temperatures inhibit high CH4 flux rates despite inundation. The potential for the conversion of upland sites from net sinks to sources of CH4 by minor changes in the water table was observed. Prediction of CH4 fluxes by plant community analysis appears to require knowledge of the thermal and hydrologie regime of particular sites over the course of the summer period. Dark CO2 fluxes, by contrast, appear more uniform across similar plant community types.",,"boreal forest; BOREAS; carbon dioxide; emission control; methane; Canada, Manitoba, Thompson; Bryophyta; Picea mariana; Sphagnum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031433679

Moro 5, Rome, 00185, Italy","The Alto Paranaiba alkaline province (∼82 Ma), tectonically associated with a NW-trending linear structure bordering the São Francisco craton, consists of a wide variety of igneous forms and magma types. It includes several alkaline-carbonatite complexes, some of which are quite important economically. The Salitre complex is represented by two interconnected oval-shaped bodies, N-S-aligned and variable in size, emplaced into Proterozoic metasedimentary rocks. It consists mainly of syenites showing clear evidence of fenitization, ultramafic rocks (clinopyroxenites, mica-bearing clinopyroxenites, locally referred to as bebedourites, dunites, glimmerites, and per-ovskitites), radial dikes of trachytes/tinguaites, and carbonatites as small veins and also forming an elongated plug, approximately 500 m2 in area, associated with the Salitre I intrusion. In a few cases the carbonatitic rocks grade into phoscorites because of an increase in magnetite content. Texturally, the ultramafites are described as adcumulates, but meso- and orthocumulate rock types also are found. Clinopyroxene, olivine, phlogopite, perovskite, and apatite represent the main cumulus phases, sphene being less common. Intercumulus material consists of the same minerals in addition to melanite. Fresh rocks are rarely present at the surface; thus the entire set of data derives almost entirely from borehole samples. Incompatible-element distributions normalized to primordial mantle for the different ultramafic rock types exhibit many similarities, showing patterns clearly dominated by the abundance of perovskite and phlogopite. Syenitic rocks and carbonatites generally are less enriched than the cumulates. Distribution patterns of REE display LREE enrichment and strong LREE/HREE fractionation typical of alkaline suites; higher REE concentrations are related to the perovskitic rocks. Smooth, almost linear patterns are indicated for all the rock types excluding the syenites (which show a characteristic U-shaped distribution curve, probably the result of the removal of sphene and amphibole). It should also be noted that the dunitic rocks in general are more fractionated than the clinopyroxenitic ones. On the basis of texture and mineralogy, the Salitre ultramafites are interpreted as being formed by accumulative processes. No distinctive layering is evident in the rocks at the borehole scale. The crystallization sequence of the main rock-forming minerals of the ultramafites shows perovskite and opaques (Cr-spinel) as early phases, followed by olivine, clinopyroxene, and finally phlogopite; the last mineral is clearly a two-generation phase, the latest being related genetically to the fenitization processes. Geological, petrographic, and mineralogical evidence for the Salitre rocks indicates a highly complex origin involving multistage crystallization processes from an initial ultrapotassic magma source. This may explain the absence of ijolitic rocks over the entire Alto Paranaíba province, which is contrary to the situation in other alkaline complexes of southern Brazil (e.g., Jacupiranga, Juquiá). Carbonatitic rocks are interpreted as resulting from an unmixing process that developed during the evolution of the parental magma. © 1997 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,"alkali igneous rock; cumulate; petrogenesis; petrology; Brazil, Goias State, Alto Paranaiba; Brazil, Minas Gerais State, Alto Paranaiba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031433593

The emissions and trade activities data collected over the past three years shows that this market-driven model is the major instrument in reducing NOx an SOx emissions from stationary sources in California's South Coast Air Basin, while providing a high degree of implementation flexibility to industrial sources. Under the program, the emissions have been reduced beyond the designed values. In addition, the monitoring systems specified in the program provide for more accurate reporting of emissions. The trading market under RECLAIM has been highly active. More than 19,000 tons of NOx and 7,000 tons of SOx have been traded to date, at a total value of more than 22 million dollars. A large number of credits were traded for future years, which indicates that many RECLAIM facilities can reduce their control costs by purchasing credits from other facilities which have reduced their emissions more cost-effectively. Although considered a closed-market system, RECLAIM is designed to interact with credits generated under the open-market system as well. Currently, emissions reduction credits generated by specific types of mobile source activities can be used by RECLAIM facilities. In the near future, emission credits from area-wide stationary sources will also be allowed for use by RECLAIM facilities. Based on three years of implementation experience, RECLAIM has proven to be a cost-effective tool for reducing emissions as well as providing for greater operational flexibility for industrial sources.",,"Air quality; Cost effectiveness; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Marketing; Regional clean air incentives market (RECLAIM) program; Air pollution control",Conference Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031367942

As part of that program, 10 in-use vehicles were tested on a chassis dynamometer at temperatures of 20, 0, and - 20 °F using both fuels. Three of these vehicles were retested in the EPA facilities at Research Triangle Park, NC, under the same conditions. Vehicles were driven over the Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule of the Federal Test Procedure during testing. PM-10 exhaust emission samples were collected at Fairbanks, and total particulate samples were obtained at the EPA. Results from both parts of this study indicate that particulate matter (PM) emission rates increased with decreasing temperature for both fuels. The increase occurred primarily during cold starting and is assumed to be due to enrichment. Particulate matter emission rates during operation on the E-10 fuel were lower relative to rates obtained during operation on the base gasoline. Exhaust hydrocarbon and PM emissions were well correlated, suggesting that fully phased-in Federal Tier 1 vehicle emission standards will reduce PM emissions from new vehicles and that rich-operating, high emitters can be expected to have high PM emissions.",,"air analysis; air monitoring; article; atmospheric dispersion; environmental protection; environmental temperature; exhaust gas; particulate matter; united states",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030895310

Asymmetries can arise because of both convective instabilities and rotation. Convective instabilities occur in two distinct, spatially well separated regions during the first second of the explosion: (i) inside the proto-neutron star immediately below the neutrinosphere and (ii) in the neutrino-heated 'hot-bubble' region interior to the outward propagating revived shock wave. The gravitational wave signature of both convective instabilities has recently been computed. One finds that for a supernova located at a distance of 10 kpc the maximum dimensionless gravitational wave amplitudes |hTT| range from about 9 × 10-23 to 3 × 10-21 in two-dimensional models. Anisotropic emission of neutrinos resulting from the non-spherical stratification of the proto-neutron star also generates gravitational waves. The amplitudes can be larger than the wave amplitudes due to mass motions by a factor of 5-10. In three-dimensional simulations the gravitational wave amplitudes due to mass motion and anisotropic neutrino emission are reduced by an order of magnitude. Most of the gravitational radiation from convection inside the proto-neutron star is emitted in the frequency band 100-1000 Hz, while convective motions in the hot-bubble region generate waves from several 100 Hz down to a few Hz. Pre-supernova models of rotating stars have not yet been calculated. Thus, in order to predict the gravitational wave signature of rotational core collapse one has to rely on parameter studies of the collapse of likely initial models. A recent comprehensive study shows that the dimensionless gravitational wave amplitudes are in the range 4 × 10-25 ≲ |hTT| ≲ 4 × 10-23 for a source at a distance of 10 Mpc. The spectra cover a frequency range of 50 Hz to 3 kHz, with most of the power being emitted between 500 Hz and 1 kHz.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0038867538

Since we have previously observed that the basolateral Na-HCO3-cotransporter operates with an overall stoichiometric ratio of q ~3 HCO3- :1 Na+ in vivo, but with q ~2 HCO3- :1 Na+ in vitro and that is responds differently in both cases to acetazolamide (ACZ), we have now tested whether the co-transporter can regain its in vivo function in vitro if the incubation conditions are improved. Cell membrane potentials (V(b)) and cell pH (pH(i)) were measured with microelectrodes and microfluorimetric techniques on isolated S2 segments of rabbit proximal tubule and the instantaneous V(b) response to a 2:1 reduction of bath HCO3- or Na+ concentration was determined. (ΔV(b))HCO3 and (ΔV(b))Na averaged 13.1 ± 0.9 mV (SEM) and 6.9 ± 0.5 mV in D-glucose-containing control HCO3-Ringer solution and decreased respectively to 10.1 ± 0.5 mV and 3.8 ± 0.2 mV (n = 8) after incubation in tissue culture medium and NE (10-5 mmol/l). These data imply that 4 increased from 1.9 to 2.7. Concomitantly the tubules became susceptible to ACZ (1 mmol/l), which reduced (ΔV(b)HCO3 in control conditions only to 94.6 ± 1.2% but under improved incubation conditions to 64.5 ± 2.4%. As verified in voltage divider measurements the latter reduction was not caused by activation of a basolateral K+ conductance. Tile results indicate that improved incubation conditions can at least partially revert cotransport function towards that of the in vivo state. The effect of ACZ may be explained if in the improved state 1 CO32- + 1 HCO3- + 1 Na+ are cotransported, in which case inhibition of carbonic anhydrase (CA) may cause a CO32-/pH disequilibrium to develop in the basal labyrinth which impedes the cotransport. Under conventional incubation conditions, however, when only 2 HCO3- + 1 Na+ are cotransported no such disequilibrium should develop irrespective of whether CA is active or inhibited.","Acetazolamide; Cellular substrate supply; CO32-/pH disequilibrium; Isolated proximal tubule; Na-HCO3 cotransport; Norepinephrine","acetazolamide; bicarbonate; glucose; noradrenalin; tissue culture medium; animal tissue; article; cell membrane potential; cell ph; controlled study; fluorometry; in vitro study; ion transport; kidney proximal tubule; nonhuman; potassium transport; priority journal; rabbit; sodium transport; Acetazolamide; Animals; Bicarbonates; Carrier Proteins; Chemistry; Electric Conductivity; Histological Techniques; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Ions; Kidney Tubules, Proximal; Mathematics; Perfusion; Rabbits; Sodium-Bicarbonate Symporters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030839385

This paper provides a brief historical review of how these particular issues came to the forefront internationally and in Canada. Then the characteristics of the issues are described, revealing the wide range of space and time scales involved, as well as the several different ecological systems and socioeconomic sectors affected. Historically each air issue has been treated as a separate problem - from root causes, through the atmospheric processes involved, through the impacts on the biosphere and society, and finally to the design of policies to slow down or eliminate unwanted impacts. In recent years, however, recognition has been growing that the six air issues are interrelated through complex feedbacks, lags and synergisms. For example, replacing CFCs may slow down stratospheric ozone depletion, but the replacement gases may contribute to climate warming. The lesson to be learned by both scientists and policy analysts is therefore that strategies for dealing with a particular issue may not be optimal for the whole. Two examples are given to illustrate the point. (1) With respect to policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the warming potentials of all such gases should be assessed, and the effects of proposed strategies on the other five air issues should also be included. (2) With respect to regional land-use planning, a long-term perspective (decades) should be taken, and the effects of global and regional atmospheric change on the region should be included in the assessment. Because the future is difficult and often impossible to predict, an adaptive strategy is recommended in which options are kept open, and the assessment document is revisited periodically (at 2- 5-year intervals).","Acidic deposition; Canada; Climate change; Global warming; Greenhouse gas warming; Ground-level ozone; Hazardous air pollutants; Multi-issue assessments; Smog; Stratospheric ozone depletion; Suspended particulate matter; UV-B radiation","air pollution; atmospheric change; atmospheric issue; atmospheric pollutant; climate change; environmental policy; man-evironment relations; ozone depletion; policy need; smog; suspended particulate matter; article; atmosphere; canada; climate; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; ozone layer; priority journal; research; smog; suspended particulate matter; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030860190

We begin with an examination of the consumption pattern of six different income classes, three each in urban and rural India, and then estimate the direct and indirect energy and CO2 emission coefficients for supporting production in various sectors. This provides us with a basis for estimating the energy and emission content of the consumption baskets of the different income classes in India. CO2 emissions are projected to increase from 0.18 tonnes of carbon (tC) per capita in 1990 to about 0.62 tC per capita in 2020 under the reference scenario which corresponds to a GDP growth rate of 5.5% per annum. We then analyse scenarios of technology improvement in which emissions are reduced to 0.47 tC per capita in 2020. Our projection methodology takes into account the changes in aggregate consumption pattern due to mobility of the population across the income classes and from rural to urban areas, besides the increase in per capita consumption of all classes.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942426109

These were then analyzed for the CO2, CH4, N2O and CO concentrations, as well as for δ13C and δ18O of CO2. Measured vertical profiles of tropospheric CO2 showed that the concentration increased with height over all locations. In the lower troposphere over the wetland and taiga regions, extremely low CO2 concentrations of 335-345 parts per million by volume (ppmv) were often observed. Measured values of δ13C and the CO2 concentration were negatively correlated with each other, the rate of change in δ13C with respect to the CO2 concentration being about -0.05‰/ppmv. This implies that the variations in the CO2 concentration observed over Russia in the summer are primarily caused by terrestrial biospheric activities. In the middle and upper troposphere, the CO2 concentration and δ13C showed systematic differences between each other in 1992, 1993, and 1994, probably due to their secular changes. The δ18O and CO2 observed in the lowest part of the troposphere over east and west Siberia were also negatively correlated with each other, with the rate of change in δ18O with respect to CO2 estimated to be about -0.11‰/ppmv. This relation may be caused by isotopic equilibrium of oxygen in CO2 with soil water through respiration of living plants and decomposition of organic matter and with chloroplast water in leaves through photosynthesis of living plants. In contrast to CO2, the CH4 concentration decreased with height. Extremely high CH4 concentrations were observed over the west Siberian lowland, owing to a large amount of CH4 emitted from wetlands. The N2O concentrations were fairly constant through the troposphere over all locations covered by this study, with an average value of about 311 parts per billion by volume (ppbv). The CO concentrations also showed vertical profiles, with a small gradient over natural wetlands, taiga, and tundra. High values of the CH4, CO, and CO2 concentrations were observed over Moscow, owing to emissions of the respective gases by human activities in an urban area. It was also found that over natural wetlands and tundra the CO2 and CH4 concentrations were negatively correlated with each other, reflecting a strong biospheric CO2 uptake and CH4 emissions from wetlands. The relationship between the CH4 and CO concentrations was strongly positive over areas with their anthropogenic and natural sources; the relationship was only slightly positive over wetlands, possibly due to CO emissions from wetlands and/or photochemically produced CO.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; methane; nitrous oxide; oxygen isotope; troposphere; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001062559

In the case of magnetic surfaces the information about the spin of the captured electron might be accessed via the polarization of the emitted light. In the grazing incidence mode the surface sensitivity is highest due to the fact that the particles do not penetrate into the target surface but are scattered well above the uppermost atomic layer. Thus the electrons that neutralize the incoming ion originate from the topmost layer.

Grasses had fewer leaves and legumes were more branched at peak production under elevated [CO2] than under ambient.

Reproductive and vegetative characteristics showed related responses to [CO2], as species with enhanced biomass had a hastened fruit set time, a higher number of fruits per plant and a higher reproductive biomass under elevated [CO2] than under ambient conditions, while species with depressed biomass had a delayed fruit set time, a lower number of fruits per plant and a lower reproductive biomass. Our results also show a high interspecific variability in [CO2] response, but some trends emerged at the family level: the production of vegetative and reproductive modules were depressed in grasses and slightly stimulated in legumes. © 1997 Blackwell Science Ltd.","CO2 concentration; Growth; Mediterranean old-field; Phenology; Senescence; Sexual reproduction","carbon dioxide enrichment; old field; phenology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031395388

This method is applicable to the decays of mixtures of spectrally distinct fluorophores. The method does not require specific information concerning the component spectra or lifetimes, but such information can be used when it is available. The decay is analyzed as the complex quantum yield (a function of the steady-state intensity, modulation ratio, and phase angle) measured as a function of modulation frequency and, in most cases, emission wavelength. When the spectra of the mixture components are known, the frequency domain decays of the components can be calculated from complex quantum yield matrices measured at all or selected wavelengths. Matrices describing component photokinetics and relative concentrations are calculated from the frequency domain decays. When the component emission spectra are not known, complex quantum yield matrices can be factored into the emission spectra and frequency domain decays of the sample components via principal components analysis of the matrix. In this paper, the principles of frequency domain decay analysis are discussed. In particular, the variation of the analysis procedure with the amount of data acquired and the extent of the analyst's knowledge of the sample components are described. These procedural variations are illustrated by the analysis of simulated decays and the decays of mixtures of polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons in isotropic and microheterogeneous solution. © 1997 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001485504

In all cases we detected emission over the whole extent of the optical disk - and thus reach significantly further out than the known CO distribution. In all cases where the galaxy is known to show a warped disk or streamers in HI we detect continuum emission outside of the disk plane. KAO data from the literature allowed to estimate the black body temperature in NGC 4565 to about 15 K in the outer disk. Hence we conclude that we are mapping the distribution of cold dust associated with the atomic gas in those regions.

We simulate the economic effects of such a program for low-emission vehicles (LEV) using a regional economic model for Pennsylvania, and compare the economic impacts of the LEV program to two alternative policies that would require additional emission reductions: industrial point source controls (PSC) and mandatory use of cleaner reformulated gasoline. Although the relationship between the proposed controls and economic development is negative in each case, the magnitude of the impact is modest, and the effects of the LEV and PSC options have approximately the same magnitudes. However, larger effects occur when combined effects of programs are considered, suggesting that policy makers need to be sensitive to the simultaneous effects of policies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744263798

The relation of measurements outside the test area to values inside the area for normal conditions (i.e. defined weather type, no emission reduction in the test area) allows prediction of the values for the test area during emission reductions, but only if this relation shows a good correlation. This prediction includes the influence of meteorological factors that are distributed more or less homogeneously within an area of about 100 km x 100 km, which includes a large part of the meteorological influence. The comparison of predicted and measured values in the test area shows the effect of emission reduction, with the uncertainty of remaining meteorological effects, of course.

Flooded rice fields (paddies) are a significant source of atmospheric CH4; estimates of the annual emission from paddies range from less than 20 to 100 million Tg, with best estimates of 50 ± 20 Tg. The emission is the net result of opposing bacterial processes: production in anaerobic microenvironments, and consumption and oxidation in aerobic microenvironments, both of which occur sequentially and concurrently in flooded rice soils. With current technologies, CH4 emission from rice fields will increase as production increases. Over the next 25 years rice production will have to increase by 65% from the present 460 Mt/y to 760 Mt/y in 2020. The current understanding of the processes controlling CH4 fluxes, rice growth and rice production is sufficient to develop mitigation technologies. Promising candidates are changes in water management, rice cultivars, fertilization, and cultural practices. A significant reduction of CH4 emission from rice fields, at the same time that rice production and productivity increase at the farm level, is feasible, although the regions where particular practices can be applied, and the trade-offs that are possible, have still to be identified.","Emission; Methane; Paddy soils","greenhouse gas; methane; mitigation; paddy field; soil emission; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031424595

Main problems may occur in urban transport, where not many promising solutions are expected, while the problems are severe. In view of the great number of uncertainties, we will in our paper resort to the use of scenarios. We will address in particular expert scenarios, concerned with a sustainable transport system, by applying the recently developed spider model. Based on a set of distinct characteristics, represented in eight axes in the spatial, institutional, economic and social-psychological field, an evaluation framework is constructed which visualises the driving forces that largely influence the future of the urban transport system. Next, expected and desired scenarios are constructed on the basis of information obtained from a survey among Dutch transport experts (both average scenarios and scenarios reflecting segments of respondents). The expected scenarios show that many current trends will continue, while the transport system is largely the same as the current one. The desired scenarios on the other hand, suggest the emergence and the need for a more collective system, in which also many new modes are operating. In the paper the resulting urban transport systems are also discussed. By calculating the CO2 emissions in the average expected and desired scenario, we can test the fulfilment of environmental quality norms. It appears that the expected scenario does not lead to a significant reduction of those emissions; the desired scenario however, may lead to a large scale reduction of the emissions. The conclusion is that the differences in expert opinion are small and that a sustainable (urban) transport system is still far away in the future, although the compact city concept may perhaps offer a promising perspective.",,"expert system; transport planning; urban transport; Araneae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030871035

Compressed natural gas (CNG) has been one of the most widely researched fuels proposed to replace liquid petroleum fuels. Regulated CNG non-methane hydrocarbon emissions are often lower than hydrocarbon emissions from conventional liquid fuels because of the absence of heavier hydrocarbons in the fuel. Reducing NOx and non-methane organic gas (NMOG) emission levels reduces the ozone forming potential (OFP) of the exhaust gases. A Hercules GTA 3.7 liter medium duty CNG engine was operated at seven load and speed set points using local supply CNG gas. The engine was operated at several rated, intermediate and idle speed set points. The engine was operated while the air/fuel ratio value was varied. The lighter load tests as well as the lean operation tests showed an increase in the hydrocarbon emissions as a result of unburnt fuel passing through the engine. As the lambda value approached stochiometric operation, NOx increased and the HC decreased. Hydrocarbons were captured using a dedicated sampling system drawing a sample from a full scale dilution tunnel via a rotary vane pump through a mass flow controller and collected in a tedlar bag. The sample was then analyzed by a gas chromatograph for identification and species were quantified utilizing retention indices. Upon close analysis of the data, the production and destruction of compounds present in engine exhaust can be related to the test fuel and background dilution air. The intent of this research was to identify the formation of products such as ethene that arise from incomplete combustion. © Copyright 1997 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Alternative fuels; Ethylene; Exhaust gases; Exhaust systems (engine); Liquid methane; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Hydrocarbon speciation; Incomplete combustion; Liquid petroleum fuels; Mass flow controller; Non-methane hydrocarbons; Ozone-forming potential; Spark-ignited engines; Compressed natural gas",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072484825

In this paper we show that two of these amplitude modulation modes can be switched from one to the other by simple meteorological processes which are herein termed ""climatic switches"". The two climatic switches (for a given location) specifically established and discussed here are a (sufficiently rapid) heating/warming episode and a (sufficiently rapid) cooling episode. Existence and influences of these two climatic switches are further ascertained and illustrated using climatic records from the U.K., Africa and U.S.A. It is inferred that a rapid man-created greenhouse-warming which is sufficiently large and spread along a given location may act as a climatic switch and hence a cause for climatic change in that particular location. A climatic change caused by climatic switches may involve an increase or a decrease in the average of some naturally existing temperature oscillations. This implies that climatic switches may be mechanisms built into the climatic system in order to make it wriggle temporarily out of a steadily rising (or falling) temperature trend caused by a sizeable heating (or cooling) process.

Unfortunately, bio-climatic building design approaches (such as passive cooling and heating using natural renewable energy sources) are not being widely adopted in these economies despite being proven appropriate and cost-effective methods of reducing commercial energy consumption without reducing significantly thermal comfort in buildings. This paper analyzes the results of a survey conducted in Nairobi on (1) impediments to diffusion, (2) agents and methods of promotion, (3) channels of communication, and (4) the role played by design education and design professions in the diffusion of these design techniques in the housing industry in Kenya. The analysis shows, first, that economic constraints, lack of systematic promotional campaigns, lack of trained manpower, institutional resistance to change, unreliability of the passive design systems, cultural resistance to change, and resistance by design professionals are perceived, in that order, as significant barriers. Second, a mix of interventions from the government, the non-government organizations and the private sector is found to have the highest likely promotional impact. Third, non-literate methods and channels of communication, such as the demonstration projects, are found to be potentially more effective than other methods. Fourth, it is found that the current design education and design practices are not only inadequate but also are discouraging innovation diffusion. Last, some possible strategies for facilitating future diffusion initiatives are discussed. It is hoped that the findings are useful to local diffusion agents, and are an equally invaluable addition to the meager literature on innovation diffusion theory in the housing industries in developing economies. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Bio-climatic; Design approaches; Diffusion; Innovations","bioclimatic design; building design; design approach; technology spread; Kenya, Nairobi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031433871

The resulting fdhC, fdhAB, and fdhCAB transcripts were present at all growth stages in cells growing on formate but were barely detectable during early exponential growth on H2 plus CO2. The levels of the fdh transcripts did, however, increase dramatically in cells growing on H2 plus CO2, coincident with the decrease in the growth rate and the onset of constant methanogenesis that occurred when culture densities reached an optical density at 600 nm of ~0.5. The mth transcript that encodes the H2-dependent methenyl-H4 MPT reductase (MTH) and the frh and mvh transcripts that encode the coenzyme F420-reducing (FRH) and nonreducing (MVH) hydrogenases, respectively, were also present in cells growing on formate, consistent with the synthesis of three hydrogenases, MTH, FRH, and MVH, in the absence of exogenously supplied H2. Reducing the H2 supply to M. thermoformicicum cells growing on H2 plus CO2 reduced the growth rate and CH4 production but increased frh and fdh transcription and also increased transcription of the mtd, mer, and mcr genes that encode enzymes that catalyze steps 4, 5, and 7, respectively, in the pathway of CO2 reduction to CH4. Reducing the Ha supply to a level insufficient for growth resulted in the disappearance of all methane gene transcripts except the mcr transcript, which increased.

By using autotrophic growth medium, which contains glucose as organic carbon source, for heterotrophic culture, the protein and chlorophyll contents of the cells could be increased by simply illuminating the culture broth and aerating with CO2-enriched air at the end of the heterotrophic culture. A system was then constructed for continuous sequential heterotrophic/autotrophic production of algal biomass. The system was composed of the conventional mini-jar fermentor for the heterotrophic phase and a tubular photobioreactor for the autotrophic phase. The exhaust gas from the heterotrophic phase was used for aeration of the autotrophic phase in order to reduce the CO2 emission into the atmosphere. With this system, it was possible to produce high Chlorella biomass concentration (14 g L-1) containing 60.1% protein and 3.6% chlorophyll continuously for more than 640 h. During the steady state, about 27% of the CO2 produced in the heterotrophic phase was re-utilized in the autotrophic phase.

Mean Hylocomium segment size differed consistently between areas and between years. Between-year variation in mean segment size was strongly correlated with an index integrating climatic effects on moss growth. Accumulated time in hydrated state is considered the major climatic determinant of size in this ectohydric plant, and the risk of termination was high in dry summers. Ramification and regeneration from buds after one yr delay of development varied little while regeneration from tissue older than two yr varied strongly between years. Rates of none of these branching types was explained by macroclimatic data. Loss rates were related to rodent population densities in one of the areas. Demographic data for mature segments were analysed separately for each area and each one-yr period by stage-structured transition matrix models. The variation in population growth rates (λ = 0.87-1.22) was larger than in most forest vascular plants. Adverse climatic conditions seem to affect more strongly the fate of large than of small segments.

In this study, we combined leaf-level ozone response data from independent ozone fumigation studies with a forest ecosystem model in order simulate the effects of ambient ozone on mature hardwood forests. Reductions in leaf carbon gain were determined as a linear function of ozone flux to the leaf interior, calculated as the product of ozone concentration and leaf stomatal conductance. This relationship was applied to individual canopy layers within the model in order to allow interaction with stand- and canopy-level factors such as light attenuation, leaf morphology, soil water limitations, and vertical ozone gradients. The resulting model was applied to 64 locations across the northeastern United States using ambient ozone data from 1987 to 1992. Predicted declines in annual net primary production ranged from 3 to 16% with greatest reductions in southern portions of the region where ozone levels were highest, and on soils with high water-holding capacity where drought stress was absent. Reductions in predicted wood growth were slightly greater (3-22%) because wood is a lower carbon allocation priority in the model than leaf and root growth. Interannual variation in predicted ozone effects was small due to concurrent fluctuations in ozone and climate. Periods of high ozone often coincided with hot, dry weather conditions, causing reduced stomatal conductance and ozone uptake. Within-canopy ozone concentration gradients had little effect on predicted growth reductions because concentrations remained high through upper canopy layers where net carbon assimilation and ozone uptake were greatest. Sensitivity analyses indicate a trade-off between model sensitivity to available soil water and foliar nitrogen and demonstrate uncertainties regarding several assumptions used in the model. Uncertainties surrounding ozone effects on stomatal function and plant water use efficiency were found to have important implications on current predictions. Field measurements of ozone effects on mature forests will be needed before the accuracy of model predictions can be fully assessed.","Air pollution; Drought stress; Foliar nitrogen; Forest canopy; Forest productivity; Modeling; Net primary production; Ozone; Photosynthesis; Stomatal conductance; Tree growth",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001086285

A significant remediation of a limited area contaminated with approximately 100 Kg of naphtha, toluene and xylenes was achieved in a 2 month treatment in which the soil was remediated to conform with local soil quality regulations. The bulk of soil removal of contaminants was achieved by vapour extraction (about 70 kg). Biodegradation also provided a significant contaminant removal (about 18 Kg). The hydrocarbons removed from the vent system were successfully biofiltered and outlet gas stream concentrations were acceptable under Italian national law. The biodegradative capacity of a mixed culture of microorganisms selectively isolated from the soil was tested in vial culture experiments. After 1 day of incubation, four of the seven most important naphtha components were completely degraded; the remaining constituents were slowly degraded.","Biofiltration; Bioventing; Hydrocarbon degradation and removal; In situ bioremediation","Biofiltration; Bioventing; Hydrocarbon contaminated soil; Hydrocarbons; Impurities; Microorganisms; Naphthas; Soil pollution; Toluene; Xylene; Biodegradation; hydrocarbon; aeration; article; biofiltration; italy; soil pollution; soil treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031238946

The results showed that considerable amounts of nickel and lead are emitted by motor vehicles and are removed from the surface of the soil by rainfall. Higher accumulation of these metals has been observed on the surface of the soil than in soil at different depths.

Reduction at 773 K resulted in a larger rate constant for the CH4-CO2 reaction than that at 673 K. Since the amount of CO adsorbed on the catalyst decreased with an increase in the reduction temperature, the phenomenon could be understood as a result of the strong metal-support interaction (SMSI). The ability of the catalyst to dissociate CO2 was not affected by the reduction temperature, while that for the dissociation of CH4 was enhanced by increasing the reduction temperature on a per active site of catalyst basis. A higher specific activity was obtained also for the steady-state CH4-CO2 reaction by reducing the catalyst at a higher temperature, suggesting that the activation of CH4 rather than of CO2 is primarily responsible for the higher activity in the SMSI state.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748633521

The negative effects of coal on global environment, eco-systems and public health are well documented; its use must be balanced between the development needs of a country and the welfare of its people and land. The most widely used combustion technology in China and India are the subcritical pulverized coal boilers with low efficiencies resulting in the combustion of extra quantities of coal. Greater efficiencies will reduce emissions and prevent waste generation, and must be implemented in the short term. Planning should strive for increased utilization of by-products and waste. And if disposal is the only alternative, protection of waterways must be enforced. Washed-coal use in power production is the most cost-effective mean to reduce environmental impact. Coal cleaning reduces the ash content of coal and of substances such as inorganic sulfur and sodium associated with corrosion and deposition in boilers. Besides the use of washed coal offers several other advantages to the plant owner, such as increase efficiency and availability, less wear and lower maintenance cost, and reduced waste generation at the plant. Switching to coals with low sulfur content is the simplest method for reducing SO2 emissions. However, ultra-low sulfur coals may not be readily available. Nevertheless, low- to medium-sulfur coals are available in both China and India.

But during times of global warmth, such as the Cretaceous period and Eocene epoch, there are large discrepancies between model simulations of high-latitude and continental-interior temperatures and those indicated by palaeotemperature records. Here we use a global climate model for the latest Cretaceous (66 million years ago) to examine the role played by high- and middle-latitude forests in surface temperature regulation. In our simulations, this forest vegetation warms the global climate by 2.2°C. The low- albedo deciduous forests cause high-latitude land areas to warm, which then transfer more heat to adjacent oceans, thus delaying sea-ice formation and increasing winter temperatures over coastal land. Overall, the inclusion of some of the physical and physiological climate feedback effects of high-latitude forest vegetation in our simulations reduces the existing discrepancies between observed and modelled climates of the latest Cretaceous, suggesting that these forests may have made an important contribution to climate regulation during periods of global warmth.",,"carbon dioxide; article; atmosphere; carbon dioxide tension; environmental temperature; forest; global climate; greenhouse effect; priority journal; sea; vegetation; warming; Cretaceous; forest; global warming; high latitude region; palaeoclimate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030621205

The evaluation raises feasibility issues based on (1) inherent scale issues, e.g., spatial and temporal discontinuities, between LCA and most environmental processes; (2) disparities between LCA threshold and dose-response assumptions and actual environmental processes; (3) extensive use of value-based subjective judgment and opinion to create environmental categories, equivalency models, and scores; and (4) the current lack of systems to indicate whether real and relevant differences are identified. All of these issues limit or constrain the decisions that can be made solely from LCA. The origins of these issue lie in procedures and calculations that are fundamental to life-cycle inventory: data collection and aggregation across multiple system operations, allocation rules for emissions and resources, and data normalization to a study functional unit. These operations remove spatial, temporal, and other considerations, resulting in significant interpretive limitations. In addition, although often presented as a technical or scientific process, extensive value-based subjective judgments are employed throughout impact assessment. Some of these judgments compromise or conflict with scientific knowledge, e.g., when independent processes or compounds are aggregated into a numerical score. There is a significant range and mix of these scale issues, process assumptions, and subjective judgments. For example, the most useful results may be for global, long lived processes with known mechanisms. Problematic areas involve transient or local processes, those measured by biological parameters, e.g., biodiversity habitat and toxicity, and those involving independent mechanisms. As a result, one cannot quantify or predict actual environmental impacts using LCA. In some cases, current practices can generate a hazard estimate that may be useful to guide pollution prevention and resource conservation strategies. Otherwise, various scores often have no substantive support for their relevance. The evaluation helps to identify and track these issues to improve interpretation of LCA impact assessment results and suggests that a significant level of caution is needed in using LCA results for decision-making. © Copyright 1997 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Biodiversity; Conservation; Decision making; Life cycle; Natural resources; Biological parameter; Environmental process; Impact assessments; Life cycle impact assessment; Life Cycle Inventory; Pollution prevention; Resource conservation; Scientific knowledge; Environmental impact",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072499640

Their catalytic properties were tested in skeletal reactions of n-hexane. The Pt 4f XPS peaks show that Pt is predominantly in the metallic state after the treatments. After sulfidation, a minor amount of PtS can be detected in the difference spectrum (Pt unsulfided - Pt sulfided) only. The growth of the O 1s intensity after sulfidation can partly be attributed to the sulfate component. C 1s shows, as a rule, residual carbon in low amounts on sulfided samples. The S 2p band shows 4-8 at.-% S with respect to the total surface in two valence states: sulfate and sulfide, the latter including also minor amounts of organic sulfur which could arise from the sulfidation of hydrocarbonaceous residues. UPS demonstrated chemical Pt-S interaction even after 02/H2 regeneration when the Fermi-edge Pt intensity rose to a height almost equal to that of a regenerated sulfur-free Pt. ISS shows that sulfur - as opposed to carbon and oxygen - is a surface component. Sputtering effect of He+ ions used in ISS can remove sulfate while a large part of sulfide is removed during O2/H2 regeneration and/or during n-hexane test runs. Both sulfidation and carbonization strongly decrease the overall catalytic activity. The selectivity of Pt with S present mainly as sulfate was similar to that of carbonized Pt, mainly producing hexenes. Pt mainly containing sulfide, produced initially mainly methylcyclopentane, as reported also for the sulfided single crystal catalyst. Carbonized Pt could be fully regenerated by O2/H2 treatment at 600 K but the same treatment - even repeated - restored the overall activity of a sulfided Pt.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-30244494244

A total of 20 patients (40 breasts with 22 lesions) were evaluated serially with MIBI and, on the following day, with FDG. For SMM, planar and singlephoton emission tomography imaging in the prone position was performed starting at 10 min following the injection of MIBI (740 MBq). For PET, scans were acquired 45-60 min after the injection of FDG (370 MBq) and attentuation correction was performed following transmission scans. Results from SMM and PET were subsequently compared with the histopathology results. True-positive results were obtained in 12/13 primary breast cancers (mean diameter = 29 mm, range 8-53 mm) with both FDG and MIBI. False-negative results were obtained in two local recurrences (diameter &lt; 9 mm) with both FDG and MIBI. In benign disease, FDG and MIBI did not localize three fibrocystic lesions, two fibroadenomas and one inflammatory lesion (true-negative), but both localized one fibroadenoma (false-positive). Collectively, the results demonstrate a sensitivity of 92%, and a specificity of 86%, for primary breast cancer regardless of whether FDG or MIBI was used. In contrast to MIBI scintigraphy, FDG PET scored the axillae correctly as either positive (metastatic disease) or negative (no axillary disease) in all 12 patients. The tumour/non-tumour ratio for MIBI was 1.97 (range 1.43-3.1). The mean standard uptake value (SUV) for FDG uptake was 2.57 (range 0.3-6.2). The diagnostic accuracy of SMM was equivalent to that of FDG PET for the detection of primary breast cancer.

We determined whether this mound was occupied by plants with higher CO2 assimilation rate. Plant cover on and off the mound was determined. Three woody species with high cover were selected for further investigation. Two deep‐rooted species, Rhigozum obovatum Burch. and Eriocephalus ericoides (L.f.) Druce, showed greater net CO2 assimilation rates on the mound. Net CO2 assimilation rates for the third species, Pentzia incana (Thunb.) Kuntze were similar both on and off the mound. In an attempt to find a mechanistic basis for the elevated CO2 assimilation rates, the relationships between soil factors, foliar nutrients and CO2 assimilation capacity were also examined. Our results suggest that the elevated net CO2 assimilation was not mediated via improved soil or plant water relations on the actively greening mound, nor through a difference in nitrogen levels in the soil or plant material, but possibly by way of the higher sub‐soil phosphorus levels measured from the geochemical mound. Genotype and cover cannot alone be used for rangeland condition assessment since localized elevated soil nutrient status (patchiness) contributes to greater photosynthetic carbon gain which may confer superior browsing responses to plants occurring on these mounds. © 1997 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","NDVI; Nutrients",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843077121

Kiruna is the right spot for scientists to have an hawk eyes view of the situation of earth and to study what's going on in space. This is because here technology, logistics, expertise and nature coincide in unique ways. Remote sensing techniques are developing rapidly and high data resolution makes it possible with more advanced studies of ecosystems. Changes in vegetation types, pollution effects, biodiversity and land use could successfully be analyzed by satellite data. The ecosystems of the Scandinavian mountain range show many of the characteristics that are typical of the tundra. In fact, the mountain range could be regarded as an extension of the tundra well into the boreal zone. We still find several of the large predatory species as bear, wolverine and lynx in the region. Reindeer husbandry is an ancient activity of the Sami people. The accessibility of these areas are very good from an global perspective and provide excellent possibilities for research in the transition zone between boreal forest and the tundra. From this point of view, the establishment of the Environment and Space Research Institute that to its nature is non-invasive could take full advantage of the possibilities offered in Kiruna. At present four programs are launched, Environmental Satellite Data Center (MDC), Climate impact Research Center (CIRC), Center for Atmospheric Research and Sociogeographic Environment Center (SMC). These space related research programs in climate change, ecology, atmospheric chemistry and the social dimension of environmental change, will contribute substantially to our knowledge of the earth's unique position in the solarsystem, improve our understanding of the biosphere and to find solutions of global environmental problems. This will put Kiruna in unique position as a center of excellence in environment and space research and lead Kiruna into the age of Gaia. We can now really look upon the earth as one single organism.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5244376839

The results indicate the existence of a high correlation between precipitation and discharge fields in the area considered, except for the hydrological stations closely below Peruća lake where human influence is significant.

Maria 53, I-56126 Pisa, Italy","The modeling of the solubility of water and carbon dioxide in silicate liquids (flash problem) is performed by assuming mechanical, thermal and chemical equilibrium between the liquid magma and the gas phase. The liquid phase is treated as a mixture of ten silicate components + H2O or CO2, and the gas phase as a pure H2O or CO2. A general model for the solubility of a volatile component in a liquid is adopted. This requires the definition of a mixing equation for the excess Gibbs free energy of the liquid phase and an appropriate reference state for the dissolved volatile. To constrain the model parameters and identify the most appropriate form of the solubility equations for each dissolved volatile, a large number of experimental solubility determinations (640 for H2O and 263 for CO2) have been used. These determinations cover a large region of the P-T-composition space of interest. The resultant water and carbon dioxide solubility models differ in that the water model is regular and isometric, and the carbon dioxide model is regular and non-isometric. This difference is consistent with the different speciation modalities of the two volatiles in the silicate liquids, producing a composition-independent partial molar volume of dissolved water and a composition-dependent partial molar volume of dissolved carbon dioxide. The H2O solubility model may be applied to natural magmas of virtually any composition in the P-T range 0.1 MPa-1 GPa and &gt; 1000 K, whereas the CO2 solubility model may be applied to several GPa pressures. The general consistency of the water solubility data and their relatively large number as compared to the calibrated model parameters (11) contrast with the large inconsistencies of the carbon dioxide solubility determinations and their low number with respect to the CO2 model parameters (22). As a result, most of the solubility data in the database are reproduced within 10% of approximation in the case of water, and 30% in the case of carbon dioxide. When compared with the experimental data, the H2O and CO2 solubility models correctly predict many features of the saturation surface in the P-T-composition space, including the change from retrograde to prograde H2O solubility in albitic liquids with increasing pressure, the so-called alkali effect, the increasing CO2 solubility with increasing degree of silica undersaturation, the Henrian behavior of CO2 in most silicate liquids up to about 30-50 MPa, and the proportionality between the fugacity in the gas phase, or the saturation activity in the liquid phase, and the square of the mole fraction of the dissolved volatile found in some unrelated silicate liquid compositions.",,"carbon dioxide; silicate melt; solubility; water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031445240

Their photon spectra, which are almost all caused by electron bremsstrahlung radiation, show significant deviations from a simple power-law form. These are attributed to the deviations in the spectra of the accelerated electrons. We develop three stochastic acceleration models to explain the shape of the photon spectra: the hard sphere model, the whistler wave model, and a more general, but still simplified, stochastic acceleration model. For photon emissions, we use a simple sum of the thin target emission from the trapped electrons at the acceleration site near the loop top and the thick target emission from the escaping electrons which travel along the magnetic field lines and radiate in the denser chromosphere at the footpoints. We find that the hard sphere model does not fit any of the flares and can be ruled out. The other two models show that the high-energy cutoff in the two GRS flares can be attributed to synchrotron radiation losses in the presence of a 500 G magnetic field at the acceleration site. The observed break in the photon spectra of all four flares around 1 MeV is attributed to a combination of the energy dependence of the escape time of particles out of the acceleration region and the change in the energy dependence of the bremsstrahlung cross section between the nonrelativistic and relativistic regimes. Further steepening of the spectrum at even lower energies is caused by Coulomb losses at the acceleration site. We find that acceleration timescales as low as ∼ 1 s are possible with a ratio of turbulent to the magnetic field energy densities of ∼10-4. We also set limits on the plasma density, the size of the acceleration region, and the spectrum of the plasma turbulence. © 1997. The American Astronomical Society.

A revised mole-balance formulation that includes an uncertainty term for each chemical and isotopic datum is derived. The revised formulation is comprised of mole-balance equations for each element or element redox state, alkalinity, electrons, solvent water, and each isotope; a charge-balance equation and an equation that relates the uncertainty terms for pH, alkalinity, and total dissolved inorganic carbon for each aqueous solution: inequality constraints on the size of the uncertainty terms: and inequality constraints on the sign of the mole transfer of reactants. The equations and inequality constraints are solved by a modification of the simplex algorithm combined with an exhaustive search for unique combinations of aqueous solutions and reactants for which the equations and inequality constraints can be solved and the uncertainty terms minimized. Additional algorithms find only the simplest mole-balance models and determine the ranges of mixing fractions for each solution and mole transfers for each reactant that are consistent with specified limits on the uncertainty terms. The revised formulation produces simpler and more robust mole-balance models and allows the significance of mixing fractions and mole transfers to be evaluated. In an example from the central Oklahoma aquifer, inclusion of up to 5% uncertainty in the chemical data can reduce the number of reactants in mole-balance models from seven or more to as few as three, these being cation exchange, dolomite dissolution, and silica precipitation. In another example from the Madison aquifer; inclusion of the charge-balance constraint requires significant increases in the mole transfers of calcite, dolomite, and organic matter, which reduce the estimated maximum carbon 14 age of the sample by about 10,000 years, from 22,700 years to 12.600 years.",,"chemical composition; flow path; groundwater processes; isotopic composition; mole balance model; Aquifers; Constraint theory; Geochemistry; Isotopes; Linear programming; Mixing; pH; Precipitation (chemical); Solutions; Charge balance equation; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Dolomite dissolution; Equations and inequalities; Inequality constraint; Isotopic composition; Mole balance model; Silica precipitation; Alkalinity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030745481

We compared the performance of ANNs and regression models (RM) in predicting ecosystems attributes. with special emphasis on temporal (interannual) predictions of functional attributes of the ecosystem at regional scales. We tested the predictive power of ANNs and RMs using simulated data for six functional traits derived from the seasonal course of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI): the annual integral of the NDVI curve (NDVI-I), the maximum (MAX) and minimum (MIN) NDVI, the date of the MAX NDVI (DM) and the date of start (SGS) and end (EGS) of the growing season. For one of these traits (NDVI-I), we also generated a set of data that incorporated the effects of the state of the system in previous years (inertial effects). Even simple non-linearities in the actual functional form of the relationship between environmental variables and ecosystem attributes preclude a precise prediction of these attributes when the rules are not explicit. That was evident for predictions based on both ANNs and RMs under absolutely deterministic conditions (error-free scenario). Non-linearities in the simulated traits of the NDVI curve derive from multiplicative terms in the models. Under the presence of these non-linear terms, a different aggregation of the driving variables (monthly vs. annual or quarterly climatic data) reduce substantially the ability of both RMs and ANNs to predict the independent variable. For the six traits analyzed, the ANNs were able to make better predictions than RMs. The correlation between observed and predicted values of each of the six traits considered was higher for the ANNs than for the RMs. ANNs showed clear advantages to capture inertial effects. The ANN used was able to use previous year information on climate to estimate current year NDVI-1 much better than the RM that used the same input information.","Aboveground net primary production; Artificial neural networks; Grasslands; Normalized difference vegetation index; Prediction; Regression models; Remote sensing","artificial neural network; ecosystem function; grassland; predictive tool; regression model; remote sensing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031591149

An external movable screen (EMS) mounted over the greenhouse roof can control radiation level and temperature, and give additional protection from various climate related diseases and sudden weather changes. The EMS is more efficient in humid areas where the evaporative cooling methods are not sufficient; it is more energy conservative then a constant screen laid on the greenhouse roof since it is applied only when radiation conditions require it. To predict the microclimate inside a commercial greenhouse equipped with an EMS a one dimensional numerical model was adapted. Measured meteorological parameters inside the greenhouse were used to test the model performance. Good agreement between the predicted and measured parameters was achieved. This model provides the grower with an efficient tool capable to determine the most efficient screen for his greenhouse (before setting up the screen) with respect to the local climate conditions and specific crop needs as well as economical considerations.","Humidity; Optimal control; Temperature",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-71449098131

However, below- ground microbial processes are likely to be affected through altered plant inputs at elevated CO2. A major component of plant input is derived from litter fall and root turnover. Inputs also derive from rhizodeposition (loss of C-compounds from active root systems) which may account for up to 40% of photoassimilate. This input fuels the activity of complex microbial communities around roots. These communities are centrally important not only to plant-microbe interactions and consequent effects on plant growth, but also, through their high relative activity and abundance, to microbially mediated processes in soil generally. This review focuses on approaches to measure C-flow from roots, in particular, as affected by increased atmospheric CO2 concentration. The available evidence for impacts on microbial communities inhabiting this niche, which constitutes an interface for possible perturbations on terrestrial ecosystems through the influence of environmental change, will also be discussed. While methodologies for measuring effects of increased CO2 concentration on plant growth, physiology and C-partitioning are abundant and widely reported, there is relatively little information on plant-mediated effects on soil microbial communities and processes. Importantly, many studies have also neglected to recognize that any secondary effects on microbial communities may have profound effects on plant parameters measured in relation to environmental change. We critically review approaches which have been used to measure rhizodeposition under conditions of increased atmospheric CO2 concentration, and then consider evidence for changes in microbial communities and processes, and the methodologies which have been recently developed, and are appropriate to study such changes. © 1997 Blackwell Science Ltd.","C-flow; Elevated CO2; Microorganisms; Rhizodeposition; Rhizosphere; Soil processes","carbon dioxide; environmental change; microorganism; rhizosphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031397425

For several years there has been discussion of the possible introduction of commuter jet aircraft into the Toronto City Centre airport, as part of the regular scheduled service. Presently, under the terms of the extant Tri-partite Agreement governing the operation of the airport, jet aircraft are prohibited from using the airport, except for certain circumstances (e.g, medivac). To assess the impact that the inclusion of commuter jet aircraft would have on the quantities of pollutants generated at the airport, aircraft emission inventories were calculated. A baseline inventory was established for 1992. Annual totals range from: CO 223.0-294.1 t, NOx 8.3 t, HC 5.4-6.4 t, SOx 0.6 t, CO2 3.5-3.7 kt, and N2O 0.3 t. With the present runway configuration, only two commuter jets can land at the airport, the BAe-146 and the Fokker-70. Just under 63,000 aircraft movements can be added annually without impinging on present traffic patterns, and developing lengthy delays. A number of different scenarios were considered, and the range of the estimated annual totals would increase to: CO 326-420 t, NOx 82.2-146 t, HC 22.3-28.5 t, SOx 4.6-7.9 t, CO2 25.9-46.1 kt, and N2O 2.3-4.0 t.

The Plan is failing completely, because of its essentially voluntary nature. Overall, greenhouse gas emissions will have increased 13 per cent in Canada between 1990 and 2000, four per cent more than the population increase for that period. Five other plans studied by government agencies are projected to fail to achieve the called-for reductions in emission. An analogous plan, the Rational Energy Plan, developed by a network of nongovernment organizations, is projected to enable the federal government to achieve its obligations under the Framework Convention and also its further obligations under the 1995 Berlin Mandate. This Plan has been analyzed using the government's own analytical tools which project that it will offer Canada substantial annual increases in employment for at least ten years, more prosperous households for more than ten years, and a smaller federal deficit for at least eight years. The federal government has no viable alternative to adopting this plan as soon as practicable. This paper explains some of the needed preliminaries to introducing the Plan, together with examples of tax-shifting and of easily implemented stick-and-carrot inducements to making the Plan work in a sea of partly hostile provinces (Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario and Newfoundland). The Plan will not be easy to implement because of necessary changes in human habits of thinking and attitudes. A new and simple strategy for reducing fuel wastage on highways is introduced in this paper; and also the concept of extended cogeneration, the Rational Energy Plan itself being a particularly fine example.",,"climate change; environmental policy; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031420111

Global estimates of this sink capacity are in the order of 20-30 Pg C over the next 50-100 years. Management practices to build up soil C must increase the input of organic matter to soil and/or decrease soil organic matter decomposition rates. The most appropriate management practices to increase soil C vary regionally, dependent on both environmental and socioeconomic factors. In temperate regions, key strategies involve increasing cropping frequency and reducing bare fallow, increasing the use of perennial forages (including N- fixing species) in crop rotations, retaining crop residues and reducing or eliminating tillage (i.e. no-till). In North America and Europe, conversion of marginal arable land to permanent perennial vegetation, to protect fragile soils and landscapes and/or reduce agricultural surpluses, provides additional opportunities for C sequestration. In the tropics, increasing C inputs to soil through improving the fertility and productivity of cropland and pastures is essential. In extensive systems with vegetated fallow periods (e.g. shifting cultivation), planted fallows and cover crops can increase C levels over the cropping cycle. Use of no-till, green manures and agroforestry are other beneficial practices. Overall, improving the productivity and sustainability of existing agricultural lands is crucial to help reduce the rate of new land clearing, from which large amounts of CO2 from biomass and soil are emitted to the atmosphere. Some regional analyses of soil C sequestration and sequestration potential have been performed, mainly for temperate industrialized countries. More are needed, especially for the tropics, to capture region-specific interactions between climate, soil and management resources that are lost in global level assessments. By itself, C sequestration in agricultural soils can make only modest contributions (e.g. 3-6% of total fossil C emissions) to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. However, effective mitigation policies will not be based on any single 'magic bullet' solutions, but rather on many modest reductions which are economically efficient and which confer additional benefits to society. In this context, soil C sequestration is a significant mitigation option. Additional advantages of pursuing strategies to increase soil C are the added benefits of improved soil quality for improving agricultural productivity and sustainability.","Agricultural soils; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Emission; Retention","agricultural soil; carbon emissions; emissions control; soil management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031414815

The model is modified from the Farquhar-von Caeremeter-Berry model by explicitly including metabolite pools and the effects of light activation and deactivation of Calvin cycle enzymes. It is coupled to a dynamic stomatal conductance model, with the assimilation rate at any time being determined by the joint effects of the dynamic biochemical model and the stomatal conductance model on the intercellular CO2 pressure. When parametrized for each species, the rondel was shown to exhibit responses to step changes in photon flux density that agreed closely with the observed responses for both the understory plant Alocasia macrorrhiza and the crop plant Glycine max. Comparisons of measured and simulated photosynthesis under simulated light regimes having natural patterns of lightfleck frequencies and durations showed that the simulated total for Alocasia was within ±4% of the measured total assimilation, but that both were 12-50% less than the predictions from a steady-state solution of the model. Agreement was within ±10% for Glycine max, and only small differences were apparent between the dynamic and steady-state predictions. The model may therefore be parametrized for quite different species, and is shown to reflect more accurately the dynamics of photosynthesis than earlier dynamic models.","Alocasia macrorrhiza; Araceae; Fabaceae; Glycine max; light regulation; lightfleck use efficiency; photosynthetic induction; soybean; stomatal conductance; sunflecks","Alocasia; Alocasia macrorrhizos; Araceae; Fabaceae; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030900845

In aqueous solution, with excitation at 335 nm, the emission fluorescence spectrum of quinine varied with pH reflecting the occurrence of different charged species of the drug. In all cases, the emission maximum centered at 383 or 443 nm shifted to lower wavelength in the presence of vesicles. This indicates that the membrane-bound state quinine is in an environment of low polarity. Drug monocationic species were deeply buried in DMPG relative to DMPA bilayers whereas no significant differences were observed for dicationic species, the fluorophore being located in this case in a more aqueous-like environment. Experimental association isotherms generated from fluorescence intensity changes were quantitatively analyzed in terms of the binding equilibrium model. Although the binding affinity of quinine to anionic membranes was always higher for DMPG over DMPA, dicationic species showed a reduced ability to bind the negatively charged membrane. In addition, the binding model has been related with the partition model leading to a good agreement between the theoretical (calculated from the binding model) and the experimental (from the initial slope of the experimental isotherms) partition coefficient derived in each case. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.","Fluorescence spectroscopy; Lipid vesicles; Quinine",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0012357547

These were home to significant manufacturing and repair facilities that, when fully operating, generated over 100 tons per year of nitrogen oxide and ozone precursor compound emissions. As the bases close, these emissions are dropping, and there is an opportunity to gain credit for them through emissions banking. In order to distribute these emission reductions to meet both the needs of the government and the local redevelopment objectives, an allocation plan was developed. The allocation plan included generating emission reduction credits from the shutdown of permitted air emission sources. This paper highlights the benefits of early planning for emission reductions and subsequent allocation of those emission reductions in the case of the closure of Naval facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area. It illustrates that early planning can ensure that the needs of the military and local community are satisfied and that the highest quantity of bankable emission reductions are identified, and properly quantified and documented, and that emission reduction credits (ERCs) are generated. This paper also presents lessons learned from the experience of banking emissions from closing Navy facilities.",,"Air quality; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Resource allocation; Strategic planning; Emission reduction credits (ERC); Air pollution control",Conference Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031343440

The higher level of crystallinity obtained from nuclear magnetic resonance and Raman measurements suggests the possibility of nucleation and oriented crystallization of polyolefins upon the LCP phase during the orientation process. Wide-angle X-ray powder diffraction data from unoriented and uniaxially oriented films of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) containing LCP analyzed by the Rietveld method reveal that the dimensions of the orthorhombic unit cell are not affected but the crystallite size and the orientation parameters are changed. Furthermore, changes in transport properties of these materials are observed. In particular, the chemical resistance to hydrocarbons of uniaxially oriented HDPE containing LCP molecules improves significantly in comparison with untreated samples. In additon to orientation, all data suggest that lowering solvent permeability on drawing may be related to changes occurring in crystalline and amorphous regions of HDPE. Chemical resistance enhancement also is confirmed for biaxially oriented films of HDPE, linear low-density polyethylene and polypropylene containing low levels of LCPs. In all cases, molecular orientation does not appear as the single cause of reduced permeability to hydrocarbons. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Crystallization; Liquid crystalline polymer; Orientation; Phase composition; Polyolefins","Chemical resistance; Crystal orientation; Crystallization; Liquid crystal polymers; Mechanical permeability; Molecular orientation; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Nucleation; Transport properties; X ray powder diffraction; Rietveld method; High density polyethylenes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031277227

An analysis is made of the spectra obtained by the optical and photoacoustic as well as by the Raman techniques; results are compared with the theory taking into account the light absorption and scattering for the visible region and the influence of the phonons' scattering on the shape of the corresponding absorption bands for the infra-red region. We found that the coloration caused by the annealing of the doped glass at 100°C is basically due to the individual Cu and Fe ions in interstitial sites. After annealing at 300°C and higher temperatures in oxygen atmosphere the doping atoms enter substitutionally for Si; part of them form colloidal particles of the corresponding metal oxide. The latter exhibit both absorption and scattering which determine the glass color. Annealing under reduction conditions leads to the formation of Cu and Cu2O particles producing a deeper coloration; interaction of the former particles with carbon (graphite) coating causes a specific changes in the Raman spectra which could be attributed to the SERS - Surface Enhanced Raman Scattering.","Colloids; Doping; Light absorption and scattering; Raman scattering; Silica glass; Sol-gel technology","Annealing; Characterization; Copper; Doping (additives); Fused silica; Iron; Light absorption; Optical glass; Phonons; Raman scattering; Spectrum analysis; Copper doped silica; Iron doped silica; Optical characterization; Optical phonon excitation; Sol-gel method; Surface enhanced Raman scattering; Optical testing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031393866

These layers have been analyzed by Raman scattering, in correlation with XRD, XPS and TEM. These data show that for implant temperature of 500°C (crystalline target), carbon is not incorporated in substitutional sites, and β-SiC precipitates aligned with the implanted matrix are formed. The residual strain and the degree of missorientation of these precipitates depend on the strain, defects and bond length of the implanted matrix. Moreover, precipitation of β-SiC in the implanted region causes an enhanced Ge migration, mainly towards the surface. This determines a Ge enrichment and consequent relaxation of the Si1-xGex matrix. This contrasts with the room temperature implants performed in preamorphized Si layers, where carbon incorporation in substitutional sites (Cs) takes place after thermal annealing. The maximum amount of Cs is found for the implanted dose corresponding to a peak carbon concentration of 1.3%. For higher doses, there is a degradation of the crystal quality of the recrystallized layer.","Ion implantation; Raman scattering; SiCy; SiGexCy; Silicon carbide","Annealing; Characterization; Crystal defects; Ion implantation; Raman scattering; Semiconducting silicon compounds; Silicon alloys; Spectroscopic analysis; Strain measurement; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction analysis; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Degree of misorientation; Ion beam synthesis; Residual strain; Silicon germanium carbide; Silicon carbide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031391348

The aim is to reduce the exceeding of critical peak values of the CSO components at critical time intervals. Control decisions will be based on continuous measurements in the sewer system and in the receiving stream. Furthermore the measurements are carried out to determine the effects (both hydraulic and chemical) of particular CSO discharges in order to evolve the critical values for the project area.

Both parameterizations of surface-atmosphere exchanges may be considered as complex but represent the soil hydrology and the role of vegetation in very different ways. The global impact of the change in land surface scheme on the simulated climate appears to be small. Changes are smaller than those obtained when comparing either one of these schemes to the fixed hydrology used in the standard CCM2. Nevertheless, at the regional scale, changing the land-surface scheme can have a large impact on the local climate. As one example, we detail how circulation patterns are modified above the Tibetan plateau during the monsoon season. Elsewhere, mainly over land, changes can also be important. In the tropics, during the dry season, Sechiba produces warmer surface temperatures than does BATS.

The low soil Eh resulted in inhibition of root elongation shortly after treatment initiation. Root elongation was reduced as soil Eh approached values below ca. +350 mV. Substantial decrease in root elongation was noted when soil Eh fell below +200 mV. Generally, net photosynthetic rate (P(N)) decreased as soil Eh was reduced, with substantial reductions in P(N) found when Eh approached negative values.

The reductions in root elongation and P(N) in response to low soil Eh indicated the adverse effects of low soil Eh on plant functioning and the need for periods of soil aeration that allow plants to resume normal functioning. Thus periods of drainage allowing soil aeration during the growing season appear to be critical to S. alterniflora by providing favorable conditions for root growth and gas exchange with important implications for plant carbon fixation.","Anaerobiosis; Leaf conductance; Plant-soil interactions; Redox potential; Rhizotron; Wetland plants","carbon dioxide fixation; photosynthesis; plant growth; plant metabolism; rooting; United States; Spartina alterniflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031295336

Significant questions regarding confounding effects due to weather, indoor exposures and co-pollutants (that accompany particulate matter) stubbornly remain. In order to address the recent research findings, methodological limitations, and remaining uncertainties, a colloquium (having 20 sessions and over 100 papers) was held in Park City, UT, May 1-3, 1996. By topic, over 30 papers related to epidemiological methods and findings; over 25 papers related to exposure assessment and sampling; 10 papers related to particle deposition and clearance; 15 papers related to mechanisms of injury; about 15 papers related to total, indoor or occupational exposures; 8 papers related to research strategies; 6 papers related to public policy; and 5 papers related to summarizing the current state of knowledge in various areas of research. The colloquium explored knowns and uncertainties related to particulate material from the perspective of several scientific disciplines. Results of this colloquium included the identification of several suspect causal pollutants, the introduction of new methods for sampling and characterizing particulate material, and new aerosol dosimetry predictions relating to potentially sensitive sub-populations. In addition, a convergence of knowledge on particulate health effects across several research disciplines is evident, and several specific research projects were proposed to help resolve the remaining uncertainties.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33747517609

The cleanness of the tungsten substrate can be justified from both high surface 4f core emission and sharp surface states in the valence-band spectra. Upon Ba (Cs) adsorption, the work function is lowered to 2.02 (1.76) eV, corresponding to one third of a monolayer. Further, the two symmetric high-lying surface states move little in energy but quench rapidly in intensity and diminish at the work-function minimum. On the other hand, the low-lying surface state at 1.41 eV shifts about 215 meV toward higher binding energy and reduces its emission at thicker coverage. The bonding of the Ba d orbital with the W d-like surface states is not found, in contrast to the theoretical calculation and angle-resolved inverse photoemission study of Ba on W(100).

The procedure to insert this data in the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) is described. Simulations are presented for a monthly simulation of summer weather in the United States, for case studies of cumulonimbus convection along a dryline in the Great Plains of the U.S. and over northern Georgia, and for pollutant dispersal in South Carolina. These results demonstrate the significant role that landscape, including its spatial heterogeneity, has on weather and climate. Environmental policy-makers need to consider this feedback to weather and climate, rather than just assuming the atmosphere is an external factor to such issues as ecosystem management and water resource management. This feedback between the atmosphere and the land surface needs to be considered on all spatial scales from the plot scale to the global scale. This includes studies being performed at the Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites that have been established throughout the United States.

Future emissions from wood waste could be even higher if waste piles must be converted to landfills by soil capping in order to comply with national criteria for solid waste disposal. In order to estimate current and potential methane emission rates a set of field and laboratory measurements were undertaken. Gas samples for analysis of methane and CO2 were collected from the surface of sawdust piles using chambers placed on the pile surface, and at depths of 1.5, 3.0 and 4.6 m using a sampling probe. Two piles in each of the following age ranges were sampled: 0-1, 1-4, 3-5, and 5-8 years. In the laboratory study, sawdust samples from the 3.0 m depth were incubated under 20% CO2 in nitrogen at 32, 40 and 48°C to simulate the temperature range and anaerobic conditions occurring in typical sawdust piles. Field measurements indicated that methane comprised 20% of the biogas generated from sawdust piles. Emissions from the pile surface averaged 1.68 mg m-2 h-1 compared to literature estimates from landfills on the order of 0.125-125,000 mg m-2 h-1, with the low emission rates suggesting that a large percentage of the methane produced was either oxidized or otherwise consumed before reaching the pile surface. Emissions to the atmosphere estimated from annual sawdust production in the Tennessee Valley range from 15-44 metric tons per year. Incubation studies indicated highest methane generation at 32°C with a reduction in emissions in excess of 70% when the temperature was increased to 48°C. Estimates of methane production indicate that soil capping of disposed sawdust could increase methane production by 2-2.5 times over the biodegradation lifetime of the sawdust stored on-site. Assuming the global warming potential of methane is 21 times that of CO2, combustion of wood waste rather than on-site storage or capping would provide a CO2 offset of 1.2 or 3.8 tons, respectively, for each ton of sawdust burned.Gaseous emission rates from wood waste were analyzed by collecting samples of methane and carbon dioxide (CO2) from sawdust piles. The sawdust samples were incubated under 20% CO2 in nitrogen to simulate temperature range and anaerobic conditions. Field measurements showed 20% methane in the biogas produced from sawdust piles. Highest methane generation was observed at 32 °C, with reduced emissions in excess of 70% when temperature was increased to 48 °C.

Shortwave radiation is treated using a two-stream, delta-Eddington approximation developed for Version 2 of the NCAR Community Climate Model. This code offers many improvements over the original radiative transfer code developed by Dudhia [1989], including a more detailed treatment of surface albedo, solar absorption by ozone, and improved treatment of liquid, ice, and mixed-phase clouds. Longwave radiative calculations are performed with the broadband radiative transfer code currently employed in Version 3 of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (EC3) model. Improvements offered by EC3 include longwave radiative absorption by ozone and trace gases and the explicit radiative treatment of mixed-phase clouds. The importance of radiation in the formation of low-level Arctic stratus and the evolution of an anticyclone is illustrated with three simulations: (1) baseline simulation using the Dudhia [1989] radiative transfer, (2) improved radiative transfer (i.e., CCM2 shortwave and EC3 longwave), and (3) radiative transfer neglected. The area extent of low clouds is reduced toward observed values when improved radiative transfer is implemented. The temperature, moisture, and cloud water profiles show significant sensitivity to the treatment of radiative transfer as well. Comparisons between observations and model results show that the new radiation package improves the area extent of cloud cover and the quality of the simulated surface radiative fluxes. The importance of radiative cooling in the evolution of a Beaufort Sea anticyclone is demonstrated.

For example, anthropogenic sulphates have been found to have a significant cooling effect. Halocarbons, once thought to be the most potent greenhouse gases, are now believed to have only a slight global warming effect because they destroy ozone, itself a strong greenhouse gas. Furthermore, case studies in various regions of the world have improved our ability to predict future damages from global warming. These developments have strong implications for the economic consequences of the greenhouse effect and motivated an update of the PAGE model.

We analyse the different association of emission features at microwaves, decimeter waves, and soft and hard X-rays for the events. The first flare has well-defined emission features in microwaves and soft and hard X-rays, and a faint decimetric signature well after the hard X-ray burst. It is not certain if the decimetric event is connected to the burst features. The second event is characterized by an almost simultaneous appearance of hard X-ray burst maxima and decimetric narrowband drift bursts, but soft X-ray emission is missing from the event. With the exception of the possibility that the soft X-ray emission is absorbed along the way, the following models can explain the reported differences in the second event: (1) Microwave emission in the second event is produced by ≤ 150 keV electrons spiraling in the magnetic field relatively low in the corona, while the hard X-ray emission is produced at the beginning of the burst near the loop top as thick-target emission. If the bulk of electrons entered the loop, the low-energy electrons would not be effectively mirrored and would eventually hit the footpoints and cause soft X-ray emission by evaporation, which was not observed. The collisions at the loop top would not produce observable plasma heating. The observed decimetric type III bursts could be created by plasma oscillations caused by electron beams traveling along the magnetic field lines at low coronal heights. (2) Microwave emission is caused by electrons with MeV energies trapped in the large magnetic loops, and the electrons are effectively mirrored from the loop footpoints. The hard X-ray emission can come both from the loop top and the loop footpoints as the accelerated lower energy electrons are not mirrored. The low-energy electrons are not, however, sufficient to create observable soft X-ray emission. The type III emission in this case could be formed either at low coronal heights or in local thick regions in the large loops, high in the corona.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031487503

Blackland Rd., Temple, TX 76502, United States","Extensive rangelands and other vegetation types that we know today formed while atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration was low (50 to 75% of today's concentration). Fossil fuel burning and deforestation and other land use changes during the last 200 years have increased CO2 concentration by about 30%, to the present 360 parts per million (ppm). Atmospheric CO2 will continue to rise during the next century, possibly to concentrations that are unprecedented for the last several million years. Much of the potential importance of CO2 concentration to vegetation derives from its influence on plant carbon balance and water relations. Plants grow by assimilating CO2 that diffuses into leaves through stomatal pores. Inevitably associated with CO2 uptake is transpirational loss of water vapor through stomata. Transpiration rates usually decline as CO2 increases, while, in many plants, photosynthesis and growth increase. These 'primary' responses to CO2 can lead to a multitude of changes at the plant and ecosystem levels, ranging from alteration of the chemical composition of plant tissues to changes in ecosystem function and the species composition of plant communities. The direct physiological responses of plants to CO2 and expression of these responses at higher scales differ among species and growing conditions. Growth response to CO2 is usually highest in rapidly-growing plants that quickly export the carbohydrates formed in leaves and use them for storage or new growth and allocate a high proportion of fixed carbon to produce leaves. Growth is also more responsive to CO2 in plants with the C3 (most woody plants and 'cool-season' grasses) than C4 photosynthetic pathway (most 'warm-season' grasses). These and other differences among species could lead to changes in the composition of rangeland vegetation, but generalizations are difficult. On many rangelands, species abundances are determined more by morphological and phenological attributes that influence plant access to essential resources like nitrogen and light and reaction to fire, grazing, and other disturbances than by physiological traits that are sensitive to CO2 concentration. Species composition probably will be most responsive to CO2 on moderately water-limited and disturbed rangelands where multiple positive effects of CO2 on plant water relations can be expressed and competition for light is minimized. Greatest initial changes in species composition likely will occur on C3/C4 grasslands and at the transition between grasslands and woodlands. Plant production should also increase on water-limited rangelands, but CO2 may have little influence on production when nutrient elements like nitrogen are severely limiting.","Grasses; Nitrogen; Photosynthesis; Primary production; Transpiration; Vegetation change; Water use efficiency","Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030828080

The trend of lung cancer mortality in Mexico City from 1979-1993 was determined, as was the rate ratio of lung cancer mortality in 31 states in Mexico, taking Mexico City as a reference by means of a Poisson model. A strong linear regression model was used to evaluate the rate, where the dependent variable was LC mortality rate and the independent variable the year observed In 15 years, 73,807 deaths from LC were reported, with an increase in mortality from 5.01-7.25 per 100,000 inhabitants. Mortality increases significantly after 60 years of age (β≠0, p<.05) in men and in women. Mortality from LC was 70% in men, and more than 60% of deaths were reported after 65 years of age. Mortality risk is higher in the northern states of the country (e.g., Sonora, RR = 2.40) than in the southern region (e.g., Oaxaca RR = 0.40). In Mexico, almost 10,000 deaths by LC are estimated for the year 2010. Therefore, changes in lifestyle should be encouraged in order to decrease the smoking habit. The governmental tax on cigarettes should be increased, smoking restricted in squares and public spaces, and the risks should be announced on cigarette packages, among other measures. With respect to other emergent risk factors, the sources of industrial pollution and toxic emissions should be regulated.","Lung cancer; Mortality rate ratioo; Tobacco; Trend","adult; age; aged; article; cancer mortality; cigarette smoking; human; lifestyle; lung cancer; major clinical study; mexico; regression analysis; risk; smoking habit; statistical model; tax; Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mexico; Middle Aged; Mortality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031467793

Water samples were analyzed for nutrient (ammonium, nitrate, phosphate, silicate), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and SPM concentrations, bacterial cell density and activity, and zooplankton composition and density. The SPM samples were analyzed for particulate organic carbon (POC), plant pigment (chlorophyll and pheopigment) and major metal (Al, Mn, Tl, V) content as well as stable isotopic (δ13C) composition of the POC. Willamette waters displayed significantly higher nutrient and DOC concentrations than those in the mainstem Columbia or any of the smaller tributaries. Elevated nutrient and DOC concentrations are attributed to runoff from the extensive agricultural lands found throughout the Willamette Valley. Regardless of collection site, total A1 content of all riverborne particles was high (5.8 ± 0.5% by weight), indicating total SPM mass was predominantly (~ 70%) detrital mineral. Nonetheless, the majority of riverborne organic matter was not allochthonous but rather derived from healthy phytoplankton as indicated by high chlorophyll a to POC (ChI:POC) values. Chlorophyll a concentration increased by almost 100% downstream in the mainstem Columbia between Bonneville Dam and the estuary. This apparent increase in phytoplankton biomass was not accompanied by a parallel decrease in any nutrient concentration probably because non-point source additions occurred all along the drainage and compensated for nutrient loss due to phytoplankton growth. Despite nutrient concentrations near eutrophic levels, phytoplankton biomass in the Willamette was significantly lower than that in the mainstem Columbia. This particular contrast between the Willamette and the mainstem Columbia is likely due to light limitation imposed on the phytoplankton by specific differences in the mixing dynamics of the two flow regimes. POC in Willamette waters displayed a 50% reduced chlorophyll content and 2-2.5% 13C-depletion relative to that present in waters from the mainstem Columbia. These compositional dissimilarities may simply reflect physiological difference between the diatom communities that comprised the bulk of phytoplankton in these two systems at the time of sampling. Alternatively, they may be caused by greater contribution of POC from non-phytoplankton sources in the Willamette. An argument is advanced suggesting that methanotrophy has contributed up to 5% of the POC that was measured in the Willamette River at the time of our study.","Composition; Methanotrophy; Organic carbon; Phytoplankton production; Suspended particulate material","nutrient; organic carbon; particulate matter; phytoplankton; suspended particulate matter; zooplankton; Canada, British Columbia, Columbia River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031463231

Box 174, Pleasanton, CA 94566, United States","Nitrous oxide (N2O) is an important constituent of the atmosphere because it is not only the dominant source of ozone (O3) destroying odd nitrogen in the stratosphere but also a greenhouse gas. Unfortunately, the classical chemistry of N2O has at least two problems, namely, (1) a possible source gap in the source-sink budget and (2) difficulties in explaining the observed heavy isotope enrichments. While the source gap can, in principle, be closed by sources of the classical type, the observed isotopic anomaly calls for atmospheric sources and sinks. This need motivated the present study, which has brought to light a totally unsuspected aspect of atmospheric chemistry, that is, short-lived (10 ps ≤ lifetime ≤ 10 ns) excited species (e.g., O2(B 3Σ) and electronically excited O3) may be quite significant in the N2O photochemistry despite their relative insignificance in many other cases. Other specific findings of the present study are the following: (1) O2(B 3Σ), which is efficiently produced in the stratosphere by resonant absorption in the Schumann-Runge bands, is a possible source of N2O with a maximum strength of the order of 60 N2O cm-3 s-1 in the vicinity of 30 km. (2) The electronic energy in O2(A 3Σ) is insufficient so that the potential reaction O2(A) + N2 → N2O + O is only marginally possible unless assisted by high-vibrational excitation (ν≥6) in O2(A). This source, if it exists, may be significant only at higher altitudes around 50 km. (3) Bimolecular and possibly termolecular reactions of O2(b1Σ) have the potential to be sinks of N2O. (4) The O2(B3Σ) source, while insignificant for the source deficiency problem, may produce N2O with an isotopic enrichment close to the observations since its optical pumping of O2(B3Σ) is isotope sensitive. (5) The O2(B3Σ) source has another intriguing feature, namely, it maximizes in the same altitude region where UARS/cryogenic limb array etalon spectrometer (CLAES) and cryogenic whole air sampler (CWAS) observations show a fold in the N2O mixing ratios which is more pronounced than the same in CH4 and chlorofluorocarbons which have no atmospheric sources. (6) The O2-mediated production of N2O from O(1D) via the ""embryonic"" O3 is potentially more efficient in the atmosphere relative to the highly inefficient direct reaction N2+ O(1D) + M → N2O + M. The optical pumping of the ground state O3 to its electronically excited states may also lead to potentially substantial N2O production. The combined production of N2O from these two processes may approach 25% of the currently estimated microbiological production. (7) Since O3 is already isotopically enriched, it is quite possible that the N2O produced by the optically pumped excited O3 might also show isotopic enrichment. (8) If the current World Meteorological Organization position that the classical sources and sinks of N2O are in balance is accepted, then the new atmospheric sources discussed here suggest hitherto unrecognized, mainly biogenic, sinks of this species which significantly reduce the net emission of N2O from the soil and the aquatic environments. It is hoped that the discussions in this paper will create a greater appreciation of the problems with the classical N2O chemistry and the potentials of the new chemistry and will thereby stimulate further research. With this hope some suggestions for new laboratory and computational chemistry experiments are also made. In particular, new experiments to test the proposed N2O production mechanisms must avoid both the initial presence and the subsequent build up of O3 in the reaction chamber.",,"atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric sink; nitrous oxide; ozone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031416885

The model showed that total suppression of natural disturbances, and their replacement by harvesting for maximum sustainable yield, could lead to significant increase in ecosystem C storage (mainly in soils and wood products) over a period of 100-200 years in this region. This is primarily because the historical interval between disturbance events (primarily wildfire) is short compared with the harvest interval. The net gains in C storage, and the period over which they are sustainable, are sensitive to several key variables, including planned harvesting levels and the intensity of natural disturbances. A warmer climate could reduce total C storage as a result of greater soil decomposition, but it should not reverse the benefits attributable to management if disturbances are controlled. Extended rotation lengths increase total C storage significantly and may justify additional investment in protection.",,"carbon budget; forest management; modelling; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031448627

Ctr. for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, CO 80307, United States","The occurrence of high concentrations of ozone in the lower part of the troposphere is considered as one of the most important issues of tropospheric chemistry. The chemical mechanisms of tropospheric ozone formation are complex, and highly variable meteorological conditions contribute additionally to difficulties in an accurate prediction of ozone episodes. An effective way to increase our understanding of the problem and eventually improve our ability to predict the concentration of tropospheric ozone and to formulate emission control strategies is by applying a comprehensive model representing accurately the interaction between meteorological processes and chemical reactions. This paper presents a 3-dimensional semi-Lagrangian, chemical tracer model (CTM) featuring an accurate transport algorithm, comprehensive oxidants chemistry and deposition modules. The CTM is executed in off-line mode with a semi-Lagrangian, nonhydrostatic, mesoscale meteorological model that contains an extensive parameterization of physical processes (including a boundary layer scheme and clouds). The system of models was run for a time period of 6 days in order to generate a tropospheric ozone field during a smog episode observed in the eastern part of North America, in the beginning of August 1988. The numerical simulation was performed on grids with resolution of 20 and 40 km with 25 vertical levels. The emissions inventory considered in the simulation included point sources, surface biogenic sources, surface mobile sources and surface non-mobile sources. An evaluation of the model results against observations clearly indicates the ability of the system to simulate regional aspects of a tropospheric ozone episode.

Two different mapping methods, singular value decomposition and maximum entropy, have been applied to the data. In both cases, the resulting maps show evidence for three distinct features: (1) a central bulge, (2) emission in the Galactic plane, and (3) an enhancement or extension of emission at positive latitudes above the Galactic center. Modeling of the data confirmed the existence of these features. The derived distribution is found to be in good qualitative agreement with nearly all of the historical observations of narrow 511 keV line emission from the Galactic center region. No evidence of time variability is found. Various possible production mechanisms for the observed positrons, including the positive-latitude enhancement, are presented. It is found that supernovae are capable of producing positrons at the required rate to account for the intensity and morphology of the observed 511 keV line emission. © 1997.

Laboratory and in situ experiments were conducted to investigate controls on carbon flow from the inorganic carbon pool into marine phytoplankton cellular material and from phytoplankton to dissolved organic carbon. Materials and methods: Production of particulate organic carbon (POC) and rates of extracellular organic carbon (EOC) were measured by uptake of 14C-sodium bicarbonate and its subsequent incorporation and release into organic compounds by employing traditional 14C radiotracer protocols. Results: Results indicated that phytoplankton cells are capable of channelling significantly more inorganic carbon into an extracellular organic carbon (EOC) fraction than into particulate organic carbon (POC), both in situ and in culture. Release/incorporation ratios ranged from 10-2 to as much as 1.2(*) 103 (EOC/POC). The cell specific rate at which the phytoplankton community released radiolabelled organic compounds declined hyperbolically as the concentration of cells increased, i.e. the release rate was found primarily as a function of cell density. For both laboratory and in situ experiments, cell-specific extracellular organic carbon release rates were elevated following dilution, suggesting an 'environmental stress' response. We believe that the autotrophic community keeps the level of dissolved organic carbon constant by producing reduced carbon compounds that are released to the environment. Bacterial activity was not statistically correlated with EOC release rates, suggesting that quality as opposed to the quantity of the released materials regulated bacterial growth. Cell-specific release rates in the light and dark were statistically correlated whereas uptake into POC in light and dark were not correlated, owing to the more complex nature of mechanisms controlling the production of cellular material. Channeling of inorganic carbon into particulate and dissolved organic pool in darkness is due to the activity of autotrophs. The influence of bacteria is negligible. We suggest that the dark bottle (DB) 14C uptake rates should not be substracted from the light bottle (LB) rates within the courses of primary production measurements. The relation between the LB cell-specific values and DB values maybe an indication of the relative activity of light-independent CO2 fixation path ways of particulate algal community. Our results emphasize the importance of EOC in phytoplankton synthesis of organic matter, i.e., primary production. There is an active component of 14CO2 fixation in the dark, among which EOC contributes significantly to the light-independent production of organic matter.","Carbon flow; Dark reactions; Extracellular organic carbon; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Primary production","bicarbonate; carbon; organic compound; tracer; article; bacterial growth; cell density; controlled study; isotope labeling; light dark cycle; nonhuman; photosynthesis; phytoplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842296993

Most of the car manufactures are researching GDI or even intend to produce it in the near future. If the promised goals are actually achieved, a great change in the development focus for automotive engines will occur. In GDI engines, ultra lean burn, stratified charge combustion is achieved by injecting fuel directly into the chamber during compression stroke (""late Injection""). In contrast, at higher power conditions, the GDI operates in homogeneous charge and fuel is injected during intake stroke (""early injection"").

To assist in the reduction of such emissions, pilot-scale experiments were completed using municipal wastewater to study the effects of drop height, liquid flow rate, and tailwater depth on oxygen transfer, and to evaluate the effects of the same parameters on the stripping of 10 VOC tracers. Results were used to develop predictive models for oxygen and VOC transfer. Oxygen uptake at the pilot drop structure suggests that the drop height is the most important parameter influencing oxygen uptake at enclosed drop structures. Tailwater depth had little effect on oxygen transfer at the drop structure. Stripping of VOCs at drop structures was seen to be a strong function of Henry's law coefficient. This sensitivity was related to gas-phase resistance in mass-transfer and/or VOC accumulation in the air bubbles. Incorporating gas-phase resistance and an appropriate α factor for wastewater into the model allowed the prediction of VOC deficit ratios and estimation of VOC stripping at drop structures for both clean water and wastewater. ©ASCE.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001379806

The concept of steady state diffusion with source/sink is used to substitute the net deviation of plasma carbon concentration in surrounding plasma as well as to determine the surface carbon content.

These requirements define specific combinations of porewater chemistry and saturation state with respect to carbonates and iron sulphides. A review of modern marine sediments suggests that near-surface porewaters are always over-saturated, or close to saturation, with iron sulphides but are alternately rich in either dissolved iron or dissolved sulphide. However, significant variations in carbonate saturation state may occur, with porewaters being undersaturated in the early stages of sulphate reduction, but subsequently becoming oversaturated until the later stages of methanogenesis. Here undersaturation may return if there is a substantial input of carbon dioxide, and if little alkalinity has arisen from iron reduction. Organic matter pyritization requires that soft-tissue material decays by sulphate reduction to release dissolved sulphide, with dissolved iron supplied by the surrounding porewaters. The modern sediment studies therefore suggest that organic matter pyritization can occur only during the earliest stages of sulphate reduction, where there are iron-rich porewaters which are saturated with iron sulphides. Pyrite replacement of carbonate shell material requires porewater undersaturation with respect to carbonates and analogy with modern sediments suggests that these conditions occur either during the earliest stages of sulphate reduction, or when methanogenesis produces undersaturation. Between these periods porewaters are saturated with respect to carbonates and pyrite of different morphologies can precipitate on carbonate shells. Sulphur isotope data provide support for these associations of porewater chemistry and style of fossil pyritization. The best-described examples are for soft tissue pyritization in Beecher's Trilobite Bed (Ordovician) and the Hünsruck Slate (Devonian), where the isotopic data are consistent with rapid, early pyritization in iron-rich porewaters. More data are needed on shell pyritization with the range of isotopic compositions indicating formation through all stages of diagenesis.","Fossils; Isotopes; Pyritization; Sulphur","diagenesis; fossilization; isotopic composition; pyritization; sulphur; taphonomy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030751905

All the gins in Texas are required to install a minimum of Baseline Best Available Control Technology (BBACT) in order to obtain a permit to construct or operate. Gins that are located in densely populated areas or those which are in violation of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission (TNRCC) regulations may be required to install additional controls to come into compliance. TNRCC permit engineers have the authority to require the installation of additional controls to reduce emission factors. The selection of the control strategies is the prerogative of the ginner. However, some control strategies may result in the cotton gin going out of business. The definition of BACT incorporates a phrase that requires consideration for economic reasonableness. It is the premise of this research that a cotton ginner will be able to utilize the requirement that a mandated BACT abatement system must include consideration of 'economic reasonableness' to negotiate an appropriate abatement strategy. Several additional air pollution abatement strategies using combinations of cyclones, rotary drum filters, and baffle type pre-separators have been defined. Procedures to estimate costs of equipment and emission factors for various abatement equipment are described in detail.

Expression of the CAT8 gene is subject to glucose repression mainly caused by Mig1p. Unexpectedly, the deletion of the Mig1p-binding motif within the CAT8 promoter did not increase CAT8 transcription; moreover, it resulted in a loss of CAT8 promoter activation. Insertion experiments with a promoter test plasmid confirmed that this regulatory 20-bp element influences glucose repression and derepression as well. This finding suggests an upstream activating function of this promoter region, which is Mig1p independent, as Δmig1 mutants are still able to derepress the CAT8 promoter. No other putative binding sites such as a Hap2/3/4/5p site and an Abf1p consensus site were functional with respect to glucose-regulated CAT8 expression. Fusions of Cat8p with the Gal4p DNA- binding domain mediated transcriptional activation. This activation capacity was still carbon source regulated and depended on the Cat1p (Snf1p) protein kinase, which indicated that Cat8p needs posttranslational modification to reveal its gene-activating function. Indeed, Western blot analysis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-gels revealed a single band (Cat8pI) with crude extracts from glucose-grown cells, whereas three bands (Cat8pI, -II, and -III) were identified in derepressed cells. Derepression-specific Cat8pII and -III resulted from differential phosphorylation, as shown by phosphatase treatment. Only the most extensively phosphorylated modification (Cat8pIII) depended on the Cat1p (Snf1p) kinase, indicating that another protein kinase is responsible for modification form Cat8pII. The occurrence of Cat8pIII was strongly correlated with the derepression of gluconeogenic enzymes (phosphoenolpyruvate carbozykinase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase) and gluconeogenic PCK1 mRNA. Furthermore, glucose triggered the dephosphorylation of Cat8pIII, but this did not depend on the Glc7p (Cid1p) phosphatase previously described as being involved in invertase repression. These results confirm our current model that glucose derepression of gluconeogenic genes needs Cat8p phosphorylation and additionally show that a still unknown transcriptional activator is also involved.",,"fructose bisphosphatase; gene product; glucose; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP); protein; article; gene activation; gene control; gene expression regulation; gluconeogenesis; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein modification; protein phosphorylation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030987084

It quantifies the predictability of three major components comprising the climate - temperature, pressure and precipitation. The quantification is done using a fractal dimensional analysis of the corresponding time series. The climate predictability index is calculated for 25 stations spread throughout India using the Global Historical Climatology Network dataset. Change in the index with the seasons suggests a strong influence of more than one climatic dynamics. In such cases, calculations done using mean yearly data are suspect. The index is shown to be useful in studying the interplay between various climatic components (viz. temperature, pressure and precipitation). Changes in predictability indices for temperature and pressure are seen to affect the index for precipitation. The index can be used as a discriminant for determining which stations are selected for use in developing regional climatic models.

The authors discuss the need and a methodology for cleanly separating the various scales of motion embedded in ozone time series data, namely, short-term (weather related) variations, seasonal (solar induced) variations, and long-term (climate-policy related) trends, in order to provide a better understanding of the underlying physical processes that affect ambient ozone levels. Spatial and temporal information in ozone time series data, obscure prior to separation, is clearly displayed by simple laws afterward. In addition, process changes due to policy or climate changes may be very small and invisible unless they are separated from weather and seasonally. Successful analysis of the ozone problem, therefore, requires a careful separation of seasonal and synoptic components. The authors show that baseline ozone retains global information on the scale of more than 2 months in time and about 300 km in space. The short-term ozone component, attributable to short-term weather and precursor emission fluctuations, is highly correlated in space, retaining 50% of the short-term information at distances ranging from 350 to 400 km; in time, short-term ozone resembles a Markov process with 1-day lag correlations ranging from .2 to 0.5. The correlation structure of short-term ozone permits highly accurate predictions of ozone concentrations up to distances of about 600 km from a given monitor. These results clearly demonstrate that ozone is a regional-scale problem.",,"ozone; scales of motion; time series",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031429922

In this paper a set required parameters to be monitored for estimating carbon flows, monitoring methods, and institutional arrangements arc presented along with a case study of the Western Ghat Forestry and Environment project. Monitoring carbon flows in forestry sector projects is different due to a long gestation period and location- or site-specific variations in various parameters, particularly rates of C sequestration and emission. Parameters to be monitored include C sequestration in vegetation and soil, rates of wood extraction, wood use related emission, litter production, decomposition from litter, and soil. Methods include field vegetation monitoring, soil study, household and industry surveys, and laboratory investigation. Investigations, analysis, and report writing should be carried out using local educational institutions, NGOs, and consultancy firms. Verification could be taken care of by external agencies. Case studies of the Western Ghat Forestry and Environment project showed that less than 10% of the project budget may be adequate for intensive monitoring of carbon flows.

The incorporation of DSPG into the lipid bilayers increases the conformational order of acyl chains due to the decrease of the number of double-gauche conformers per chain. On the other hand, the entrapment of Cytc into the MO-DSPG-H2O phase causes the number of gauche-trans-gauche defects to decrease significantly. In the MO-DSPG-H2O and MO-DSPG-Cytc-H2O phases, the OH groups of the MO glycerol residue possess higher mobility in comparison with the binary cubic phase. At the same time, in the cubic phases, containing Cytc and/or 7 wt% of DSPG, the hydrogen bonding of the acyl chain carbonyl groups is clearly reduced. Analysis of the spectra in the region of water association band reveals that the hydrogen bonds of the entrapped water molecules are basically diminished as compared to the situation in pure water. In the MO-DSPG-H2O phase, water molecules participate in the hydration of the PO-2 group of DSPG, whereas the entrapment of Cytc eliminates this effect. As evident from the spectral characteristics of Cytc, the protein molecules retain their native secondary structure in the MO-DSPG-Cytc-H2O phase. The results presented are discussed on a basis of the lipid packing parameter concept. It is also suggested that the DSPG molecules in the lipid bilayer of the MO-DSPG-Cytc-H2O phase are concentrated in the vicinity of the entrapped protein.","Cubic liquid-crystalline phase; Cytochrome c; Distearoylphosphatidylglycerol; FT-IR spectroscopy; Monoolein",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010371412

Both interactions are influenced by zooplankton activity. To examine the relationship between algae and bacteria in Lake La Caldera, we studied: the correlations among phytoplankton, bacteria and phosphorus (P) dynamics; the ratio of organic carbon supplied by algae to organic carbon demand by bacteria; and the importance of P remineralized by metezooplankton for both communities. Phytoplankton and bacteria had a similar seasonal dynamics, and there was a significant and positive relationship between bacterial abundance and algal biomass (P < 0.01). However, the release of organic carbon from phytoplankton was usually higher than the bacterioplankton carbon requirement. P available via zooplankton remineralization satisfied between 74 and 316% of the minimum P demands of algae and bacteria. To elucidate whether zooplankton operate similarly on algae and bacterial growth or indirectly influence bacterial growth through phytoplankton metabolism, we performed zooplankton manipulation experiments. High zooplankton biomass in these experiments stimulated both primary and bacterial production, but release of organic carbon from phytoplankton declined. These results suggest a direct stimulus of bacterial growth, so algae and bacteria can balance grazing losses by compensatory growth.

These concerns have led to the investigation of many technologies and strategies for mitigation, both in the U.S. and abroad. One technology explored at ANL is integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power generation, which is based on extraction of CO2 by a solvent. The IGCC process reduces CO2 production through efficient fuel use, which makes CO2 recovery less expensive than conventional systems. Recovery using the following solvents was explored in detail: monoethanolamine (MEA), glycol, chilled methanol. and hot potassium carbonate. Other incentive-based options for mitigation have also been explored, including market incentives (carbon fees and tradable permits) and regulatory measures. Our work suggests a complex global strategy will be necessary to optimize options for mitigation of global climate change, one that takes into account both local and regional considerations.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030970564

Photosynthesis, per unit leaf area, was almost unaffected. Even so, over a 4-week period, growth (dry weight increment) was reduced in the salt treatment by 50%. This could be ascribed to a large reduction in leaf area (&gt; 60%) and to an approx. 20% increase in the rate of dark respiration (Rd). Raising ambient [CO2] from zero to 2000 μmol mol-1 decreased Rd in both control and salinized plants (by 20% at 1000, and by 50% at 2000 μmol mol-1 CO2 concentration) compared to Rd in the absence of ambient CO2. High night-time [CO2] had no significant effect on growth of non-salinized plants, irrespective of day-time ambient [CO2]. Growth reduction caused by salt was reduced from 51% in plants grown in 350 μmol mol-1 throughout the day, to 31% in those grown continuously in 900 μmol mol-1 [CO2]. The effect of [CO2] at night on salinized plants depended on the daytime CO2 concentration. Under 350 μmol mol-1 day-time [CO2], 900 μmol mol-1 at night reduced growth over a 4-week period by 9% (P &lt; 0.05) and 1700 μmol mol-1 reduced it by 14% (P &lt; 0.01). However, under 900 μmol mol-1 day-time [CO2], 900 vs. 350 μmol mol-1 [CO2] at night increased growth by 17% (P &lt; 0.01). It is concluded thai there is both a functional and an otiose (functionless) component to Rd, which is increased by salt. Under conditions of low photosynthesis (such as here, in the low day-time [CO2] regime) the otiose component is small and high night-time [CO2] partly suppresses functional Rd, thereby reducing salt tolerance. In plants growing under conditions which stimulate photosynthesis (e.g. with increased daytime [CO2]), elevated [CO2] at night suppresses mainly the otiose component of respiration, thus increasing growth. Consequently, in regions of adequate water and sunlight, the predicted further elevation of the world atmospheric [CO2] may increase plant salinity tolerance.","atmosphere; carbon dioxide; photosynthesis; respiration; sail stress; sodium chloride; Xanthium strumarium","Xanthium; Xanthium strumarium; Xanthium strumarium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030901844

Validation with data from two Swiss sites revealed satisfactory agreement between simulation and measurement for yield, energy fluxes, and N-dynamics. Local weather scenarios were derived from the results of two General Circulation Models (GCM) for 2 x CO2 by a statistical down-scaling procedure. Biomass production changed by a maximum of 8% in response to CC without 2 x CO2 effects, by 1-17% in response to 2 x CO2 alone, and by 6-20% in response to the combination of CC and 2 x CO2. With plant acclimation, biomass production increased only up to 8% with elevated CO2, as compared to a maximum increase of 20% in the absence of plant acclimation. Reduced yield with CC was obtained for sites with low soil water holding capacity. Decreased evapotranspiration and increased WUE with 2 x CO2 were partially offset by CC. The simulations indicated that productivity of managed grassland is sensitive to different assumptions about changes in climate.

It is, therefore, essential to establish a fundamental basis for fuel injection modeling that involves various atomization processes. A two-dimensional fuel injection model has been formulated to simulate the airflow within and downstream of the atomizer and address the formation and breakup of the liquid sheet formed at the atomizer exit. The sheet breakup under the effects of airblast, fuel pressure, or the combined atomization mode of the airassist type is considered in the calculation. The model accounts for secondary breakup of drops and the stochastic Lagrangian treatment of spray. The calculation of spray evaporation addresses both droplet heat-up and steady-state mechanisms, and fuel vapor concentration is based on the partial pressure concept. An enhanced evaporation model has been developed that accounts for multicomponent, finite mass diffusivity and conductivity effects, and addresses near-critical evaporation. The present investigation involved predictions of flow and spray characteristics of two distinctively different fuel atomizers under both nonreacting and reacting conditions. The predictions of the continuous phase velocity components and the spray mean drop sizes agree well with the detailed measurements obtained for the two atomizers, which indicates the model accounts for key aspects of atomization. The model also provides insight into ligament formation and breakup at the atomizer exit and the initial drop sizes formed in the atomizer near field region where measurements are difficult to obtain. The calculations of the reacting spray show the fuel-rich region occupied most of the spray volume with two-peak radial gas temperature profiles. The results also provided local concentrations of unburned hydrocarbon (UHC) and carbon monoxide (CO) in atomizer flowfield, information that could support the effort to reduce emission levels of gas turbine combustors. © 1997 by ASME.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0005472231

This is because much of the flux adjustment field is dominated by regions of high horizontal SST gradient, where even small shifts in positioning lead to large SST errors and therefore large flux adjustments. A simple scheme is used to remove the effects of these regions in the calculation of flux adjustment and this results in adjustments considerably smaller than those usually obtained.

The sensor model code is fully portable and integrated as ModSAF libraries. Relevant emission protocol data units (PDU) are generated and transmitted. The overall simulation architecture and the MTI and BCIS models have been described in detail elsewhere. The current work concentrates on the development of real-time model-based imaging functions. The software tools which provide this capability are available both in the government-owned inventory and as commercial products. The purpose of the current activity is to investigate the feasibility of integrating software of this kind with the ModSAF environment in order to produce realistic target/scene renderings similar to those obtained by high-resolution imaging sensors. To this end, we investigated real-time scene generation using two approaches. The first, through integration of the IRMA software package developed and distributed by the USAF Wright Laboratories, Eglin AFB, and the second is by use of the commercial software package SensorVision™, which is marketed and distributed by Paradigm Solutions, Inc. Both of these produce scene renderings in user specified wavebands by combining entity state PDU information with terrain data. The scene model information is passed to rendering software to produce an IR or SAR rendering of the scene.","Sensor models; Sensor rendering; Setiensor visualization; Simulation","Computer simulation; Computer software; Infrared imaging; Interactive computer systems; Optical resolving power; Optical sensors; Real time systems; Synthetic aperture radar; Forward looking infrared (FLIR) imagers; Sensor data fusion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031309450

Toxicol., University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, United States","Summaries of the interactions caused by altering adrenoreceptor activity in conjunction with the administration of selected hepatotoxicants are provided in Table 2 and Fig. 1. These hepatotoxicants can be divided into two groups, one whose toxicity is increased by adrenergic agonist drugs (group I) and the other whose toxicity is decreased by adrenergic antagonists (group II). Group I includes carbon tetrachloride, acetaminophen, and methylphenidate. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect these chemicals have in common is the striking potentiation that occurs with cotreatment with certain adrenergic agonist drugs. For each of these, cotreatment with the appropriate adrenergic agent can result in massive hepatocellular necrosis from an otherwise nontoxic dose. In terms of the specific adrenoreceptors involved and mechanisms of potentiation, however, they have little in common. Potentiation of carbon tetrachloride hepatotoxicity appears to be mediated by α2-adrenoreceptor stimulation, acetaminophen is potentiated by α1- adrenoreceptor agonists*, and methylphenidate responds to β2- adrenoreceptor stimulation. Studies of the potentiation of carbon tetrachloride and acetaminophen agree that the timing of adrenergic stimulation relative to the hepatotoxicant dose is critically important to the interaction but markedly different for these two toxicants. Acetaminophen was potentiated only when the adrenergic drug was administered as a 3-h pretreatment. This is apparently a consequence of a mechanism of potentiation that involves adrenergic depression of hepatic glutathione content and a requirement that peak effects on glutathione of both the adrenergic agent and acetaminophen be coincident. The mechanism of potentiation of carbon tetrachloride hepatotoxicity is uncertain but clearly does not involve hepatic glutathione content. In contrast to acetaminophen, adrenergic effects must occur within a time window a few hours after the carbon tetrachloride dose for potentiation to occur. The importance of dose timing has not been evaluated for adrenergic potentiation of methylphenidate hepatotoxicity, but it is clear that this interaction is based on yet a third mechanism. While only three hepatotoxicants of the group I type have been examined in detail, the diversity of receptor types and mechanisms involved suggest that this phenomenon may be relevant for a wide variety of hepatotoxic drugs and chemicals. This interaction is also of interest because factors or events that lead to increased adrenergic stimulation are common in everyday life. Most over-the-counter cold and allergy preparations contain sympathomimetic drugs, and many prescription drugs produce adrenergic effects a either an extension of the intended therapeutic effect or as a side effect. Stress and some disease states can also lead to significant increases in peripheral adrenergic activity, creating the potential for increased susceptibility to hepatic injury from exposure to certain drugs or chemicals. Cocaine and bromobenzene represent group II, chemicals whose hepatotoxicity is diminished by cotreatment with adrenergic antagonist drugs. In the case of cocaine, adrenergic antagonist cotreatment was capable of reducing serum alanine aminotransferase activities by approximately 50%. For bromobenzene, the protection afforded by adrenergic antagonist cotreatment was more profound, with minimal hepatic lesions resulting from doses of bromobenzene that otherwise produced lethal hepatic necrosis. For the chemicals in group II, experimental observations are consistent with a phenomenon in which adrenergic potentiation of toxicity is supplied by the hepatotoxicant itself. Both cocaine and bromobenzene, in hepatotoxic doses, increase endogenous catecholamine levels. When the effects of the elevated catecholamines are removed with the appropriate adrenergic antagonist, much lower toxicity (presumably due only to the direct hepatotoxic effects of the drug of chemical) is observed. Conceptually, this may be viewed as a self- potentiation. Studies using adrenoreceptor-selective antagonists suggest that cocained hepatotoxicity is enhanced principally through stimulation of α2- adrenoreceptors while bromobenzene toxicity is increased by α1- adrenoreceptor stimulation. It is interesting that this distinction exists, given that the source of adrenoreceptor stimulation (epinephrine and nonrepinephrine) and the postulated mechanism for potentiation (adrenergic depression of hepatocellular glutathione content) is the same for both chemicals. Both α1- and α2-adrenoreceptor stimulation have been shown to decrease hepatic glutathione content in mice [27], although there may be differences in the anatomical sites of the relevant α-adrenoreceptors. α1- Adrenoreceptor-mediated effects on hepatic glutathione occur exclusively in the periphery, presumably involving adrenoreceptors on the hepatocyte itself [27]. Hepatic glutathione depression can also occur from stimulation of α2- adrenoreceptors located within the CNS. While cocaine and bromobenzene both increase endogenous catecholamines, they might not do so equally throughout the body. As such, the differences in the principal receptor subtypes involved in modulating cocaine and bromobenzene hepatotoxicity may simply reflect differences between these chemicals in their effects on CNS versus peripheral catecholamines. In the case of carbon tetrachloride, and perhaps also bromobenzene, the effect of adrenergic stimulation to enhance hepatotoxicity appear to involve a postinsult mechanism; that is, it is the cellular response to the biochemical insult produced by reactive metabolite formation that is affected rather than the magnitude of the insult itself. While there has been extensive study on ways in which drug and chemical cotreatment can exacerbate hepatotoxicity by influencing the rate or extent of reactive metabolite formation and binding, the ability of drugs and chemicals to alter the progression between reactive metabolite binding and cell death has received comparatively little attention. The ability of adrenergic stimulation well after toxicant exposure to significantly influence the outcome has interesting implications, not the least of which the possibility of new therapeutic avenues for treating and preventing liver injury from at least some hepatotoxicants. Like many other research topics, our understanding of the potential for the sympathetic nervous system to modulate toxic responses in the liver grew as complementary threads from a few pioneering studies came together. Insightful experiments and thoughtful interpretation by Plaa, his colleagues, and students laid the foundation and helped set the pathway for the series of studies that has established the ability of adrenergic agonists and antagonists to affect toxicity of several classic hepatotoxicants with varied toxicokinetic and mechanistic characteristics. The phenomenon has been clearly demonstrated. Adrenergic agonists can potentiate hepatotoxicity through a variety of adrenoreceptor- mediated mechanisms. Antagonists can both block agonist-induced potentiation and reduce the toxicity of hepatotoxicants that stimulate catecholamine release as part of their toxic insult. The specific mechanistic link at the cellular level between the adrenergic system and the toxic response remains to be clearly elucidated for most of the individual hepatotoxicants. Also, it remains to be shown how generally important adrenergic stimulation is to toxicity outcomes. However, those early observations have led us to an understanding of the importance of physiological stress responses in affecting toxicity and potentiation. In addition, the pharmacological use of agents which affect sympathetic tone may eventually be considered as sa potential means to ameliorate toxic responses.",,"adrenalin; bromobenzene; carbon tetrachloride; cocaine; methylphenidate; noradrenalin; paracetamol; adrenergic nerve; conference paper; drug effect; drug potentiation; drug protein binding; liver toxicity; nonhuman; sympathetic innervation; toxicity testing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030740645

In the evening the airglow emission layer is very bright and descends with time. At about midnight the emission rate is drastically reduced, with a deep midnight minimum. Shortly afterward, the emission rate begins to recover at higher altitudes and increases toward dawn. The TIME-GCM simulations show that if the diurnal tide has sufficient amplitude to penetrate the atomic oxygen layer near 97 km, then it significantly alters the atomic oxygen distribution at low latitudes, producing a strong green line variation similar to the WINDII observations. At latitudes greater than 20°N and 20°S latitude the opposite variation occurs, indicating a global oscillation in the atomic oxygen layer. If the diurnal tide is weak, it does not penetrate the layer and there is only a weak semidiurnal variation of the nighttime green line similar to what is generally observed for solstice conditions.

The 4.9 m2 wetland cells were filled with 9 mm limestone gravel, and planted with cattail, common reed and spike rush. Changes in nutrient (total organic carbon, PO43- and NH4+), suspended solids and metal (Cu, Pb, Zn) concentrations were used to assess performance. Contaminant removal occurred through a combination of physical, chemical and biological means. As with any biological system, variation in performance of stormwater wetlands can be expected to occur as a result of fluctuations in contaminant loading, contact time and ambient environmental conditions. Storm pond effluent was delivered in continuous flow through the wetlands (during baseflow and event conditions), with a detention time of 1 to 3 days. The wetlands were able to maintain removal rates of up to 39% for orthophosphate even during the more severe conditions of fall dieback. Average removal of suspended solids (46%) and dissolved metals (Cu 50%) remained similar throughout all tests. Organic carbon was reduced by less than 10% during these tests. Low nutrient levels in the pond effluent were supplemented by spiking with sources of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus during pulsed loading conditions. Daily sampling produced a time series, which illustrated the rates of decline in concentration of nutrients. First order kinetic assimilation rates ranged from 1.7 d-1 for NH4+ to 0.12 d-1 for organic carbon, which were noticeably lower when compared with municipal and industrial wastewater treatment rates. Three methods of sizing stormwater wetlands (impervious surface area, volumetric load and kinetic reaction rates) were compared using the same design storm and data from this study. From this comparison it was seen that the kinetic sizing approach proved to be the most versatile, and allowed for adaptation to northern climatic conditions and anticipated nutrient loading.","Constructed wetlands; Design; Nutrients; Performance; Stormwater treatment; Suspended solids","Biological water treatment; Carbon; Copper; Ecosystems; Effluents; Groundwater resources; Lead; Reaction kinetics; Sedimentation; Sediments; Water quality; Zinc; Kinetic sizing approach; Nutrient levels; Stormwater; Wetlands; Chemicals removal (water treatment)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030869816

Particulate mass, carbon (organic and inorganic) (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) export fluxes were measured at the equator in the western and central Pacific during two 6-7 day-long time-series stations located in the warm pool (TS-I at 0°, 167°E) and in the equatorial HNLC situation (TS-II at 0°, 150°W), using drifting sediment traps deployed for 48 h at four depths (between, approximately, 100 and 300 m). The particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes at the base of the euphotic zone (0. 1% light level), were approximately four times lower at TS-I than at TS-II (4.1 vs. 17.0 mmo] C m-2 day-1). Conversely, fluxes measured at 300 m were similar at both sites (3.6 vs. 3.7 mmol C m-2 day-1 at TS-I and TS-II, respectively). This change in export fluxes was in good agreement with food-web dynamics in the euphotic zone characterized by an increase in plankton biomasses and metabolic rates and a shift towards larger size from TS-I to TS-II. The POC flux profiles indicated high remineralization (up to 78%) of the exported particles at TS-II, between 100 and 200 m in the Equatorial Undercurrent. According to zooplankton ingestion estimates from 100-300 m, 60% of this POC loss could be accounted for by zooplankton grazing. At TS-I, no marked increase of flux with depth was observed, and we assume that loss of particles was compensated by in-situ particle production by zooplankton. Fluxes of particulate nitrogen and phosphorus followed the same general patterns as the POC fluxes. The elemental and pigment composition of the exported particles was not very different between the two stations. In particular, the POC:PN flux molar ratio at the base of the euphotic zone was low, 6.9 and 6.2 at TS-I and TS-II, respectively. For particulate inorganic carbon (mainly carbonate) flux, values at the base of the euphotic zone averaged 0.9 mmol C m-2 day-1 at TS-I and 2.3 mmol C m-2 day-1 at TS-II (corresponding to a 2.6-fold increase) and showed low depth changes at both stations. POC export flux (including active flux associated with the interzonal migrants) at the 0.1% light level depth represented only 8% of primary production (14C uptake) measured at TS-I and 19% at TS-II. For the time and space scales considered in the present study, new primary production, as measured by the 15N method, was in good agreement with the total export flux in the HNLC situation, thus leading to negligible dissolved organic carbon (DOC) or nitrogen (DON) losses from the photic zone. Conversely, export flux was found to be only 50% (C units) and 60% (N) of new production in the oligotrophic system, either because of an overestimation by the 15N method or of a significant export of DOC and DON. Comparison with other oceanic regions shows that export flux in the warm pool was within the same range as in the central gyres. On the other hand, comparison with EqPac data in the central Pacific suggests that there is no straightforward relation between the magnitude of the export and surface nitrate concentrations.",,"organic carbon; organic nitrogen; particulate flux; particulate organic carbon; phosphurus; Pacific, (Equatorial)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031402256

Greenhouse gas emissions based on these estimates may convey the message that the world is running out of fossil fuels, and as a result, emissions would be reduced automatically. If the vast unconventional hydrocarbon occurrences are included in the resource estimates and historically observed rates of technology change are applied to their mobilization, the potential accessibility of fossil sources increases dramatically with long-term production costs that are not significantly higher than present market prices. Although the geographical hydrocarbon resource distribution varies significantly, a regional breakdown for 11 world regions indicates that neither hydrocarbon resource availability nor costs are likely to become forces that automatically would help wean the global energy system from the use of fossil fuel during the next century.","Coal; Conventional; Natural gas occurrences; Oil; Unconventional","Costs; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Hydrocarbons; Resource allocation; Technology transfer; Geographical hydrocarbon resource distributions; Global energy system; Petroleum reservoir evaluation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031384758

The age-old desire for consumption grows unabated and increasing numbers of consumers around the world are attaching new value to the environmental quality of goods and services and expressing concern over the environmental impacts of industrialization. That concern is growing because more than 70 percent of the world's urban population live in areas where the air is seriously polluted and as many as 750,000 people—the majority in developing countries—die each year of ailments caused by air pollution.1. Over the past 25 years, corporations throughout the world have made dramatic changes in the way they do business as more people come to understand how the ecological system works and how polluted air and water endanger human health. The key to increasing industry's participation in the drive for higher standards of air quality is the growing realization that effective environmental management, technological development, and technology dissemination are cost-effective and profitable business strategies. Global competition is making firms around the world more customer-conscious and, to the extent that consumers demand products that minimize environmental degradation and enhance the quality of their lives, businesses in every industry must respond in order to survive.2. This article examines how changes in business practices, driven by a better understanding of how natural environments function, are converging to provide new opportunities for environmental management that go beyond regulatory compliance to reduce air pollution. Although sound and well-enforced environmental regulations are an essential foundation for improving air quality, command-and-control systems alone are unlikely to achieve the lower levels of pollution that will be necessary to achieve sustainable development in the 21st century. In cooperation with government, businesses in every industry can play crucial roles in achieving higher standards of air quality while at the same time maintaining acceptable levels of economic growth. We explore three ways in which corporations can contribute to environmentally sustainable development: (1) by adopting proactive environmental management systems that focus on air pollution prevention; (2) by developing new technologies for air pollution control and reduction; and (3) by transferring air pollution control and prevention technologies through international trade and investment. © 1997 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001772796

With increasing cerium concentration the emission shows a strong shift to longer wavelengths caused mainly by changes in the ligand field. Despite a relatively small Stokes shift (2000 cm-1), the emission shows a low concentration quenching up to x = 0.10. Because of the size differences between the Ce3+, Na+, and Sr2+ ions, cerium ions possess various environments. Energy migration to defects is impeded by the transfer of the excitation energy to the ions having the lowest emitting states, whose emission exhibits reduced overlap with the absorption of other ions. As a result of the small Stokes shift, at low Ce concentration the luminescence is not affected by the thermal quenching up to 500 K. The low concentration quenching and the high thermal stability are favorable characteristics for use of this phosphor in electroluminescence and high current density CL screens.",,"Absorption; Cathodoluminescence; Cerium; Electroluminescence; Ions; Phosphors; Quenching; Strontium compounds; Temperature; Thermodynamic stability; Thin films; Blue emission; High current density cathodoluminescent screen; Photoluminescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031075792

Indeed, the development and operation of in-situ manufacturing plants are required to enable the establishment of permanent lunar and Martian bases and colonies. Oxygen manufacture for life support and propulsion will be the most important process for the first of these plants. This will be followed by the development of add-on facilities for the manufacture of additional products and materials using the by-products of lunar oxygen production, followed by the development of permanent lunar bases and colonies for commercial development on and from the Moon for the benefit of space science, exploration and utilisation and, most importantly, Earth and humankind. A review of several processes which have been proposed for lunar oxygen manufacture is presented. Particular emphasis is placed on the Ilmenite Process and the Carbothermal Process for lunar oxygen manufacture and the products which can be produced from their respective by-products. The ilmenite Process for the manufacture of oxygen from lunar materials has two essential steps: (1) the reduction of ferrous oxide, in the form of ilmenite, with hydrogen to form water and titania; and (2) the electrolysis of water to form oxygen and hydrogen. This closed cyclic process does not depend upon the presence of water or water precursors in the lunar materials. It does, however, depend on the location of raw materials which have comparatively high concentrations of ilmenite in their composition and may require raw material beneficiation. Iron, slag, and volatiles, e.g., hydrogen and helium, including the high value helium 3 isotope, are the principal by-products of this process. The Carbothermal Process for the manufacture of oxygen from lunar materials has three essential steps: (1) the reduction of ferrous oxide and metallic silicates with methane to form carbon monoxide and hydrogen; (2) the reduction of carbon monoxide with hydrogen to from methane and water; and (3) the electrolysis of water to from oxygen and hydrogen. This closed cyclic process does not depend upon the presence of water or water precursors in the lunar materials. In addition, it does not depend on the location of particular raw materials as it produces oxygen from metallic silicates and titanates regardless of their composition, concentration and fine structure. Iron, silicon, ferrosilicon, trace metals, slag and volatiles, e.g., hydrogen and helium 3, are the principal by-products of this process. A review of the preliminary design of several lunar oxygen production plants based on the use of Carbothermal Process is presented. The plants range in size from five metric tonnes (11,000 pounds) per year of oxygen for life support in a six-person lunar outpost to 11 metric tonnes (24,000 pounds) per month of liquid oxygen for propellant use in a high density cis-lunar transportation system. The weight and power requirements for four oxygen plants are provided. Alternative power sources for plant operation are discussed. Commercial development on the Moon is discussed, e.g., the potential value of the manufacture of oxygen and silane to support lunar-based transportation systems for exploration and colonisation of the near and far sides of the Moon, the manufacture of iron, ferrosilicon, and ceramic products to support the construction of advanced lunar bases and colonies, and the manufacture of high purity silicon wafers to support solar electric power generation. Commercial development from the Moon is discussed, e.g., the potential value of (1) a lunar based oxygen/silane bipropellant propulsion system to support cis-lunar transportation systems which would operate between Low Earth Orbit and the Moon and (2) the use of lunar oxygen to support transportation systems which would operate between the Earth and Mars, and the export of lunar products, e.g., (a) high purity silicon wafers, to Earth, Low Earth Orbit, and Mars (b) low intensity microwave energy for terrestrial electric power generation, and helium 3 for terrestrial nuclear electric power generation based of fusion reactors. Conclusions are drawn concerning lunar commercial development and its benefits for humankind in the latter half of the 21 st century and beyond.

The effects of elevated CO2 on plant community structure were studied using the point intercept method. Measurements were made in March 1994 prior to the start of CO2 exposure and again in June 1994 at peak plant biomass. There were no significant differences in the initial structure of the communities based on their assigned CO2 treatments in March. After 9 weeks of exposure of the community to elevated CO2, the total number of intercepts per plot was not significantly different between CO2 treatments; however, Carex flacca and Cirsium acaule had marginally significant (P = 0.055 and P = 0.06) increases in the % sward of the community at elevated CO2 (number of intercepts for a single species divided by the total number of intercepts for all species). Measurements of leaf extension in Carex flacca showed that at least part of the increase in % sward at elevated CO2 could be explained by greater leaf length per plant (P = 0.02). These measurements and other experiments with calcareous grassland species and communities suggest that rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations will probably alter the structure of calcareous grassland communities.","Calcareous grassland; Elevated CO2; Jura mountains; Point intercept method","calcareous grassland; carbon dioxide enrichment; community structure; grassland; plant community; screen-aided carbon dioxide control; Asteraceae; Asteraceae; Carex flacca; Carex flacca; Cirsium; Cirsium acaule; Cirsium acaule; Cyperaceae; Cyperaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030821297

We investigated these phenomena using two complementary approaches to evaluate the physiological contribution of TGFα and TGFβ in the control of the FSH- induced estradiol production in bovine granulosa cells from large follicles. Granulosa cells (3 x 105 viable cells/cm2) harvested from eCG-treated prepubertal calves were cultured (serum free) in wells containing 500 μl/cm2 of defined Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 0.5 ng/ml FSH for the first 3 days (37°C; 95% air:5% CO2). In the first approach, the effects of individual addition of TGFα and TGFβ at final concentrations of 1 x 10-4 to 10 ng/ml were determined on Day 4 of culture after stimulation of granulosa cell estradiol production with 6 ng/ml FSH. In a second approach, TGFα or TGFβ was removed specifically from bFF (from large follicles &gt; 10 mm) by immunoneutralization. Thereafter, effects of immunoneutralization of TGFα or TGFβ (0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 μg/ml anti-TGF neutralizing antibody) present in bFF (2%) were determined on Day 4 of culture following stimulation of granulosa cell estradiol production with 6 ng/ml FSH. On Day 4, FSH increased (p &lt; 0.001) granulosa cell estradiol production (0 vs. 6 ng/ml FSH). Addition of TGFα decreased the granulosa cell estradiol production after 6 ng/ml FSH stimulation in a dose-dependent manner (p &lt; 0.001). In contrast, addition of TGFβ had no effect on the granulosa cell estradiol production (p &gt; 0.1) after the addition of 6 ng/ml FSH. Addition of bFF (2%) decreased (p &lt; 0.0001) the FSH-induced estradiol production by bovine granulosa cells. After immunoneutralization of TGFα in bFF, however, this suppressed FSH-induced estradiol production was restored to levels obtained in the absence of bFF, and this occurred in a dose-dependent manner (p &lt; 0.05). Immunoneutralization of TGFβ in bFF did not prevent (p &gt; 0.1) the suppressive effect of bFF on FSH-induced estradiol production. These results suggest that TGFα produced in vivo by large bovine follicles can act locally (auto/paracrine manner) to suppress granulosa cell estradiol production.",,"estradiol; follitropin; transforming growth factor alpha; animal cell; animal experiment; article; cattle; cell differentiation; cell function; estradiol blood level; granulosa cell; hormone synthesis; nonhuman; ovary follicle fluid; priority journal; theca cell; Animals; Antibodies; Apoptosis; Cattle; Cell Division; Cells, Cultured; Estradiol; Female; Follicle Stimulating Hormone; Follicular Fluid; Granulosa Cells; Humans; Transforming Growth Factor alpha; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Animalia; Bos taurus; Bovinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030858552

In contrast, CYP1A1 mRNA is inducible in Hudson River tomcod that are treated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and in tomcod that are collected from cleaner rivers and treated with HAHs or PAHs. We hypothesize that CYP1A1 transcription is inhibited in Hudson River tomcod because of down-regulation of the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway and that separate molecular pathways modulate CYP1A1 transcription in fish treated with HAHs and PAHs. We initially evaluated levels of hepatic nuclear protein binding at enhancer elements (DREs) in the regulatory region of tomcod CYP1A1. No difference in levels of protein binding was observed between tomcod from the Hudson and Miramichi (cleaner) rivers that were untreated or were treated with benzo[a]pyrene. In contrast, levels of protein binding were lower in tomcod from the Hudson River that were treated with TCB than in similarly treated fish from the Miramichi River, suggesting differences between the populations in the structure or expression of AhR pathway molecules. To address this possibility, AhR DNA sequences were characterized from tomcod cDNA and genomic DNA libraries. In tomcod and mammals, AhR is represented by 11 exons, overall peptide sizes are similar, and amino acid sequences at basic, helix-loop-helix, PAAS A, and PAAS B domains are highly conserved. In contrast, little similarity was observed between tomcod and mammals in the sizes or sequences of AhR exons 10 and 11, including the absence in tomcod of glutamine-rich domains. No differences in levels of hepatic AhR mRNA were observed between the two populations or treatment groups when tomcod were untreated or were treated with aromatic hydrocarbons. In contrast, variation in levels of AhR mRNA expression was observed among tomcod tissues; however, no relationship was observed between levels of AhR mRNAs and CYP1A1 mRNAs in tissues from chemically or vehicle control-treated fish. RFLP analysis revealed extensive variation in exons 10 and 11 of AhR cDNA among tomcod from different rivers. Our results suggest that variation between tomcod populations in CYP1A1 mRNA inducibility is reflected by differences in levels of inducible hepatic protein binding to DREs. However, levels of hepatic AhR mRNA are not down-regulated in the Hudson River population, are not affected by AH treatments, and levels of AhR mRNA expression are not responsible for the differential inducibility of CYP1A1 transcription.","Aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; Atlantic tomcod; Cytochrome P4501A1; Gene expression; Genetic resistance","aromatic hydrocarbon; amino acid sequence; animal cell; animal experiment; article; DNA sequence; fish; gene expression; gene expression regulation; gene induction; genetic transcription; hypothesis; mammal; nonhuman; priority journal; restriction fragment length polymorphism; Animalia; Mammalia; Microgadus tomcod",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031571650

This etching is encountered as the amount of bias power used in the SiO2 etching process is increased, and a transition from fluorocarbon film growth on the SiO2 to an oxide etching rate which is consistent with reactive sputtering theory is made. The observed presence of an intermediate region where etching occurs, although a steady state fluorocarbon film suppresses the etch rate from that expected for a reactive sputtering process, has been referred to as the fluorocarbon suppression regime. This work demonstrates the role of the steady state fluorocarbon film present on silicon dioxide during etching within the fluorocarbon suppression regime. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy studies of the surfaces of partially etched SiO2 have shown a thinning of this film with increasing rf bias power, as well as a decrease in the fluorine content of the surface film as a function of increasing rf bias power. We have found that slight variations in the film thickness, on the order of 1 nm, can result in large variations, approximately 400 nm/min, in the silicon dioxide etch rate. The presence of the film within the suppression regime appears to be due to the overwhelming polymerization ability of high density plasmas, coupled with the inability of the oxide to react sufficiently with the total fluorocarbon particle flux in order to completely remove this film. For this reason these types of reactors exhibit a regime where oxide etching occurs in the presence of a surface film. The film appears to be directly responsible for the observed suppression of the oxide etch rate from that expected for a reactive sputtering process by dissipating the bombarding ion energy, and thereby suppressing the energy flux arriving at the oxide surface. © 1997 American Vacuum Society.",,"Crosslinking; Energy dissipation; Film growth; Fluorocarbons; Monolayers; Plasma devices; Polymerization; Silica; Sputter deposition; Surface structure; Thin films; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Inductively coupled plasma reactors; Reactive sputtering theory; Plasma etching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031189218

The plant currently burns poor quality anthracite (30% ash versus 18% ash design coal, as-received basis) and is in need of maintenance. Oil or gas support fuel in the amount of 30% (calorific basis) is required to stabilize the flame and supplement the calorific value of the coal feed. No NOx or SO2 controls are used at present, and unburned carbon content in the fly ash is high. An experimental program was carried out at the Federal Energy Technology Center (FETC) to estimate the improvement in plant performance that could be expected if the unit is supplied with design coal and is refurbished. High ash Ukrainian anthracite was cleaned to design specifications. Raw and cleaned coal were fed to a 490 MJ/h coal feed combustion unit at a number of conditions of support fuel use and ingress air leakage designed to simulate current and improved operations at the power plant. The results indicate the improvement in performance and reductions in SO2 and NOx emissions that can be expected as a result of the planned upgrade and conversion to use of cleaned coal. A detailed engineering and financial analysis indicates that plant rehabilitation combined with the use of cleaned schtib reduces not only pollutant emissions but also cost of electricity (COE).

The measurements were performed under ambient conditions with the molecules dispersed on glass or embedded in polymer. In successive images the fluorescence of single molecules was followed over about 1 h, with 10 ms integration time, until photodissociation. The position of single molecular fluorescence could be located with an accuracy of 1 nm. From the lateral diffusion of Rhodamine 6G molecules on glass during successive images, a diffusion constant of (6.7 ± 4.5) x 10-15 cm2/s was determined. The orientation of the in-plane emission dipole of all molecules in one image could be directly determined with an accuracy of a few degrees by simultaneous detection in two perpendicular polarization directions. By rotating the excitation polarization we could selectively excite different sets of molecules and compare their in-plane absorption and emission dipole orientation. Monitoring DiI molecules in PMMA over 1 h, we found rotation of less than 10° for the majority of molecules, while incidental fast rotation and transition to a dark state occurs. The fluorescence intensity was observed to be molecule dependent, which is an indication for out-of-plane orientation and different local photophysical environment.",,"Diffusion; Dissociation; Fluorescence; Light polarization; Molecular orientation; Molecules; Optical microscopy; Photochemical reactions; Near field scanning optical microscopy; Rotational diffusion; Single molecules; Translational diffusion; Molecular dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031549598

The global average, direct anthropogenic aerosol effect on upwelling shortwave fluxes is estimated to be about +1/2 W m-2, whereas errors in flux changes measured with airborne and spacebome radiometers are 2 to 8 W m-2 or larger. This poses the question of whether flux changes expected in field experiments will be large enough to measure accurately. This paper obtains a new expression for the aerosol-induced change in upwelling flux, compares it to two-stream and adding-doubling (AD) results, and uses all three methods to estimate expected flux changes. The new expression accounts for the solar zenith angle dependences of aerosol transmission and reflection, as well as of surface albedo, all of which can have a strong effect in determining flux changes measured in field experiments. Despite its relative simplicity, the new expression gives results similar to previous two-stream results. Relative to AD results, it agrees within a few watts per square meter for the intermediate solar elevation angles where the flux changes peak (roughly 10° to 30°), but it has negative errors for higher Sun and positive errors for lower Sun. All three techniques yield aerosol-induced changes in upwelling flux of +8 to +50 W m-2 for aerosol midvisible optical depths of 0.1 to 0.5. Because such aerosol optical depths occur frequently off the U.S. and European Atlantic coasts in summer, the flux changes they induce should be measurable by airborne, and possibly by spaceborne, radiometers, provided sufficient care is taken in experiment design (including measurements to separate aerosol radiative effects from those of absorbing gases). The expected flux changes are about 15 to 100 times larger than the global average flux change expected for the global average anthropogenic sulfate optical depth of 0.04. Reasons for the larger flux changes include the larger optical depths considered here (factor 2.5 to 12), plus restricting the measurements to cloud-free, daytime conditions over the ocean (factor 5 to 9).",,"aerosol; anthropogenic aerosol; climate change; radiative effect; radiative forcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031438534

The low emission boiler system (LEBS) is a highly advanced pulverized-coal-fired power plant which will be ready for commercial introduction before the year 2001. LEBS uses supercritical steam conditions and substantial low-level heat recovery to achieve an efficiency of 42%. Very low emissions are realized by using advanced combustion technology and pollution controls that are integrated with the boiler. The high performance power system (HIPPS) is based on indirectly fired combined-cycle technology that is capable of 47-50% efficiency. This system uses a gas turbine driven by a clean air working fluid separately heated in a novel high-temperature furnace. Energy recovered from the turbine exhaust drives a steam cycle. HIPPS is planned to be commercially available by 2005. This paper describes the Combustion 2000 program and the technologies being developed for LEBS and HIPPS.

We examined the response of Rubisco content to atmospheric CO2 enrichment (600-680 μmol mol-1 in place of ppm) in 5 herbaceous species growing in a low altitude grass/and (550 m) near Basel, Switzerland, and 3 herbaceous species from Swiss alpine grassland at 2 470 m. At low elevation, the dominant grass Bromus erectus and the subdominant dicot Sanquisorba minor exhibited 20% to 25% reduction of Rubisco content following high CO2 exposure; no CO2 effect was observed in the subdominants Carex flacca, Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium repens. At the Alpine site, the subdominant grass Pea alpine maintained 27% less Rubisco content when grown at high CO2 while the co-dominant forb Leontodon helveticus had 19% less Rubisco in high CO2. Rubisco content was unaffected in the tundra dominant Carex curvula. Because the degree of Rubisco modulation was similar between high and low elevation sites, it does not appear that differences in local partial pressure of CO2 (altitude) or differences in stress in general induce different patterns of modulation of photosynthetic capacity in response to high CO2. In addition, the degree of Rubisco reduction (&lt; 30%) was less than might be indicated by the low biomass response to CO2 enrichment previously observed at these sites. Thus, plants in Swiss lowland and alpine grassland appear to maintain greater Rubisco concentration and photosynthetic capacity than whole plants can effectively exploit in terms of harvestable biomass.","Acclimation; Alpine; Alps; High CO2; Photosynthesis; Rubisco","Bromus; Bromus erectus; Carex curvula; Carex flacca; Leontodon helviticus; Lotus corniculatus; Pisum sativum; Trifolium repens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030753549

The promotion of phosphorus uptake and plant growth of host by AM fungi is now well recognized. Therefore, it is anticipated that AM symbiosis could be applied for sustainable agriculture. The author investigated the regulation of the symbiosis with emphasis placed on nutrient exchange, namely phosphorus transfer from AM fungi to host plant and reverse transfer of carbon. The following results were obtained: 1) The growth of AM fungi in host roots was regulated by the supply of photosynthates and the growth of both partners in the symbiosis was well harmonized. 2) A new method for the isolation of intraradical hyphae from host root tissues was developed. The characteristics of enzyme activities in the isolated intraradical hyphae suggest that alkaline phosphatase activity is localized in arbuscular hyphae and that glucose is one of the carbon sources from host plant to AM fungi. 3) Electrophoresis analysis showed that symbiosis-specific alkaline phosphatase was present in the soluble protein of mycorrhizal roots. The phosphatase may originate from AM fungi.

M5S 1A7, Canada","A reduced model of the global thermohaline circulation has been asynchronously coupled to a simple energy balance climate model in order to investigate the natural variability of the overturning circulation that may have been characteristic of late glacial conditions. Previous analyses with the ocean-only component of the model have suggested that the nature of the internal variability of the thermohaline circulation was a strong function of the surface boundary conditions on temperature and salinity flux. When the boundary conditions were altered from those corresponding to modern conditions to those appropriate to full glacial conditions, then the internal variability was shown to be radically transformed. Under modern conditions the ocean-only version of the model delivered an overturning circulation that was only weakly time dependent with a characteristic period of centuries. Under full glacial boundary conditions, however, the circulation became strongly time dependent with a characteristic period of millennia. This timescale corresponds to that of the Dansgaard-Oeschger oscillation, which is a prominent feature of the proxy climate records that have been derived on the basis of oxygen isotope data from Summit, Greenland, ice cores by the GRIP and GISP2 collaborations. By coupling the reduced model of the global thermohaline circulation to a simple model of the atmosphere, the authors are able to address the issue of whether the amplitude of the millennium timescale oscillation of atmospheric temperature matches that inferred on the basis of the ice core records. The results reported herein demonstrate that model and observations agree extremely well in this regard. The authors construe this to provide strong further support for the idea that the Dansgaard-Oeschger oscillation is a natural mode of internal variability that would exist even with time-independent boundary conditions appropriate to the full glacial state.",,"atmosphere-ocean coupling; atmosphere/ocean coupling; climate modelling; Dansgaard-Oeschger oscillation; Dansgaard-Oeschger oscillations; ice age; ice ages; late glacial; palaeoclimate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030730158

Since they have exhausted all of their nuclear fuel, their evolution is just a gravothermal process. The release of energy only depends on the detailed internal structure and chemical composition and on the properties of the envelope equation of state and opacity; its consequences on the cooling curve (i.e., the luminosity vs. time relationship) depend on the luminosity at which this energy is released. The internal chemical profile depends on the rate of the 12C(α, γ)16O reaction as well as on the treatment of convection. High reaction rates produce white dwarfs with oxygen-rich cores surrounded by carbon-rich mantles. This reduces the available gravothermal energy and decreases the lifetime of white dwarfs. In this paper we compute detailed evolutionary models providing chemical profiles for white dwarfs having progenitors in the mass range from 1.0 to 7 M⊙, and we examine the influence of such profiles in the cooling process. The influence of the process of separation of carbon and oxygen during crystallization is decreased as a consequence of the initial stratification, but it is still important and cannot be neglected. As an example, the best fit to the luminosity functions of Liebert et al. and Oswalt et al. gives an age of the disk of 9.3 and 11.0 Gyr, respectively, when this effect is taken into account, and only 8.3 and 10.0 Gyr when it is neglected. © 1997.

The measured gas species are, in order of abundance, CH4, H2, C2H6, CO2, N2, C3H8, n-C4H10, n-C5H12, C2H2, i-C4H10, and C2H4. Minor amounts of i-C5H12, n-C6H14, i-C6H14, and neo-C6H14 were also detected (but not quantified) in some samples. A suite of quartz samples from Ca-metasomatised pegmatites contains fluid inclusions with a similar distribution of hydrocarbons but much higher proportions of CO2. The carbonic fluid coexisted immiscibly with a brine (Salvi and Williams-Jones, 1992), which on the basis of field and petrographic evidence, was interpreted to have originated from the magma. However, thermodynamic calculations indicate that the above gas species, specifically the hydrocarbons, could not have coexisted at equilibrium in the proportions measured, at any geologically reasonable conditions either prior to or post entrapment. We propose, instead, that the gas compositions measured in the Strange Lake inclusions, and in inclusions from other alkalic complexes, resulted from the production of H2 during the alteration of arfvedsonite to aegirine, and the subsequent reaction of this H2 with orthomagmatic CO2 and CO to form hydrocarbons in a magnetite-catalysed Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. Locally, influx of an oxidised calcic brine, derived externally from the pluton, altered the original composition of the fluid by converting hydrocarbons to CO2.

The biogenic emissions and the land-use classes are obtained by using LANDSAT-5 satellite imagery. A photochemical module based on the CBM-IV scheme and the SMVGEAR numerical method for solving the atmospheric chemistry are used. The results are compared with data obtained from the Madrid Municipality ozone network.

Initially, drought increased the fraction of closed Photosystem II (PS II) reaction centres (lowered qP) and decreased the quantum yield of PS II electron transport (Φ(PS II)) with no enhancement of nonradiative dissipation of light energy (qN) because it increased the efficiency of electron capture by open PS II centres F'(v)/,F'(m). As drought progressed, F'(v),/F'(m) fell and the decrease in Φ(PS II) was associated with an increased qN. The kinetics of dark relaxation of fluorescence quenching pointed to an increase in a slowly-relaxing component under drought, in association with increased contents of zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin. Total NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase activity increased and total stromal fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase activity decreased under drought, while the activation state of these enzymes remained unchanged.

Debate, in public at least, reverted to the traditional North-South divide. Yet in many countries the enthusiasm for the findings of the Earth Summit and its follow-up is clear. What is argued is that governments need to sort out much more clearly what can and should be addressed at the international level. Many of the major environment issues, such as forest and biodiversity loss, are basically national or local concerns. The development agenda and poverty have to be addressed locally. Only when it is clear that individual countries and regions cannot cope without international intervention, as happens in the case of climate change and the international trade regime, should the matter be of concern to the UN at the centre.

The dust suppressants studied, lignin derivatives and chloride based compounds, were used on unpaved road test sections during the severe dusty months of 1993 and 1994 in Colorado, which fell in the late spring to autumn period To measure the relative effectiveness of the different dust suppressants, comparative fugitive dust emission studies were conducted on unpaved road test sections using the Colorado State University Dustometer, a dust-sampling device developed during this research. In addition, total aggregate loss from the surfaces of the test sections was measured. Based upon the prevailing costs, analyses were performed to determine the economics of using the different dust suppressants. The research indicated that all three dust suppressants studied reduced fugitive dust emission from the unpaved roadways by 50-70%. The treated test sections retained 42-61% more aggregate than the untreated control test section. The cost savings of retaining aggregate on the treated test sections more than offset the costs of the dust suppressants, resulting in an estimated cost savings of 28-42% over the untreated control test section.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001370695

Deserts are also one of the most climatically unpredictable and heterogeneous biomes; thus, variation of energy balance characters due either to plasticity or genetic differentiation might also be crucial to the success of desert plant species. In a common garden environment we examined variation in the traits associated with energy balance and productivity in Encelia farinosa A. Gray (brittlebush) plants. Comparing two populations from contrasting rainfall and drought climates, we found that plants from the wetter site (Superior, Arizona) always maintained higher leaf absorptances than plants from the more xeric region (Oatman, Arizona) when at similar water potentials. Superior plants also increased stomatal conductance and photosynthesis in response to mid-spring rainfall, whereas Oatman plants did not. Oatman plants, however, tended to have greater leaf areas and continuous spring growth, which made them larger than superior plants, yet both populations produced the same number of flower heads. The differences for these traits, and the associations among them, agree with predictions based on the contrasting drought and rainfall environments of these two populations. Our results suggest that the differences might represent alternative suites of characters of selective importance for maximizing carbon gain over the climatically variable range of this widespread species. Furthermore, these differences, detected in common environment conditions, might have a genetic basis, which might contribute to a greater potential for local adaptation in this species.","Desert; Drought response; Encelia farinosa (brittlebush); Energy balance; Leaf pubescence","Encelia farinosa; Asteraceae; brittlebush; desert; drought; leaf pubescence; USA, Arizona, Oatman; USA, Arizona, Superior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031285064

The assessment concentrates on polarization lidar and radiometric observations of persisting contrails from Salt Lake City, Utah, where an extended Project First ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Program) Regional Experiment (FIRE) cirrus cloud dataset from the Facility for Atmospheric Remote Sensing has captured new information in a geographical area previously identified as being affected by relatively heavy air traffic. The following contrail properties are considered: hourly and monthly frequency of occurrence; height, temperature, and relative humidity statistics; visible and infrared radiative impacts; and microphysical content evaluated from in situ data and contrail optical phenomenon such as halos and coronas. Also presented are high-resolution lidar images of contrails from the recent SUCCESS experiment, and the results of an initial attempt to numerically simulate the radiative effects of an observed contrail. The evidence indicates that the direct radiative effects of contrails display the potential for regional climate change at many midlatitude locations, even though the sign of the climatic impact may be uncertain. However, new information suggests that the unusually small particles typical of many persisting contrails may favor the albedo cooling over the greenhouse warming effect, depending on such factors as the geographic distribution and patterns in day versus night aircraft usage.",,"cirrus; climate change; contrail; USA, Utah, Salt Lake City",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031432845

Emission maxima were associated with the 440-nm, 470-nm and 370-nm excitation bands and the 455-nm to 590-nm emission bands. The coma of milkweed, silkvine, cotton (raw), cottonwood seeds and yellow- colored pollen and spores were highly fluorescent. The pappus of thistles, dandelion and goat's beard seeds and newly senesced grass leaves and glumes had moderate to high fluorescence. Dark brown-colored mushroom spores and weathered, senesced plant materials had low fluorescence. The emission spectra resembled that of regent, microcrystalline cellulose although impurities incorporated within the plant materials altered their emission intensities from that of cellulose. Moderate to low emissions were from tan- to dark brown-colored materials, whereas the white-colored or light, tan-colored materials had high emissions.",,"Agriculture; Air pollution; Cellulose; Emission spectroscopy; Laser applications; Luminescence; Plants (botany); Scanning; Soils; Stresses; Pollen; Seed pubescence; Senesced plant materials; Spores; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031362611

Nutrient (nitrates and silicates), phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll), oxygen, temperature, salinity, and current fields were used to elucidate the effect of a freshwater pulse produced by the discharge of the St. Lawrence and Saguenay rivers on the current fields and the biological variability and productivity of the LSLE. A simple Rossby adjustment model is presented to explain the temporal (3-5 days) and spatial (40-50 km) scales of motion in our study region (impact of the freshwater pulse on the circulation). Prior to the passage of the pulse during the neap tide, the circulation was dominated by a downstream outflow and phytoplankton blooms were limited to areas of weak baroclinic currents downstream and along the south shore. The arrival of the pulse during the tidal transition led to the intensification of a transverse current that most likely reduced flushing and allowed phytoplankton biomass to develop further upstream and toward the north shore. During the spring tide, lower salinity waters and the bloom spread along the north shore as the transverse current weakened. Based on these observations, a new conceptual model of mesoscale physical-biological interactions in the LSLE is presented that emphasizes the importance of transverse motions in regulating mesoscale patterns in phytoplankton blooms.",,"circulation; estuarine dynamics; freshwater pulse; phytoplankton; river discharge; Canada, Quebec, St Lawrence Estuary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030808540

Modeling has shown that the most important precursors to ozone formation are emissions from motorized vehicles. As the Sacramento, CA region battles ozone pollution, it looks towards its large employers to help decrease the number of vehicles on the roadways. This is not an easy task. Reduction of mobile air emissions is dependent upon changing the habits of commuters. Ridesharing is the answer, but trading the convenience of a single occupant vehicle for some alternative mode of pollution preventing transportation involves a change of lifestyle. Sacramento's largest employer, McClellan Air Force Base, has devised an effective, dynamic program that promotes ridesharing through education and marketing under restrained conditions. Recognized by the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management district and the American Lung Association, McClellan's Rideshare Program targets five modes of transportation as beneficial commuter choices. Marketing schemes and incentives for each of the modes will be discussed. Employees are challenged to decrease their single occupant vehicle commute trips and to decrease the number of motorized vehicle trips needed once on the worksite.

For those applications the interface properties of the heterostructure play a key role. In this article the electronic and chemical nature of the interface between plasma deposited a-C:H in the form of diamondlike carbon (DLC) and hydrogen terminated silicon (111) was determined by in situ core level and valence band photoemission spectroscopy. The quantitative analysis of core level shifts and intensities indicate that both, an interface layer of mixed composition and a pure a-C:H layer, grow simultaneously with relative growth rates of 2:1 during the initial stages of the interface formation. The interface layer is first carbon rich and then approaches stoichiometric composition which is reached at an interface thickness of 18 Å. Then a reactive SiC interface is completed and acts as a diffusion barrier which prevents further extension of the interface region when the deposition of a-C:H proceeds. Aside from an acceptor passivation of the Si substrate, due to H atoms from the plasma, no overlayer induced band bending is measured. The valence band offset between Si and DLC is determined as 0.7±0.1 eV with the valence band edge of DLC below that of silicon. © 1997 American Vacuum Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031490170

The PAMS network is designed to aid in the tracking of NMOC and NOx emission changes and to provide sufficient data to evaluate the effectiveness of VOC and NOx emission control programs. During the summer of 1994, two stations were operated in Illinois including a site to monitor precursor emissions near the center of Chicago (NWU), and a site to monitor downwind maximum concentration far north of the city at the Illinois-Wisconsin border (Zion). Both sites are located along the lake shore. Three hour average speciated NMHC concentrations were determined four times per day (start times were hour 0, 6, 12 and 15) at each site on an once every three day schedule (extra sampling days were added on days with high ozone forecasts). The purpose of this study is to extract and evaluate emission inventory information contained in the 1994 Illinois PAMS data using the Chemical Mass Balance (CMB) receptor model. Sample-specific emissions for vehicles, gasoline vapors, whole gasoline, petroleum refineries, graphic arts, architectural coatings and coke ovens were determined for each sample using the CMB model.

Posttreatment readings taken 3 mo or earlier for infestations treated with spinosad suspension concentrate, chlorpyrifos, and DOT surface showed reductions in acoustic emission activity. Only spinosad SC treatment yielded significant acoustic emission reductions at 5 mo or later. Results suggest that chemical toxicity, formulation, and application method, as well as drywood termite behavior and gallery system architecture, influenced the performance of local chemical treatments.

In order to investigate a possible trend, time series of days with a minimum wind speed estimate or measurement equivalent to Beaufort 7, 8 and 9 were established. The longest being a record of the mesonet station Zürich from the period 1864 until 1993 (130 years). Slightly shorter time series for three additional stations in Northern Switzerland were compiled to control the behavior of the longest record and to verify the observed temporal trend. From the location of the four investigated wind records the observational domain was restricted to the part of Switzerland north of the Alps whereas for further meteorological considerations the whole North-Atlantic-European area was included. A negative regional trend in the number of storm days has been observed during the last century. In particular, the period before 1940 has to be interpreted as windier than the following decades. The duration of a storm event also decreased on average. In spite of an increase in cyclonic westwind situations since about 1960 over Europe, Switzerland was hit by fewer storms during the same period. One explanation could be that the whole westwind belt has moved slightly further north where a deepening of the cyclones was observed in recent times. Switzerland is usually situated at the southernmost edge of the particular storm fields and is therefore less influenced by strong gales. Rare exceptions are the cases when a secondary depression directly hits Central Europe, e.g. as happened in February 1990 (storm ""Vivian"").",,"cyclone; storm; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031396073

Properties of the snow cover reflect local meteorological conditions. Therefore in order to detect climate variability on the basis of the seasonal dynamic of the snow, ERS images that show variations due to changes in the snow cover are utilised. During two summer seasons ERS-PRI data covering the area were collected. Simultaneously field measurements were accomplished in order to link up findings in the ERS images with observed meteorological conditions. During the field campaigns micro-meteorological measurements with three automatic weather stations (AWS) were carried out on the glaciers. More than 40 snow pits were dug during the summer season to obtain ground truth data from the snow cover. Based on data from AWS the amount of energy available for melting was computed. The energy balance as derived for the locations of the AWS was than calculated for the entire surface area of the glaciers taking into account a digital terrain model (DTM) and a model for short-wave irradiance. The result can be used to separate periods and areas with melting from periods and areas with a completely frozen snow cover. The same separation can be achieved from the evaluation of ERS-1 imagery.

The main purpose of the investigation is to prove the ability of the model system to analyse the regional air quality in an area characterized by a complex terrain. The results clearly show that the EZM is a useful tool to describe the air pollution levels in such a structured region. In addition to the wind field a detailed emissions inventory is necessary to obtain realistic results. This inventory should be highly resolved in space and time and should contain all major emission sources. A sensitivity study is carried out to investigate the influence of uncertain emission data on the calculated ozone concentrations. Varying the emissions of individual source types inside the estimated error range leads to changes of the maximal ozone concentrations of up to 10%. The results of the sensitivity study lead to useful conclusions with regard to the effectiveness of emission reductions at the regional scale.","Emissions inventory; Photosmog modelling; Sensitivity studies","Emissions inventory; Wind flow simulations; Flow of fluids; Gaseous effluents; Mathematical models; Ozone; Particulate emissions; Wind; Air pollution control; ozone; volatile organic compound; air pollution; air quality; atmospheric flow; atmospheric pollution; complex terrain; emissions control; modelling approach; ozone level; pollutant transport; pollution transport; topography; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; airflow; conference paper; germany; priority journal; wind; Germany, Rhine Valley",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031259921

As a result these models underestimate potential global warming damages. Here, a more realistic, but practical, carbon cycle parameterization is developed that can be incorporated within an optimizing climate-economy model framework. This method is utilized in conjunction with the DICE model (Nordhaus, 1994) to estimate optimal reductions in CO2 emissions. The results are shown to be extremely sensitive to the pure rate of time preference, ρ. For ρ=3% (Nordhaus' preferred value), our model predicts an optimal CO2 emission reduction of 13% by the year 2045, as compared to 11% in the original DICE model. But, for ρ=0% the optimal emissions reduction rises to 79% in the year 2045 and to 97% by the year 2200. We argue that energy policy should be guided by the ρ=0% results for both economic and ethical reasons.

Estimates of these externalities are compared for two commuting scenarios: a base scenario of estimated commuting flows for 1991 and an optimal scenario in which the mean commuting time for all workers is minimized. The findings indicate that significant reductions in congestion and automobile emissions are possible by advocating policies that encourage greater commuting efficiency in the locational choices of workers. The analysis of jobs-housing balance as one such means suggests that a considerable proportion of commuting cannot be explained by geographical imbalances in the distributions of jobs and housing, and that workers consider many factors besides commuting costs in their locational choices. It is concluded that policies promoting jobs-housing balance as the principal strategy for facilitating more efficient commuting may not meet the expectations of policy-makers. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Automobile emissions; Congestion; Excess commuting; Jobs-housing balance; Simulation modeling","air pollution; commuting; methodology; pollution monitoring; traffic congestion; traffic emissions; Canada, Ontario, Hamilton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031413504

In these case studies, the potential human health impacts were estimated for both carcinogenic and chronic non-carcinogenic risk.

An IPCC report estimated that the increase in global average surface temperature at equilibrium resulting from a doubling CO2 would be likely to be between 1.5 and 4.5°C, with a best estimate of 2.5°C. Such climate change is expected to have great impact on crop production. Crop model simulations under the condition of current cultivars and cropping systems indicates that a 2xCO2 climate would substantially increase crop yield and its stability in northern and north-central Japan, and that, in south-central and south-western Japan, it will decrease the yield and its stability to a marked extent. By aggregating these regional impacts over the whole country, national crop production is concluded that would not change significantly from the current level. However, the variability of yield is likely to increase, reflecting increased high-temperature-induced spikelet sterility in south-central and south-western Japan. Adjustment of agricultural practice, such as advancing the planting date and application of supplemental irrigation, is necessary to adapt to climatic changes projected from the GCMs. The yields of crops could increase by introducing adjustment of agriculture practices under the predicted warm climate; however Kyushu where higher temperature could result in heat stresses on crops, it is expected that the yield reduction 2xCO2 climate could not be recovered by supplemental irrigation and advancing the planting date. © 1997, The Society of Agricultural Meteorology of Japan.

It may be appreciated that the downward trend occurring between 1979 and 1985 during the household heating season (from November to March), and observed by us in a previous study, almost disappears when a longer period (1979-89) is analysed.

Despite the enormous lengths to which consensus between indeterminate scientific and policy communities was attained, nevertheless only a handful of nations will deliver 1990 levels of CO2 emissions by 2000. These will not include the USA, Canada or, in all likelihood, the European Union. There is something missing between the scientific case and the willingness to respond to it, This may be an institutional matter, The Conference of the Parties has no real clout over non-compliance. And the general weariness over the distant prospect of climate change induced calamity makes it all too easy to fudge the response. The British media for example have concentrated on the beguiling prospect of the Mediterranean climates coming to North European shores rather than the thorny political difficulties associated with preventing it. As Simon Shackley reveals below, the atmosphere of debate has become noticeably more conflictual as the IPCC has moved from studying the phenomenon of climate change to considering policy responses. Maybe the best bet for the IPCC is to centre on Working Group II (adaptation) and help bring about joint implementation through as much emphasis on joint development strategies as on greenhouse gas mitigation in the industrialized world. Right now there is no effective link in the IPCC between the working groups. Thus the vital opportunity to link activities implemented jointly to improved trade, aid and debt relief matters remains unexplored.

This report aims to assist policy makers in the design and implementation of policies, monitoring and management tools to restore air quality in Mumbai (Bombay), India's financial and commercial capital. Annual average TSP concentration has increased about 50% from 1981 to 1990, to reach 270 μm3. World Health Organization (WHO) and national guidelines for PM10 are frequently and substantially exceeded in Mumbai; 97$ of the population lives in areas where the WHO air quality guideline for particulate is exceeded. Studies point to the resulting health effects - more cases of colds, chronic bronchitis, asthma and general decline in lung function. Using dose-response equations developed in the United States, this report estimates that air pollution causes 2 800 cases of excess mortality, 60 million respiratory sympton days, and 19 million restricted activity days, at a total cost of Rs. 18 billion per year. Applying the essential components of an air quality management system to the problem in Mumbai; this report suggests an action plan containing abatement measures for the short, medium and long terms. Recommended actions fall under two categories - institutional and technical. A single institution with a clear mandate and sufficient resources should be made responsible for air quality management in Mumbai. In addition, capabilities for data gathering and processing should be improved throughout the city. Technically, it is crucial that clean vehicle standards be established and strictly enforced. The switch from dirty to clean fuel, including to unleaded gasoline and low-sulfur diesel, should be completed. Another option for clean vehicles is the introduction of LPG- and CNG-powered vehicles. The use of low-smoke lubrication oil for 2-stroke engines is also an important policy measure. Gross polluters should be identified and penalized. In addition, general traffic management would reduce congestion and pollution. Awareness raising through pyblic and private organizations including educational institutions is key to bringing about policy change on matters of air pollution.",,"air pollution; developing country; management approach; pollution control; urban pollution; India, Maharashtra, Bombay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031411622

The integral-membrane protein was purified as nearly homogeneous protein vesicles by differential ultracentriftigation and HPLC cation exchange chromatography without the detergent solubilization normally required for membrane proteins. Purified AlkB had specific activity of up to 5 units/mg for octane-dependent NADPH consumption. Mössbauer studies of AlkB showed that it contains an exchange-coupled dinuclear iron cluster of the type found in soluble diiron proteins such as hemerythrin, ribonucleotide reductase, methane monooxygenase, stearoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) Δ9 desaturase, rubrerythrin, and purple acid phosphatase. In the as-isolated enzyme, the cluster contains an antiferromagnetically coupled pair of high-spin Fe(III) sites, with an occupancy of up to 0.9 cluster per AlkB. The diferric cluster could be reduced by sodium dithionite, and the diferrous state was found to be stable in air. When both O2 and substrate (octane) were added, however, the diferrous cluster was quantitatively reoxidized, proving that the diiron cluster occupies the active site. Mössbauer data on reduced AlkB are consistent with a cluster coordination rich in nitrogen-containing ligands. New sequence analyses indicate that at least 11 nonheme integral-membrane enzymes, including AlkB, contain the 8-histidine motif required for catalytic activity in stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Based on our Mössbauer studies of AlkB, we propose that the integral-membrane enzymes in this family contain diiron clusters. Because these enzymes catalyze a diverse range of oxygenation reactions, this proposal suggests a greatly expanded role for diiron clusters in O2-activation biochemistry.","Binuclear iron; Cytochrome P450; Desaturase; Nonheme; Oxygenase","Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas oleovorans; acyl coenzyme a desaturase; cytochrome p450; iron; membrane enzyme; oxygenase; iron; membrane protein; mixed function oxidase; recombinant protein; article; controlled study; electron spin resonance; enzyme active site; enzyme activity; enzyme purification; enzyme structure; escherichia coli; ion exchange chromatography; mossbauer spectroscopy; nonhuman; priority journal; pseudomonas; ultracentrifugation; chemistry; enzymology; genetics; Mossbauer spectroscopy; Pseudomonas; Iron; Membrane Proteins; Mixed Function Oxygenases; Pseudomonas; Recombinant Proteins; Spectroscopy, Mossbauer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030611636

In 1993 the south basin of Squaw Lake, Wisconsin, U.S.A., was artificially circulated and injected with CO2 in an attempt to eliminate the massive quantities of blue-greens normally present during summer. The unmixed, uninjected north basin was the control. Despite a great difference in CO2 concentration and in pH between the two basins, their blue-green maxima began simultaneously and eventually reached the same size. The predominant algae in both basins were Aphanizomenon flos-aquae and Anabaena flos-aquae. 2. From 13 May to 9 September, experiments were done to determine the responses of photosynthesis (oxygen production) of the phytoplankton communities in both basins to changes in pH over the range 7-9. Both the north and south basins underwent two distinct shifts in the slopes of their photosynthetic responses to pH. These shifts paralleled changes in the proportion of blue-greens in their phytoplankton. 3. Experiments with additions of KHCO3 or NaHCO3 showed that the responses to pH were really responses to CO2 concentration. Therefore, the data obtained in the photosynthesis experiments were used to calculate the kinetic parameters K(s)* and V(max)*. The K(s)* values varied in relation to the proportion of blue-greens, with lower values during the period when blue-greens predominated. The V(max)* values showed no such systematic changes. 4. CO2 compensation and zero photosynthesis concentrations confirm that when the blue-greens dominated, CO2 was taken up much more efficiently than when the phytoplankton comprised mostly non-blue-greens. No evidence appeared suggesting direct use of bicarbonate even at pH values of 10.0. 5. Experiments with water collected seasonally from four other lakes show that Squaw Lake is not unique. In each case the response slopes (and therefore K(s)* values) were high during spring when non-blue-greens were dominant, but decreased when the blue-green maximum began. 6. Experiments with individual species of algae confirm that blue-greens generally have better CO2 kinetics than do greens. 7. It is concluded that initiation of the blue-green maximum does not depend upon conditions of low CO2 concentration or high pH. However, once the blue-greens become abundant they ensure their dominance by reducing concentrations of CO2 to levels available only to themselves.",,"algae; Anabaena; Anabaena flos-aquae; Aphanizomenon flos aquae; Flos; Anabaena flos-aquae; Aphanizomenon flos-aquae; carbon dioxide; cyanobacteria; dominance; pH; USA, Wisconsin, Squaw Lake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030618970

Systems analysis is a way of looking at a problem in a holistic, integrated fashion through including as many as practicable of the important components, and the linkages among them. Systems analysis often begins with a conceptual model which, even if lacking quantification, is a useful means of changing one's thinking to a multi-issue approach. If possible, conceptual models are 'operationalized' by quantification (using the best available scientific knowledge) of the stocks and flows of the relevant components of the problem, and the processes that are involved. In this paper, a systems approach to food production is used to link various atmospheric issues such as regional acidification and climatic change. A spreadsheet model of food demand and production in various world regions examined the possible effect of atmospheric change on how much food we can grow, and whether or not we may be able to meet the increased demand in the year 2025. Using relatively modest changes in factors of agricultural production, the spreadsheet model calculated global shortfalls by the year 2025 of the order of 10 to 20% in some important agricultural crops, despite the improvements in crop production factors that are envisaged by the Food and Agricultural Organization from now until the year 2010, and that were extrapolated in this paper to 2025. The model also calculated that climatic change in combination with either tropospheric ozone or increased UV-B radiation caused by depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer may in general make the situation worse than in the case of climatic change alone. Given the large uncertainties in the input data, the results in this paper should not be viewed as predictions but rather as an example of taking a relatively simple systems approach to food production using a spreadsheet model, and calculating the effects that various aspects of atmospheric change might have upon it. Therefore, it is extremely important to know the effects upon crop production factors of climatic change, tropospheric ozone and increased UV-B radiation not only as individual issues, but also of their combined effect since it is probable that in many regions they will occur in combination.","Atmospheric change; Food; Modelling","ozone; acid rain; acidification; agriculture; air pollution; climate; conference paper; crop; food; model; ozone layer; stratosphere; system analysis; ultraviolet b radiation; Computer simulation; Cultivation; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Ozone layer; Spreadsheets; Systems analysis; Ultraviolet radiation; Ozone depletion; Climate change; atmospheric change; interdisciplinary approach",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030609240

The visible emission rate in diffusional steady-state measurements scales as the sixth power of excitation intensity, demonstrating that absorption of six near-IR photons is required to generate emission of one visible photon. Transient measurements reveal that this process is composed of two sequential nonlinear steps, the first excited by four photons and the second by two photons. These results, in combination with measurements of multiphoton-excited serotonin UV fluorescence, support a model in which 5HT is photochemically transformed as a consequence of four-photon absorption (Etot ≈ 6 eV) to a photoproduct that then emits in the visible region via two-photon excitation. A minimum bound of ∼10-51 cm4 s photon-1 is observed for the two-photon emission action cross section at 830 nm. Photoionization, rather than reaction with a dissolved oxygen species, appears to be the primary mechanism for generation of the blue-green-emitting photoproduct.

The central 12 residues, which interact only with the lipid hydrocarbon chains, maintained a very stable helical structure. Helical regions extended beyond these central 12 residues, but interactions with the lipid fatty-acyl ester linkages, the lipid headgroups, and water molecules made the helix less stable in this region. The C and N termini, exposed largely to water, existed as random coils. As a whole, the helix tilted substantially, from perpendicular to the bilayer plane (0°) to a 30°tilt. The helix experienced a bend at its middle, and the two halves of the helix at times assumed substantially different tilts. Frequent hydrogen bonding, of up to 0.7 ns in duration, occurred between peptide and lipid molecules. This resulted in correlated translational diffusion between the helix and a few lipid molecules. Because of the large variation in lipid conformation, the lipid environment of the peptide was not well defined in terms of 'annular' lipids and on average consisted of 18 lipid molecules. When compared with a 'neat' bilayer without peptide, no significant difference was seen in the bilayer thickness, lipid conformations or diffusion, or headgroup orientation. However, the lipid hydrocarbon chain order parameters showed a significant decrease in order, especially in those methylene groups closest to the headgroup.",,"dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine; hydrocarbon; lipid; membrane protein; amino terminal sequence; article; bilayer membrane; carboxy terminal sequence; DNA helix; DNA structure; hydrogen bond; hydrophobicity; molecular dynamics; phospholipid bilayer; protein conformation; protein protein interaction; proton transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030966534

The focus of this study is to provide a long-term (i.e. 12-years, 1981-1992) climatology of the seasonal, annual, intra-annual and inter-annual variations of ozone and surface meteorology in the Baltimore-Washington region, which is located at the southern end of the Clean Air Act-mandated Northeast Ozone Transport Region (OTR). The area was divided into four regions: urban Baltimore, MD; urban Washington, DC; non-urban Maryland; and, non-urban Northern Virginia. The annual mean departure statistics for Baltimore, non-urban Maryland and non-urban Northern Virginia all had positive departures in 1981, 1984, 1989 and 1992. The annual mean departure statistics for Washington, DC were substantially different from the other three regions. However, the summer (i.e. June-August) mean departure statistics for all four regions were similar. In general, positive departures were found in 1983, 1988 and 1991 with negative departures occurring in 1981, 1985, 1989 and 1992. Nominally, 50% of the exceedances (i.e. concentrations $120 ppb) had concentrations ranging from 120 to 130 ppb and about 75% were in the range of 120 to 140 ppb. The individual ozone and meteorological time series were divided into four terms, representing the different behavioral time scales: long-term mean; the mean intra-annual perturbation; the inter-annual perturbation; and, the synoptic perturbation. The synoptic perturbation for the non-urban areas was linked closely to the synoptic cycle (i.e. 3-10 days), which indicates that net increases/decreases in ozone at these time scales is highly dependent on synoptic-scale weather systems. Under episodic conditions, the synoptic perturbation contributed approximately 40-55% of the total ozone concentration.",,"Climatology; Perturbation techniques; Time series analysis; Synoptic scale weather systems; Ozone",Conference Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031370727

The Kakinokidae Formation at this site is intensely bioturbated, shows no evidence of wave action, and contains molluscs that suggest a paleodepth of 100 to 150m. The chemosynthetic community occurs at the outcrop in a zone that is 18m wide and 5m high, and it consists of extremely abundant and mostly articulated shells of the bivalves Conchocele disjuncta, Lucinoma aokii, and Acharax tokunagai. These bivalves have been previously observed to contain chemosynthetic bacteria in their bodies. Nearly all of the articulated bivalves are preserved in life position. The enclosing matrix is mostly cemented by carbonates characterized by extreme 13C depletion (δ13C = -48.82~ -62/29‰), which suggests that the carbonates were precipitated by sulfate-reducing bacterial activity using methane. These observations indicate that this community is an in situ chemosynthetic colony that depended on methane which seeped from unknown source. The outcrop at Kawayatsu is divided into upper and lower parts, based on the mode of occurrence of the disarticulated valves. The lower part is characterized by disarticulated valves whose commissure planes are aligned vertical to the bedding plane. Those in the upper part are aligned parallel to the bedding plane and predominantly occur in convex-down positions. The disarticulated valves in the lower part may be in life position. They might have been disarticulated through biological means within the sediments, then preserved virtually in life position. The disarticulated valves in the upper part are inferred to have been reworked and exposed on the sediment surface. It is likely that environmental changes occurred between the times of deposition of lower and upper parts of the Kawayatsu outcrop. Those changes were either a shallowing of the habitat due to an over-growth of carbonate cement, or an overpopulation of bivalves caused by increased volume of seepage or a reduced influx of sediments. These changes restricted the bivalve habitat to just below the sediment surface and allowed dead shells to easily rework onto the sediment surface.",,"chemosynthetic community; outer shelf; Pleistocene; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031394026

Therefore, the modeling of fuel volatility is an essential basis for all theoretical approaches to address these issues. For the modeling, commercial gasolines were simplified with 13 major hydrocarbon species based on the carbon number and hydrocarbon families. Thermodynamic states of modeled fuels were calculated by the program SUPERTRAP? released by NIST (National Institute of Science and Technology). The program is based on the Peng-Robinson equation of state. The compositions of simulated fuels were calibrated with the specifications of commercial gasolnes such as ASTM distillation curve.

Previously we have reported the molecular characterization of a number of in vivo selected mutant alleles and showed that they were unlikely to represent total loss of function alleles and that a deletion of the creA gene and surrounding DNA has an extremely severe effect on morphology under both carbon catabolite repressing and carbon catabolite nonrepressing conditions. Here we present an analysis of in vivo selected creA mutations with an extreme morphological phenotype and show that some of these alleles would be predicted to result in no functional CreA. The most extreme of these alleles resulted in a truncation of the protein within the first zinc finger. Precise gene disruptions, leaving the flanking sequences intact, show essentially the same phenotype as this truncated allele. Thus, a strain containing a null allele is viable, and the leaky-lethal phenotype of previous deletion alleles must be due to the deletion of additional 3' genomic sequence. A strain containing an allele that results in a deletion of the final 80 amino acids shows reduced sensitivity to carbon catabolite repression for a number of systems, thus localizing a region of the protein involved in repression. Surprisingly, the phenotypically most extreme allele studied is not a null allele, but results in an amino acid substitution that would disrupt the zinc finger region and abolish binding to DNA. This is the only allele that produces a full-length protein, predicted to be nuclear localized, but which completely abolishes DNA binding. The phenotype may be more extreme than the null alleles due to the nuclear located CreA protein titrating interacting proteins.","Carbon catabolite repression; CreA; Mig1p; Transcriptional repressor; Zinc finger protein","carbon; mutant protein; regulator protein; zinc finger protein; allele; amino acid substitution; article; Aspergillus nidulans; catabolite repression; cell shape; cell structure; cell viability; controlled study; deletion mutant; fungal genetics; gene disruption; gene mutation; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein DNA binding; protein domain; protein structure; Aspergillus; Emericella nidulans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031214324

A scenario has been developed for an improved management program that would be implemented over the next 40 years. Possible options have been aggregated into three interlinked groups: increase in forest productivity through improvement of the forest conditions and the structure of the Forest Fund, decrease of carbon release by mitigation of disturbance regimes, and improvement of landscape management. One prerequisite in developing this scenario was that the cost of sequestering one ton of carbon should not exceed US$3 (1992 dollar value). In this article a simple model is described to illustrate the following possibilities for increased carbon fixation by improved forest management: large-scale reforestation and afforestation, replacement of stands with low productivity and replacement of so called soft deciduous species and 'climax' stands, and implementation of rational silviculture (thinning). The results indicate a potential for an increase in carbon fixation in Russian forest ecosystems of 24.4 Pg over 100 years, after the first year that the actions discussed are implemented. The net sink of carbon was determined to be 16.5 Pg in the 'low' estimate and 42.5 Pg in the 'high' estimate. There are, however, many uncertainties in the data and there are difficulties in adequately modeling the possibilities for implementation under current conditions in Russia. In spite of these uncertainties, we conclude that there is great potential for economically justified increased carbon fixation through improved forest management in Russia.","carbon budget; climate change; forest management; mitigation options","air pollution; article; climate; ecosystem; environmental protection; forest; greenhouse effect; nonhuman; russian federation; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; economic analysis; environmental economics; forest management; Russian Federation; Carbon; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Economics; Ecosystems; Geographical regions; Management; Mathematical models; Carbon budget; Carbon fixation; Carbon sequestration; Mitigation options; Russia; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030612953

In this organism the utilization of the two catabolic pathways, a variant of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway and the modified (nonphosphorylative) Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway, was investigated and the first enzyme of the ED pathway, glucose dehydrogenase, was characterized. The distribution of the 13C label in alanine synthesized by cells grown with [1-13C]glucose indicated that in vivo the EMP pathway and the modified ED pathway operate parallel, with glucose metabolization via the EMP pathway being prominent. To initiate studies on the regulatory mechanisms governing carbon flux via these pathways, the first enzyme of the ED pathway, glucose dehydrogenase, was purified to homogeneity and its phenotypic properties were characterized. The pyridine-nucleotide-dependent enzyme used both NAD+ and NADP+ as cosubstrates, showing a 100-fold higher affinity for NADP+. Besides glucose, xylose was used as substrate, but with significantly lower affinity. These data suggest that the physiological function of the enzyme is the oxidation of glucose by NADP+.

Some of the more significant and recent findings described below are highlighted here. The configuration of the polypeptide chain of EPSP synthase was determined and theorized to function as a charge vector, directing negatively charged substrates to the active site. The kinetic mechanism of EPSP synthase has been revised to describe random binding of substrates, with a preferred sequence being conferred by synergistic binding. New evidence suggests that the reaction that converts the tetrahedral intermediate to EPSP proceeds through an oxocarbonium ion. The excessive synergy of binding between S3P and glyphosate relative to that between S3P and PEP suggests that the gly-S3P complex resembles the tetrahedral intermediate or an oxocarbonium transition state. Enzyme-directed synthesis of new EPSP synthase inhibitors has yielded an elegant series of inhibitors but no herbicides. Although EPSP synthase is the sole site of glyphosate action, the exact lethal consequences of inhibition of the shikimate pathway are not known. The impact of glyphosate action on the photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cycle is discussed in terms of previously unpublished data. The reaction sequence and mechanism of glutamine synthetase has been rationalized by crystal structures representing different stages of the reaction. The chloroplastic form of GS was shown to be coded by a single gene, while cytosolic GS had three-to-five genes. The GS genes were expressed differentially according to tissue, age, light and physiological demands. Chloroplastic GS, having the function of recovering ammonia lost during photorespiration, appeared to be the primary target of phosphinothricin (PPT). Inhibition of photosynthesis by PPT was not due to accumulation of ammonia but possibly was due to depletion of PCR cycle intermediates or inhibition of ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase by glyoxalate and phosphoglycolate. The intentional targeting of histidine biosynthesis for herbicide discovery has yielded both potent herbicides and basic knowledge of the histidine pathway in plants. If commercialized, these compounds would be the first agrochemicals discovered by a rational approach.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-29344475991

The rate of methane production was detenuined by in vitro soil incubations. We found field drainage to be an effective method of mitigating methane emissions from rice paddies, with a 64 reduction in seasonal emissions reported after a single midseason drainage at the Richmond, Texas, site. The decreased methane emissions were in response to soil aeration, as indicated by changes in the Eh and ferrous ion concentration of the soil. The mechanism for this response appears to be a reduction in the rate of methane production, as indicated by significantly reduced soil acetate concentrations and decreased methane production rates in anaerobic soil incubations. Evidence of drainage-induced methanogenic substrate depletion is presented. In addition, the duration and liming of field drainage required for effective mitigation are discussed. We found no evidence that field drainage adversely affected grain yield. Copyright 1997 by the American Geophysical Union.

The successful photochemical indicators are: 03/NO, 03/NOz (where NOz = NOy-NOx), 03/HN03, H202/HN03, and H202/NOz. Results of Urban Airshed Model (UAM-IV) simulations for Atlanta, GA, New York, NY, and Los Angeles, CA, show that high values of these species ratios are correlated with NOx-sensitive chemistry and low values are associated with reactive organic gases (ROG)-sen-sitive chemistry. Correlations between measured 03 and NO in Atlanta and between 03 and NOz in Los Angeles are consistent with theory and reflect the difference between likely NOx-sensitive chemistry in Atlanta and hydrocarbon-sensitive chemistry in Los Angeles. Measured 03, NOx and NO are used to evaluate model performance during two air pollution events in Atlanta and Los Angeles. The performance evaluation includes model scenarios for each city with different anthropogenic and biogenic emission rates and different NOx-ROG sensitivity predictions. Simulations with different NOx-ROG chemistry are found to give similar predictions for peak ozone but different values for photochemical indicators. Comparison with measured values of photochemical indicators provides a more stringent test of model performance than evaluation versus observed ozone. © 1997 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.",,"Computer simulation; Correlation methods; Hydrocarbons; Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Public policy; Photochemical indicators; Reactive organic gases (ROG); Urban airshed model; Air pollution control; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxide; ozone; air pollution indicator; article; photochemistry; priority journal; simulation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031259643

In the current study, the authors examined daily mortality during the period 1987–1993 for the Brisbane region, which is the fastest-growing urban region in Australia (annual average concentration of particulate matter less than 10 μm in diameter = 27 μg/m3, maximum hourly sulfur dioxide level = 60 ppb, and maximum daily ozone hourly level = 118 ppb). The authors conducted a general estimating equation analysis, and they used autoregressive Poisson models for daily mortality to examine associations with air pollution variables. The authors used research methods developed in the Air Pollution on Health, European Approach (APHEA), project to control confounding effects of weather and temporal trends. The air pollutants examined included particulate pollution (measured by nephelometry [bsp data]), sulfur dioxide, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide. The results indicated that the associations between total daily mortality and particulate levels found in studies in the United States and other countries may be applicable in Brisbane, Australia. Ozone levels were also associated significantly with total daily mortality. There was little evidence of interaction between the ozone effects (mainly in summer) and particulates or with sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide. The associations between pollutants (ozone, bsp) and daily mortality were significant only for individuals who were older than 65 y of age; positive associations were also found with cardiovascular disease categories, and the regression coefficients–when significant–were higher than those for total mortality. The results indicated a possible threshold for ozone levels, but a similar result for particulate levels was not apparent. © 1997 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.",,"air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; article; Australia; mortality; particulate matter; priority journal; risk factor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031433813

The selection of genes that, when overexpressed, are able to suppress the reduced viability upon carbon starvation of the rvs167 mutant strain, has allowed the cloning of the SUR7 gene (Accession Number Z46729xl1). We showed that the suppressive ability of the overexpressed SUR7 gene concerns all the rvs167 phenotypes. However, this suppression is only partial since the rvs167-suppressed strain is not of wild-type phenotype. Moreover, SUR7 is also able to suppress partially the phenotypes exhibited by the rvs161 and rvs167 rvs161 mutant strains. The SUR7 gene encodes a putative integral membrane protein with four transmembrane domains. Furthermore, sequence comparisons revealed that Sur7p and two other proteins, Ynl194p and Yd1222p, present significant sequence and structural similarities. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the Rvs161 and Rvs167 proteins act together in relation with Sur7p. Moreover, the putative transmembranous character of Sur7p suggests a membrane localization of the Rvs function, a localization which is consistent with the different rvs phenotypes and the actin-Rvs167p interaction.","Actin cytoskeleton; Budding pattern; Membrane protein; Multicopy suppression; RVS161; RVSI67","actin binding protein; membrane protein; article; molecular cloning; nonhuman; priority journal; protein localization; saccharomyces cerevisiae; suppressor gene; Actins; Amino Acid Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Fungal Proteins; Genes, Fungal; Genes, Suppressor; Membrane Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030795414

In doing this, we have been motivated by the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model presented by Wood et al. (1992). For catchments, or for parts of the land surface, whose hydrology fits the TOPMODEL assumptions, this lumped version offers an alternative representation that can be used as the building block for land surface hydrology models at large spatial scales. The model is first applied, with satisfactory results, to a small catchment near Canberra in Australia. Next, using the same model, the effects of random spatial variability of rainfall are studied, but in the context of land surface hydrological parameterizations for global climate models. Sub-grid rainfall variability, especially the partial coverage that characterizes rainfall events at such large scales, is found to cause significant biases in the estimation of land surface fluxes. Other manifestations of the effects of the spatial variability of rainfall are also investigated, also by means of model simulations, but with a view to gaining insights for developing simple parameterizations of land surface fluxes at large scales. This includes the investigation of the dynamics, i.e. spatial and temporal variability, of the soil moisture state variable during and after a rainfall event. In addition, empirical relationships linking the variable contributing area, subsurface runoff and evaporation, to a soil moisture state variable (e.g. soil moisture storage), are derived based on model simulations, and the effects of the sub-grid rainfall variability on these relationships are examined. Because of the strong non-linearity inherent in the process descriptions within the model, the above 'constitutive' relationships are strongly affected by rainfall heterogeneity. © 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Aggregation; Disaggregation; Rainfall heterogeneity; TOPMODEL; Variable bucket capacity","Computer simulation; Evaporation; Geomorphology; Hydrodynamics; Infiltration; Mathematical models; Moisture; Rain; Runoff; Soils; Rainfall heterogeneity; Topography based hydrological model (TOPMODEL); Variable bucket capacity; Hydrology; heterogeneity; rainfall; TOPMODEL; variable bucket capacity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031177890

If this holds in the central regions of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), in particular Seyfert galaxies, then considerable nuclear spallation of Fe occurs, resulting in enhanced abundances of the sub-Fe elements Ti, V, Cr, and Mn. These elements produce a cluster of X-ray fluorescence lines at energies just below the 6.4 keV Fe Ka line. It is suggested that the red wings on the Fe lines observed with ASCA from various Seyfert AGNs are due to the unresolved line emission from these elements. Future observations with more sensitive X-ray instruments should resolve these lines.

Forest biomass inventory is substantial in the United States and significant amounts of wood residue are generated from processing, construction, demolition, and municipal solid waste. Prospects for expanding the use of wood biomass for producing electrical power or ethanol will be enhanced by environmental needs and improvements in technology. Environmental needs include 1) reducing carbon emissions from fossil fuels and sequestering carbon; 2) removing wood from forests to improve forest health; 3) diverting urban waste streams from landfills; and 4) generating oxygenates, possibly from ethanol, for gasoline. Technology needs include improvement of short-rotation intensive culture techniques for plantations and improvement of electrical power and ethanol production processes. These efforts can help improve the comparative advantage of wood biomass feedstocks relative to fossil fuel feedstocks.

In the present study, alkene monooxygenase has been resolved from the soluble fraction of cell-free extracts into four components, each of which has been purified to homogeneity, that are obligately required for alkene epoxidation activity. The four required components are 1) a monomeric 35.5-kDa protein containing 1 tool of FAD and a probable 2Fe-2S center; 2) a 13.3-kDa ferredoxin containing a Rieske-type 2Fe-2S cluster; 3) an 11-kDa monomeric protein that contains no detectable cofactors; and 4) a 212-kDa α2β2γ2 multimeric protein containing four atoms of nonheme iron. The 35.5-kDa protein has been characterized as an NADH reductase. The physiological electron acceptor for the reductase was the Rieske-type ferredoxin, which is proposed to be an intermediate electron carrier between the reductase and terminal catalytic component of the system. The 212-kDa protein was specifically inactivated in cell-free extracts by the mechanism-based inactivator propyne, suggesting that it is the catalytic component and contains the active site(s) for O2 activation and alkene epoxidation. The subunit structure and metal analysis of this component suggest that it contains two diiron centers, one for each αβγ protomeric unit. No specific enzymatic activities could be assigned for the 11-kDa protein, but this component was obligately required for steady-state alkene epoxidation. The alkene monooxygenase components were expressed during growth of Xanthobacter Py2 on aliphatic alkenes or epoxides and repressed during growth on other carbon sources. The electron transfer components of alkene monooxygenase were highly specific: other reductase activities present in Xanthobacter were incapable of transferring electrons to the Rieske-type ferredoxin or substituting for the reductase in the alkene monooxygenase complex. Likewise, other bacterial and plant ferredoxins were unable to substitute for the Rieske-type ferredoxin in mediating electron transfer to the oxygenase. The biochemical properties of alkene monooxygenase described in this study suggest that this enzyme combines elements of both the well-characterized aromatic dioxygenase (two-component electron transfer scheme) and methane monooxygenase (small regulatory protein and diiron oxygenase) multicomponent enzyme systems.",,"aliphatic compound; alkene; iron sulfur protein; oxidoreductase; unspecific monooxygenase; article; bacterial metabolism; cell free system; electron transport; enzyme active site; enzyme activity; enzyme assay; enzyme purification; epoxidation; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal; xanthobacter; Chromatography, Gel; Chromatography, Ion Exchange; Circular Dichroism; Electrochemistry; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Electron Transport Complex III; Ferredoxins; Gram-Negative Aerobic Bacteria; Iron-Sulfur Proteins; Macromolecular Substances; Molecular Weight; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygenases; Protein Conformation; Spectrophotometry; Bacteria (microorganisms); Xanthobacter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030803666

Thus, policymakers will eventually have to address adaptation to the effects of climate change. Given the uncertainties about the timing, direction, and magnitude of regional climate change, it might seem preferable to postpone adaptive measures until after climate changes. Yet, this may not produce satisfactory results if climate change impacts are irreversible or catastrophic, long-lived resource systems are affected, or current trends make adaptation less likely to succeed in the future. In these cases, policy changes in anticipation of climate change may be justified. Anticipatory climate change measures need to be flexible-they should absorb impacts or enable a system to quickly recovery under a wide variety of climate situations. In addition, they should be economically efficient, that is their benefits should exceed their costs. Although many measures are appropriate anticipatory measures, not all of them need to be implemented now. Those most in need of immediate implementation should meet at least one of the following criteria: (1) address irreversible or costly impacts; (2) be urgent, i.e. reverse trends that make adoption of the measure more difficult over time; or (3) address long-term decisions, such as building infrastructure. A method is proposed for natural resource policymakers to use in analyzing the need for anticipatory adaptation policies and the effectiveness of policy options to anticipate climate change. This method enables policy makers to identify those anticipatory policies most in need of immediate implementation.","Adaption; Climate change; Policy","climate change; environmental policy; global planning; greenhouse gas; greenhouse gas emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031439244

New simultaneous observations of the triplet λ5876 and singlet λ6678 lines show that the emission ratio for these lines is near unity, contrary to the predictions of either non-LTE model atmospheres or nebular recombination theory. Several He I emission events point to the formation of short-lived structures near the star's surface. On 1995 September 12 the line λ6678 exhibited a strong (0.13Icont) emission lasting some 20 minutes. The rapid decay of this feature implies a density of ≥1011.5 cm-3 for an emitting plasma structure near the star. This value is consistent with density estimates for slabs which may be responsible for ephemeral ""dimples"" in this star's He I lines on other occasions. We argue that photospheric helium emissions during Hα-quiescent phases are caused by foreground material and ask what mechanism might produce these features against the stellar background. To answer this question we have simulated He I line emission from model slabs having various properties and suspended over the star. We find that illumination by a source of extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) or X-ray flux depletes the He i column density so that it is difficult to form observable He I lines. A more interesting set of conditions occur for slabs with high densities (∼1012 cm-3) and moderately large optical thicknesses in optical He I lines. Under these modified assumptions modest amounts of emission can be reproduced in singlet and triplet lines, and in the observed ratio. The key to producing this emission is for the slab to feel its own Lyman continuum radiation. This condition causes λ584 and other resonance lines to partially depopulate the ground state and to overpopulate the first few excited levels, ensuring that the departure coefficients of relevant atomic levels approach common values. The second necessary ingredient is a high density, which tends to equalize the departure coefficients of excited levels through recombinations and through redistribution of electrons among the l-sublevels. The combination is a kind of ""Lyman-pumped recombination"" because it relies on the Lyman continuum being marginally optically thick. Our results are consistent with studies of He I emission from planetary nebulae, symbiotic variables, and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and may have a bearing on other ""detached atmospheres"" problems as well. This study appears to be the first application of such a recombination mechanism to a quasi-photospheric setting. © 1997. The American Astronomical Society.

If it were possible to detect these plumes with an airborne geophysical technique, then the technique could be used on reconnaissance surveys to identify prospective areas. More detailed geophysical (eg, seismic) or geochemical surveys would be required to further develop these prospects. Hydrocarbbn alteration plumes have been detected using the following geophysical techniques: Magnetic; electrical; induced polarisation; and radiometric methods. Of these methods only magnetic and radiometric methods can be acquired from an airborne platform. However, the electrical method responds to resistivity or conductivity and this quantity can also be mapped with an electromagnetic method — which can be mounted on an aircraft. The ALTREXô method therefore consists of an electromagnetic system, a magnetic system and, optionally, a radiometric system installed on an aircraft. The method has been tested (with electromagnetic and magnetic installations only) in three onshore basins in the southwestern United States of America. Only one of the seven fields shows a near-surface magnetic anomaly interpreted to be associated with the alteration zone. The other six fields, however, do have magnetic responses which can be associated with deeper structural features, which may control the hydrocarbon traps. The electromagnetic data, which respond to the conductivity in the top 300 m of the subsurface, show an anomalous response in most cases. This anomalous response generally correlates with the surface projection of the producing field (which are generally at 1 km to 2.5 km depth). Results suggest that a combination of airborne magnetic and electromagnetic data will provide a useful reconnaissance tool for regional scale exploration for alteration zones. Whether these zones are indicative of producing fields or not would require further work. © 1997, CSIRO.

Yet, the nature and processes of human adaptation to climate are poorly understood and rarely investigated directly. Most often, human responses of one form or another are simply assumed in impacts research. Analyses that do address adaptation use a variety of interpretations and perspectives resulting in an incomplete, and at times inconsistent, understanding of human adaptation to environmental variations. This paper reviews and synthesizes perspectives from an eclectic body of scholarship to develop a framework for characterizing and understanding human adaptation to climatic variability and change. The framework recognizes the characteristics of climatic events, the ecological properties of systems which mediate effects, and the distinctions which are possible among different types of adaptation.

The role of the terrestrial biosphere as a source or sink for carbon during climate change is critical: if increased GHG concentration and warming enhances carbon storage, thereby reducing atmospheric concentrations, the climate changes would also be ameliorated. If instead, carbon storage is reduced, the warming could induce a positive feedback to further increase atmospheric concentrations already on the rise from burning of fossil fuels. Differing climate-defined static vegetation classifications have been used to project biome distributions for climates induced by 2XGHGs. These projections assume that species extirpation and invasion will track perfectly distributions of climate variables and they predict enhanced terrestrial carbon storage. However, theoretical calculations and palaeoecological evidence suggest an alternative, more realistic simplifying assumption: trees will be extirpated but will not invade new territory before 2XGHG climate is attained. We projected global terrestrial carbon under future climates using both assumptions. Simulated terrestrial carbon under delayed immigration decreased 7 to 34 Pg from modern values in contrast to increases projected under instant migration in this and earlier model exercises.","Climate change effects; Forest development; Terrestrial carbon; Tree migration; Vegetation models","biomass; carbon dioxide enrichment; climatic change; tree migration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031472799

Most of the ultraluminous galaxies in this sample are interacting, but not completed, mergers. The CO(1-0) luminosity of all but one of the ultraluminous galaxies is high, with values of log (L′CO/K km s-1 pc2) = 9.92 ± 0.12. The extremely small dispersion of only 30% is less than that of the far-infrared luminosity. The integrated CO line intensity is strongly correlated with the 100 μm flux density, as expected for a blackbody model in which the mid- and far-IR radiation is optically thick. We use this model to derive sizes of the FIR- and CO-emitting regions and the enclosed dynamical masses. Both the IR and CO emission originate in regions a few hundred parsecs in radius. The median value of LFIR/L′CO = 160 L⊙/K km s-1 pc2, within a factor of 2 or 3 of the blackbody limit for the observed far-IR temperatures. The entire ISM is a scaled-up version of a normal galactic disk with the ambient densities a factor of 100 higher, making even the intercloud medium a molecular region. We compare three different techniques of H2 mass estimation and conclude that the ratio of gas mass to CO luminosity is about a factor of 4 times lower than for giant molecular clouds (GMCs) but that the gas mass is a large fraction of the dynamical mass. Our analysis of CO emission from ultraluminous galaxies reduces the H2 mass from previous estimates of 2-5 × 1010 M⊙ to 0.4-1.5 times; 1010 M⊙, which is in the range found for molecular gas-rich spiral galaxies. A collision involving a molecular gas-rich spiral could lead to an ultraluminous galaxy powered by central starbursts triggered by the compression of infalling preexisting GMCs.

There is an acute need for such estimation in water balance studies in arid climates, and the case study in this paper is for such a region. The wetting front movement in the unsaturated zone depends on antecedent soil moisture, the ponded water depth and its duration, and on the position of the water table and the hydraulic properties of the unsaturated zone. A hydraulic connection between the recharge basin and the aquifer is not immediately established because the wetting front is unsaturated. A numerical model is applied to estimate recharge in an arid-zone wadi, and its validity is tested by comparing it with an analytical solution of the equations. The calculated recharge values matched the piezometric levels observed at a well site at the edge of the wadi channel. The total recharge depths found by integration in the time domain provided a good estimate of the transmitted volume of water per unit length of wadi channel. The findings were confirmed by runoff volume measurements at gauging stations located in the basin. ©1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Analytical and numerical techniques; Arid region; Groundwater recharge; Wadi","Aquifers; Arid regions; Groundwater resources; Hydraulics; Hydrology; Integration; Mathematical models; Moisture; Runoff; Soils; Time domain analysis; Wetting; Water balance; Recharging (underground waters); arid region; ephemeral stream; groundwater recharge; recharge estimation; unconfined aquifer; Saudi Arabia, Wadi Tabalah",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031254586

Aerosol and cloud backscatter cross sections were acquired during November and December 1989 and May and June 1990 by the NASA DC-8 aircraft as part of the Global Backscatter Experiment. The instrument, methodology, and measurement results are described. A Nd:YAG laser produced 1.064- and 0.532-μm energy. The 1.54-μm transmitted pulse was generated by Raman-shifted downconversion of the 1.064-mm pulse through a Raman cell pressured with methane gas. The lidar could be pointed in the nadir or zenith direction from the aircraft. A hard-target-based calibration procedure was used to obtain the ratio of the system calibration between the three wavelengths, and the absolute calibration was referenced to the 0.532-μm lidar molecular backscatter cross section for the clearest scattering regions. From the relative wavelength calibration, the aerosol backscatter cross sections at the longer wavelengths are resolved for values as small as 1% of the molecular cross section. Backscatter measurement accuracies are better than 10−9 (m sr)−1 at 1.064 and 1.54 μm. Results from the Pacific Ocean region of the multiwavelength backscatter dependence are presented. Results show extensive structure and variation for the aerosol cross sections. The range of observed aerosol cross section is over 4 orders of magnitude, from less than 10−9 (m sr)−1 to greater than 10−5 (m sr)−1. © 1997 Optical Society of America.","Aerosol backscatter; Lidar; Near infrared; Raman cell",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000736702

The role of the surface reaction and the characterisation of the surface species active in the catalytic reaction were the main goals of the investigation. With this aim, the investigation was centred on the analysis of some important effects on catalyst activity and selectivity: the effect of the ratio of methane to oxygen; that of the temperature; that of the contact time. With the same aim, a study was carried out under transient conditions at the very beginning of the reaction and an analysis of the apparent activation energy was made. The whole set of experiments was completed by a study of the reactivity of ethane, and its ability to undergo dehydrogenation and formation of ethylene under the same conditions of methane coupling. It was possible therefore to detect the strong adsorption of CO2 even at such high temperatures and its importance in reducing selectivity to C2-hydrocarbons; moreover the surface plays an important role in the overall reaction up to about 700°C for Li2O/Y2O3 and up to about 730°C for LiYO2. This result is confirmed also by the evidence that the apparent activation energy is higher at the lowest temperatures for both catalysts.","Catalyst activity; Lithium-yttrium catalysts; Methane coupling","Activation energy; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Dehydrogenation; Ethane; Gas adsorption; High temperature effects; Lithium compounds; Methane; Oxygen; Yttrium compounds; Methane coupling; Catalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031164706

Methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), is the most commonly used fuel oxygenate and is a relatively new gasoline additive. Nevertheless, out of 60 volatile organic chemicals analyzed, MTBE was the second most frequently detected chemical in samples of shallow ambient groundwater from urban areas that were collected during 1993-94 as part of the U.S. Geological Survey's National Water-Quality Assessment Program. Samples were collected from 5 drinking-water wells, 12 springs, and 1g3 monitoring wells in urban areas. No MTBE was detected in drinking-water wells. At a reporting level of 0.2 μg/L, MTBE was detected most frequently in shallow groundwater from urban areas (27% of 210 wells and springs sampled in 8 areas) as compared to shallow groundwater from agricultural areas (1.3% of 549 wells sampled in 21 areas) or deeper groundwater from major aquifers (1.0% of 412 wells sampled in 9 areas). Only 3% of the shallow wells sampled in urban areas had concentrations of MTBE that exceed 20 μg/L, which is the estimated lower limit of the United States Environmental Protection Agency draft lifetime drinking water health advisory. Because MTBE is persistent and mobile in groundwater) it can move from shallow to deeper aquifers with time. In shallow urban groundwater, MTBE generally was not found with benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, or xylenes (BTEX) compounds which commonly are associated with gasoline spills. This disassociation causes uncertainty as to the source of MTBE. Possible sources of MTBE in groundwater include point sources, such as leaking storage tanks, and nonpoint sources, such as recharge of precipitation and storm-water runoff.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5844298336

A comprehensive study has been conducted by the Saskatchewan Research Council and PanCanadian to assess the suitability of the process for Weyburn. This paper presents a technicaL evaLuation of CO2 nearmiscibLe injection for Weybum reservoir. This is based on laboratory studies conducted with three Weyburn oils collected from different regions ofthe reservoir. These studies included: (i) measurement of minimum miscibility pressure for the reconstituted reservoir fluids for pure and impure CO2, (ii) determination of PVT properties for reservoir fluid-C02 mixtures. and (iii) assessment of recovery behaviour from uniquely designed Laboratory coreflood tests representing the permeability contrast ofthe reservoir. The studies indicated that the CO2 minimum miscibility pressure for the Weyburn reservoir oils variedfrom about 11.5 to N.5 MPa. indicating suitabilityfor CO2 miscibLe flooding. PVJdata generatedfor the three Weyburn reservoirfluid-C02 mixtures showed that viscosity reduction and oil swelling by CO2 aLso contributed to oil recovery. A slight manipulation of the measured PVTproperties ofthe mixtures made it possibLe to obtain singLe property curves for the three Weyburn oiLs. This feature can be used to estimate the PVTbehaviourfor any Weyburn oiLfrom the reservoir. Coreflood studies showed that CO2 injected into the Vuggy zone could rise to the upper Marly zone and heLp enhance oil recovery.

Tne region is adjacent to the Po Valley and exhibits the highest ozone concentrations within Switzerland. O3 concentrations of up to 166 parts per bilion by volume (ppbv) were measured. Isoprene was 3 ppbv on the ground and 0.3 ppbv at 1000 m altitude on average in the afternoon and dominates the volatile organic compound (VOC) reactivity toward OH at the ground. Measured HONO concentrations of 0.2 ppbv in the afternoon are much higher, as can be explained from gas phase reactions alone. Radical concentrations are derived from steady state calculations using ground-based measurements in the afternoon. The resulting concentrations for OH, HO2, and RO2 are 3.1 × 106, 1.1 × 109, and 1.3 × 109 molecules cm3, respectively. Isoprene and NO have the largest influence on the estimated OH concentration, followed by O3, photolysis frequency of O3, and HONO. HO2 and RO2 concentration are most sensitive to changes in HONO, O3, and photolysis frequency of O3. The estimated radical production is larger than the NOx emissions, suggesting low-NOx chemistry. We calculated indicators for NOx or VOC sensitivity and show that reduction of NOx emissions would be more efficient in reducing O3 than VOC reduction upwind of the measurement site.",,"atmospheric chemistry; ozone; photochemical oxidant; trace gas; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031413485

The 492 GHz observations were made with the Antarctic Submillimeter Telescope and Remote Observatory. The absorption feature allows the derivation of lower limits for the C I column density in the cold foreground material. The feature is unlikely to be caused by self-absorption within the [C I]-emitting cloud because it is observed over a region at least 4′ across and is also seen in emission 22′ north of the Galactic plane in 12CO J = 2-1. In order to determine the temperature and the abundance ratio of C I to CO in the foreground gas, we compare the observations with 12CO and 13CO J = 1-0 observations obtained with the Bell Labs 7 m antenna and with 12CO and 13CO J = 2-1 observations made with the Kölner Observatorium für Submillimeter und Millimeter Astronomie 3 m telescope. All these observations have about the same beam size. On the assumption that the background emission is not spatially associated with the absorbing cloud(s), a consistent model for the observed line intensities yields an excitation temperature of 3.5 K for 13CO and 5 K for [C I], which implies low volume densities, n(H2) ≲ 103 cm-3. The measured abundance ratio of C I to 13CO is ∼34. This value is consistent with photochemical model calculations that predict an abundance ratio of C I to 12CO of ∼1 and a 12CO to 13CO ratio of ∼30 (reduced in comparison to the intrinsic 12C to 13C isotopic ratio of 60 by fractionation). The observed 13CO column density corresponds to an Av of 4.6 mag, i.e., the hydrogen column density N(H) is ∼9 × 1021 cm-2. This, together with the observed [C I] line width, indicates that the absorption is likely due to several translucent clouds. We compare our results with line fluxes derived from the large-scale, low-resolution COBE FIRAS spectral line survey of [C I] 3P1 → 3P0 and [C I] 3P2 → 3P1 emission in the Galactic plane. Taking into account beam filling, the lower limit for the column density of cold (Tex ≤ 10 K) C I that is traced by our absorption observations is at least a factor of 2 higher than the column density of the warmer C I (Tex ≥ 20 K) detected in emission by COBE. Our results suggest that a substantial fraction of atomic carbon in the interstellar medium may be difficult to detect in [C I] emission, owing to its low excitation. © 1997.

Federal water agencies have responsibilities for protecting aquatic ecosystems through their regulatory programs and operations and planning missions. The primary concern of water resources and aquatic ecosystems planning in the United States is on the riparian or floodplain corridors of river systems. In the context of climate change, planning for these systems focusses on adaptation options both for current climate variability and for that engendered by potential climate change. Ecosystems appear to be highly vulnerable to climate change, as described in IPCC reports. Aquatic ecosystems are likely to be doubly affected, first by thermally induced changes of global warming and second by changes in the hydrologic regime. Perhaps as much as any of the issues dealt with in this issue, the evaluation of ecosystems is linked to fundamental questions of criteria as well as to the details of the Federal environmental planning system. That system is a densely woven, interlocking system of environmental protection legislation, criteria and regulations that includes a self-contained evaluation system driven by the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) procedural guidelines (United States Council on Environmental Quality, 1978) and Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) requirements. The Corps of Engineers must use both the P and G and the NEPA/EIS system in discharging its responsibilities. If U.S. Federal agencies are to take the lead in formulating and evaluating adaptation options, there needs to be a reexamination of existing evaluation approaches. Among the elements of the P and G that may require rethinking in view of the prospects of global climate change are those relating to risk and uncertainty, nonstationarity, interest rates, and multiple objectives. Within the government planning process, efforts must be made to resolve inconsistencies and constraints in order to permit the optimal evaluation of water-based ecosystems under global climate change. The interrelationships of the two systems are described in this paper, and alternative ways of viewing the planning process are discussed. Strategic planning and management at the watershed level provides an effective approach to many of the issues. Current NEPA/EIS impact analysis does not provide a suitable framework for environmental impact analysis under climate uncertainty, and site-specific water resources evaluation relating to climate change appears difficult at current levels of knowledge about climate change. The IPCC Technical Guidelines, however, provide a useful beginning for assessing the impacts of future climate states.",,"climate change; ecosystem evaluation; planning approach; water planning; water resource management; USA; Nepa; Riparia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030827238

Attempts made, using these data, to identify and describe the relationship between plant physiognomy and climate, have all searched for a global relationship applicable throughout data space. We investigate the possibility that the relation between climate and physiognomy is so non-linear that only local relationships should be sought. We use a resemblance function to select sites that are physiognomically similar to each unknown site: these similar sites, alone, yield a climatic estimate for the unknown site. Data collected from New Zealand and Australia are then added to Wolfe's data set in order to test this new method. We show that the use of a resemblance function enables us to produce Mean Annual Temperature estimates for all modern sites that lie within 2.6 C of meteorological data for 90% of the sites. This method also allows the objective identification of outliers based on their distance in physiognomic space from their nearest neighbours. When a method is used that searches for a global relationship between physiognomy and climate, the misfit of estimated Mean Annual Temperature for the combined Southern Hemisphere and CLAMP sites is almost twice as great (5 C) as that to the CLAMP sites alone. In contrast, when the resemblance function is used, the RMS misfit of estimated Mean Annual Temperature increases by only 0.2 C. This result demonstrates the robustness of the new method.","Leaves; Multivariate analysis; Paleobotany; Paleoclimate; Paleotemperature","Dicotyledoneae; eudicotyledons; fossil flora; leaf morphology; morphology; palaeobotany; palaeoclimate; physiognomy; resemblance function; statistical analysis; woody dicotyledon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030619422

Isoprene was the dominant compound emitted and represented over 90% of the total assigned volatile organic compound plant emissions during the day. Other identified species were α-pinene, sabinene, β-pinene, myrcene, limonene, cineole, linalool, α-terpineol, and, tentatatively, cis-and trans-ocimine and an unidentified octatriene. When they were adjusted to standard conditions of temperature (30°C) and light (1000 μmol-2 ms-1) VOC emissions from a 1 year old sapling were 5 times higher (49 and 5.2 μg Cg-1 dry wt h-1 for isoprene and total monoterpenes, respectively) than those from a 7-year-old tree (15 and 0.7 μg C g-1 dry wt h-1 respectively). On a projected leaf area basis these differences were not so apparent (isoprene; 5 and 4 mg m-2 h-1, young and old trees, respectively; monoterpenes, 0.6 and 0.2 mg m-2 h-1, respectively). Emission rates from both trees were closely correlated with incident light flux and temperature, with daytime maxima, and with nighttime minima. Existing models describing emissions in terms of light, temperature, and empirical coefficients were found to adequately predict emissions from the young tree but to grossly overestimate emission rates from the mature tree. This finding has implications for the extrapolation of emission data obtained in the laboratory with immature trees to the canopy, regional, or global scales, although additional measurements are required to determine whether the results presented here can be generalized.",,"Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus globulus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000691035

The use of the photodiode array spectrometer enables the system to have a fast response time while maintaining excellent wavelength stability and reliability, since there are no moving parts in the main optical system.

The Act allows the issuance of Title V permits for numerous similar sources under one general operating permit (GOP). A project for industry to partner with the Texas state regulatory agency to develop a GOP for oil and gas sources was funded by American Petroleum Institute (API). The advantages of GOPs for the regulatory agency and industry are: 1) Economy - A single proposed GOP, not individual applications, is subjected to public notice and comment. 2) Consistency - Facilities with identical equipment have identical permit terms. 3) Certainty - GOP applicants know what the permit terms will be since the permit was negotiated prior to the call for applications. Additionally, a survey was conducted to identify potential states to be targeted in a second phase of the project. This paper will discuss the mechanics of how the GOP was developed, some unique features of the Texas GOP and lessons learned that can be applied to development of GOPs in other states. © Copyright 1997, Society of Petroleum Engineers, Inc.",,"Gasoline; Laws and legislation; Petroleum industry; Air emissions; American Petroleum Institute; Clean air act; Operating permits; Public notice; Regulatory agencies; Title V permits; Unique features; Petroleum prospecting",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088762315

Among these proteins, microtubule- associated protein 2 (MAP2) has been shown to be highly vulnerable to ischemic injuries. To determine the degree of anesthetic effect on the collapse of cytoskeletal proteins, we compared the effect of three inhalation anesthetics; isoflurane, halothane, and nitrous oxide (N2O), on MAP2 degradation during 20 min of forebrain ischemia in the rat. Under equipotent anesthesia, forebrain ischemia was induced by the occlusion of the bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) combined with a lowering of mean arterial pressure (mAP) to 50 mmHg. After 20 min of ischemia, three regions of the brain, the frontoparietal cortex, brainstem, and hippocampus, were removed and separately homogenized. Subsequently, MAP2 of each region was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the frontoparietal cortex and hippocampus, MAP2 was significantly protected from degradation when isoflurane was used combined with nitrogen (N2). However, the protective effects of isoflurane were drastically reduced when N2O was given instead of N2. These results suggest that the use of N2O should be discontinued when severe cerebral ischemia is accidentally incurred during anesthetic management.","Forebrain ischemia; Halothane; Isoflurane; Microtubule- associated protein 2 (MAP2); Nitrous oxide","halothane; isoflurane; microtubule associated protein 2; nitrous oxide; animal experiment; animal model; article; brain ischemia; cytopathogenic effect; cytoskeleton; drug effect; inhalation anesthesia; male; nerve cell necrosis; neuroprotection; nonhuman; priority journal; protein degradation; rat; Anesthetics, Inhalation; Animals; Brain Ischemia; Halothane; Isoflurane; Male; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Neuroprotective Agents; Nitrous Oxide; Parietal Lobe; Prosencephalon; Rats; Rats, Wistar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030816999

Nitrogen dynamics were excluded from most acidic deposition modeling studies because it was believed that terrestrial ecosystems strongly retain N and because modeling N is a more formidable task than modeling S due to the influence of complex biological processes on N cycling. Re-examination of available data for the Adirondack Mountains of New York suggests that N deposition may be contributing to both chronic and episodic acidification of freshwaters to a greater extent than is generally believed. Previous research concluded that N has played a limited role in acidification processes in these lakes, based on regional averages of chronic chemistry. However, it is now known that historic acidification responses have been spatially variable within the Adirondack Mountains and that the declines in lakewater pH have been less than previously believed. Lakewater NO3- concentrations are commonly in the range of 5 to 25 μeq L-1 on a chronic basis in portions of the Adirondack region that have experienced significant chronic acidification. These NO3- concentrations correspond in magnitude to inferred historical acidification. Furthermore, the relative importance of NO3- as an agent of acidification increases dramatically during snowmelt when conditions are most toxic to fish. The consequence of not addressing N in formulating acidification recovery strategies for the Adirondacks includes the likelihood that we will overestimate the response of surface water to the mandated sulfur emissions reductions.","acidification; Adirondack Mountains; atmospheric deposition; nitrogen","nitrogen; acidification; article; controlled study; environmental impact assessment; pollution transport; United States; water pollution; Atmospheric composition; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Industrial emissions; Lakes; Nitrates; Nitrogen; pH effects; Sulfur; Water acidification; Water pollution; acidification; atmospheric deposition; nitrogen; sulphur; surface water quality; USA, New York, Adirondack Mountains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030615782

The tip region of the microbuckle is modelled using alternating layers of fibre and matrix, while the microbuckle at the macro scale is treated as a sliding mode II crack. By assuming that the composite deforms in accordance with a deformation theory of plasticity, material history effects are neglected. The microbuckle propagation direction is predicted for a wide range of material properties by finding a correlation direction of the deflected fibres ahead of the microbuckle: propagation angles of between 5 and 30° are predicted, depending on the matrix shear yield strain and the strain hardening exponent. For the case of a carbon fibre-epoxy composite, the predicted value of 19° is in good agreement with measured values in the range 20-30°. A predicted value of tip toughness Gt/τyd of 25 is also in reasonable agreement with experimental measurements of 32-55, where Gt is the mode II strain energy release rate, τy is the longitudinal shear yield strength of the composite and d is the fibre diameter. An alternative couple-stress finite element calculation, in which the bending resistance of the fibres is incorporated directly into the element formulation, predicts propagation angles in reasonable agreement with those found from the above layer finite element model over the range of material parameters considered, with excellent agreement for carbon fibre-epoxy composites.

In particular, nitrogen oxides, NOx, are known environmental and health hazards. Formed during combustion, they are the focus of many local, state, federal, and international regulations. Because emission regulations are becoming more stringent, there have been many combustion techniques and control technologies developed to meet these demands. This paper focuses on two major topics associated with NOx emissions: 1) regulations (Clean Air Act, New Source Performance Standards, National Ambient Air Quality Standards, etc.); and 2) control technologies (boilers, gas turbines, etc.). In addition to reviewing the current advancements in these areas, a spreadsheet program and a graph for conversion of NOx emission units from lb/MBtu to ppmv (dry), for different concentrations of O2 in the flue gas are presented. This graph simplifies the process of comparing regulations and measurements.","Emissions combustion; Nitrogen oxides; No(x) control; Regulations","Air quality; Environmental impact; Flue gases; Graphic methods; Health hazards; Industrial emissions; International law; Nitrogen oxides; Oxygen; Spreadsheets; Standards; Emission conversion; Air pollution control; air pollution; environmental legislation; USA",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030860948

After the 1970's, stricter exhaust emission regulations and fuel economy requirements induced combustion developments and application of turbocharged and inter cooled engines. From the late 1980's, high pressure fuel injection has been investigated and recognized as an essential tool for lowering emissions especially of particulate matter. Although turbulence effects on both in-cylinder air motion and during the combustion process are quite effective, they show different phenomena in conventional and advanced high pressure fuel injection systems. In the 1990's, multiple injection with high pressure has been attempted for further reduction of NOx and particulate matter. Also, though the idea was not so new, homogeneous diesel combustion based on bulk combustion has been investigated by several researchers due to a very low figure of emission, but it has a very limited operable region. Recently, a research based on the concept of combination of multiple fuel injection and homogeneous diesel combustion has begun for the purpose of widening the operable region. Today EGR is considered to be widely applicable to future heavy duty engines because the wear problems have been improved by the reduction of sulphur content in diesel fuel, and several remaining problems are under discussion. Future fuel must meet environmental requirements. The ultimate ideal fuel would be hydrogen.

In the study, the emission control costs of SO2, NO(x) and NH3 are assessed for the areas studied and an optimisation model developed for calculation of cost-optimal deposition control policies. The input data of the model consist of the cost functions describing the emission control costs to achieve lower emission levels for the gases and areas considered and of dispersion coefficients which describe the deposition due to an emission source in the deposition receptor grid squares. In addition, the model includes a description to calculate the acidifying load. The optimisation is based on linear programming. When the acidifying load of Southern Finland is reduced by minimising the total control costs, approx. three quarters of the total control costs are due to measures in the nearby areas, Estonia, St. Petersburg region, Karelia and Kola, and approx. one quarter due to measures in Finland. The distribution of costs in the cost-optimised cases depends relatively little on the level to which the acidifying load due the source areas considered are required to be reduced. If the load reduction target is moderate, the emission control measures should mainly be allocated to sulphur emissions and to some extent to ammonia emissions and, if the load reduction target is stricter, also to the emissions of nitrogen oxides.","Ammonia; Control of acidic deposition; Cost effectiveness; Emission; Nitrogen oxides; Sulphur dioxide","ammonia; nitric oxide; nitrous oxide; sulfur dioxide; acid deposition; air pollution; economics; emission control; emissions control; environmental economics; air pollution; article; cost effectiveness analysis; estonia; finland; pollution control; priority journal; russian federation; Acid Rain; Acids; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Ammonia; Animals; Cost Control; Estonia; Finland; Manure; Models, Economic; Nitrogen Oxides; Russia; Sulfur Dioxide; Estonia; Finland; Russian Federation, Karelia; Russian Federation, Kola Peninsula; Russian Federation, St. Petersburg; Kola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0343923631

The program not only imposes a substantial curb on NOx emissions but also calls for the reduction of black soot exhaust gas, which is peculiar to diesel vehicles, and restricts it in terms of the particulate matter (PM) emission level. Oil companies, on the other hand, have been required to reduce diesel oil's sulfur content, which corrodes the equipment and piping tubes and causes deterioration of the catalyst, from 0.4% (or 0.5% under the Japanese Industrial Standards) to 0.2% by 1993 and further to 0.05% by 1997.

This paper investigated the influence of a processing additive on the carbon black incorporation and its dispersion behavior by inspecting Banbury power curves. From this investigation, we considered that good wettability toward the carbon black surface was necessary for processing additives in order to improve carbon black dispersion. The function of the processing additive was thought to enhance the surface lubrication of carbon black for disagglomeration in the early steps of mixing. The dry grip properties of a tire was estimated from the temperature dependence of dynamic viscoelastic properties of rubber compounds, with improved carbon black dispersion due to the processing additive; and it was confirmed by an actual tire running evaluation. Consequently, we found that tread compounds with improved carbon black dispersion had a remarkable effect on tire dry-grip properties at high temperatures.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843101881

In order to evaluate the clinical value of IMZ SPET for presurgical identification of epileptic foci in patients with medically intractable seizures, we measured the binding potential (BP) of BZR using two IMZ SPET scans and compared the results with brain perfusion SPET and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). A total of ten patients with intractable partial epilepsy were examined by electroencephalography, magnetic resonance imaging, FDG PET, brain perfusion SPET and IMZ SPET. After neuroimaging examinations, five patients underwent selective surgery, and all of them have since been free of seizures. Two SPET scans were performed at 15 min (early) and 3 h (late) after intravenous injection of 123I-IMZ (167 MBq). Parametric images of the ligand transport (K1) and binding potential (BP) were calculated by the table look-up method, which is based on a three-compartment two-parameter model, using the standard arterial input function obtained by averaging of six normal volunteers' input functions. BP images delineated the epileptic foci more precisely than either FDG PET or ictal perfusion SPET. FDG PET showed widespread reduction, including the area surrounding the focus, and ictal increase in the cerebral blood flow was seen in possibly activated areas spread from the focus. In four epilepsy cases which originated from the mesial temporal lobe without lateral temporal abnormality, there was no significant decrease in the BP images in the lateral temporal structures, which showed decreased uptake of FDG. It is concluded that parametric images of BP with IMZ are valuable for precise presurgical localization of epileptic foci.","Benzodiazepine receptor; Epilepsy; Iodine-123 iomazenil; Single-photon emission tomography","benzodiazepine receptor; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; iodine 123; iomazenil; radiopharmaceutical agent; adult; article; brain blood flow; brain perfusion; brain tomography; clinical article; electroencephalography; epileptic focus; female; human; intractable epilepsy; intravenous drug administration; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; photon emission tomography; positron emission tomography; preoperative evaluation; Adult; Brain; Deoxyglucose; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy, Frontal Lobe; Epilepsy, Temporal Lobe; Feasibility Studies; Female; Flumazenil; Fluorine Radioisotopes; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Humans; Iodine Radioisotopes; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Preoperative Care; Tomography, Emission-Computed; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8044231948

Surgical principles in oncology, i.e, radical eradication of tumours was strictly followed. It is very important to consider the exact TNM classification of the disease its localization and extent. The majority of epylaringeal tumours are in advanced stages at the diagnosis. Therefore, only a few are suitable for CO2 loser treatment. The video presents our CO2 laser surgery procedure. Material and methods: During the last 10 years, 10 patients with tumour located in the suprahyoid epiglottis and/or on the aryepiglottic fold were treated by CO2 laser. In 7 cases, laser operation was the primary treatment and, in 3 cases, laser was used as a salvage surgery for residual or recurrent tumours after radiation failure. The tumor together with the surrounding tissue was removed with the CO2 laser beam of 20-30 Watts. Discussion and conclusion: A primary and salvage laser surgery of early and not deep-infiltrated marginal tumours of the larynx was successfully carried out with minimal morbidity and excellent functional results. The authors emphasize the advantages of combination of CO2 laser and ionizing irradiation because the laser evaporation does not disturb the blood supply and oxygenation of the surrounding tissue, therefore the radiosensitivity is not decreased. A minimum invasive surgery done by CO2 laser may be indicated also after irradiation failure. The treatment with laser surgery of epilarynx turnouts is a responsible decision requiring great experience, careful examination and selection of patients.","Epiglottis; Laryngeal neoplasms-surgery; Laser surgery","cancer surgery; carbon dioxide laser; clinical article; conference paper; epiglottis tumor; human; larynx tumor; laser surgery; treatment failure; treatment indication; treatment outcome; tumor recurrence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030791873

Our analyses are performed with a reduced model of the climate system that incorporates significant improvements to the representation of both climate forcing and mass balance response in a previously described theory based upon a coupled one-level energy balance model (EBM) and vertically integrated ice sheet model (ISM). The theory fully incorporates the influences of orbital insolation forcing, glacial isostatic adjustment and variations in the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. It correctly predicts the main geographical regions of the northern hemisphere that were glaciated at last glacial maximum 21,000 years ago as well as the abrupt termination of the glacial epoch that occurred subsequently. The latter feature of the ice age cycle is obtained without the need to incorporate unconstrained and therefore controversial physical processes into the model, a limitation of all previous attempts to understand this global scale climate cycle. Our analyses suggest that the radiative impact on surface glaciation due to the changing atmospheric concentration of CO2 is critical to the ability of the model to deliver a synthetic history of glaciation and deglaciation that is in accord with inferences based upon surface geological and geomorphological evidence. With the incorporation of this influence, model-predicted ice thickness distributions at last glacial maximum (LGM) are very similar to those of the recently described ICE-4G reconstruction that was based upon the inversion of postglacial relative sea level histories.",,"chronology; glaciation/deglaciation; ice age cycle; palaeoclimate; Pleistocene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031433375

An indexed mean chronology of radial growth was developed in each case. Black ash from flooded sites did not cross-date with those from unflooded sites and responded differently to climate. On the floodplain sites, black ash radial growth is directly correlated with the previous year's August precipitation (i - I) and with the current year's June precipitation (i). High water levels at the beginning of the growing season also had a negative impact on the following year's growth, whereas a high drought index during June of the preceding year (i - I) had a positive one. Radial growth of unflooded black ash is mainly related to temperature. For those black ash not exposed to flooding, the preceding year's August temperature (i - I), as opposed to August precipitation, had a negative impact on the current year's growth. A high drought index in June (i) also had a negative impact on the current year's growth. Compared with black ash, white cedar from both xeric and mesic sites showed good between-site cross dating and had similar relationships to climate. In both cases, abundant summer precipitation, associated with cool temperature, produced maximum growth. Temperature during August of the preceding year (i - I) was also negatively correlated with radial growth. White cedar from xeric sites also responded more intensely to drought, as revealed by the negative relationship to the June-July (i) drought index.

The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved. We study the physical processes in the system containing the 47 ms radio pulsar PSR B1259-63 orbiting around a Be star in a highly eccentric orbit. This system is the only known binary where a radio pulsar is observed to interact with gaseous material from a Be star. A rapidly rotating radio pulsar such as PSR B1259-63 is expected to produce a wind of electromagnetic emission and relativistic particles, and this binary is an ideal astrophysical laboratory to study the mass outflow/pulsar interaction in a highly time-variable environment. Motivated by the results of a recent multiwavelength campaign during the 1994 January periastron passage of PSR B1259-63, we discuss several issues regarding the mechanism of high-energy emission. Unpulsed power-law emission from the PSR B1259-63 system was detected near periastron in the energy range 1-200 keV. The observed X-ray/soft γ-ray emission is characterized by moderate luminosity, small and constant column density, lack of detectable pulsations, and peculiar spectral and intensity variability. In principle, high-energy (X-ray and gamma-ray) emission from the system can be produced by different mechanisms including (1) mass accretion onto the surface of the neutron star, (2) ""propeller""-like magnetospheric interaction at a small pulsar distance, and (3) shock-powered emission in a pulsar wind termination shock at a large distance from the pulsar. We carry out a series of calculations aimed at modeling the high-energy data of the PSR B1259-63 system throughout its orbit and especially near periastron. We find that the observed high-energy emission from the PSR B1259-63 system is not compatible with accretion or propeller-powered emission. This conclusion is supported by a model based on standard properties of Be stars and for plausible assumptions about the pulsar/outflow interaction geometry. We find that shock-powered high-energy emission produced by the pulsar/outflow interaction is consistent with all the characteristics of the high-energy emission of the PSR B1259-63 system. This opens the possibility of obtaining for the first time constraints on the physical properties of the PSR B1259-63 pulsar wind and its interaction properties in a strongly time-variable nebular environment. By studying the time evolution of the pulsar cavity, we can constrain the magnitude and geometry of the mass outflow as the PSR B1259-63 orbits around its Be star companion. The pulsar/outflow interaction is most likely mediated by a collisionless shock at the internal boundary of the pulsar cavity. The system shows all the characteristics of a binary plerion being diffuse and compact near apastron and periastron, respectively. The PSR B1259-63 system is subject to different radiative regimes depending on whether synchrotron or inverse-Compton (IC) cooling dominates the radiation of electron/positron pairs (e± pairs) advected away from the inner boundary of the pulsar cavity. The highly nonthermal nature of the observed X-ray/soft γ-ray emission from the PSR B1259-63 system near periastron establishes the existence of an efficient particle acceleration mechanism within a timescale shown to be less than ∼ 102-103 s. A synchrotron/IC model of emission of e± pairs accelerated at the inner shock front of the pulsar cavity and adiabatically expanding in the MHD flow provides an excellent explanation of the observed time-variable X-ray flux and spectrum from the PSR B1259-63 system. We find that the best model for the PSR B1259-63 system is consistent with the pulsar orbital plane being misaligned with the plane of a thick equatorial Be star outflow. The angular width of the equatorially enhanced Be star outflow is constrained to be ∼ 50° at the pulsar distance, and the misalignment angle is ≳25°. We calculate the intensity and spectrum of the high-energy emission for the whole PSR B1259-63 orbit and predict the characteristics of the emission near the apastron region based on the periastron results. The mass-loss rate is deduced to be approximately constant in time during a ∼ 2 yr period. Our results for the Be star outflow of the PSR B1259-63 system are consistent with models of the radio eclipses near periastron. The consequences of our analysis have general validity. Our study of the PSR B1259-63 system shows that X-ray emission can be caused by a mechanism alternative to accretion in a system containing an energetic pulsar interacting with nebular material.

The absence of such studies in developing countries is restricting many decisions to be made and applied by policymakers. In one developing country, Turkey, results of the study of four urban stations and their neighboring rural sites for the 1951-1990 time period reveal that there is a shift towards the warmer side in the frequency distributions of daily minimum and 21.00 hr temperature difference series. This shift is an indication of urban heat island. The maximum urban heat island intensity trend that is obtained from the temperature differences database agrees well with Oke's (1973) formula for European cities. Seasonal analysis of individual 21.00 hr temperature series suggests that the regional warming is strongest in spring and weakest in autumn and winter. Urban warming is detected to be more or less equally distributed over the year with a slight increase in the autumn months. The Mann-Kendall trend rest is applied to the temperature difference series, and the urban heat island effect is found to be significant in all urban sites. On the other hand, almost no significant urban effect on precipitation can be detected.",,"developing country; regional weather pattern; temperature; urban heat island; urbanisation; Turkey; Aves; Meleagris gallopavo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030620253

The combination of their long atmospheric lifetimes (approximately 10,000 years) and propensity for absorption of solar infrared radiation necessarily define such chemical compounds as a suspect target in enhancing the natural greenhouse effect and thus, a potential contributor to global warming. While associated environmental issues are universal and impact a variety of industrial communities, the semiconductor manufacturing community has taken a lead role in exploring various alternative strategies for reducing perfluorocompound atmospheric emissions.

Perfluorocarbon (PFC) aerosols present the opportunity far simultaneous analysis of lung structure and pulmonary oxygenation patterns. The authors investigated techniques to nebulize neat liquid PFCs for inhalation as a new method of PFC administration and tested the hypothesis that PFC aerosols may be developed for efficient delivery to the lung in an experimental rat model allowing the potential for sequential monitoring of pulmonary status via quantitative fluorine-19 (19F) magnetic resonance (MR) partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) imaging. METHODS. Pneumatic aerosol generators were configured to produce a neat liquid PFC perfluorotributylamine (FC-43) aerosol. Perfluorocarbon inhalation breathing protocols for the rat model included: spontaneous direct breathing from an aerosol chamber, and use of a tracheotomy tube to bypass nasal breathing. The PFC aerosol delivery into the rat lung was documented through 19F MR imaging in correlation with high-resolution anatomic proton MR images. Theoretical model calculations for PFC mass deposition were compared with experimental results. RESULTS. The pneumatic generator produced a PFC aerosol droplet within the theoretically targeted range (geometric mean particle diameter of 1.2 μm; concentration of ~4 x 107 droplets per cm3). No measurable aerosol reached the lungs during spontaneous breathing because of the efficient filtering capabilities of the turbinated nasal passages. With tracheotomy, aerosol depositions within the lung were achieved in mass quantities consistent with theoretical expectations; however, the distribution patterns were nonuniform and unpredictable. Oxygen-enhanced 19F imaging was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS. Perfluorocarbon aerosols of controlled size distribution can be produced at sufficient concentration with pneumatic generators for distribution to the terminal pulmonary architecture and visualization using 19F MR imaging. The potential exists for in vivo oxygen-sensitive imaging in the pulmonary system and development of sophisticated experimental animal models of systemic oxygen transport as a function of pulmonary status.","aerosols; fluorine magnetic resonance; nuclear magnetic resonance; Perfluorocarbon; pulmonary oxygen imaging","fluorine; fluorocarbon; oxygen; perfluorotributylamine; aerosol; animal experiment; animal model; article; controlled study; drug delivery system; drug instillation; inhalational drug administration; intratracheal drug administration; lung; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oxygen tension; pneumatic tool; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; rat; tissue oxygenation; tracheotomy; Administration, Inhalation; Aerosols; Animals; Drug Delivery Systems; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Image Enhancement; Lung; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Oxygen; Pulmonary Gas Exchange; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031031486

This poses the question of whether travel growth in the intervening period may overwhelm the benefits of fleet turnover and adopted control strategies, with adverse implications for air quality and for conformity. Emissions trends are examined for three planning areas in California that are nonattainment for ozone. Forecasted emissions of ozone precursors for attainment years are compared with projected emissions for 2020. The latest model for estimation of on-road motor vehicle emissions in California is employed to estimate emissions, augmented by estimated effects of additional control strategies from the 1994 California ozone SIP. Alternative higher-growth travel forecasts for two areas, developed in consultation with regional transportation agency modeling staffs, are then applied to test the sensitivity of emissions to various travel growth scenarios. Ozone precursor emissions are found to remain within attainment year baseline levels for each growth scenario. Oxides of nitrogen emissions approach attainment year levels in one area, due to high projected growth in heavy-duty vehicle travel. Demonstrations of conformity to the ozone SIP for transportation planning horizon years are significantly aided by California's adopted and planned fuels and motor vehicle emissions control programs.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0012460695

This paper summarizes our recent estimates of soil NO emissions from a wide variety of sites in nine southeastern United States. A total of over 12,000 individual flux measurements was made from crop, pasture, and forests representing major physiographic regions within the southeast. These measurements were used to determine flux algorithms relating NO emissions from land types. Strong relationships were found between NO flux and temperature that explained over 80% of the variation in emissions. Using these relationships and Geographic Information Systems land base information for the states, calculated seasonal emissions for NO are reported. Crop land regulated regional soil NO emissions, accounting for 83% of the emissions in summer, 61% in spring, and 55% in fall. The summertime contribution of soil NO to the overall NO inventory, including anthropogenic sources, averaged 4.1% for the states, ranging from a high of 9.5% for Mississippi to a low of 2.2% for Florida. The importance of high summertime temperatures in controlling soil NO was evident in that emissions on a prototypical summer day were only one fifth the emissions of a hot (36°C, maximum daily high) summer day. Comparisons of the algorithms we developed to those of the current model used by the Environmental Protection Agency, BEIS 2.2, showed reasonable agreement, that is, agreement within a factor of 2, given the inherent temporal and spatial variability of soil NO emissions.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001260321

A steady state code developed at NASA LeRC, ALLSPD-3D is used for this purpose. Effects of varying the initial liquid droplets size distribution and injection angle on evaporation, combustion and CO emission are studied. It is determined that a smaller range of initial droplet sizes evaporate quite efficiently and hence, burn quite effectively, while a larger range of initial droplet sizes is not as effective and can result in incomplete combustion. This results in increased CO emission. Inclusion of swirl increases the combustion efficiency and reduces CO emission.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether SAE measurements are feasible using harmonic power Doppler imaging technique (H-PMI). Methods: The hearts of 12 German farm pigs (30±2,5 kg) were surgically expianted and inserted in an artificial circulation providing physiological flow and pressures. Isolated pig hearts were investigated with different imaging techniques in the working heart and in an asystolic state without any motion of the heart. 0,05-0,3g Levovist® (Schering AG, Germany) was injected into the left atrium and contrast effects were evaluated in the LV cavity and the myocardium with an ultrasound imager (ATL, HDI 3000) equipped with a prototype software for harmonic imaging. H-PMI registrations were performed with continuous and intermittent recordings (EKG triggered at endsystole) in the beating heart and in the asystolic heart in which perfusion was interrupted for 20 seconds. Pictures were digitally stored and were analyzed using a calibrated software-tool for video-densitometry. Results: In the beating pig heart HPMI provided intensive opacification of the LV cavity and visible myocardial contrast when EKG triggering was performed. In the asystolic pig heart with interrupted perfusion either triggered or non triggered registrations showed homogeneous signals in the cavity and within the myocardium when the registration was started by unfreezing the system for up to 35 frames indicating disintegration of microbubbles. These results could be obtained with no flow in the circulation system. Conclusion: Display of stimulated acoustic emission using H-PMI is feasible.

Induction of cytochrome P450 1A1-catalyzed 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity in mammalian cell culture (EROD bioassay) is thought to be a selective and sensitive parameter used for the quantification of dioxinlike compounds. Fly ash extracts from municipal waste incinerators (MWI), a crematorium, wood combustors, and a noble metal recycling facility were analyzed in the EROD bioassay using rat hepatocytes in primary culture. Fractions containing 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDDs/PCDFs, dioxinlike PCBs, and 16 major polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were isolated from the extract and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and by the EROD bioassay. It was found that with MWI samples the bioassay of the extract resulted in a two- to fivefold higher estimate of TCDD equivalents (TEQ) than the chemical analysis of PCDDs/PCDFs and PCBs. However, the outcome of both methods was significantly correlated, making the bioassay useful as a rough estimate for the sum of potent PCDDs/PCDFs acid dioxinlike PCBs in extracts from MWI fly ash samples and in a fly ash sample from a crematorium. In noble metal recycling facility and wood combustor samples, higher amounts of PAHs were found, contributing to more pronounced differences between the results of both methods. The remaining unexplained inducing potency in fly ash samples probably results from additional dioxinlike components including certain PAHs not analyzed in this study. The hypothesis that emissions from MWI of hitherto unidentified dioxinlike compounds are higher by orders of magnitude than emissions of potent PCDDs/PCDFs and dioxinlike PCBs could not be confirmed. We found no indication for a marked synergistic interaction of dioxinlike fly ash components in the bioassay.","Bioassay; Dioxin; EROD; Fly ash; Incineration; PAH; PCB","cytochrome P450; dioxin; ethoxyresorufin deethylase; industrial effluent; metal; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; article; atmospheric dispersion; bioassay; cell culture; chemical analysis; combustion; correlation function; enzyme activity; fly ash; furnace; gas chromatography; hypothesis; incineration; intermethod comparison; liver cell; mammal cell; mass spectrometry; posthumous care; priority journal; quantitative assay; recycling; statistical analysis; wood; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031424731

FUND is a nine-region model of the world economy and its interactions with climate, running in time steps of one year from 1990 to 2200. The model consists of scenarios for economy and population, which are perturbed by climate change and greenhouse gas emission reduction policy. Each region optimizes its net present welfare. Policy variables are energy and carbon efficiency improvement, and sequestering carbon dioxide in forests. It is found that reducing conventional air pollution is a major reason to abate carbon dioxide emissions. Climate change is an additional reason to abate emissions. Reducing and changing energy use is preferred as an option over sequestering carbon. Under non-cooperation, free riding as well as assurance behaviour is observed in the model. The scope for joint implementation is limited. Under cooperation, optimal emission abatement is (slightly) higher than under non-cooperation, but the global coalition is not self-enforcing while side payments are insufficient. Optimal emission control under non-cooperation is less than currently discussed under the Framework Convention on Climate Change, but higher than observed in practice. © Baltzer Science Publishers BV.","Game theory; Integrated assessment of climate change; Optimal control; Secondary benefits","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Game theory; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Carbon dioxide emissions; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Integrated assessment; Integrated assessment models; Joint implementation; Optimal controls; Secondary benefits; Sequestering carbon; Climate models; abatement cost; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; integrated approach; optimization; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21944456670

(1995) Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 61, 883-889). However, they catalyze the NO reduction to N2O, but not the monooxygenation reaction using O2. We kinetically and spectrophotometrically studied the reactions of the two Nor's with NO and electron donor, NAD(P)H, using flash-photolysis and stopped-flow rapid scan methods. The enzyme in the Fe3+ state can bind NO to yield the Fe3+NO complex. When the resultant Fe3+NO complex reacted with the electron donor, it was converted to the Fe3+ enzyme via a transient formation of the characteristic intermediate (I). The spectroscopic results were essentially the same as those of the Nor from another denitrifying fungus Fusarium oxysporum (f.Nor), which we previously reported (Shiro et al. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 1617-1623), suggesting that these fungal Nor's catalyze the NO reduction by the same mechanism. Most probably, the Fe3+NO complex of the Nor is reduced with two-electrons directly transferred from NAD(P)H to yield the intermediate I, and then the I reacts with another NO to generate N2O and the Fe3+ enzyme. However, the kinetic measurements showed that the reaction rate constant of each step was variable depending on the combination of the Nor and the electron donor; i.e., c.Nor1 + NADH, c.Nor2 + NADPH, c.Nor2 + NADH and f.Nor + NADH. In particular, the rate constant for the electron transfer step from the electron donor to the Fe3+NO enzyme is dramatically different among these systems. On the other hand, we also measured paramagnetically shifted 1H-NMR spectra of c.Nor2 and f.Nor in the ferrous (reduced) state, where the iron-bound Cys β-CH2 signal was observed at the same position (~ 270 ppm) for c.Nor2 and f.Nor, indicating that the Cys thiolate (S-) coordinates to the heme iron in the same fashion in the Nor's. However, the heme peripheral proton signals were subtly but significantly different in their positions between the two enzymes. On the basis of these kinetic and spectroscopic data, we suggested that the Fe-S- binding character is not essential for the NO reduction reactivity, but that the subtle difference in interaction of their hemes with the surroundings is possibly responsible for the difference in the Nor reactivity, especially in the electron transfer step from NAD(P)H to the Fe3+NO moiety.","C. tonkinense; Cytochrome P-450; Denitrification; F. oxysporum; Fungal denitrification; Nitric oxide reduction","cytochrome p450; isoenzyme; nitric oxide; nitric oxide reductase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; article; chemical reaction kinetics; denitrification; electron transport; enzyme structure; fusarium oxysporum; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; oxygenation; photolysis; priority journal; spectrophotometry; Basidiomycota; Isoenzymes; Kinetics; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Oxidoreductases; Protein Conformation; Spectrophotometry; Cylindrocarpon; Fungi; Fusarium lichenicola; Fusarium oxysporum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031035984

ENSO has been shown to be predictable to some degree for over a year ahead, which therefore provides a basis for skillful prediction of interannual variations in climate. The processes involved are emphasized in order to highlight the areas where future research may most profitably be directed to improve climate forecasts. This progress has been realized through the successful completion of the Tropical Oceans Global Atmosphere (TOGA) Program of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP), which has established and maintained the TOGA Observing System, developed coupled atmosphere-ocean models of the tropical Pacific Ocean, demonstrated the predictive capabilities noted above, and conducted field programs to further the understanding of physical processes. Future research will take place in the context of a developing infrastructure associated with operational climate forecasts. Short-term climate variability involves much more than ENSO, and the challenge is to also capitalize on long timescales associated with anomalies in other parts of the climate system and any additional predictability that goes beyond simple persistence and build this into any prediction scheme. The international framework for helping to facilitate future research is CLIVAR-GOALS, the WCRP program on climate variability and predictability, and the subprogram on the Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System. The research challenges are many, but the prospects are excellent for making further advances and the potential is high for socioeconomic benefits for many countries. Turning skillful but uncertain forecasts into useful information and beneficial decisions represents a particular challenge, so that collaboration will be required between the physical scientists and scientists from the applications and social science communities.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000051291

Decision-makers have the choice among the following solar technologies: (1) parabolic trough; (2) central receiver; (3) paraboloidal dish; (4) solar chimney; (5) solar pond; (6) photovoltaic cells. This article compares present solar electricity technologies from the point of view of system analysis, taking into consideration their performance, costs and environmental impact. The study shows that the different approaches cover a wide range from units of a few Watts to utility-size plants and from isolated to grid-connected systems. It also shows that there is still a need for intense efforts to integrate those technologies into the existing electricity supply scheme. If a continuous development and market introduction is achieved, solar power plants will contribute substantially to the reduction of global CO2-emissions.

The monoclonal antibody 4155 has been used as a convenient means of measuring the concentration of steroid glucuronides in EMU, as it specifically recognises the steroid hormone estrone β-D-glucuronide (E3G), with very high affinity, and the closely related hormone estriol 3-(β-D-glucuronide) (EI3G), with reduced affinity. Although 4115 binds these hormones with different affinities, EI3G differs from E3G only in the addition of a hydroxyl group and reduction of an adjacent carbonyl. To investigate the structural basis of this fine binding specificity, we have determined the crystal structures of the variable fragment (Fv) of 4155 in complex with each of these hormones. Results: Two crystal forms of the Fv4155-EI3G complex, at resolutions of 2.1 Å and 2.5 Å, and one form of the Fv4155-E3G complex, at 2.1 Å resolution were solved and refined. The crystal structures show the E3G or EI3G antigen lying in an extended cleft, running from the centre of the antibody combining site down one side of the variable domain interface, and formed almost entirely from residues in the heavy chain. The binding cleft lies primarily between the heavy chain complementarity determining regions (CDRs), rather than in the interface between the heavy and light chains. In both complexes the binding of the glucuronic sugar, and rings A and B of the steroid, is specified by the shape of the narrow cleft. Analysis of the Fv structure reveals that five of the six CDR regions can be assigned to one of the predefined canonical structural classes. Conclusions: The difference in the binding affinity of Fv4155 for the two steroid hormones is accounted for by a subtle combination of a less favoured hydrogen-bond geometry, and a minor rearrangement of the water molecule network around the binding site. The rearrangement of water molecules results from the burial of the additional hydroxyl group of the EI3G in a hydrophobic environment.","Antibody-antigen complex; Fine specificity; Fv fragment; Steroid hormone","Dromaius novaehollandiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031571157

An activation energy barrier for the adsorption of hydrogen of 12 k cal mol-1 reduces the steady state hydrogen atom coverage of the copper from 90% of a monolayer to &lt;10% of a monolayer. Paradoxically this model predicts an increase in the rate of the reverse water gas shift reaction at all temperatures studied in the temperature range 300 K to 470 K. This results from the lower hydrogen atom coverage producing a greater amound of free copper area on which the CO2 can decompose. Reducing the activation energy barrier to hydrogen atom adsorption to 9 k cal mol-1 increases the steady state hydrogen atom coverage of the copper to ∼30% of a monolayer, a value which is more consistent with the H : Cu ratio of 4 found by Topsoe and co-workers (13). This overall potential energy diagram, incorporating this 9 k cal mol-1 activation energy barrier now predicts rates of the reverse water gas shift reaction in good agreement with experiment. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

First the nonlinear structure of SOI is probed by estimating local Lyapunov exponents. We obtain the sum of all positive Lyapunov exponents (Kolmogorov entropy) as a function of time for the period between June 1882 and May 1987. We then demonstrate that this time series and global temperature records are coherent over the Nyquist frequency band from 0.0 to 0.25 cycles/year thus establishing linear relationship between many of their oscillatory components. Since the inverse of the Kolmogorov entropy is a measure of predictability this result indicates that global temperature may affect predictability with higher temperatures corresponding to lower predictability. We discuss how this result may eventually lead to the development of strategies for improved long-term predictions. Copyright © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

The HIMAC is the world's only heavy ion accelerator complex dedicated to medical use in a hospital environment. There are three treatment rooms with fixed apertures as well as rooms for physics and biological research studies. Judging from the results of preparatory experiments as well as Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) experiences, we decided to use carbon ions in the initial clinical studies. Preparatory to clinical application, preclinical studies were performed on five human cell lines cultured in vitro and mouse skin to estimate relative biological effectiveness (RBE) values relative to photons and to fast neutrons as well. The RBE values of carbon ions for acute or subacute skin reactions were estimated to be 3.0 at the distal part of the SOBP. Interdisciplinary working groups were organized to design protocols for phase I/II carbon-ion therapy, in which the main purpose was to investigate normal tissue toxicities as well as tumor response in HIMAC carbon-ion therapy. The protocols were designed for various tumor sites including the head and neck, brain, lung, liver, uterine cervix, and prostate. In the phase I/II studies for these tumors, the initial doses used were assumed to be 10% to 20% lower than those possibly tolerable for musculoconnective tissues. The doses have been escalated by 10% increments based on careful observation of the normal tissue morbidity as well as tumor response. During June 1994 to August 1995, a total of 55 patients were treated. As with carbon-related toxicities, none of the patients experienced major morbidities at six months or later posttreatment. The preliminary results appear to demonstrate promising effects of carbon ions in selected tumors. Despite using relatively conservative doses for cancer control, the local control rates were adequate in those tumors other than malignant gliomas.","Carbon ions; High-linear energy transfer radiation","carbon; animal tissue; brain tumor; cancer control; cancer radiotherapy; clinical trial; computer assisted tomography; conference paper; fast neutron radiation; head and neck tumor; human; human cell; linear energy transfer; liver cell carcinoma; lung cancer; major clinical study; mouse; nonhuman; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; photon; priority journal; prostate carcinoma; radiation dose; relative biologic effectiveness; toxicity; uterine cervix carcinoma",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030734135

In the Former Soviet Union (FSU) and the conterminous United States (US), the stand age-class distribution on the forested land and the rate of logging tended to be the most important factors in the land-base flux, whereas in Brazil the rate of land-cover change and the vegetation regrowth in secondary forests on abandoned agricultural or grazing land were critical. The areas of greatest uncertainty for the FSU and US analyses related to the rates of woody debris and soil organic matter accumulation and to limitations in the age-class based inventory data available. In Brazil, the initial biomass in forests subject to deforestation, and the area of recovering secondary forest, were identified as important research issues. Continued database development, and close attention to methodologies for quantifying carbon flux, will be necessary if carbon budget assessments are to be of use to the policy community.",,"carbon budget; forest harvest; greenhouse gas; lancover change; land cover; land use change; land use pattern; national survey; wildfire",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030776679

Such trends may be indicative of the polar amplification of warming predicted for the next several decades in response to increasing atmospheric CO2. We have summarized these predictions and nonuniform patterns of arctic climate change in order to address their potential effects on marine mammals. Since recent trends in sea ice extent are nonuniform, the direct and indirect effects on marine mammals are expected to vary geographically. Changes in the extent and concentration of sea ice may alter the seasonal distributions, geographic ranges, patterns of migration, nutritional status, reproductive success, and ultimately the abundance and stock structure of some species. Ice-associated seals, which rely on suitable ice substrate for resting, pupping, and molting, may be especially vulnerable to such changes. As recent decreases in ice coverage have been more extensive in the Siberian Arctic (60°E-180°E) than in the Beaufort Sea and western sectors, we speculate that marine mammal populations in the Siberian Arctic may be among the first to experience climate-induced geographic shifts or altered reproductive capacity due to persistent changes in ice extent. Alteration in the extent and productivity of ice-edge systems may affect the density and distribution of important ice-associated prey of marine mammals, such as arctic cod Boreogadus saida and sympagic ('with ice') amphipods. Present climate models, however, are insufficient to predict regional ice dynamics, winds, mesoscale features, and mechanisms of nutrient resupply, which must be known to predict productivity and trophic response. Therefore, it is critical that mesoscale process-oriented studies identify the biophysical coupling required to maintain suitable prey availability and ice-associated habitat for marine mammals on regional arctic scales. Only an integrated ecosystems approach can address the complexity of factors determining productivity and cascading trophic dynamics in a warmer Arctic. This approach, integrated with monitoring of key indicator species (e.g., bowhead whale, ringed seal, and beluga), should be a high priority.","Arctic Ocean; Balaena mysticetus; Beluga; Bowhead whale; Climate change; Delphinapterus leucas; Global warming; Ice-associated seals; Marginal ice edge zone; Phoca hispida; Ringed seal; Sea ice extent","climatic change; geographical distribution; marine mammal; productivity; reproduction; sea ice; Arctic Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031407114

The genes atxA, located on pXO1, and acpA, located on pXO2, encode positive trans-acting proteins that are involved in bicarbonate-mediated regulation of toxin and capsule production, respectively. A derivative strain cured of pXO1 produced less capsular substance than the parent strain harbouring both pXO1 and pXO2, and electroporation of the strain cured of pXO1 with a plasmid containing the cloned atxA gene resulted in an increased level of capsule production. An acpA-null mutant was complemented by not only acpA but also the atxA gene. The cap region, which is essential for encapsulation, contains three genes capB, capC, and capA, arranged in that order. The atxA gene stimulated capsule synthesis from the cloned cap region. Transcriptional analysis of cap by RNA slot-blot hybridization and primer-extension analysis revealed that atxA activated expression of cap in trans at the transcriptional level. These results indicate that cross-talk occurs, in which the pXO1-located gene, atxA, activates transcription of the cap region genes located on pXO2. We identified two major apparent transcriptional start sites, designated P1 and P2, located at positions 731 bp and 625 bp, respectively, upstream of the translation-initiation codon of capB. Transcription initiated from P1 and P2 was activated by both atxA and acpA, and activation appeared to be stimulated by bicarbonate. Deletion analysis of the upstream region of the cap promoter revealed that activation by both atxA and acpA required a DNA segment of 70 bp extending upstream of the P1 site. These results suggest that cross-talk by atxA to the genes encoding capsule synthesis is caused by the interaction of the atxA gene product with a regulatory sequence upstream of cap.",,"anthrax toxin; anthrax; article; bacillus anthracis; bacterial virulence; controlled study; dna sequence; encapsulation; gene expression regulation; nonhuman; priority journal; transcription regulation; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacillus anthracis; Bacterial Capsules; Bacterial Proteins; Bacterial Toxins; Base Sequence; DNA; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes; Genetic Complementation Test; Molecular Sequence Data; Operon; Plasmids; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Sequence Analysis, DNA; Trans-Activators; Transcription, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030934904

By comparing levels of gene expression in cells grown on glucose, acetate, lactate, and oleic acid, we found that the increase in gene expression was due to a glucose repression-derepression mechanism. In order to obtain information concerning the regulation of the gene expression, a fusion gene which consists of the 5'-upstream region of MS-2 (UPR-MS-2) and the lacZ gene (encoding Escherichia coli β-galactosidase), was introduced into S. cerevisiae, and β-galactosidase activities were measured with cells grown on glucose or acetate. Deletion analysis of UPR-MS-2 revealed that the region between -777 and -448 (against the translation initiation codon) enhanced the level of gene expression in both glucose- and acetate-grown cells. In this region, sequences which resemble binding sites of Rap1(p)/Grf1(p)/Tuf(p), a global transcription activator, were found at seven locations and one was found for another pleiotropic activator Abf1(p). The result also suggested the presence of multiple upstream repression sequences (URSs), which function specifically in glucose-grown cells,in the region between -368 and -126. In the repressing region, there were three tandem C(A/T)CTCCC sequences and also a putative binding site of Mig1(p), a transcriptional repressor which mediates glucose repression of several other genes. When MIG1 gene of S. cerevisiae was disrupted, the expression of the UPR-MS-2-lacZ gene in glucose-grown cells increased approx. 10-fold. Furthermore, the effect of deletion of a putative Mig1(p) binding site was abolished in the MIG1-disrupted strain, suggesting Mig1(p) binds to this site and brings about glucose repression. When the SNF1 gene was disrupted, the high level gene expression observed in acetate-grown cells bearing UPR-MS-2 was abolished. This indicated that derepression of UPR-MS-2-mediated gene expression was dependent on Snf1(p), as is the case of genes encoding isocitrate lyase and gluconeogenic enzymes in S. cerevisiae.","Candida tropicalis; glucose repression; malate synthase; MIG1; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; SNF1","carbon; malate synthase; article; candida tropicalis; gene deletion; gene disruption; gene expression regulation; gene repression; glucose metabolism; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; saccharomyces cerevisiae; Acetates; Base Sequence; beta-Galactosidase; Candida; Cloning, Molecular; Codon; DNA Primers; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Genes, Fungal; Malate Synthase; Molecular Sequence Data; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides; Peptide Chain Initiation, Translational; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Recombinant Proteins; Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid; Restriction Mapping; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031030469

Therefore, we have investigated regions in UPR-ICL responsible for gene expression in glucose-grown and acetate-grown cells. In glucose grown cells, a deletion of the region between -801 and -569 (region G1) significantly decreased gene expression compared with that observed with the complete UPR-ICL. The region from -421 to -379 (region G2) also repressed gene expression in glucose-grown cells. In acetate-grown cells, two regions were found to strongly enhance gene expression, one between -728 and -569 (region A1) and the other between -370 and -356 (region A2). Whereas region A2 contained a sequence motif similar to the carbon-source-responsive element (CSRE), which mediates regulation by carbon source of S. cerevisae ICL1, region A1 did not show similarity to any reported cis-acting elements. Deletion mutants of UPR-ICL containing only one of these regions showed that each region could independently activate gene expression to a similar level when the cells were grown on acetate. The influences of null mutations in the MIG1, SNF1 and CAT8 genes on regulation of UPR-ICL-mediated gene expression were examined. Expression of the ICL gene with full-length UPR-ICL increased about tenfold in mig1 cells grown on glucose, while little difference was observed in acetate-grown cells. The effects of snf1 and cat8 mutations were different between region-A1-mediated and region-A2-mediated gene expression in acetate-grown cells. Region-A2-mediated expression decreased 95% and 86% in snf1 and cat8 cells, respectively, while region-A1-mediated expression decreased 72% in snf1 cells and was not affected by the car8 mutation. This finding indicates that region A1-mediated gene expression is regulated by a pathway independent of CAT8, which is necessary for derepression of CSRE-mediated gene expression in S. cerevisiae.","Candida tropicalis; Glucose repression; Isocitrate lyase; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Upstream region of the isocitrate lyase gene","glucose; isocitrate lyase; article; Candida tropicalis; culture medium; deletion mutant; gene expression regulation; gene repression; genetic analysis; priority journal; promoter region; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Candida tropicalis; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031016050

In this paper, the economic effects of these price increases are studied. It is shown that the price increases have beneficial effects. For each 1% increase in the price of gasoline, the consumption of gasoline falls by 0.41%. This translates into a corresponding proportionate reduction in carbon emissions from gasoline. Analogously, a 1% rise in the price of electricity yields a 0.33% reduction in electricity consumption giving a coincident decline in carbon emission from the generation of electricity.In December 1995, Mexico began a process of increasing the prices of gasoline and electricity, both produced by state monopolies. The objective of the price icnreases, which are to take place over the course of the next year, is to raise revenue as well as reduce consumption of fossil fuels. One unknown with regard to the price increases for gasoline and electricity is what will be the expected impact as the Mexican economy struggles to rebound. This is of more than spurious concern since many Mexican industries rely both intensively and extensively on gasoline and electricity to produce their goods and services. The nature and extent of this effect is the subject of this paper. Before turning to an examination of this issue, however, the modelling approach to be used in assessing the impact of higher energy prices will be discussed.",,"Economic and social effects; Electricity; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gasoline; Mathematical models; Economic impact; Electricity consumption; Energy price increase; Mexico; Energy policy; economic impact; energy prices; price increase; Mexico",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031194542

Pipestem is linked to a steady-state, carbon-flux model in order to gauge the effects, on stand growth, of weather and other environmental factors that operate on short temporal scales.

The present experiments were performed to further test the hypothesis that renal kallikrein reduces bicarbonate secretion of cortical collecting duct (CCD). The effect of orthograde injections of pig pancreatic kallikrein (1 or 3 μg/ml) into the renal tubular system was investigated. Urine fractions (Fr) were collected after a 2-min stop flow. Changes in the urine fraction with respect to those in free-flow urine samples (Ff) were related to the respective polyfructosan (Inutest) ratio. Renal kallikrein activity (Fr:Ff kallikrein/Fr:Ff polyfructosan) increased significantly in the first two urine fractions collected after glandular kallikrein administration (kallikrein, 1 μg/ml, P &lt; 0.05; kallikrein, 3 μg/ml, P &lt; 0.01). HCO3 secretion of collecting ducts was significantly reduced dose dependently by orthograde and also reduced by retrograde pig pancreatic kallikrein administration. Release of kinins into the fractions was not affected by the retrograde kallikrein injection, even though the kallikrein activity increased considerably 12.26 ± 0.2 vs. 1.55 ± 0.2, P &lt; 0.05). Adequacy of retrograde injections for delivering substances to the CCD was demonstrated by injecting colloidal mercury and detecting the appearance of this mercury in the renal cortex by transmission electron microscopy. The integrity of the renal tissue after a retrograde ureteral injection was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. These results confirm and extend previous data (M. Marin-Grez and P. Valles. Renal Physiol. Biochem. 17: 301-306, 1994; and M Marin-Grez, P. Valles, and P. Odigie. J. Physiol. 488:163-170, 1995) showing that renal kallikrein reduces bicarbonate secretion at the CCD, probably by inhibiting HCO3 transported by a mechanism unrelated to its kininogenase activity. Support for this assessment was obtained in experiments testing the effect of kallikrein on the luminal bicarbonate secretion of a subpopulation of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells capable of extruding the anion. Kallikrein inhibited HCO3/Cl exchange, and the degree of inhibition was dose dependent. This inhibition occurred in the absence of kininogen in the bathing solution.","Bicarbonate; Cortical collecting duct; Cortical connecting tubule; Kallikrein; Madin-Darby canine kidney cells","bicarbonate; fructan; kallikrein; kinin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; chloride transport; controlled study; dog; enzyme activity; female; kidney collecting tubule; kidney cortex; kidney distal tubule; kidney tubule excretion; nephron; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; scanning electron microscopy; transmission electron microscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030709458

A low-investment-cost option is the firing of locally grown willow in retrofitted Irish peat plants. Various options for such a biomass energy system were evaluated. All steps in the supply chain were integrated in a model and optimised economically. Retrofitting of existing peat plant was compared with building new biomass combustion and gasification plants. All conversion technologies considered are able to co-fire biomass and peat. The study focused on possibilities in the short term. To reflect uncertainties, all costs were presented in ranges. Neither agricultural subsidies nor possible CO2 taxes were included. The lowest cost retrofit option with a proven technology was the conversion of unit 3 of the Lanesborough peat plant into a bubbling fluidised bed. The willow costs at the plant gate ranged between 4.4 and $15/GJ(LHV) and the kW h costs between 7.5 and 21 cents/kW h. The not yet proven options of gasification and the retrofit into a whole-tree energy plant showed slightly lower costs. The large ranges in the costs were mainly caused by the difference between the low and high estimation of the willow yields and the farmer's annual income. It can be concluded that in the lowest cost estimate, willow firing in retrofitted Irish peat plants has about the same cost as peat firing. ($4.3/GJ(LHV) and 7.4 cents/kW h) and could therefore be a promising option to reduce CO2 emissions in Ireland.","Biomass; biomass combustion; economics; Ireland; logistics; peat; power generation; retrofit; short rotation coppice; willow","alternative energy; biomass fuel; electricity generation; willow firing; Ireland; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Cost accounting; Cost effectiveness; Electric power generation; Firing (of materials); Gasification; Industrial economics; Industrial emissions; Peat; Retrofitting; Short rotation coppice; Fossil fuel power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030616098

In the four scenarios emphasis has been placed on reduction of emissions into the water chain, reduction of water consumption, minimal pollution (source reduction) and on small-scale.

The supports are actively used to guide the electrons from the cathodes to the phosphor screen. The electrons are transported through the insulating structures by a self-regulating secondary emission process, provided a sufficiently high voltage is applied between the entrance and the exit of the structures. The local potentials are automatically adjusted by charge deposition on the insulating walls until a situation is established characterized by the property that the local average secondary emission coefficient is equal to one everywhere in the structure. The flat thin CRT with these insulating internal supports has a thickness of about 1 cm for any display size and a relatively low mass. Large displays have been realized showing a good performance: brightness, contrast, colour purity and power dissipation are comparable to or better than obtained with conventional cathode ray tubes. Some other interesting applications based on the same phenomenon are briefly discussed: an electron 'fibre', an electron source with high current density and a beam switch.","Electron sources; Electron transport; Flat display; Flat thin CRT","Atmospheric pressure; Current density; Display devices; Electric insulating materials; Electron sources; Electron transport properties; Energy dissipation; Flat displays; Secondary electron emission; Cathode ray tubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031550384

The aim of this study was to determine how these two annual species can maintain themselves in a community that exists almost uniquely of perennials. It was found that L. inflata has low survival and low RGR in gaps of diameter <25 cm, whereas R. minor has higher survival and grows better (and therefore produces more seeds) even in much smaller gaps. Further experiments showed that survival in L. inflata is strongly affected by ferilization, with extra fertilization raising the probability of survival in the plots with no competition and with only below ground competition, and lowering the probability of survival in the control plots. RGR in L. inflata was almost completely determined by the vegetation treatment: it was high in herbicided plots, lower in netted plots (with only below ground competition), and lower still in the intact control plots (where average RGR was negative). In R. minor, on the other hand, survival was high in both fertilized and unfertilized plots. In the fertilized plots where was no significant difference between the survival of netted and control treatments, whereas in the unfertilized there was. Greater dry weight of the test plants at the start of the experiment (as predicted by initial length) correlated with higher survival. Fecundity in R. minor also depended on initial length, and to some extent on treatment. We conclude that the ability of R. minor to do well in dense vegetation depends on the plants' predatory way of making a living; as a hemiparasite, R. minor depends for all its water and mineral reosurces and for some of its carbon gain on the plants it parasitizes. A stochastic simulation with spatial extent enabled us to obtained continued survival of both species provided the rate of formation of new gaps was high enough. It is was not, then L. inflata would disappear from the plots, while R. minor continued to thrive. The observed cycling of R. minor could be due to other factors not in the model (seed predation by voles or by a specialized insect), or they could represent stable limit cycles generated by an inherently deterministic process. Further research is required to elucidate these matters.",,"community dynamics; grassland; population dynamics; stochastic process; Lobelia inflata; Rhinanthus minor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031374765

On the basis of 14C incorporation into the major biochemical pools, no changes were observed in the allocation of carbon into proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and low-molecular-weight metabolites in the particulate fraction.

Stratigraphic relationships, radiocarbon dating, and pollen, plant macrofossil, and isotopic analyses are used to reconstruct the developmental history of the peatland. Organic matter began to accumulate in the basin about 7200 yr B.P., during a period when the climate is thought to have been warmer than present. Initially the permafrost table was probably below the bottom of the basin, and an open-water mineral wetland with emergent and submergent aquatic vegetation occupied the site. Enriched δ18O values from ice samples confirm the existence of an open water body with a water balance strongly affected by evaporation. Transformation to a graminoid fen peatland was underway by 6300 yr B.P. Permafrost and ice began to form in the peatland at this time. Low-centered polygons probably began to develop by 4700 yr B.P. and subsequently evolved into the high-centered polygons which characterise the southwestern part of the peatland today. Peat accumulation in the polygons has been extremely slow for the last 4000 years. The eastern, wetter part of the basin has largely remained unchanged since its inception about 7000 yr B.P.

Strong upwelling (SST &lt;20°C) occurred between 7°and 11°N along the Somali coast during July. Diatoms dominated in patchy blooms of phytoplankton north of Ras Hafun at the border of the Somali Current. Picophytoplankton (mainly Synechococcus and pico-eukaryotes) were present, but their contribution to the total chlorophyll a content was less than 30%. Nutrient concentrations in the main upwelling wedge south of Ras Hafun were high (nitrate over 5 μM), but chlorophyll a concentrations remained relatively low (≤0.6 mg.m-3) both in the freshly upwelled water of the Somali Current and downstream around Socotra Island and in the Great Whirl. In the latter areas, nutrients were not depleted (nitrate concentration varied between 3 and 8 μM) but primary production did not exceed 1 g C.m-2.day-1 as mixed layer depth largely succeeded the euphotic zone depth. Primary production for the whole northern Somali Basin showed a mean of 1.25 g C.m-2 day-1 (range 0.8-2.8 g C.m-2.day-1). During the NE monsoon, phytoplankton was dominated by picophyplankton (up to 80% of total chlorophyll a content; dominated by Synechococcus, pico-eukarylites and Prochlorococcus). Strong winds resulted in nutrient entrainment from deeper water. Surface values of chlorophyll a were ca 0.3 mg.m-3 and mean primary production of the Somali Basin was 0.8 g C.m-2.day-1 (range 0.5-1.0 g C.m-2.day-1). In the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden a reverse seasonal pattern occurred. During the SW monsoon, both areas were oligotrophic, including a deep chlorophyll maximum. Phytoplankton was dominated by picoplankton, namely Synechococcus. Primary production was low (0.50.6 g C.m-2.day-1). During the NE monsoon winter cooling resulted in deep vertical mixing and surface water replete with nutrients. Chlorophyll a values varied between 0 5 and 1.0 mg.m-3 with the highest values in diatom blooms in the Red Sea. Mean primary production was 1.2 g C.m-2.day-1 (range 0.5-2.2 g C.m-2.day-1). A detailed study, applying flow-cytometry, of the daily net growth rates of individual phytoplankton species/groups during the NE monsoon showed a large spatial variation indicative of active dynamics in the algal composition even on a daily basis. For picophytoplankton the highest growth rates exceeded 1.5 day-1, but larger phytoplankton showed lower maxima for growth rates (ca 1 day-1). Net growth rates decreased often to negative values at the bottom of the euphotic zone, implying a high grazing pressure. Net growth rates were converted to daily variations in plant carbon an compared with 14C-based primary production data (only during the NE monsoon). In nutrient replate regions, the two methods showed comparable values for carbon production, indicating that all newly fixed carbon resulted in an increase in plant biomass. Higher nutrient levels in particular favoured growth of larger phytoplankton (&gt;3 μm). In more oligotrophic (low surface nitrate) areas, &lt;35% of the primary production resulted in a net increase in plant carbon. At some stations grazing pressure balanced phytoplankton growth, as plant carbon did not change over a full day incubation period.",,"biomass; community composition; monsoon; monsoons; phytoplankton; productivity; Indian Ocean, (Northwest); Prochlorococcus; Synechococcus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030901237

The tri-nation (Senegal, Mauritania and Mall) river basin development authority, the Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Senegal (OMVS), is attempting to execute a shift to irrigated rice production for domestic consumption in the river basin in order to ease the severe foreign exchange shortfalls these riparian nations face. With the recent completion of the Manantali and Diama dams, year-round irrigated agriculture is now possible in the SRB. The full agricultural development potential of the SRB is constrained, however, by the basin's limited water resources. Significantly, a time series analysis of Senegal River hydrology has provided powerful evidence that the prolonged Sahelian drought may be permanent. The basic hydrologic constraint on development is revealed in a time series decomposition of Senegal River annual flow volumes, which strongly suggests that water resources availability has been substantially curtailed since 1960. Two alternative time series mechanisms are hypothesized to account for the decreased flow volumes in recent decades. The first time series model suggests the presence of a long-term periodicity, while the second model hypothesizes an ARMA(1,1) process. The second hypothesis provides a superior model fit. The stationary ARMA(1,1) model can be fit successfully, however, only after explicitly removing a non-stationary component by linearly detrending after 1960. The implication of non-stationarity in Senegal River hydrology provides analytic evidence that the landscape degradation and desertification processes observed in Sahelian Africa can be in part attributed to climate change effects. The negative impact of the state-imposed rice production policy compounds the severe effects of the drought on the river basin ecology. Rice production in the arid river valley has been a financial and social failure. Irrigated rice projects suffer a high rate of abandonment and have intensified the desertification process in the river valley. As an alternative use of the basin's scarce water resources, an agricultural development policy based on village-scale irrigation projects and intensive, irrigated agro-forestry projects has been proposed. Village-scale irrigation is dedicated to low-water-consumption cereal grain crops and is managed by traditional socio-political structures. The agro-forestry production system analysed has the dual objectives of using irrigation to re-establish a protective bio-mass cover in the desertifying river valley and of reversing the drought-induced migration from rural to urban areas. A comparative river system simulation study was conducted to analyse the effects of both the rice production development policy (policy RP) and the natural resources management policy (policy NRM) on the SRB's full agricultural development potential. The simulation study compared three alternative hydrologic scenarios using, (1) the pre-drought era, (2) the 1970s level drought and (3) the 1980s level drought. Principles of dynamic programming were applied to Manantali reservoir management to optimize water allocation in each scenario. All the hydrologic scenarios generated showed that the lower overall water-demand pattern exerted by policy NRM allows a higher full agricultural development potential than does policy RP.","Climate change; Hydrology; Irrigation policy; Senegal River; Simulation","water; agriculture; article; cereal; climate; developing country; environmental planning; flow; forestry; human; Mauritania; migration; policy; resource management; rice; rural population; Senegal; socioeconomics; urban area; water flow; agricultural development; climate change; hydrology; irrigation policy; water resource management; water resource modelling; water resources planning; Africa, Senegal River Basin; Riparia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030617479

For the CH4 reaction we also report measurements made using a high-temperature flowing afterglow (HTFA) instrument over the temperature range 300 K-1313 K. The rate constants are found to have a very large isotope effect, with the CH4 rate constant a factor of 15 higher than the CD4 rate constant at 93 K. The rate constants generally have a minimum with respect to temperature and 〈KEcm〉, except for the higher-temperature data for CD4 where the rate constants show only an increase with increasing kinetic energy. The data indicate that increasing rotational temperature decreases the rate constants and that rotational energy behaves similarly to translational energy. Single excitations of bending and twisting vibrations have a negligible effect on the rate constant. Either the stretching vibrations or overtones of the bending vibrations increase the rate constants. If the stretches are responsible for the increase in the rate constants, the derived rate constant for a single quantum of stretch excitation (v = 1) is 5 X 10-10 cm3 s-1, a factor of 6 larger than the rate constant for v = 0. The CH2D2 rate constants are approximately equal to the averages of the rate constants for the pure isotopes. The product branching ratio (OH-/OD-) shows no dependence on CH2D2 rotational temperature or low-frequency CH2D2 vibrations. A theoretical study of the minimum energy reaction path was performed to help elucidate the reaction dynamics. The minimum energy reaction surface was characteristic of the standard double minimum pathway for ion molecule reactions. The height of the central barrier was found to be close to the energy of the reactants and varied with isotopic substitution. Conformationally different transition states are found for these isotopic reactions. Theoretical studies at the QCISD(T) level of theory find distinct transition states corresponding to O-+CH4, O-+H-CHD2, O-+D-CH2D, O-+CD4. The transition state barriers increase in the order O-+CH4, O-+H-CHD2, O-+D-CH2D, and O-+CD4, in agreement with experimental reaction rates. The main features of the reactivity are explained by the characteristics of the reaction surface. © 1997 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001282442

The DNA sequences for the two genes were very similar, even in the promoter regions and in introns, indicating that the repeat is a result of a recent duplication. To study gene regulation, elements from the upstream region of ca1 were fused to the arylsulphatase reporter gene.

We have investigated the effect of glucose on the induction of this mechanism. Cells adapted to low CO2 in the presence of glucose showed a reduced ability to transport and fix external inorganic carbon. This reduction was correlated with a decrease in internal carbonic anhydrase activity, 3-O-methyl-glucose, a nonmetabolizable analog of glucose, caused a more dramatic repression of these phenomena. Immunoblot analyses of total cell protein of Chlorella vulgaris UAM 101 against large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate-carboxylase/oxygenase activase polyclonal antibodies showed that the expression of these two polypeptides was affected by neither CO2 level, nor glucose or 3-O-methyl-glucose. Ultrastructure studies showed that the low CO2-induced development of the pyrenoid was also affected by glucose. Immunocytochemical data demonstrated that ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase was exclusively located in the pyrenoid matrix.

The cultivated soil was more sandy and had lower organic matter and nutrient contents than the fallow soil. Four nematode assemblages of Scutellonema cavenessi, Helicotylenchus dihystera and Tylenchorhynchus gladiolatus were inoculated in the soils. The pot experiment was conducted on millet during 2 months. Multiplication rates of H. dihystera were not significantly different in the two soils. T. gladiolatus had a lower multiplication rate in the fine-textured soil. S. cavenessi seemed to reproduce better in the coarse-textured soil when inoculated in low density with H. dihystera. The presence of plant parasitic nematodes in the cultivated soil caused a significant decrease of millet biomass, whereas plants in the fallow soil were less sensitive to nematode damage and were only affected when the soil was inoculated with T. gladiolatus alone.

However, a relatively new application is syngas utilization for its combustion value.

One of the most recent applications of SGP is the PER+ Shell Refinery project in the Netherlands which is nearly completed. By applying SGP, the refinery is being upgraded to meet product volume and quality demands for lighter and environmentally cleaner transportation fuels, whilst reducing refinery emissions to the environment. Furthermore, part of the syngas is being used in a 120 MWe combined cycle, replacing a conventional utility unit. A 250 MWe coal gasification combined cycle plant based on SCGP has recently been built by Demkolec, a development partnership of the Dutch Electricity Generating Board (N.V. Sep).

Recent advances in computer technology, regional hydrology and our understanding of water supply system behavior allow for examination of the sensitivity of water supply system behavior to potential climatic change in a very general framework. A regional hydroclimatologic model of annual streamflow is developed for the northeastern United States which relates moments of annual streamflow to climatic and geomorphic characteristics at 166 gaging stations. The regional hydroclimatologic streamflow model is then combined with analytic relationships among water supply system storage, reliability, resilience and yield. The sensitivity of various water supply system performance indices such as yield, reliability and resilience are derived as a function of climatic, hydrologic and storage conditions.

After 26 days, [14C]carbon dioxide production from free glyphosate accounted for 34-51% of the applied radiocarbon, and 45-55% was recovered from plant-associated residues. For three soils, the cumulative [14C]carbon dioxide production from free glyphosate was positively correlated with soil microbial biomass, determined by substrate-induced heat output measurement and by total adenylate content. The fourth soil, originating from a former hop plantation, and containing high concentrations of copper from long-term fungicide applications, did not fit this correlation but showed a significantly higher [14C]carbon dioxide production per unit of microbial biomass. Although the cumulative [14C]carbon dioxide production from plant-associated 14C-residues after 26 days was as high as from the free compound, it was not correlated with the soil microbial biomass. This indicates that the biodegradation of plant-associated herbicide residues, in contrast to that of the free compound, involves different degradation processes. These encompass either additional steps to degrade the plant matrix, presumably performed by different soil organisms, or fewer degradation steps since the plant-associated herbicide residues are likely to consist mainly of easily degradable metabolites. Moreover, the bioavailability of plant-associated pesticide residues seems to be dominated by the type and strength of their fixation in the plant matrix.","Glyphosate; Mineralization; Plant-associated herbicide residues; Soil microbial biomass","biodegradation; carbon dioxide; glyphosate; herbicide residue; mineralization; Glycine max; Humulus; Humulus lupulus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031449070

Recently, the U. S. EPA put into place staged requirements for heavy duty diesel engines in urban bus applications which are aimed at ultimately bringing pre-1994 engines into particulate emissions compliance with 1994 heavy duty on-road truck standards (0. 1 g/bhp-hr TPM). This reflects the need to control emissions in crowded urban environments. Zirconia based ceramic combustion management coatings, although originally developed for adiabatic or low heat rejection engines to boost thermal efficiency, have also been shown to contribute to the reduction in diesel emissions. Heavy duty transient testing of rebuilt 2-stroke MUI diesel bus engines equipped with stabilized zirconia based coatings applied by thermal spray process have shown significant reduction in exhaust opacity relative to a baseline, uncoated engine. This was a reflection of the reduction in the dry carbon (soot) component of the particulate emissions. The combination of the zirconia in-cylinder coatings and an efficient diesel oxidation catalyst have allowed the 0.1 g/bhp-hr TPM standard to be met for rebuilt pre-1994 MY 2-stroke bus engine. Testing also showed that NOx emissions could also be reduced significantly via fuel injection timing retard without substantial increase in particulate emissions. Several years of field experience have been gained in diesel engines in urban bus applications equipped with in-cylinder zirconia based ceramic coatings and postmortem examination of coatings with over 100,000 miles service has shown very good durability.

The dominant characteristics of the observation period were strong drought and drastically reduced pollutant emissions. Traffic and local sources operated at 0-10% of their capacities. Samples of dry and wet precipitation were taken by an automatic collector at a height of 2 m at weekly intervals. Two petri polycarbonate dishes of 93.5 mm diameter, facing upward, and one, facing downward, were used for dry precipitation sampling. Determination in a 'clean room' by differential pulse stripping voltammetry provided the low detection thresholds of 0.1, 1.0, 0.5 and 2.0 ng mL-1, i.e. the measurement of minimal dry deposition rates of 0.02, 0.2, 0.1 and 0.4 μg m-2 d-1 for Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn, respectively. The mean annual deposition rates, expressed in μg m-2 d-1, were found to be as follows: 4.5 (down), 26 (up) and 37 (wet) for Pb, 2.1 (down), 13 (up) and 36 (wet) for Cu, and 3.1 (down), 26 (up) and 95 (wet) for Zn. No values above 0.2 μg m-2 d-1 were found for the Cd dry deposition rate and no Cd concentration higher than 1 ng mL-1 for precipitation with an amount &gt; 0.5 mm at the weekly interval was detected. Using the XREDS method with a scanning electron microscope, Si, Al, Fe matrix elements and Mg, Ca, S, K, P, Cu, Zn, W were identified as minor constituents of the single spherical particles and of the agglomerates present. Pb could not be categorized as a minor constituent of the coarse particles suspended in the air of New Belgrade on the basis of the previous analysis. Analysis of meteorological data showed road dust transport by outgoing SE-ESE wind from the old city of Belgrade (H(s) = 100-250 m) as a possible Pb source at the chosen site, which was located in a park. A comparative measurement of Pb deposition on linden leaves was carried out in the vegetation period (1 April-31 October) of 1993 and 1994. The Pb distribution on leaves differed in the two growing seasons, while the sum of Pb deposition rates on the downward and upward oriented petri dishes remained practically equal. The Pb accumulation on linden leaves was higher in 1994, first because of an intensive soil supply by rain water. Besides, 'yellow' rain was reported during the night 15/16 April, on 16 and 17 April 1994. A Fe concentration of 2.3 μg mL-1 and a Pb concentration of 312 ng mL-1 with a total precipitation of 12.6 mm were found in the weekly wet sample of 13-20 April. Dry deposition rates of 17 and 84 μg m-2 d-1 for Cd and Pb, respectively, were measured on the upward facing dishes two weeks later (27 April-4 May). The synoptic analysis confirmed the development of the Saharan cyclogenesis and its influence on the Balkan peninsula in the period of 14 to 17 April 1994. In this region the impact of dustfall originating from the Saharan storm was evident either during wet deposition or through resuspension processes.","dry and wet deposition; Pb deposition to foliage; resuspension; trace metals","cadmium; copper; lead; trace metal; zinc; article; chernobyl accident; eastern europe; particle size; pollution; Cadmium; Copper; Deposition; Lead; Precipitation (chemical); Zinc; Deposition rates; Petri dishes; Resuspension; Trace metals; Trace elements; dry deposition; dust; foliage; lead; resuspension; trace metal; wet deposition; Serbia, Belgrade; Viscum album",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030617295

This evolution is apparent through the recent publication of material from important Byzantine sites such as St. Polyeucte (Saraçhane) in Istanbul [1], the consideration now attached to these categories of wares in the excavations (e.g. in Pergamon [2]), the publication of collections from museums [3], the - still seldom - organization of specific colloquiums [4,5] as well as through the publication of Crusader material from several sites in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem [6,7,8,9,10]. Nevertheless, very little is known about the manufacturing centers of late Byzantine and Frankish wares and about the patterns of diffusion of their products. A major contribution to this question can be obtained from elemental and petrographical analysis of the paste constituting the ceramics. Such methods are able to identify the provenance of ceramics by comparison with reference groups of known origin. Comprehensive analytical programs using sherds from attested production centers have been pioneered in the 1980's by Megaw and Jones [11] and are expected to be developed in the future [12] to support research in Byzantine ceramology. In this framework, the study of material from the recent excavations in Acre may shed some new light on the relationships between the Levant and the Byzantine world during the Crusader period. Acre was the main harbour of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem and became its capital in 1191, after the seizure of Jerusalem by Salah-el-Din. An important part of the maritime trade with the Crusader kingdoms, especially through Italian merchants, was directed to it. Excavations have been carried out by the Israel Antiquities Authority in different parts of Acre, mainly in the Hospitallers Complex [13], built in the 12th century by the knights of the order of St. John, in a tower and part of the 13th century wall and moat [14], and in some other sites throughout the old city in dwellings and commercial areas [15]. Ceramic finds are currently under study [8,9] and show a diversity of sources which illustrate links with the eastern part of the Mediterranean: Byzance, Cyprus, the Aegean, Christian and Islamic Syria, as well as with the western Mediterranean: Italy, North Africa Some of these sources can be identified from the typological features (e.g. St Symeon ware known to have been manufactured in the Syrian port of Al Mina [16]), but in most cases ceramics are refered to by their type and supposed broad region of origin, and therefore some accuracy can be gained from an analytical study. The present INAA (Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis) and ICP-AES (Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectrometry) program focuses on two categories of ceramics excavated in Acre and serves a double aim. The first aim is to define and characterize the local productions of Acre and to set a new analytical reference for the ceramics production centers of the late Byzantine / Crusader period. The second is to investigate some imports related to the Byzantine world, and especially, in the present case, the type known as ""Zeuxippus ware"" [17]. This type corresponds to a fine, glazed ware decorated with the sgraffito technique. It is of particular interest for the period both because of the extent of its diffusion (Fig.1) and because its decorative patterns have been a main source of inspiration for the 13th century productions [18]. ICP-AES and INAA elemental analysis are used in a complementary way to determine a range of elements which includes the major and minor elements as well as a variety of traces of different geochemical behavior. Rare earths (La, Ce, Nd, Sm, Tb, Yb, Lu), some transition elements (Sc, Co, Cr), some major elements (Na, (K, Ca), Fe) and (Rb), Sb, Cs, Hf, Ta, Th and U are determined by INAA with the external standard method, using Perlman-Asaro standard as reference [19]. The analytical protocol involves 3 countings with a planar, high resolution Ge detector for low energy gamma-rays (below 400 keV) [20] and a larger Ge detector of higher efficiency for higher energy gamma-rays. ICP-AES is mainly used here to determine major elements, together with minor and trace elements not determined by INAA such as V, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Sr, Y. Alkaline elements cannot be analyzed as a consequence of the dissolution process, which involves fusing in a furnace with Na2O2 and subsequent dissolution in water with HNO3 addition [21]. Sc serves as internal standard for the control of physical effects in the plasma. Various rock standards are used for calibration. The ICP and INAA measurements include an intercalibration program which is designed to enable us to compare our results with the ICP-based database currently under development in Oxford [12] and with data on similar ceramics from Asia Minor (including Zeuxippus ware derivatives) previously investigated by PIXE and INAA [22]. The first part of our project involves the analysis of different kind of wares which are suspected to be local. Evidence for local production has been found in the form of wasters of a type of bowl which is unique to Acre - thus named ""Acre bowl"". Since large quantities of these bowls were unearthed in the courtyard of the Hospitallers Complex, it seems that they were probably used for feeding the pilgrims or the sick in the Hospice [8]. They were found in smaller quantities in all other excavated sites in Acre, and do not appear in other excavated sites in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, apart from some rural sites in the close vicinity of Acre. Previous petrographic analysis of a sampling of Acre bowls has shown that, despite a fabric that appears to be uniform to the eye, two different groups of pastes can be distinguished [23]. One group corresponds to the geological features of the region of Acre and can be considered as local. The other is related to a geological context which can be found in southern Lebanon. The import of such simple, unglazed ware as the Acre bowls has been interpreted as a consequence of the need for additional stock in periods of heavy pilgrimage [8]. In spite of this rather unusually complicated feature, elemental analysis of wasters of Acre bowls is expected to enable us to define the range of locally manufactured products. Apart from Acre bowls and wasters, the sampling includes amphorae - some presumably local and some presumably imported -, glazed cooking pots, and glazed bowls decorated in the sgraffito, slip-painted and reserved slip techniques. The cooking pots have already attracted some attention in the literature since a street of cooking pots makers is known to have existed in Acre in the 13th century [24]. Furthermore, similar glazed cooking pots have been found in Paphos (Cyprus), where they appear as imports according to analyses by atomic emission spectrometry [11]. The evidence for the export of such wares, which seem to derive from an earlier Palestinian tradition, from the Crusader mainland would be of some interest in terms of economic and cultural history [7]. © 1997 Trans Tech Publications.","Acre; Byzantine period; Crusader period; ICP; INAA; Israel; Levant; Production center; Zeuxippus ware","Atomic spectroscopy; Chemical analysis; Neutron activation analysis; Petrography; Spectrometry; Byzantine wares; Frankish wares; Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICPAES); Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA); Sherds; Ceramic materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20644445651

Temperature, sunlight intensity, water vapor mixing ratio, and isoprene concentrations all increase on hotter days, and all influence ozone formation rates. Over a wide range of NOx and anthropogenic hydrocarbon concentrations, enhanced photolysis rates and elevated isoprene concentrations are calculated to be the most important factors contributing to increased O3 formation rates on warmer days. These results suggest that the most uncertain yet important meteorological factor controlling regional-scale O3 formation is fractional cloudiness and its impact on photolysis rates. Past studies have attempted to remove a 'temperature' effect using only temperature. Perhaps a better factor to 'normalize' longer-term ozone trends in polluted areas would be cloud coverage derived from routine surface-derived meteorological measurements. Only through such normalization could year-to-year variability be adequately accounted for when assessing the impact of emission control strategies on undesirable ozone concentrations.",,"Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Composition effects; Gas emissions; Hydrocarbons; Meteorology; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Photolysis; Thermal effects; Vapors; Isoprene; Water vapor mixing ratio; Air pollution",Conference Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031348330

The flux was 2 orders of magnitude greater than benthic oxygen fluxes in areas unaffected by venting on the continental margin off Alaska. Porewater profiles taken from the surface sediment below a vent site showed high concentrations of sulfide, methane, and ammonia. The reduced carbon and nitrogen compounds are transported to the vent site by fluids expelled from deeper anoxic sediment layers by the forces of plate convergence. The tectonically driven fluid flow was determined from the biochemical turnover in vent communities and was found to be 3.4 ± 0.5 m yr-1. A model was used to quantify the transport of silica, Ca2+, and sulfate via diffusion, advection, and bioirrigation through the surface sediments of a vent site. A nonlocal mixing coefficient of 20-30 yr-1 was determined by fitting the model curves to the measured porewater profiles showing that the transport of solutes within the near-surface sediments and across the sediment-water interface is dominated by the activity of the vent fauna. Sulfate-containing oceanic bottom water and methane-rich vent fluids were mixed below the clam colony to produce sulfide and a CaCO3 precipitate. The vent biota shape their immediate environment and control the sediment-water exchange and the benthic fluxes at vent sites. The oxygen consumption at vent sites is a major sink for oxygen at the study area.

Three models were used in combination, the RAINS (Regional Acidification INformations and Simulation) model, the SAFE (Simulating Acidification in Forest Ecosystems) model and the MakeDep model. The scenarios used were based on results from international negotiations (the Oslo and Sofia protocols) and on calculations of what could be achieved using the best available technology at a reasonable cost. The parameters chosen for studying the course of acidification were base saturation, BC.Al molar ratio in soil solution and pH. Furthermore, the sites were compared with respect to deposition regimes as well as ion exchange and weathering rates, nutrient uptake and nutrient cycling. The results show, that all sites have undergone acidification. Three of the sites show BC.Al molar ratios below or very close to the threshold value of 1. Currently accepted reductions in S and N emissions will lead to a halt in acidification in all cases and a partial regeneration of the soil buffer capacity in some cases. Introducing maximum feasible reductions would improve soil conditions remarkably at all six sites. The differences in degree and course of acidification can be derived from differences in weathering rate and soil buffer capacity as well as from the deposition regimes. Detailed information on future anthropogenic base cation deposition is shown to be less important for the outcome of the scenarios than expected.","Acidification; Aluminum; Model; Scenario analysis; Weathering","nitrogen; sulfur; acid deposition; acidification; air pollution; modelling; pollution control; acidification; air pollutant; air pollution; article; calculation; cost; Denmark; environmental impact assessment; Europe; forest; Germany; ion exchange; Ireland; pH; Russian Federation; simulation; soil; Spain; Switzerland; Euorpe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345726091

This report recommends that governments adopt a strategy for the progressive elimination of lead from gasoline. In conjunction with catalytic converters, unleaded gasoline use leads to reductions in major pollutants such as hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides. Unleaded gasoline should be made cheaper than leaded gasoline at the pump. In addition to this priority step, it is also crucial that other clean fuels be promoted. For example, the sulfur content of diesel fuel should be reduced to control emissions of sulfur and particulates. Alternative clean fuels such as natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas should also be promoted. Poorly maintained cars are responsible for a disproportionate amount of emissions.

The basic physical processes of relativistic electron spectrum evolution for synchrotron emission are second-order Fermi acceleration of turbulent plasma waves, Fermi acceleration of shock waves, radiation loss, particle escape, and adiabatic deceleration in a flow of synchrotron plasma. When the timescale of turbulence acceleration is larger than the Alfvén timescale, the evolutionary spectra of relativistic electrons are flattened in low energy and steepen rapidly in high energy. The shape of relativistic electron spectra depends on the level of plasma turbulence and shock wave acceleration. In the case of strong plasma turbulence, the resulting synchrotron emission has a flatter spectrum below a special frequency vc, which is inversely proportional to magnetic field, plasma density, and the square of emission region size. In the case of weak plasma turbulence, the flat spectrum is not formed by the physical processes in the plasma. Based on this model, the radio flat-spectrum sources are easily formed in compact active galactic nuclei. The flat radio sources with higher frequency extension appear in compact, active nuclei with lower plasma density and magnetic field. © 1997. The American Astronomical Society.

Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have the potential of improving fuel economy and reducing emissions. However, both electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles do have their own environmental impacts. In order to quantify the potential benefits from introducing such vehicles, it is necessary to compare their impacts with those from the conventional vehicles they would replace. These impacts include energy use and emissions from the entire energy cycle, including fuel production, vehicle and battery production and recycling, and vehicle operation. Argonne's previous work in collaboration with other national laboratories analyzed the total energy cycle of electric vehicles; this paper compares energy use and emissions for the total energy cycle of several HEV designs with those from modern conventional vehicles. The results show that use of HEVs can reduce energy use and emissions of greenhouse gases, volatile organic gases, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter with size smaller than 10 microns.

Different studies may, however, yield significantly different, sometimes contradicting, results for the same control measures. The results differ because of the various calculation methodologies used and assumptions made about the values of costs and emission reductions. This paper examines some important methodological issues involved in calculating the cost-effectiveness of mobile source control measures and proposes appropriate methods for calculating cost-effectiveness. Included are such issues as using user costs or societal costs, using costs at the manufacturer or the consumer level, determining baseline emissions, using emission reductions in nonattainment or in both nonattainment and attainment areas, using annual or pollution-season emission reductions, considering multiple-pollutant emission reductions, and applying emission discounting. This paper then reviews methodologies used in 11 studies recently completed in the United States on the cost effectiveness of mobile source control measures. On the basis of the methods proposed here for addressing the above issues, the original estimates in each study are modified to correct inconsistent or inappropriate methods so that the studies are comparable. From the adjusted results, the paper presents relative cost-effectiveness of 19 mobile source emission control measures.",,"Calculations; Cost effectiveness; Gas emissions; Ground vehicles; Motor transportation; Mobile source emission control; Air pollution control; economic evaluation; emissions control; environmental economics; methodological evaluation; uncertainity; vehicle emissions; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031103409

A survey was implemented to compare the concentrations of lead for 1984/1985 with those of 85 houses re-sampled within the city in 1996. It is shown that lead concentrations and loading of dusts in and around the houses have fallen significantly over the last 11 years. However, lead concentrations in soils have only slightly decreased over the same period. The US EPA IEUBK model for exposure of children to lead is validated, updated and applied to predict the blood lead level of young children. It is predicted that the blood lead concentrations of 2-year-old children have been reduced considerably over the period. The fall in lead concentrations is thought to be the consequence of the reduction policies for lead emissions in the UK since the 1980s. The result of this study provides a valuable example of the benefits of the reduction policies for lead which are of equal importance in developing countries with rapid economic growth.","Birmingham; IEUBK model; Lead concentrations; Reduction policies","lead; article; controlled study; dust; environment; environmental protection; health hazard; human; human tissue; lead blood level; methodology; normal human; pollution; preschool child; priority journal; risk assessment; sampling; soil; united kingdom; urban area; Air Pollutants; Child, Preschool; Data Collection; England; Humans; Lead; Lead Poisoning; Soil Pollutants; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Urban Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031588361

The two treatments were control and liming (to reduce soil acidity). These trace gas fluxes were also simulated using a revised version of the process-based model DNDC. Our version of the DNDC (Denitrification and Decomposition) model has been significantly modified by including a surface energy balance submodel; by using more comprehensive formulations for soil evaporation, plant transpiration, plant growth, and plant nitrogen uptake; by using an implicit difference scheme to solve the diffusion equations governing heat and water fluxes in the soil; and by initializing the soil organic carbon in different pools using their relative proportions at the steady state. The simulated average nighttime CO2 fluxes from the control plot were 0.07, 0.05, and 0.16 g C m-2 h-1 in March, August, and October of 1993, respectively, as compared with the measured average nighttime CO2 fluxes of 0.10, 0.07, and 0.14 g C m-2 h-1 for the corresponding periods. The simulated average daily N2O fluxes from the control plot were 0.09, 0.03, and 0.04 mg N m-2 d-1 in March, August, and October of 1993, respectively, as compared with the measured average daily N2O fluxes of 0.07, 0.03, and 0.16 mg N m-2 d-1 for the corresponding periods. Similar agreements between model simulations of CO2 and N2O fluxes and measurements were also obtained for the limed plot. We find that the simulations by model DNDC and field observations of gaseous N2O emissions agree well over a range of 3 orders of magnitude. We conclude that the daily and seasonal variations of CO2 and N2O fluxes on a plot scale can be reasonably simulated by this process-based model. The model shows that the fraction of N2O produced aerobically from nitrification was 73% for the control plot and 55% for the limed plots in 1993; therefore mitigation strategies for reducing N2O emission from such temperate or semiarid nitrogen-limited systems in Australia should be focused on the N2O loss from nitrification.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000957532

Injury was greater in a 5% CO2/2% O2 atmosphere than in 2% CO2/2% O2, but incidence was affected by orchard source. Susceptibility to injury was highest during the first 4 weeks of storage, while a postharvest treatment with diphenylamine prevented the disorder. Ethanol reduced injury, but ascorbic acid increased incidence of the disorder. Keeping fruit in air cold storage for 10 days before application of CO2 markedly reduced incidence of CO2 injury. Histological studies showed that external CO2 injury begins at the hypodermis-cortex boundary and spreads outward into the upper hypodermis and inward into outer cortex cells, although the cuticle and epidermis appear unaffected and unbroken. Radial walls of affected cells collapse and become pleated, so that the skin surface sinks below nearby normal regions. Other cellular events include loss of cytoplasmic integrity, coagulation of the protoplast, loss of organelle structure, and cell wall separation. Nondigested starch can be found in cells of affected fruit at the hypodermis-cortex boundary.

Biology, University College London, London WC1E 6BT, United Kingdom","Carbon and nitrogen regulation of UBI4, the stress-inducible polyubiquitin gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was investigated using a UBI4 promoter-LacZ fusion gene (UBI4-LacZ). Expression of this gene in cells grown on different media indicated that the UBI4 promoter is more active during growth on respiratory than on fermentable carbon sources but is not subject to appreciable control by nitrogen catabolite repression. UBI4-LacZ expression was virtually identical in cells having constitutively high (ras2, sra1-13) or constitutively low (ras2) levels of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity, indicating that this kinase does not exert a major influence on UBI4 expression. Catabolite derepression control of the UBI4 promoter was confirmed by measurements of UBI4-LacZ expression in hap mutant and wild-type strains before and after transfer from glucose to lactate. Mutagenesis of the perfect consensus for HAP2/3/4 complex binding at position -542 resulted in considerable reduction of UBI4 promoter derepression with respiratory adaptation in HAP wild-type cells and abolished the reduced UBI4-LacZ derepression normally seen when aerobic cultures of the hap1 mutant are transferred from glucose to lactate. This HAP2/3/4 binding site is therefore a major element contributing to catabolite derepression of the UBI4 promoter, although data obtained with hap1 mutant cells indicated that HAP1 also contributes to this derepression. The HAP2/3/4 and HAP1 systems are normally found to activate genes for mitochondrial (respiratory) functions. Their involvement in mediating higher activity of the UBI4 promoter during respiratory growth may reflect the contribution of UBI4 expression to tolerance of oxidative stress.","Catabolite derepression; Oxidative stress survival; Polyubiquitin gene; Saccharomyces cerevisiae","carbon; cyclic amp dependent protein kinase; glucose; heat shock protein; lactic acid; nitrogen; polyubiquitin; biopolymer; CCAAT binding factor; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; DNA (apurinic or apyrimidinic site) lyase; fungal protein; HAP2 protein, fungal; HAP3 protein, S cerevisiae; HAP3 transcription factor protein, Fungal; HAP4 protein, S cerevisiae; heat shock protein; hybrid protein; lyase; nuclear protein; polyubiquitin; Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein; transcription factor; ubiquitin; article; binding site; catabolite repression; consensus sequence; controlled study; culture medium; enzyme activity; fungus culture; gene activation; gene expression; gene fusion; genetic analysis; mitochondrial respiration; mutagenesis; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; promoter region; saccharomyces cerevisiae; biosynthesis; fermentation; fungal gene; gene expression regulation; genetic transformation; genetics; metabolism; oxygen consumption; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; site directed mutagenesis; Biopolymers; Carbon-Oxygen Lyases; CCAAT-Binding Factor; Consensus Sequence; Culture Media; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; DNA-(Apurinic or Apyrimidinic Site) Lyase; Fermentation; Fungal Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Genes, Fungal; Glucose; Heat-Shock Proteins; Lactic Acid; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Nuclear Proteins; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen Consumption; Polyubiquitin; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Transcription Factors; Transformation, Genetic; Ubiquitins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030614559

This review combines what is known about boreal forest dynamics from paleological studies, with the information derived from state-of-the-art climate and vegetation modeling, to present possible scenarios of the impact of anticipated climate change on boreal forest ecosystem structure and function, particularly in relation to fire regimes. Anticipated climatic/atmospheric impact on plant physiological, communal, ecosystem, and finally landscape-level interactions with fire are reviewed. All indications from the modeling sector point towards unprecedented increased regional or seasonal temperatures, with projected changes most pronounced at high latitudes and there greatest in winter. Anticipated climate change scenarios are expected to alter dramatically the boreal forest ecosystems and fire regimes with which they are currently in equilibrium. Changed fire regimes could be represented by increased annual area burned because of an extended fire season, increased fire frequency, and severity. Simulation studies show the potential for greatly reduced boreal forest area and increased fragmentation due to climate change. Fire regime as an ecosystem process is highly sensitive to climate change because fire behaviour responds immediately to fuel moisture, which is affected by precipitation, relative humidity, air temperature, and wind speed. This interaction between climate change and fire regime has the potential to overshadow the importance of the direct effects of global warming on species distribution, migration, substitution, and extinction. Such a scenario suggests that rate and magnitude of fire-regime-induced changes to the boreal forest landscape could greatly exceed anything expected due to atmospheric warming alone. Socioeconomic implications of altered fire regimes in a changing climate are discussed in terms of adaptive fire management strategies, age class distribution, and such global stewardship issues as biodiversity, carbon cycling, and sequestration.","Boreal forests; Climate change; Ecosystem processes; Ecosystem structure and function; Fire regime",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000698966

Arcjets operating with helium as a propellant may be the most efficient electric thruster capable of operating in this specific impulse range. This work reports on a recent set of experiments in which emission spectra of the plume of a helium arcjet were acquired and analyzed to obtain information on the internal energy modes of the arcjet. Of particular interest is the population of electronically excited helium states, as these carry a large energy, and would have a significant negative impact on arcjet performance if highly populated. Experiments were conducted using pure helium as a propellant, and using helium seeded with small amounts (< 5%) hydrogen. Data are presented which show that the intensity of emissions from the excited helium states fall off rapidly as the hydrogen concentration is increased. Electron temperatures, as determined by Boltzman plots of three different series of helium lines, remain constant within limits of uncertainty as the hydrogen concentration is varied. It is also observed that, as a function of distance from the exit plane, the emission intensities of several lines in the helium spectrum fall off proportionally, indicating that the emission observed does not derive form re-emission of photons originating in the arc which were absorbed by the plume. © American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., 1997.

Addition of a range of carbon sources to the rhizosphere sediment stimulated rates of acetylene reduction, with this stimulation being significant for sucrose and lactate. Surprisingly, whilst low additions of ammonium to the sediment porewater (10 to 50 mM) inhibited 50% of acetylene reduction activity, approximately 30% of this activity persisted in the presence of 1 mM ammonium chloride; this indicating that in at least a proportion of the N-fixing community, nitrogenase activity was not regulated in the short term by the availability of alternative nitrogen sources.","Acetylene reduction; Ammonium; Carbon sources; Nitrogen fixation; Plant photosynthesis; Rhizosphere; Root exudates; Zosfera noltii","Halophila; Zostera noltii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000797814

For climate analysis, the LWP and CF parameters are computed on pentad and monthly timescales. Comparisons are made between cloud frequencies obtained from microwave and visible/infrared measurements. It is shown that the SSM/I CF correlates with International Satellite Cloud Climatology Program low- and middle-level cloudiness. Interannual variations of monthly LWP are found to be strongly correlated with El Niño and La Niña events. In general, positive LWP anomalies are associated with positive SST anomalies. However, positive LWP anomalies may also occur in regions of negative SST anomalies. This is probably due to an increase in warm top rain clouds, produced from low-level convergence. When pentads of outgoing longwave radiation data are compared to the LWP, they both show the detailed structure for atmospheric intraseasonal oscillations at 30-60-day periods. However, there are some interesting differences. Finally, as an important application, the monthly LWP is compared with simulations from a general circulation model. While the simulation captures the locations of observed maxima and minima, there is a large discrepancy between the model and measurement for the Northern Hemisphere in summer.",,"algorithm; cloud cover; cloud water; liquid water; liquid water climatology; microwave imagery; SSM/I",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030782314

Here a one year data set will be investigated to look at two different characteristic features in more detail: (i) an evapotranspiration increase in the Rhine Valley between northerly stations (e.g., Karlsdorf, 510mm) and southerly stations (e.g., Sasbach, 620mm) was found, although there is only a small difference in altitude between both stations (27 m). The increase can be related to the increase in precipitation. Nearly a constant ratio of 0.8 between evapotranspiration and precipitation is given. The higher precipitation can be related to orographie effects, because the southerly stations are situated in the luff of higher mountains (Hornisgrinde about 1100m high) than the stations in the north (Kraichgau about 300m high). Hence the differences in evapotranspiration in the Rhine Valley can be explained by a remote effect of the orography. (ii) the increase in the sensible and the decrease of the latent heat fluxes with the altitude at the slope of the Black Forest, although there is a strong increase in precipitation from Sasbach (880mm) at the bottom to Hornisgrinde (1340mm) at the crest of the Black Forest. Explanations for this behaviour can be given by theoretical consideration about the height dependence of the Bowen ratio, which is mainly influenced by the air temperature and by the ratio of the temperature gradient to the moisture gradient.",,"boundary layer; energy balance; evapotranspiration; orography; precipitation; radiation; sensible heat flux; Germany, Rhine Valley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031461522

The other countries belonging to this agreement are Australia, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. There are two operating annexes, the first, Annex I being task-shared, in which designated research projects within the participating countries are reported on an annual basis. Annex II is cost-shared and the research is conducted at the International Flame Research Foundation (IFRF) in the Netherlands and paid for by the participants, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. The objectives of Annex II are to develop advanced low NOx coal, burners for power boilers and to characterize their performance with a wide range of coals and coal blends. Two burners have been selected as showing great promise in suppressing NOx formation, thereby reducing emissions to below regulatory levels. One is an aerodynamically air-staged burner (AASB) and the other an internally fuel-staged burner (IFSB). Both can utilize a single boiler entry port, which makes them ideal for retrofitting, the former relies on combustion air staging, the latter on fuel staging or reburning. The IFSB, when developed to a commercial stage, is anticipated to meet projected Canadian NOx regulations for the foreseeable future. Supplementary aspects of the program have been coal characterization, ash behaviour and deposition, advanced in-flame measurement technique development and validation data bases for flame, combustion and NOx modelling. This presentation will focus on the two low NOx burners developed under the Annex II program.",,"Air pollution control; Coal fired boilers; Database systems; Flame research; Fuel burners; Industrial emissions; Laws and legislation; Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Operations research; Aerodynamically air staged burner (AASB); Internally fuel staged burner (IFSB); Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17644448899

This study investigated a method of reducing the SO2 emissions by adding lime (CaO) to the coal prior to combustion. Sorbent, as lime, was added to the combustion chamber (a domestic stove), by pretreating the coal by mixing crushed coal with lime and molasses and turning the coal into briquettes. Lime was added to lump coal for comparative purposes. The ratio of Cafree:S was varied for a series of combustion tests, and the heating efficiency and the amount of sulphur fixed in the ash were determined. The results of the tests show that optimum sulphur retention and heating efficiency were obtained when the Cafree:S molar ratio was between 0.95 and 1.15 for the briquettes and between 1.00 and 1.25 for the lump coal. For lump coal, 50% of the total sulphur could be fixed in the ash and at least 75% of the heating efficiency retained. During combustion of the briquettes, at least 57.5% of the sulphur could be fixed in the ash and at least 85% of the heating efficiency could be achieved. This suggests that the addition of lime to briquettes may be a feasible way of reducing the SO2 emissions for domestic stoves.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33750688261

This usually results from an O2 demand above the maximal conductance of the O2 transport chain. Of the many types available, an incremental test that provides a smooth gradational stress over the entire tolerance range is most appropriate for clinical investigations. The responses to exercise in patients should be interpreted with reference to the magnitude and pattern of normal response. Muscular work is fuelled from aerobic (O2 from the atmosphere and the body's O2 stores) and anaerobic (depletion of intramuscular creatine phosphate stores and production of lactate and H+ sources. At work rates (WRs) that do not yield sustained increases in blood lactate (i.e. ~50% of maximum oxygen uptake (V'O2), the steady state pulmonary CO2 output (V'CO2) reflects the substrate mixture being oxidized, but is also influenced during the transient by increased tissue CO2 storage. Ventilation (V'E) at this moderate intensity normally changes proportionally with V'CO2, as modified by the decreased dead-space fraction of tidal volume: arterial pH and partial pressure of CO2 (Pa,CO2) are regulated close to resting levels. At WRs resulting in a sustained metabolic (chiefly lactic) acidaemia, V'E is stressed further both by the increased V'CO2 resulting from the bicarbonate component of the buffering of the lactic acidosis, and the additional demands for compensatory hyperventilation. Although most subjects have significant ventilatory reserve at maximum exercise, elite athletes can actually achieve air flows during part of the expiration equivalent to that achieved (at that volume) with maximum volitional effort; the aged athlete is particularly prone to such limitation. Arterial hypoxaemia is not common at sea level even at maximum WRs, although it does develop during high-intensity exercise in some highly fit subjects. Inefficiency of pulmonary gas exchange, evidenced by widening of the alveolar to arterial PO2 difference, is normal during exercise, becoming prominent at high WRs. This reflects persistent, and possibly worsening, alveolar ventilation/perfusion mismatching, supplemented by some developing diffusion impairment. Cardiac output (Q') is not appreciably different in fit and unfit normal subjects at a given WR, but as stroke volume is higher in fitter subjects, higher WRs can be achieved prior to maximum cardiac frequency being attained, resulting in higher achievable levels of Q' and muscle blood flow. However, the mechanisms that limit maximum V'O2 (O2 delivery to the exercising muscle or diffusive conductance between the red cell and mitochondria) remain to be conclusively determined.","Aerobic metabolism; Alveolar-arterial oxygen difference; Anaerobic metabolism; Muscular work; Ventilatory and cardiovascular responses","carbon dioxide; lactic acid; oxygen; aerobic metabolism; anaerobic metabolism; arterial carbon dioxide tension; arterial oxygen tension; article; breathing pattern; cardiovascular response; exercise tolerance; gas exchange; heart output; heart rate; heart stroke volume; human; human experiment; muscle blood flow; normal human; oxygen consumption; respiratory function",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031427267

The differential concentrations, for both Titan plumes, in the diameter size range 10-200 nm, are found to increase with decreasing aerosol diameter. Ozone loss in the vicinity of the Titan plumes can be correlated with increases in local aerosol concentration due to the rocket emissions.

Interplanetary dust grains and micrometeorites currently deliver carbonaceous matter to the Earth's surface at a rate of ∼ 3 × 105 kg/yr (equivalent to a biomass in ∼2 Gyr), but this may have been as high as 5 × 107 kg/yr (a biomass in only ∼10 Myr) during the epoch of late bombardment.

Here I devise new profiles that take into account emissions- limitation proposals restricted to 'Annex I' (developed) countries, as well as the constraints imposed by more recent emissions data (now available until the end of 1995; ref. 5). The Annex 1 scenarios considered are two that span proposals recently considered by the IPCC, and a less restrictive case. Using the new CO2-concentration profiles and a carbon-cycle model to determine global CO2 emissions, and taking into account the prescribed Annex I country emissions, I determine the CO2-emission requirements for non-Annex I (developing) countries to achieve the stabilization of atmospheric concentration at about twice preindustrial values. I show that action by Annex I countries within the bounds of the scenarios considered can mean that non-Annex I countries have several decades before their emissions need to depart significantly from a 'business as usual' (no intervention) trajectory. Alternatively, if international trade in carbon emissions is permitted, non- Annex I countries can choose to emit below their 'business as usual' baseline and benefit from the trading of emission rights.The stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse-gas concentrations is the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

It is shown that the errors in the simulated fluxes under present climate are often of similar or larger magnitude than the simulated changes of these quantities. A similar relationship may be found in climate change experiments of many GCMs. Although this does not imply that the projected changes of the fluxes are wrong, more accurate absolute values would improve confidence in GCM-simulated climate change scenarios. The global mean increase in the downward component of the longwave radiation, which is the direct greenhouse forcing at the surface, is on the order of 10 W m-2 at the time of double carbon dioxide in a transient coupled atmosphere-ocean scenario experiment. This is an amount similar to the underestimation of this quantity in the present-day simulations compared to surface observations. Thus, it is only with doubled carbon dioxide concentration that the simulated greenhouse forcing at the surface reaches the values observed at present. The simulated shortwave radiation budget at the surface is less affected by the increased levels of carbon dioxide than the longwave budget on the globel scale. Regionally and seasonally, the changes in the incoming shortwave radiation at the surface can exceed 20 W m-2, mainly due to changes in cloud amounts. The projected changes, however, are generally of smaller magnitude than the systematic control run at the majority of 720 observation sites. The positive feedback between excessive radiation and surface processes leading to excessive summer dryness and temperatures over continental surfaces in the control run is enhanced in the doubled carbon dioxide experiment, resulting in a massive increase in the projected surface temperature. In the high-resolution T106 time-slice scenario experiment performed in this study the global mean latent heat flux and associated intensity of the hydrological cycle is slightly decreased rather than increased with doubled carbon dioxide. A reduction in surface wind speed in the T106 scenario is suggested as a major factor for the revers of sign. The improved representation of the orography with T106 resolution allows a better estimate of the projected changes of surface energy fluxes in mountain areas, as demonstrated for the European Alps.",,"carbon dioxide increase; climate change; GCM; radiation budget",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031393859

In addition many of these deeps have low oxygen values below sill depths. Warming of such waters could: (1) destabilize existing gas hydrates (clathrates) flashing them into gas and (2) reduce the oxygen capacity of waters below the sill depth. Outgassing could increase the buoyancy, producing upwelling of potentially noxious deep waters into the photic zone and even to the surface where the greeenhouse gases would be added to the atmosphere. We plotted the depth (pressure) and temperatures of Southeast Asian deep basins on a clathrate phase diagram to determine their suceptibility to outgassing and upwelling using a creditable global warming scenario. In general, most of the Indonesian basins are too cold or too deep for any pre-existing clathrates to be destabilized by perceived global warming. However, the Sulu Basin of the Philippines and the Halmahera Basin in Indonesian waters have sill depths in the pycnocline shoal enough and temperatures warm enough potentially to support outgassing and upwelling of basin waters, if water temperatures were raised. The presence of gas hydrates has not been demonstrated in these deeps. Although generally associated with high latitudes, clathrates have been identified in tropical waters off Central America. Accordingly, the proximity of the SouthEast Asian deeps to land and their low oxygen content suggest that tropical plant debris could accumulate and provide sufficient organic matter to generate methane and/or hydrogen sulfide clathrates. Local fisheries initially could be affected adversely by upwelling of anoxic or near anoxic waters into the photic zone. However, in the long term, the anoxic effects would dissipate and the nutrients brought up by the upwelling could increase primary productivity. A major adverse affect would be the introduction of methane into the atmosphere, as that gas has about 20 times the warming potential of carbon dioxide.",,"carbon dioxide; hydrogen sulfide; methane; reducing agent; conference paper; greenhouse effect; indonesia; marine environment; nutrient; philippines; plant; productivity; southeast asia; temperature; water temperature; Carbon dioxide; Degassing; Fisheries; Greenhouse effect; Hydrates; Hydrogen sulfide; Methane; Thermal effects; Anoxic expansion; Clathrates; Global warming; anoxic conditions; deep water; gas hydrates; global warming; methane; outgassing; Asia, (Southeast)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030615623

Information on Finnish biomass resources and use, energy economy and national research policy is provided as background. Global biomass resources and potential energy from biomass markets are also assessed based on available literature, to put the development of the gasification technology into a wider perpective of global biomass utilisation for energy production. The increasing use of biomass and other indigenous forms of energy has been part and parcel of the Finnish energy policy for some twenty years. Biomass and peat account for almost 20% of the production of primary energy in Finland. As the consumption of biofuels is significantly lower than the annual growth or renewal, the use of bioenergy is considered to be an important measure of reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Research and development on thermal gasification of solid fuels was initiated in the late 1970s in Finland. The principal aim was to decrease the dependence of Finnish energy economy on imported oil by increasing the utilisation potential of indigenous fuels. Development in the early 1980s focused on simple atmospheric-pressure fuel gas applications including a gasification heating plant. Eight Bioneer updraft gasifiers (abt 5 MWth) were constructed in 1982 - 1986, and a new Bioneer gasifier was commissioned in eastern Finland in 1996. A Pyroflow circulating fluidised-bed gasifier was also commercialised in the mid-1980s; four gasifiers (15 - 35 MWth) were commissioned. In the late 1980s the interest in integrated gasification combined-cycle (IGCC) power plants, based on pressurised air gasification of biomass and hot gas cleanup, increased in Finland and in many other countries. The utilisation potential for indigenous fuels is mainly in medium-scale combined heat and electricity production (20 - 150 MWe). Foster Wheeler Energia Oy, Carbona Inc. and Imatran Voima Oy are the main gasification technology developers in Finland. In 1993, a biomass IGCC demonstration plant based on Foster Wheeler gasification technology and owned by the Swedish utility company Sydkraft was commissioned in Sweden. The plant is the first combined-cycle plant for generating electricity from fuel gas produced entirely from biomass. Atmospheric-pressure gasification of biomass fuels is a simpler and cheaper technology than pressurised gasification. Co-combustion is a promising new alternative, in which the biomass gasification is integrated to a pulverised coal-fired boiler. The concept will be demonstrated by Foster Wheeler Energia Oy and a municipal power company.","Bioenergy; Biomass; Energy production; Gasification",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8844220645

Within the limitations caused by the hard- and software of the system all parameters such as eluent concentration and flow rate, nebulizer and plasma gas flow, sampling frequency, integration time and the number of simultaneously measured emission lines were optimised.

It is interpreted to be a metamorphosed epigenetic Archean gold deposit. The host rocks form part of a graywacke-shale sequence close to a major regional structure known as the Lily Fault. They are intensely deformed close to the fault with strain partitioned into finely laminated, carbonaceous phyllosilicate-rich units. The bulk geochemistry of the host rocks is dominated by pelitic, ferruginous and quartz-rich fractions mixed in varying proportions. Mineralization is concentrated in rocks composed largely of the pelitic and ferruginous fractions that have prograde metamorphic almandine, biotite, grunerite, magnetite and Fe carbonates. Magnetite-rich rocks were produced by progressive metamorphism of greenalite and/ or siderite and do not reflect 'oxide facies iron formation'. Much of the quartz-rich fraction occurs in deformed and metamorphosed veins associated with the mineralization. Gold is concentrated in the 'Main Reef Zone' immediately adjacent to the Lily Fault. Native gold occurs with arsenopyrite, pyrrhotite, minor chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena and stibnite in association with abundant deformed and metamorphosed veins composed of quartz-albite-grunerite-ankerite-sulfides in graphite-depleted, biotite-grunerite-tourmaline schists and massive grunerite-ankerite rocks. Ultramafic schists in the footwall of the Lily Fault exhibit intense K-CO2 alteration (phlogopite ± dolomite ± calcite) and quartz veining but are essentially barren of gold.

We detect ∼20 supernova remnants at this frequency, which is a much smaller number than we detect at higher frequencies (∼50). We attribute this difference to free-free absorption by ionized gas. We find that seven remnants show low-frequency turnovers in their spectra consistent with free-free absorption. These spectra are similar to the spectrum previously obtained for the brightest, youngest supernova remnant, 41.95+57.5. We find a mean optically thin spectral index of -0.6 and emission measures ∼105 cm-6 pc for the remnants detected at 408 MHz. These emission measures are an order of magnitude smaller than other published values for the central region of M82 and we therefore suggest that the remnants we detect at 408 MHz are embedded within ionized gas towards the near side of the distribution. In addition to the supernova remnants, we detect the extended background in which several regions attributable to free-free absorption by ionized gas can be seen. The most striking is an extended absorption region (∼100 pc across) approximately centred on 41.95+57.5 which may be an H II region photoionized by a cluster of early-type stars. The progenitor of 41.95+57.5 may well have been a member of this cluster. We find one source near the dynamical centre of M82, which we speculate could be a possible candidate for an active galactic nucleus. © 1997 RAS.","Galaxies: individual: M82; Galaxies: starburst; Radio continuum: galaxies; Supernova remnants",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000115976

Most previous studies of sulfur lifetimes, budgets, and scavenging ratios have been based on limited observational data or data from highly simplified models. The Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM2.61) shows some skill in predicting atmospheric mixing ratios of acidic materials and other related trace constituents and acid deposition patterns in North America, and so, analysis of its established, theoretical, database serves as a counterpoint to previous studies of sulfur budgets, lifetimes, and scavenging ratios. The annual budget shows that the net transport (outflow minus inflow) of sulfur compounds out of eastern North America is equal to the total deposition within the domain. Of the total deposition, 63% is from wet deposition and 37% is from dry deposition. The annual average lifetime of sulfur dioxide (38 hours), estimated by the turnover time, is limited by aqueous conversion, while that for sulfate aerosols (54 hours) is limited by their removal in precipitation. The annual average lifetime of sulfur in this domain is slightly more than three days. Episodic lifetimes and budgets, based on particular synoptic situations, show large variations around the annual values. Episodic precipitation scavenging ratios exhibit similar variability and are used to offer explanations of several potential biases found in the wet sulfur deposition amounts as predicted by the EMEP sulfur transport model and other published results.","Eastern North America; Sulfur; Sulfur budgets; Sulfur lifetimes; Sulfur scavenging ratios","sulfur; sulfur dioxide; air pollution; air pollution control; article; data base; dry deposition; north america; pollution transport; time; acid deposition; RADM2.61 model; scavenging ratio; sulphate aerosol; sulphur cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030619733

One apparent implication is that water resources planning methods should be modified accordingly. Few of these studies, however, have attempted to account for either the chain of uncertainty in projecting water resources system vulnerability to climate change, or the adaptability of system operation resulting from existing planning strategies. Major uncertainties in water resources climate change assessments lie in a) climate modeling skill; b) errors in regional downscaling of climate model predictions; and c) uncertainties in future water demands. A simulation study was designed to provide insight into some aspects of these uncertainties. Specifically, the question that is addressed is whether a different decision would be made in a reservoir reallocation decision if knowledge about future climate were incorporated (i.e., would planning based on climate change information be justified?). The case study is possible reallocation of flood storage to conservation (municipal water supply) on the Green River, WA.

The experiments reported here involve measuring the absorption across an open gap between two embedded fibers as it fills with gaseous decomposition products. Spectroscopic detection is achieved using pairs of bandpass filters. The absorption record can be correlated with readings from embedded thermocouples and with a high- resolution video recording of the burn. We have observed N2O, a decomposition product of hexahydro-1, 3, 5-trinitro-1, 3, 5-triazine (RDX) evolving into the observation volume. The N2O appearance is often an abrupt event. Coupled with evidence that it can occur while the observation region is relatively cool and far from the burning surface (observed in cases involving burning at 6 atm pressure), these observations suggest hypotheses concerning the physical processes in the condensed phases of this propellant, hypotheses including the development of pressurized voids or matrix-trapped bubbles, which can release decomposition gases into the unburnt propellant through cracks that suddenly open. The appearance of N2O after the temperature record suggests that melting and decomposition of RDX have begun (observed in 1-atm cases), implies that N2O formation is indeed not an initial step in RDX decomposition under our conditions.",,"cyclonite; nitrous oxide; propellant; article; combustion; decomposition; diagnostic procedure; fiberoscope; priority journal; spectroscopy; temperature measurement; videorecording",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031013190

The mitigation options are water management, soil amendments, organic matter management, different tillage, rotation, and cultivar selection. Altering water management, in particular promoting midseason aeration by short-term drainage, is one of the most promising strategies, although these practices may be limited to the rice paddy fields where the irrigation system is well prepared. Improving organic matter management by promoting aerobic degradation through composting or incorporating into soil during off-season drained period is another most promising candidate. There are several formidable obstacles to adopt the mitigation options into local rice farming, including limited applicability to different types of rice fields, increasing cost and labor, negative effects on rice yield and soil fertility, and time requirement for practical application. Further studies to verify the mitigation options should focus on the feasibility for local farmers. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Cultivar selection; Global warming; Organic matter management; Soil amendments; Water management","environmental management; methanogenesis; rice; emission reduction; methane emission; rice paddy; water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031410678

The use of standard stocks in hot climates may result in large economic losses because genotypes selected in temperate climates may respond differently to the high ambient temperatures in hot regions or seasons. The summer and fall in Izmir, Turkey, provided the natural hot and temperate climates, respectively, for this study. Broiler chicks were obtained from three commercial stocks, all bred in temperate climates. Male and female chicks, 60 per pen, were housed in four pens per stock per season. Individual BW was determined at hatch, and at 4 and 7 wk of age. Feed consumption and efficiency were determined per pen. Feathering was scored at 4, 5, and 6 wk of age. Body temperature was measured twice on three birds per sex per pen, 16 h and immediately before slaughter, and feather weight was determined for each of these birds. The two seasons clearly differed in ambient temperature at the broiler house, and consequently, BW at 7 wk was significantly lower in the summer than in the fall in all stocks, with an average reduction of 23%. The season effect was largest (33.5%) on BW gain from 4 to 7 wk, along with 23 and 15% reductions in feed consumption and efficiency, respectively, during these 3 wk. A significant season by stock interaction was detected for BW gain from 0 to 4 wk and 4 to 7 wk.

The enzyme activity in the cytosol fraction was about twice that in the microsomal fraction and NAD served as the preferred cofactor in both fractions. The enzyme in the cytosol fraction was purified to a homogeneous protein by the use of various chromatographic techniques. The enzyme is a monomeric protein with a molecular weight of 36,000 and an isoelectric point of 6.4. The enzyme had a dual cofactor specificity but NAD was more efficiently utilized than NADP. With NAD, the enzyme showed an optimal pH of 9.4, and the K(m) and V(max) values toward morphine were 0.72 mM and 0.59 unit/mg protein, respectively. The enzyme also exhibited a significant activity for morphine analogs having an unsaturated bond at C-7,8 (codeine, ethylmorphine, and normorphine), alicyclic alcohols (3-hydroxyhexobarbital, 1-indanol, and cyclohexene-2-ol) and benzenedihydrodiol. In the reverse reaction, the enzyme exhibited highly restricted specificity for o-quinones. Sulfhydryl reagents and quercetin inhibited the enzyme but pyrazole, barbital, and indomethacin had little effect on the enzyme activity. Androstanes, lithocholic acid, and estradiol potently inhibited the enzyme in a competitive manner toward morphine binding. The partial amino acid sequence of the random peptides obtained by the proteolytic digestion of the enzyme, which comprised about 40% of the whole protein, revealed a significant homology to the corresponding regions in the members of the aldo-keto reductase family. These results therefore indicate that the present enzyme is a new and unique member of the aldo-keto reductase family.","aldo-keto reductase family; carbonyl reductase; Morphine metabolism; morphinone; rabbit liver morphine 6- dehydrogenase","carbonyl reductase; morphine; morphinone; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; oxidoreductase; amino acid sequence; animal tissue; article; drug metabolism; enzyme analysis; enzyme degradation; enzyme inhibition; enzyme purification; enzyme specificity; enzyme structure; liver cytosol; nonhuman; priority journal; rabbit; sequence homology; synaptosome; Animalia; Oryctolagus cuniculus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031148771

Mean fluxes of N2O decreased appreciably with increasing acidity, whilst NO fluxes showed little dependence on pH, with the highest mean flux from the plot at pH 5.9. Sterilization of soil cores by autoclaving reduced N2O emissions almost to zero at all pH values, but residual production of NO was found, even at low pH. Increasing the pH of unsterilized soil cores from pH 3.9-6.5 ± 0.5 led to a reduction in NO and especially N2O fluxes.

The results obtained from many reports or field data on the forest are that the ecological feature of the forest such as floristic composition or physiognomy is caused by plant migration history, climatic condition, especially coldness during winter season and local topography or soil conditions. It possesses of both essential similarity such as character species and partial dissimilarity such as species combination, compared with that of neighboring southwestern Japan. The significant differences of species combination with varied environmental conditions are found at many stands, even in the cases recognized as the same plant communities by many investigators. According to Yim(1977a), the average value of coldness index at the northern limit of distribution of 11 lucidophyll species in Korea was -6. 3°C. month, and a coldness index value of -8°C.month corresponded to the boundary of evergreen lucidophyll forest on existing vegetation maps. Considering the remaining distribution of lucidophyll forests preserved as natural monument such as Mokdo, Ulsan (coldness index: -9.3°C.month) and Naejangsan, it seems that the critical value of coldness index of - 10°C.month delimits the distribution of lucidophyll forests in Korea (Yim, 1977b). However, in Chejudo the vertical distribution showed 630m in Camellia japonica, and 570m in Castanopsis cuspidata var. sieboldii. And then their limit lines largely correpond to warmth index 95~100°C.month (ca. CI=-4°C.month). It means that in Chejudo the warmth of growing season acts as a more important factor than the coldness of winter season. The maintenance and management system of the forest in this country can be classified into two styles of traditional and modernized ways. While the former is related to spiritual or human nature such as cultural background and people's daily life for survival, the latter mainly depends on the policy and technology for the management of the forest.",,"biodiversity conservation; broad-leaved forest; evergreen forest; floristics; forest management; geographical distribution; Korea(South); Camellia japonica; Castanopsis cuspidata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031413280

This has prompted numerous scientists to: study the environmental fate and transport of methyl bromide; search for replacement chemicals and/or nonchemical alternatives; and develop new methodology which improves containment of methyl bromide (or any alternative fumigant) to the treatment zone, while maintaining adequate pest control.

AAQ suffered substantial fluorescence quenching with red shifts of their λmax in benzene solution upon addition of alcohol and hydroperoxide. Primary alcohols exhibited the largest quenching effects among 26 alcohols examined, while tertiary alcohols were least effective. The Stern-Volmer constants were well correlated with the 13C NMR chemical shift of the carbinol carbon atom and the contact molecular surface area of the hydroxyl hydrogen of the quenchers, while it apparently did not depend upon pKa values. Contact molecular surface area was revealed to be a good quantitative parameter for the steric effect in the intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interaction. The steric factor was dominant in the fluorescence-quenching process, but the electronic factor becomes evident among the molecules having the same steric factor such as benzyl alcohol derivatives, where the Hammet plot showed a good linearity. Fluorescence decay kinetics clearly showed that two emitting levels were involved such as the fluorescent state in benzene and a fully relaxed state in which reorganization of the surrounding alcohol was established. Estimated lifetimes of the fully relaxed states were longer than those in neat alcohol by a factor of 30. The results were interpreted that there were at least two relaxation pathways by alcohol reorganization through the intermolecular hydrogen bond. A specific reorganization of alcohol to AAQ induced relaxation from the fluorescent state in benzene to a relaxed, emissive state and to another relaxed, nonfluorescent state. The latter leads to an efficient radiationless deactivation. The relaxed emissive state corresponds to the excited state of intermolecular hydrogen-bonded species of AAQ with the alcohol in the ground state in which the hydroxyl group of alcohol interacts through an in-plane mode against the carbonyl oxygen of AAQ. Another relaxed nonfluorescent state is formed through an out-of-plane mode interaction between AAQ and the hydroxyl group of alcohol.",,"Alcohols; Aromatic compounds; Electron energy levels; Electron transitions; Fluorescence; Hydrogen bonds; Hydrogen peroxide; Ketones; Reaction kinetics; Aminoanthraquinones; Stern Volmer constants; Molecular dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031244738

I found very high temporal variation in CH4 within each site, precluding the detection of variation in CH4 as a function of sediment or soil organic matter content. In 1994, CH4 efflux from two peat sites to the atmosphere averaged 7 and 87 nmol m-2 s-1 compared to 89 and 408 nmol m-2 s-1 for two sediment sites. Mean CO2 efflux from the peat sites was 0.40 and 1.51 μmol m-2 s-1 compared to 1.02 and 1.65 μmol m-2 s-1 for the sediment sites. I assessed the role of plant production by experimentally removing T. latifolia shoots from small plots: this lowered CH4 efflux from the sediment site by 85%, suggesting that plants foster CH4 production in low organic matter sediment, but CH4 efflux was 14-times greater following shoot removal on one peat site. Shoot removal had no effect on CO2 efflux. Variations in temperature, dissolved organic carbon, and pCH4 in sediment or soil porewater explained the variation in CH4 efflux among the four study sites, whereas variation in net primary production explained the variation in CO2 efflux.","Carbon dioxide; Cattails; Methane; New York; Soil organic matter; Soil respiration; Typha latifolia","Typha latifolia; biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; methane; wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031393261

This knowledge has resulted in improved TBCs that survive severe cyclic fatigue tests in high-output diesel engines. Although much conflicting literature now exists regarding the impact of TBCs on engine performance and fuel consumption, changes in fuel consumption appear to be less than a few percent and can be negative for state-of-the-art diesel engines. The ability of the TBC to improve fuel economy depends on a number of factors, including the fuel injection system, combustion chamber design, and initial engine fuel economy. Limited investigations on state-of-the-art diesel engines have indicated that surface- connected porosity and coating surface roughness may influence engine fuel economy.

The significantly increased plasma concentrations and the resultant AUCT values of M2 in both SHRs and DOCA-salt rats at 16 weeks of age were due to the significantly decreased biliary excretion of M2 and possibly to the increased amount of aldo-keto reductase in the liver.

It contributes to the greenhouse effect and influences the global ozone distribution. Recent reports suggest that regions such as the Arabian Sea may be significant sources of atmospheric N2O. In the ocean, N2O is formed as a by-product of nitrification and as an intermediary of denitrification. In the latter process, N2O can be further reduced to N2. These processes, which operate on different source pools and have different magnitudes of isotopic fractionation, make separate contributions to the 15N and 18O isotopic composition of N2O. In the case of nitrification in oxic waters, the isotopic composition of N2O appears to depend mainly on the 15N/14N ratio of NH4/+ and the 18O/16O ratio of O2 and H2O. In suboxic waters, denitrification causes progressive 15N and 18O enrichment of N2O as a function of degree of depletion of nitrate and dissolved oxygen. Thus the isotopic signature of N2O should be a useful tool for studying the sources and sinks for N2O in the ocean and its impact on the atmosphere. We have made observations of N2O concentrations and of the dual stable isotopic composition of N2O in the eastern tropical North Pacific (ETNP) and the Arabian Sea. The stable isotopic composition of N2O was determined by a new method that required only 80-100 nmol of N2O per sample analysis. Our observations include determinations across the oxic/suboxic boundaries that occur in the water columns of the ETNP and Arabian Sea. In these suboxic waters, the values of δ15N and δ18O increased linearly with one another and with decreasing N2O concentrations, presumably reflecting the effects of denitrification. Our results suggest that the ocean could be an important source of isotopically enriched N2O to the atmosphere.","Arabian Sea; continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry; denitrification; dual isotopic composition of N2O; eastern tropical North Pacific; nitrification; nitrous oxide (N2O)","air-sea interaction; isotopic composition; nitrous oxide; Arabian Sea; Pacific, (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031104914

The addition of 7.4 mol % methanol to the SC CO2 phase resulted in 2-11-fold reductions in Freundlich capacity factors at 120 atm and 50 °C. The capacity reduction greatly exceeded that expected from the 21% increase in phenanthrene solubility accompanying cosolvent addition. Isotherms became more linear at 120 atm and 50 °C upon methanol addition for all sorbents except a shale sample. Solubility and organic carbon-normalized phenanthrene sorption capacities declined with increasing solvent polarity, in the order dry SC CO2 &gt; methanol-amended SC CO2 &gt; aqueous solution, and declined with sorbent organic carbon content. Sorption enthalpies from an ideal gas reference state ranged from -106 to -70 kJ/mol, similar to phenanthrene's heat of condensation of -70.7 kJ/mol. The results indicate that the primary mechanism for polar cosolvent desorption enhancement is competitive displacement of phenanthrene from polar sites within soil organic matter or on mineral surfaces.",,"phenanthrene; adsorption; article; enthalpy; pollution transport; sediment; soil; solubility; aquifer; carbon dioxide; desorption; organic matter; phenanthrene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030617033

The research in this paper also uses the link travel time data collected from the selected coordinated traffic signals in the city of Houston to demonstrate the difference between the new technique and the traditional method for determining the platoon dispersion parameter values. If the proposed technique can be incorporated into a traffic responsive signal control system where the platoon dispersion parameters are calibrated from the real-time link travel time statistics, the predictions of the platoon dispersions can then be made site specific and more accurate, the traffic signal timings can be better optimized, and the total delays, stops, fuel consumption and emissions can be further reduced.",,"Calibration; Control systems; Statistical methods; Traffic signals; Link travel time; Traffic management; Traffic platoon dispersions; Traffic control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030672051

Another immediate priority acknowledged by these nations is the need for development of adaptation policies that plan for adjustment or adaptation, where possible, to the foreshadowed impacts of climate change. This article does not focus on adaptation or mitigation policy directly but on an allied opportunity that exists for the Pacific Islands via the auspices of the Climate Convention, because the existing very costly energy systems used in the Pacific Island region are fossil-fuel dependent. It is argued here that efforts can be made towards the development of energy systems that are ecologically sustainable because Pacific Island nations are eligible to receive assistance to introduce renewable energy technology and pursue energy conservation via implementation mechanisms of the Climate Convention and, in particular, through transfer of technology and via joint implementation. It is contended that assistance in the form of finance, technology, and human resource development from developed countries and international organizations would provide sustainable benefits in improving the local Pacific Island environments.

At an early stage of CVD, each round Ni particle with a diameter of about 30 nm is covered with graphite layers. The graphite-covered Ni particle is considered to be unstable because the graphite layers have a large curvature. This instability is thought to make the graphite-covered Ni particles transform into a Ni bar enclosed within a carbon nanotube. In order to verify this nucleation model, we show that the size of the round Ni particle is a decisive condition for carbon nanotube formation by CVD, and that an intermediate state of the transformation of the graphite-covered Ni particles to the carbon-nanotube-enclosed Ni bar was observed by transmission electron microscopy. © 1997 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000763602

We hypothesized that the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on soil moisture and plant biomass production would increase earthworm activity, expressed as surface cast production. Using a screen-aided CO2 control facility (open top and open bottom rings), eight 1.2-m2 grassland plots in Switzerland have been maintained since March 1994 at ambient CO2 concentrations (350 μl CO2 1-1) and eight at elevated CO2 (610 μl CO2 1-1. Cumulative earthworm surface cast production measured 40 times over 1 year (April 1995-April 1996) in plots treated with elevated CO2 (2206 g dry mass m-2 year-1) was 35% greater (P&lt;0.051 than that measured in plant communities maintained at ambient CO2 (1633 g dry mass m-2 year-1). At these rates of surface cast production, worms would require about 100 years to egest the equivalent of the amount of soil now found in the Ah horizon (top 15 cm) under current ambient CO2 concentrations, and 75 years trader elevated CO2. Elevated atmospheric CO2 had no influence on the seasonality of earthworm activity. Cumulative surface cast production measured over the 7-week period immediately following the 6-week summer dry period in 1995 (no surface casting) was positively correlated (P&lt;0.05) with the mean soil water content calculated over this dry and subsequent wetter period, when viewed across nil treatments. However, no correlations were observed with soil temperature or with annual aboveground plant biomass productivity. No CO2-related differences were observed in total nitrogen (N(tot)) and organic carbon (C(org)) concentration of surface casts, although concentrations of both elements varied seasonally. The CO2-induced increase in earthworm surface casting activity corresponded to a 30% increase of the amount of N(tot) (8.9 mg N m-2 vs. 6.9 mg N m-2) and C(org) (126 mg C m-2 vs. 94 mg (7 m-2) egested by the worms in one year. Thus, our results demonstrate an important indirect stimulatory effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 on earthworm activity which may have profound effects on ecosystem function and plant community structure in the long term.","Carbon dioxide enrichment; Cast C and N; Cast production; Lumbricidae; Producer-consumer interactions","calcareous grassland; carbon dioxide enrichment; cast production; earthworm; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030860535

These properties can be dramatically affected by the introduction of a 6-methyl substituent on the pendant pyridines of the tetradentate ligand TPA (TPA = tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine). A series of Fe(TPA) complexes has thus been synthesized and characterized to provide the structural basis for these dramatic effects. The following complexes have been obtained: [Fe(L)(CH3CN)2](ClO4)2 (1, L = TPA; 2, L = 6-MeTPA; 3, L = 6-Me2TPA; 4, L = 6-Me3TPA) and [Fe(L)(acac)](ClO4)2 (5, L = TPA; 6, L = 5-Me3TPA; 7, L = 6-MeTPA). As indicated by 1H NMR and/or EPR, 1, 5, and 6 with no 6-methyl substituent are low spin, while complexes 2, 3, 4, and 7 with at least one 6- methyl substituent are all high spin, with higher redox potentials than their low-spin counterparts. The ligands with 6-methyl substituents thus favor a metal center with a larger ionic radius, i.e., Fe11 over Fe(III) and high spin over low spin. Careful scrutiny of the crystal structures of 1, 4, 6, and 7 reveals that one hydrogen of the 6-methyl group is only 2.7 Å away from the metal center in the high-spin complexes. Its presence thus prevents the pyridine nitrogen from forming an Fe-N bond shorter than 2.1 Å as required for an iron center to adopt a low-spin configuration. This steric effect of the 6-methyl substituent serves as a simple but very useful ligand design tool to tune the electronic properties of the metastable alkylperoxoiron(III) species derived from the reactions of 1-4 with tert- butyl hydroperoxide. These intermediates serve as models for low-spin and high-spin peroxoiron(III) species in the reaction cycles of the antitumor drag bleomycin and lipoxygenase, respectively. Similar principles apply in the design of nonheme diiron(II) complexes that reversibly bind dioxygen and of high-valent bis(μ-oxo)diiron complexes that model the high-valent intermediates in the redox cycles of nonberne diiron enzymes such as methane monooxygenase and ribonucleotide reductase.",,"bleomycin; heme derivative; iron derivative; lipoxygenase; ribonucleotide reductase; unspecific monooxygenase; article; crystal structure; crystallography; oxidation reduction potential; oxidation reduction reaction; protein analysis; protein synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030960721

The two cases illustrate a broad realm of possible effects and actions facing continental shorelines. The climate change issue is primarily centered around sea level rise in Vietnam but has been expanded to other domains in Poland. General ICM issues are treated under the action plan Vietnam ICM 2000,1 and a central Vietnam coast at Hue is considered for its ICM potentials. GIS-aided techniques are employed in both countries to solve vulnerability problems and prepare for ICM. Sea-level rise scenarios, 10 cm (SLR1) and 30 cm (SLR2) by the year 2030, and 30 cm (ASLR1) and 100 cm (ASLR2) by the year 2100, are assumed as boundary conditions (along with some wind climate changes) for the entire Polish coast. Over 2200 km2 and 230 000 people are found vulnerable in Poland, and the total cost of land at loss due to ASLR2 is presently re-assessed at nearly US$30 billion (plus some US$18 billion at risk of flooding), while the cost of full protection reaches US$6 billion. Growing prices urge for prompt protection actions. Physical and socioeconomic development scenarios are examined and the coastal data input is provided for other Polish climate-change studies that are under way, thus adding to the cross-sectoral dimension. With l-m sea-level rise in Vietnam, 17 million people will be subject to annual flooding, of which over 14 million are in the Mekong Delta provinces. About US$17 billion of capital value will be lost by annual flooding, which is about 80% of the yearly GDP. In the 30-year development scenario, the capital value lost will be close to US$270 billion, which would be even higher than the projected GDP at that time; the damage increases faster than the GDP Major low-lying areas will be subject to increase in flooding: and, if no additional protection measures are taken, about 40 000 km2 will be flooded annually.The continental shorelines of Poland and Vietnam are studied in the context of their vulnerability to climate change, present and planned response strategies, and steps toward integrated coastal management (ICM).

Of the climatic factors, E was most sensitive to changes in vapor pressure, and T to changes in irradiance.

Animal habitats are shrinking and the number of animals is decreasing. The largest desert oilfield in China with a capacity of 2 million tons per year is under development. We develop oilfields with environmental concern. As a result the development of the oilfield did not cause any damage to the environment. On the contract a favourable change took place such as natural vegetation rehabilitation in the area with a high water table and the reappearance of special birds and their numbers increased. We were able to obtain such a result by undertaking the following measures: - well organised environmental protection group and adherence to national Law and national or CNPC standards; - waste water and produced water treated in a central plant, treated water re-injection or used for irrigation; - utilisation of centralised heating system, emission control technique and associated gas recovery technology for pollution control and energy saving; - sand prevention and sand control measure along the desert highway; - construct an engineering demonstration of artificial Greenland and ecological areas in the hinter land; - carrying on some measures to protect wild animals.

The spectrum is phase sensitive. The effects of different statistics of the initial cavity mode are reported. For the cavity mode in a coherent state, one of the sidebands in the atomic emission spectrum can be reduced whilst the other can be enhanced due to the virtual photon transitions.

The relationships between these solid phases and the nature of the water interactions in their structures were studied through characterization by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Karl Fischer titrimetry (KFT), hot-stage microscopy (HSM), ambient-or variable-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) spectroscopy, water uptake at various relative humidities (RH), intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR) and solubility measurements. The solubility and intrinsic dissolution raze of the pentahydrate in water at 25 °C are ~17% greater than the corresponding values for the 8/3 hydrate, corresponding to a greater Gibbs free energy of only 380 J · mol-1 (91 cal · mol-1) for the pentahydrate. The results of DSC, TGA, and FTIR and SSNMR spectroscopy indicate that the water of hydration is more loosely bound in the pentahydrate than in the 8/3 hydrate. On increasing the temperature in open-pan DSC and TGA, the water in the pentahydrate is released in four steps (three steps in crimped pans), whereas the water in the 8/3 hydrate is released in three steps (three steps also in crimped pans). These three stepwise dehydrations are fundamentally explained by their different water environments in the crystal structure of the 8/3 hydrate, which was determined by single-crystal XRD [crystal data: triclinic, space group P1, a = 13.2381(3) Å, b = 13.3650(2) Å, c = 17.8224(2) Å, α = 68.202-(1)°,β = 86.894(1)°, γ= 82.969(1)°, Z = 6]. The asymmetric unit contains three nedocromil anions and three calcium cations associated with eight water molecules. The nedocromil anions act as polyfunctional ligands to the Ca2+ ions, coordinating through both the carbonyl oxygen and the carboxylate oxygen atoms. The molecular conformations of the three nedocromil anions in the asymmetric unit are almost identical. However, the crystal structure contains two different calcium environments, one of which has the Ca2+ ion hydrated by four water molecules in the equatorial plane ann by two carbonyl oxygens in its axial coordination sites. In the second environment, the Ca2+ ion has four carboxylate oxygen atoms in its equatorial plane and two water molecules in its axial coordination sites. Two of the carboxylate ligands are twisted out of the tricyclic ring, and the other two carboxylate ligands are nearly coplanar with the tricyclic ring. All of the eight water molecules in the 8/3 hydrate are linked to calcium and carboxylate ions and none are linked to other water molecules.",,"calcium chloride; calcium ion; carboxylic acid derivative; divalent cation; ligand; metal; nedocromil sodium; water; article; crystal structure; differential scanning calorimetry; drug solubility; hydration; infrared spectroscopy; ligand binding; physical chemistry; solid state; thermogravimetry; titrimetry; X ray diffraction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031445302

At the International Rice Research Institute, rice (cv. IR 72) was grown from germination until maturity for the 1994 wet and 1995 dry seasons at three different CO2 concentrations (ambient, ambient + 200, and ambient + 300 μL L-1 CO2) and two different air temperatures (ambient and ambient + 4°C) using open-top field chambers. Averaged for both seasons, increases in CO2 concentration alone (+200, +300 μL L-1) resulted in a significant increase in total plant biomass (+31%, +40%) and crop yield (+15%, +27%) compared with the ambient control. The increase in crop yield was associated with an increase in the number of particles per square meter and a greater percentage of filled spikelets. Simultaneous increases in CO2 and air temperature did not alter the biomass at maturity (relative to elevated CO2 alone), but plant development was accelerated at the higher growth temperature regardless of CO2 concentration. Grain yield, however, became insensitive to CO2 concentration at the higher growth temperature. Increasing both CO2 and air temperature also reduced grain quality (e.g., protein content). The combination of CO2 and temperature effects suggests that, in warmer regions (i.e., &gt;34°C) where rice is grown, quantitative and qualitative changes in rice supply are possible if both CO2 and air temperature continue to increase.",,"Oryza sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030896340

A simple steady-state countercurrent reactor model that is capable of describing the influence of adiabatic temperature rise and heat transfer properties of the fixed bed of catalyst on mean reactant conversion and temperature profile in cycle steady state is proposed. Generally, the agreement between calculated and experimentally determined parameters is satisfying.

In response the fate of VOCs at drop structures has been studied. The study described herein involved two major components. First, 64 pilot experiments were conducted to study the effects of drop height, liquid flow rate, and tail water depth on oxygen transfer. Second, 15 additional experiments were completed to determine the effects of the same parameters on the stripping of a cocktail comprising 10 volatile tracers. Headspace ventilation rates, chemical properties, and the differences between clean water and raw wastewater on VOC stripping were studied. Results suggest that oxygen is a useful surrogate for VOC measurements as both oxygen and VOC mass transfer were observed to be highly dependent on drop height and less on liquid flow rate. Stripping efficiencies for VOCs were observed to vary between 0.5 and 32% depending upon specific compounds and experimental conditions. VOC stripping was also observed to be greater from clean water as compared to wastewater. Gas liquid mass transfer of VOCs was seen to be a strong function of Henry's law coefficient suggesting the occurrence of gas-phase mass transfer resistance.","emissions; mass transfer; oxygen; VOCs; wastewater","volatile organic compound; air monitoring; air pollution; article; priority journal; sewage; water flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030906356

The forthcoming millennium will set new demands for more energy production at lower cost and reduced environmental impact. Ecological problems have become more severe primarily because of steadily increasing CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning plants, including those used for power production, transport, and industry. The ultimate global warming effect can cause dangerous climatic changes on Earth. Steadily increasing emissions of other atmospheric pollutants such as sulfur and nitrogen oxides are also very damaging to the environment. Therefore reduction of all emissions from the energy sector is of the utmost importance. These concerns create new challenges in the area of energy technology. The existing power production technology cannot fulfill these requirements in the most sensitive areas of efficiency and pollutant emissions. At present, energy technology is marked by tremendous efforts aimed at achieving higher efficiencies in energy conversion with reduced environmental impact and at lower costs. Therefore advanced energy systems that have been developed in the last decades become mature contenders to the conventional energy technology based predominantly on coal-fired central steam power stations. Although conventional energy technologies have been consistently improving in terms of efficiency, economics, and reduction of environmental impact in the last decade, modern power stations have achieved the ultimate degree of intrinsically limited efficiency. Further improvements are possible only by revolutionary changes of the energy technology. The 21st century will drastically change energy production and will become the era of more efficient combined power plants. The development trends are directed at the changeover from basically steam power technology to combined-cycle power based on such plants as gas turbines, fuel cells, MHD generators, as well as the advanced energy systems based on the utilization of renewable energy sources. The book deals with all those advanced energy systems that have reached a sufficiently mature state of development to conform to the requirement for commercial application before the end of this century. These are predominantly combined-cycle gas turbine and steam turbine power plants, various improved gas turbine configurations, second- and third-generation gas turbines with intercooling, reheat, water/steam injection, air-conditioning, etc., coal-based low-emission power systems such as integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and fluidized bed combustion (including second-generation pressurized bed combustion, i.e., PFBC), means of reduction of environmental impact of energy systems, low-emission combustors and furnaces, advanced cogeneration plants, advanced solar and wind systems, as well as advanced energy storage systems.",,"energy; fluidized bed; gas turbine; pollution; power supply",Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031430298

In order to prevent pollution and protect nature, Spain has developed modern environmental legislation and regulations, creating a Ministry of the Environment (MMA) in 1996 and granting the autonomous regions and municipalities wide responsibilities for the implementation of environmental policy. Yet this policy has been hampered by heavy reliance on subsidies, government transfers and other forms of aid. Despite the progress, water is a constraint on sustainable development in certain regions. Overpumping is depleting aquifers, and consumption patterns are preventing them from being used rationally. With regard to air management, sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions have shown a decreasing trend in the 1990s, and concentrations of SO2 and particulates have decreased through sulphur reduction in fuel, a shift away from coal, and emission regulations. But Spain needs to make further efforts, because emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have increased continuously despite stabilisation and reduction targets. The study shows that the Spanish population is exposed to relatively high noise levels, especially in urban areas. It highlights that Spain's emphaisis on road-building and its policy to encourage diesel-fuelled vehicles have only intensified environmental pressures. In certain autonomous regions uncontrolled landfilling still accounts for over half the volume of solid waste. Capacity for treatment and disposal of hazardous waste is insufficient. Little progress has been made on waste prevention. Spain has adopted general aims and modern legislation in order to conserve its vast biological diversity, in terms of species and habitats. The report notes that the proportion of its territory benefiting from protection has grown significantly over the last decade, but it stresses that much remains to be done to extend the area protected and make that protection more effective. As for integration of environmental concerns in other policies, Spain has been progressing slowly. In spite of the success achieved, the mechanisms of integration among sectors are not yet fully effective. Spain also needs to increase consultation with the autonomous regions with regard to proposed European directives, and to strengthen the responsibilities of lower levels of government, while ensuring adequate funding. In the area of international co-operation, Spain is party to numerous international agreements aimed at managing common problems, notably in the area of surface and marine waters.",,"environmental protection; national performance; nature conservation; policy evaluation; Spain",Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0030733227
