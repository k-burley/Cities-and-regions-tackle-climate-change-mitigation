In the current study, we developed an applicable granular composite based on a flocculant commonly employed for drinking water treatment adsorbed to montmorillonite. DOM adsorption from surface waters, Lake Kinneret and Suwannee River, with low and high specific ultraviolet absorption (SUVA), respectively, by composite and GAC columns, was studied. Adsorption of DOM from Suwannee River was significantly higher by the composite column, in comparison to the GAC column, while an opposite trend was obtained for the adsorption of DOM from Lake Kinneret. In-situ regeneration of the columns with a brine solution was extremely efficient and inefficient for the composite and GAC columns, respectively. Adsorption, of both waters, post-regeneration by the composite column was not compromised, while GAC effectiveness decreased. The opposite trend in DOM adsorption from Suwannee River and Lake Kinneret was explained by the different affinities of the sorbents towards various DOM molecules. Distinguishing between different DOM components adsorbed by GAC and the composite was supported by 13C NMR and direct pyrolysis-GC-MS measurements. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the kinetics and adsorption at the equilibrium of five organic molecules to the composite and GAC can be correlated to their chemical-physical properties. Indeed, combining the properties of both sorbents, by integrating them into a single column, yielded higher DOM removal than by the individual columns. Furthermore, since DOM removal by GAC and by the composite, increases, and decreases with temperature, respectively, the integrated column, mitigates the changes in removal, stabilizing the adsorption performance. Such an integrated filter may minimize additional seasonal and water quality fluctuations. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Dissolved organic matter; Filtration; Granules; Polymer-clay composite; Surface water","Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Biogeochemistry; Granular materials; Lakes; Molecules; Organic compounds; Potable water; Rivers; Sorbents; Water quality; Adsorption performance; Chemical-physical properties; Dissolved organic matters; Granular activated carbons; Granular composites; Integrated filter; Quality fluctuations; Ultraviolet absorption; Adsorption; activated carbon; dissolved organic matter; drinking water; montmorillonite; polymer; river water; surface water; charcoal; organic compound; adsorption; composite; detection method; dissolved organic matter; drinking water; physicochemical property; pollutant removal; surface water; water quality; water treatment; Article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; filtration; light absorption; priority journal; pyrolysis; pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry; seasonal variation; waste component removal; water absorption; water quality; water treatment; zeta potential; adsorption; kinetics; water management; water pollutant; Israel; Northern District; Sea of Galilee; Suwannee River; United States; Adsorption; Charcoal; Kinetics; Organic Chemicals; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085767420

In this work, we present an approach to analyze various carbonaceous samples with different degrees of coalification (one peat and five coals) using laser desorption/ionization in negative ion mode (LDI(-)) and ultrahigh resolving Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. This preparation and analysis method enables a characterization of reactive organic molecules in their native state, without a need for excessive sample preparation or processing. By combining ultrahigh resolving mass spectrometry with different chemometric analyses, an in-depth characterization of the analyzed peat and coal samples was possible, and a correlation between the mass spectra and the degree of coalification of each sample could be verified. As a proof of concept, various analytical standard molecules were analyzed at increasing laser powers to demonstrate that the detected coal-related molecules are actually contained in the samples and were not simply formed by fragmentation reactions during the LDI process. Overall, the direct analysis method presented is a time-saving alternative to analyze complex organic solid samples of all kinds by mass spectrometry.

We aim to understand the role of seed banks as potential buffers against climatic uncertainty determined by climate change. Methods: We examined germination strategies of 18 common species present along an aridity gradient. Data were obtained from soil seed banks germinated during nine consecutive years from arid, semi-arid, Mediterranean and mesic Mediterranean ecosystems. At the semi-arid and Mediterranean sites, rainfall manipulations simulating 30% drought and 30% rainfall increase were applied. Germination strategies were tested under optimal irrigation conditions during three consecutive germination seasons to determine overall seed germinability in each soil sample. Changes in germination strategy were examined using a novel statistical approach that considers the climatic and biotic factors that may affect seed germinability. Important Findings: The results showed that dominant species controlled their germination fractions by producing seeds with a different yearly germination fraction probability. The amount of rainfall under which the seeds were produced led to two major seed types with respect to germinability: high germinability, seeds leading to transient seed banks, and low germinability, seeds leading to persistent seed banks. We conclude that differential seed production among wet and dry years of both seed types creates a stable balance along the aridity gradient, enabling the soil seed bank to serve as a stabilizing mechanism buffering against rainfall unpredictability. Additionally, we present a general model of germination strategies of dominant annual species in Mediterranean and arid ecosystems that strengthens the notion of soil seed banks as buffers against climatic uncertainty induced by climate change in the region. © 2020 The Author(s).","Climate change; Desert; Drought; Mediterranean; Rainfall manipulations; Seed bank",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097170564

O'Neill, School of Public and Environmental Affairs, Indiana University Bloomington, United States","We use data from US power plants and a regression based approach to empirically estimate the marginal rate of co-pollutant emission reductions resulting from a mass-based carbon reduction policy for electricity producers. The standard approach to estimating co-pollutant reductions uses Linear Programming Models. These models require millions of input variables and constraints, resulting in long computational times and an opaque simulation process, while yielding only point estimates for key variables of interest. Our regression-based approach has far fewer data requirements, needs less computational resources, and produces estimates with confidence intervals that capture estimation uncertainty. Moreover, it is straightforward and transparent to implement and provides a larger range of potential outcomes for policy makers to consider. Our results indicate that a 1% decrease in electricity output from coal (gas) power plants would reduce SO2 by 0.6% and NOx by 0.8% (0.7%). These are not statistically significant different than estimates reported by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We estimate that reducing electricity output enough to reduce CO2 emissions by one ton yields health benefits of $15.33 from NOx reductions and $59.64 from SO2 reductions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Co-pollutants; Electricity generation; Health co-benefits","Climate change; Electric utilities; Emission control; Environmental Protection Agency; Linear programming; Nitrogen oxides; Power plants; Climate change policies; Computational resources; Computational time; Confidence interval; Electricity producers; Estimation uncertainties; Linear programming models; Simulation process; Uncertainty analysis; climate change; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy policy; linear programing; numerical model; policy making; regression analysis; standardization; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088034239

In this study, we investigated the exposure status of ozone pollution and the temperature distribution in an air-conditioned bus in Jinan during the evening peak period based on field measurements obtained with a handheld portable particle counter and indigo disulfonate spectrophotometry. Statistical analysis showed that the passengers experienced poor air quality within the confines of the bus due to the poor air quality outside. Furthermore, the level of passenger comfort was dissatisfactory because of the high temperature, thereby highlighting the urgent need to improve the current situation. Numerical simulations were conducted using FLUENT software to explore the impacts of the air supply angle, the opening and closing of the bus door, and the chemical reaction between ozone and its precursors on the diffusion and distribution of ozone, the temperature, and the airflow field. The results indicated that high concentrations of ozone were present in the middle and front regions of the bus. Pollution can be reduced by keeping the bus door open for no longer than 20 s when waiting for other passengers, and the best optimization effect in relation to the temperature and passenger comfort was determined as an air supply angle of 30°. In addition, the average individual daily intake of ozone was combined with other relevant parameters to assess the exposure level. It is recommended that the elderly and children should avoid peak time travel to reduce their exposure to ozone (inhalation dose values &gt; 60 μg/m3 and &gt; 56 μg/m3 according to simulations, respectively). These findings are expected to effectively improve the air quality and passenger comfort levels in busses, thereby protecting the health of passengers and reducing carbon usage. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Air conditioning operation optimization; Artificial environment; Numerical simulation; Ozone exposure and prediction assessment; Passenger comfort","Air conditioning; Air quality; Air pollution in chinas; Current situation; Field measurement; Ground-level ozone; Microenvironments; Optimization effects; Ozone and its precursors; Passenger comfort; Ozone; ozone; ozone; air conditioning; air quality; atmospheric pollution; bus transport; ozone; pollution exposure; source apportionment; traffic emission; air conditioning; air quality; airflow; Article; carbon source; chemical reaction; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; diffusion; environmental exposure; field study; geographic distribution; high temperature; human; mathematical computing; microenvironment; precursor; simulation; spectrophotometry; statistical analysis; temperature; time factor; traffic pollution; traffic safety; aged; air conditioning; air pollutant; air pollution; child; environmental monitoring; motor vehicle; China; Aged; Air Conditioning; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Child; China; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Motor Vehicles; Ozone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087734988

However, reviews on improvement/efficiency and the scope of such reductions by soil, management, climate, and hydrological processes are limited. Methods: This paper synthesized the available evidence on the reduction in surface runoff, soil erosion, nutrient, and pollutant losses (e.g., herbicides, pesticides, and antibiotics) to quantify the effectiveness of agroforestry systems on water quality improvement based on published studies. Results: On average, agroforestry systems reduced surface runoff, soil, organic carbon, and related nutrient losses by 1–100%, 0–97%, –175–92%, and –265–100%, respectively, with average values of 58%, 65%, 9%, and 50%, respectively. They also lowered herbicide, pesticide, and other pollutant losses by –55–100% (49% on average). Conclusions: Reduction efficiency of agroforestry systems is site-dependent and varies widely depending on different biophysical factors. A comprehensive science-based review is needed to generalize agroforestry design and site adaptability for water and soil conservation where climatic, geographical, ecological, and socio-economic conditions are relatively similar in the world. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Agroforestry practice; Nutrient capture; Root system; Soil erosion; Water contamination","agricultural land; agroforestry; nutrient loss; pesticide residue; reduction; runoff; soil conservation; soil erosion; soil management; soil pollution; water pollution; water quality; water use efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076199881

SC-CO2 fracturing has advantages of the complicated fracture network, low formation pollution, and methane replacement on account of its good performance of permeability, anhydrous fracturing fluid, less chemical additives, and solubility. Technical features and research state of SC-CO2 fracturing were discussed in this paper. Key issues in the application of SC-CO2 fracturing was summarized in the following aspects: Flow laws of SC-CO2 in the wellbore and fracture need to be lucubrated to provide a basis for fracturing design; Interactions between formation rock and SC-CO2 need to be studied to find the Fracture propagation laws; The proppant-carrying laws need to be explained clearly to form better support effect of the fracture; Effective CO2 tackifier and ultra-light proppant need to be found to improve the proppant-carrying capacity; SC-CO2 source and fracturing devices should be further considered to reduce the cost, increase the efficiency ensure production safety of SC-CO2 fracturing. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Additives; Fracturing fluids; Oil wells; Planning; Proppants; Supercritical fluid extraction; Sustainable development; Chemical additive; Enhance oil recoveries; Fracture propagation; Fracturing design; Production safety; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Technical features; Unconventional gas; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091258684

This study integrated a Copula-based Bayesian Model Averaging (CBMA) and multiple deterministic artificial neural networks (ANNs) to make accurate ensemble probabilistic PM2.5 forecasts. The new approach (CBMA), has a flexible structure that grants the posterior distribution to have any shape owing to the Copula function. The CBMA approach could remove the data transformation and bias correction procedures as it is done in the original BMA, which was taken as the benchmark. The air quality in Taipei City of Taiwan was selected as a study case to evaluate the applicability and reliability of the proposed approach. Three kinds of air quality monitoring stations denoted heavy traffic loads, intensive commercial trading and human intervention, and a natural circumstance with fewer human activities respectively. The forecasts of PM2.5 concentrations were regarded as a math function involving meteorological and air quality variables, using long-term (2010–2018) hourly observational datasets. Firstly, four deterministic ANN models were established and evaluated to provide inputs for ensemble forecasting. Then, the two post-processing techniques (i.e. CBMA and BMA) were employed to produce ensemble probabilistic forecasts based on the forecasts obtained from multiple ANN models. The results demonstrated that the CBMA not only could outperform the BMA but also could provide a practical and reliable approach as a complement to multiple deterministic ANN models to create ensemble probabilistic forecasts. From horizons t+1 up to t+4, the CBMA approach could drive up the Containing Ratio (CR) values by 3.12% ˗ 9.58% as well as reduce the average Relative Band-width (RB) values by 8.63% ˗ 34.48% and the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) values by 7.62% ˗ 32.89%, in comparison with the BMA one. Consequently, the predictive uncertainty could be alleviated while model reliability and PM2.5 forecast accuracy could be considerably increased. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Bayesian model averaging (BMA); Copula function; Ensemble forecast; Uncertainty","Air quality; Bayesian networks; Digital storage; Flexible structures; Functions; Metadata; Neural networks; Quality control; Air quality forecasts; Air quality monitoring stations; Bayesian model averaging; Continuous ranked probability scores; Post-processing techniques; Posterior distributions; Predictive uncertainty; Probabilistic forecasts; Forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083293254

Compared to traditional statistical method, radiocarbon (14C) offers a different approach to quantify atmospheric CO2 derived from fossil fuel emissions. Here, we carry out a multi-year (2011–2016) CO2ff tracing by 14C in Xi'an, and a three-year (2014–2016) CO2ff tracing in 15 Chinese cities. The Xi'an results show that average CO2ff concentrations fell 35.9 ± 6.6% from 2014– 2016, compared to 2011–2013, and the timing of this decrease coincides with the implementation of nationwide carbon reduction measures in China, known as the Action Plan on Prevention and Control of Air Pollution. A WRF-Chem forward modeling simulation reveals that the CO2ff in Xi'an is mainly derived from local sources, and a source apportionment combined stable-carbon isotope showed that the CO2ff in this city is dominated by coal combustion (72.6 ± 10.4%). Strong CO2ff differences are found between January and July in most Chinese cities. High CO2ff concentrations often correspond to severe haze episodes and there are generally positive correlations between CO2ff and fine particulate (PM2.5) concentrations. Our study provides scientific data to understand the effects of CO2ff reduction strategies in China that can be applied to other countries as well. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon reduction; Cities; Fossil fuel CO2; PM2.5; Radiocarbon","Air pollution control; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Fine particulates; Fossil fuel emissions; International community; Positive correlations; Prevention and controls; Reduction strategy; Source apportionment; Stable carbon isotopes; Fossil fuels; carbon 14; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; isotope; carbon emission; coal combustion; concentration (composition); emission control; emission inventory; fossil fuel; radiometric method; stable isotope; urban atmosphere; Article; China; combustion; concentration (parameter); correlational study; particulate matter; priority journal; seasonal variation; simulation; trend study; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083893864

This paper considers China’s pilot ETS launched in 2013 as a quasi-natural experiment. Exploring provincial industrial-level data that are more in line with the ETS coverage, the difference-in-difference-in-difference (DDD) model is used to evaluate the impact of the ETS on carbon productivity. Considering different pilot regions and industries, we also analyze the heterogeneous effect of ETS. Moreover, the mediating effects of technical progress and capital investment are explored. We find that China’s pilot ETS boosted carbon productivity. Among pilot regions, the best policy effectiveness appeared in Beijing, while the weakest effectiveness appeared in Chongqing. Among the pilot industries, the pilot ETS had better effectiveness in petrochemical and electric power industries and weaker effectiveness in building materials and transportation industries. Additionally, the pilot ETS promoted carbon productivity through both technological progress and capital investment, and the former contributed more. Our findings can provide empirical references and policy implications for nationwide implementation of ETS to further promote low-carbon economic transformation. © 2020 by the authors.

Surprisingly, with the increasing concentration of Eu3+:Y2O3 nanocrystals, the photoluminescence of Eu3+:Y2O3/g-C3N4 (EYCN) showed a continuous red shift in comparison with pure g-C3N4 from blue to green.

However, the uncertainty of the effect of recirculation under different feedstock restricts the application of recirculation technology. In this study, the comprehensive effects of straw to manure feeding ratios and liquid digestate recirculation on anaerobic digestion performance and microbial community structure were investigated. Recirculation was beneficial for biomethane production and digestion stability in digesters of corn stalk and straw/manure 3:1 by alleviating the loss of ammonia and alkalinity, while it aggravated the accumulation of ammonia and organic acids and reduced methane yield under 1:1, 1:3 and pig manure. The feeding ratios and recirculation formed a combined effect on ammonia concentration in the fermentation system, and when the total ammonia concentration was above 1500 mg/L, acids accumulation and decline in methane production would occur whether with recirculation or not. The microbial community structure varied corresponding to the fermentation state. In the well-run digesters, which were 3:1 with recirculation and 1:1 without recirculation, the dominant methanogens were Methanosaeta, while in the inhibited digesters, Methanosarcina and Methanosphaera dominated the methanogen community. Based on producing 1 GJ energy, the strategy of 3:1 with recirculation reduced the discharge of liquid digestate by 81.9% and the use of clean water by 65.4% compared to that of 1:1 without recirculation. An integrated approach of adjusting feedstock formula and selectively employing liquid digestate recirculation was proposed to produce liquid digestate on-demand with downstream application requirement, which will make biogas industry eco-friendly and cost-effective. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic co-digestion; Corn stalk; Digestate recirculation; Pig manure; Straw-to-manure ratio","Ammonia; Biogas; Cost effectiveness; Feeding; Feedstocks; Fermentation; Fertilizers; Liquids; Mammals; Manures; Methane; Methanogens; Ammonia concentrations; Comprehensive effect; Digestion performance; Downstream applications; Fermentation systems; Integrated approach; Methane production; Microbial community structures; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083167704

As a novel promising energy-saving dehumidification technology, desiccant coated heat exchanger (DCHE)-based air conditioning systems have attracted immense attention recently. This paper provides a quick and reasonable selection of desiccant materials for DCHE systems using water as the cooling medium in different buildings and climates. By the theoretical calculation of moisture needed to be removed in three types of buildings (offices, residential buildings and restaurants) and the analysis of the dehumidification capacity of desiccants in DCHEs reported in the literature, optimal desiccants for different building types and ambient air conditions under given parameters are recommended. Salt-supported porous composite desiccants possess flexible dehumidification performance and can be utilized in most climates and building types, except for extremely humid indoor environments with high requirement for fresh air.

Converting the waste cooking oil to biodiesel can reduce environmental emissions and achieve economic value. As the recycling supply chain is not matured, the Chinese government is trialing various policies to improve the management of waste cooking oil. However, evidence shows that current policies have shortcomings, which reduce the efficiency and sustainability of the supply chain, recycling and biorefineries capacities. It is not trivial to quantify the impacts of policies and only limited amount of research has reported the supply and value chain of waste cooking oil to be used as biodiesel. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an optimization-based model to quantify the likely impacts from policy interventions, i.e. integrating and opening the third party take-back supply chains, motivation policies, subsidy policies and demand adjustments due to policy changes. A case study, which includes 63 stakeholders in Shandong Province, China, is selected to demonstrate the impacts such changes can have. The new research method and computational results of the economic and environmental assessments show that the integration of stakeholders and markets increase efficiency and sustainability. Whilst the opening markets option does make fairer profit allocations across the stakeholders, but does not increase efficencies to the same level. In addition, and to the best of authors’ knowledge for the first time, it is shown that unfair profit allocations will decrease the amount of recycled materials. This research has wider applications to policy developments and governmental interventions that aim to promote cleaner production of goods and services. For example, the optimization model can be applied to other circumstances such as electricity supplies, raw material extraction or the recycling of other materials like construction and demolition wastes or plastics. © 2020","Biodiesel supply chain; Efficiency; Government policy; Optimization model; Sustainability; Waste cooking oil","Biodiesel; Commerce; Demolition; Efficiency; Pollution control; Profitability; Public policy; Raw materials; Recycling; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Waste management; Biodiesel supply chains; Computational results; Construction and demolition waste; Economic and environmental assessments; Environmental emissions; Governmental intervention; Optimization modeling; Raw material extraction; Oils and fats",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083317578

This study presented a comprehensive overview of the BNG industry in China, including its status quo, national strategic planning, upgrading technologies, investment cost, potential, and opportunities and challenges. A total of 65 BNG demonstration projects were approved by the central government between 2015 and 2017, and 197 projects are expected to have been built by 2020 as part of the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016–2020). BNG is an emerging industry, and its development provides several opportunities, including a huge natural gas demand, national policy incentives, integrated agriculture, and reduced carbon emissions. The challenges and barriers to such developments include the high upgrading cost, fluctuating natural gas prices, unsound market access mechanism for biomethane and biofertilizer, scarce competition-oriented feedstock resources, incomplete standard system and cross-sectorial management, imperfect policy and subsidy mechanism, and lagging technology and equipment. China can learn from other developed countries in four ways. First, the country must enhance the cost effectiveness of its subsidies. Then, China must highlight the operations of its BNG industry and evaluate its performance; prioritize digestate management in the planning stage; improve its project service level and reinforce research and development. The findings of this work provide a valuable reference for other developing countries that intend to address energy shortage issues and integrate waste management into their regional planning. © 2020","Bio-natural gas; Biogas; Biomethane; China; Potential","Agricultural robots; Biogas; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Developing countries; Gas emissions; Investments; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Project management; Regional planning; Research and development management; Service industry; Waste management; Central government; Demonstration project; Developed countries; Feedstock resources; Natural gas demand; Research and development; Technology and equipments; Upgrading technologies; Gas industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085280482

Nuclear power output is stable and the inertia is large, which can provide the necessary power, electricity and inertia support for the power system with a high penetration of new energy integration. This paper comprehensively considers various factors such as China's energy resource conditions, environmental constraints, demand pattern, development schedule, construction cycle, and faces the development scenario of power systems with different penetration of new energy integration for medium and long-term construction. The regional power grid proposes a coordinated development strategy for nuclear power and other new energy that meets the requirements of power system safety and stability, energy conservation, and emission reduction, and provides a useful reference for the healthy development of China's future nuclear power and new energy industries. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Accident prevention; Chemical equipment; Emission control; Integration; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Coordinated operation; Development scenarios; Development strategies; Environmental constraints; New energy industries; Power system safeties; Regional power grids; Resource conditions; Electric power transmission networks",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090477821

Thus, study of the feasibility of urban green travel in public transportation is necessary. This study focuses on it from two aspects: City level by complex network and individual level by structural equation model. As for the former, point of interest data on the spatial distribution of urban public transportation in Wuhan city are quantitatively analyzed. Then, a complex network of public transportation inWuhan is constructed by using the Space L method, and the network characteristics are analyzed. Results show that accessibility coverage is mainly concentrated in the central urban area, and two significant central nodes exist, namely, Linshi and Zhaohu stations. At the individual level, 354 valid questionnaires and the structural equation model were used to explore the factors affecting individual intention of public transportation. Behavioral perceptual outcome, behavioral attitudes, and subjective norms have positive influences on the behavioral intention of public transportation, among which the behavioral attitudes are the most significant, and the subjective norms had the lowest influence. Some suggestions are proposed forWuhan to improve urban accessibility and for individuals to increase green travel in public transportation. © 2020 by the authors.","Complex network; Green travel; Structural equation model; Theory of planned behavior","attitudinal survey; feasibility study; perception; pollution control; public attitude; public transport; spatial distribution; travel behavior; urban transport; China; Hubei; Wuhan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089981357

An “Environmental Protection Interview (EPI)” is one of the campaign-style environmental governance methods that target local officials. In this paper, the causal relationship between the implementation of EPI and pollutant emission reduction was confirmed using the method of Time-Varying Difference-in-difference (Time-Varying DID) to compensate for endogeneity problem and ensure that the results are still valid after several robustness checks. Our regional heterogeneous analysis shows that the policy effects of EPI decrease from east to west in China and that they have different emission reduction effects on various types of pollutants. Unfortunately, the results also suggest that policy implementation only temporarily affects pollutant emission reduction, which could be attributed to the governance approaches of campaign-style enforcement according to the impact mechanism analysis. This paper implies that the EPI should be continued to be implemented in the future with some improvements on pollutant reduction mechanisms to ensure effective adoption. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Campaign-style governance; Dynamic effects analysis; Environmental Protection Interview; Pollutant reducing mechanism; Time-varying DID","emission control; environmental protection; governance approach; policy approach; policy implementation; questionnaire survey; China; environmental policy; environmental protection; government; pollutant; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Policy; Environmental Pollutants; Government",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085035418

Herein, a facile and efficient approach to prepare ultrathin carbon nanosheet superstructure (BN/C) with high B, N-doping level by using sodium chloride (NaCl)-assisted pyrolysis method is proposed. The developed BN/C catalyst exhibits good catalytic activity for ORR in alkaline medium with a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.8 V, which is comparable to that of commercial Pt/C. The BN/C catalyst also shows much better long-term stability and satisfactory tolerance for the methanol crossover effect. This excellent performance is attributed to the structure and composition characteristics of BN/C, including the large surface area (1085 m2 g−1), hierarchically porous structure, the synergistic effect of the B, N co-doping and high content of ORR active species. Significantly, the B element with electron-deficient property in BN/C can create more charged sites favorite for O2 adsorption and thus accelerate reaction kinetics in ORR. Furthermore, a rechargeable Zn-air battery device comprising BN/C catalyst and RuO2 with a liquid electrolyte shows superior performance with an open-circuit potential of ∼1.36 V, a peak power density of ∼115 mW cm−2, as well as excellent durability (1000 cycles for 14 days of operation).

The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) is one of the busiest port clusters in the world, accounting for 11% of global seaborne cargo throughput, so future improvements in shipping emission controls may still be important in this region. To assess the impact of future ship emissions on air quality of coastal areas, this study evaluates emissions reductions and air quality in 2030 for three scenarios (business as usual, stricter regulations, and aspirational policies) representing increasing levels of control compared with a base year of 2015. We projected ship emissions in the region using a bottom-up approach developed in this study and based on the historical ship automatic identification system (AIS) activity data. We then predicted air quality across the YRD region in 2030 using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The annual average contributions of ship emissions to ambient PM2.5 would decrease by 70.9%, 80.4%, and 86.2% relative to 2015 under the three scenarios, with the largest reductions of more than 4.1 μg/m3 near Shanghai Port under the aspirational scenario. Reductions in ship emissions generally led to lower levels of PM2.5, particularly in most of the coastal cities in the YRD. Compared with a business-as-usual approach the aspirational scenario reduced SO2, NOx and PM2.5 concentrations from shipping by 71.8%, 61.1% and 52.5%, respectively.

In recent years, great effort has been exerted to support the development of renewable energy in China. While, due to fiscal pressures and changes in management policies, related subsidies are diminishing now and energy users are asked to pay for the cost. Regulations about carbon cap and renewable energy consumptions are issued to transfer the responsibility of consuming renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions to energy consumers. A national carbon trading system is set up in China and is under its growth stage. Therefore, this study lists the factors that should be considered by the energy users, analyzes the levelized cost of electricity generated by renewable energy in four cities in China, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou,Wuhan, and compares the results with current carbon prices. Based on the research, under the current status, it is still more cost-efficient for enterprises to buy carbon credits than introduce renewable energies, and great differences among cities are shown due to different natural conditions. Besides, with diminishing subsidies and development of the carbon trading market, the carbon price will gradually reflect the actual value and carbon emission reduction costs will become an important part of enterprise expenditure. In the long term, enterprises should link more factors to carbon emissions, like social responsibility and brand image, instead of only the cost. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; Carbon price; China; Enterprise strategy","alternative energy; carbon emission; corporate social responsibility; electricity generation; emissions trading; energy market; energy use; power generation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089812260

Vibration-induced emission (VIE) refers to a tunable multiple fluorescence exhibited by saddle-shaped N,N′-disubstituted-dihydribenzo[a,c]phenazines (DHPs), which involves photo-induced configuration vibrations from bent to planar form along the N-N axis. VIE-active molecules show intrinsic long-wavelength emissions in the unconstrained state (planar state) but bright short-wavelength emissions in the constrained state (bent state). The emission response for VIE-active luminogens is highly sensitive to steric hindrance encountered during the planarization process such that a tiny structural variation can induce an evident change in fluorescence. This can often be achieved by tuning the intensity ratio of short-and long-wavelength bands. In some special cases, the alterations in the emission wavelength of VIE fluorophores can be achieved step by step by harnessing the degree of bending angle motion in the excited state. In this perspective, we summarize the latest progress in the field of VIE research. New bent heterocyclic structures, as novel types of VIE molecules, are being developed, and the general features of the chemical structures are also being proposed. Technologically, novel emission color-tuning approaches and VIE-based probes for visualizing biological activity are presented to demonstrate how the dynamic VIE effect can be exploited for cutting-edge applications.

Various strict measures were adopted to reduce anthropogenic activities in order to prevent further spread and infection of the disease. In this study, we utilized continental scale remotely sensed data along with city scale in situ air quality observations for 2020 as well as data from the baseline period (2015-2019) to provide an early insight on air pollution changes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, by combining both continental and city scales. For the continental scale analysis, data of NO2, SO2, and O3 were acquired from the ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) and data of aerosol optical depth (AOD) were collected from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS). For city scale analysis, data ofNO2, CO, PM2.5, O3, and SO2 were derived from ground-based air quality observations. Results from satellite observations at the continental scale showed that concentrations of NO2, SO2, and AOD substantially dropped in 2020 during the lockdown period compared to their averages for the baseline period over all continents, with a maximum reduction of ~33% for NO2 in East Asia, ~41% for SO2 in East Asia, and ~37% for AOD in South Asia. In the case of O3, the maximum overall reduction was observed as ~11% in Europe, followed by ~10% in North America, while a slight increase was found in other study regions. These findings align with ground-based air quality observations, which showed that pollutants such as NO2, CO, PM2.5, and SO2 during the 2020 lockdown period decreased significantly except that O3 had varying patterns in different cities. Specifically, a maximum reduction of ~49% in NO2 was found in London, ~43% in CO in Wuhan, ~38% in PM2.5 in Chennai, and ~48% in SO2 in Beijing. In the case of urban O3, a maximum reduction of ~43% was found inWuhan, but a significant increase of ~47% was observed in Chennai. It is obvious that restricted human activities during the lockdown have reduced the anthropogenic emissions and subsequently improved air quality, especially across the metropolitan cities. © 2020 by the authors.","Ambient air pollutants; COVID-19; Geospatial correlation; Lockdown; MODIS; OMI","Air quality; Data reduction; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution control; Radiometers; Statistics; Ultraviolet spectrometers; Aerosol optical depths; Anthropogenic activity; Anthropogenic emissions; Continental-scale analysis; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Ozone monitoring instruments; Remotely sensed data; Satellite observations; Quality control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089395308

Under this circumstance, it is necessary to assess the level of energy-saving and emission reduction (ESER) of China's transportation industry. Therefore, based on the panel data of China's 30 provinces during 2008–2017, this paper develops a new DEA model to evaluate the growth-adjusted energy-emission efficiency of transportation industry in China. The results show that, first of all, the growth-adjusted energy-emission efficiency of China's transportation industry is approximately 0.5543 during the sample period, and the provinces with high efficiency in their transportation industries are mainly concentrated in the central region and the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region; in particular, the central region takes the lead in low-carbon and energy-saving (LCES) technology of transportation industry. Second, during the sample period, the overall growth-adjusted energy-emission efficiency of China's transportation industry improves by 7.08% on average. The efficiency of the transportation industry in the eastern region improves the most, i.e., 28.99%.

To evaluate the effect of emission trading system on carbon emission reduction, this study applies a robust econometric method difference-in-difference estimation on city-level panel data in China from 2004 to 2015. The findings of this study indicate that the emission trading policy adopted in pilot regions has reduced carbon emission by approximately 16.2% and such effect is particularly prominent in eastern areas of China where the economy is more developed. Moreover, other factors such as the development of the second industry and foreign direct investment are also found to affect carbon emission. The results of this study provide evidence for the success of the emission trading system in reducing carbon emission across pilot cities and suggest that an expanded scope of carbon trading mechanism adopted in China would further control the carbon emission. Meanwhile, a multi-level emission trading system from central to local government needs to be built using a variety of market-based instruments to promote the equal development of carbon trading market in various regions with different economic development levels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Emission reduction; Emission trading system; Policy evaluation","Carbon; Economics; Investments; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; Difference-in-differences; Emission trading; Emission trading systems; Foreign direct investments; Local government; Market-based instruments; Emission control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084251854

Systematic PM2.5 measurements have started only in 2013, resulting in a lack of historical data which is a key obstacle for the analysis of long-term PM2.5 trends and forecasting the evolution over this hot region. Satellite data can provide a new approach to derive historical PM2.5 information provided that the column-integrated aerosol properties can adequately be converted to PM2.5. In this study, a recently developed formulation for the calculation of surface PM2.5 concentrations using satellite data is introduced and applied to reconstruct a PM2.5 time series over China from 2000 to 2015. The formulated model is also used to explore the PM2.5 driving factors related to anthropogenic or meteorological parameters in this historical period. The results show that the annually averaged PM2.5 over China's polluted regions increased rapidly between 2004 and 2007 (with an average rate of 3.07 μg m-3 yr-1) to reach values of up to 61.1 μg m-3 in 2007, and decreased from 2011 to 2015 with an average rate of -2.61 μg m-3 yr-1, to reach a value of 46.9 μg m-3 in 2015. The analysis shows that the increase in PM2.5 before 2008 was mainly associated with increasing anthropogenic factors, further augmented by the effect of meteorological influences. However, the decrease in PM2.5 after 2011 is mainly attributed to the effect of pollution control measures on anthropogenic factors, whereas the effects of meteorological factors have continued to increase since 2000. The results also suggest that further reduction in anthropogenic emissions is needed to accelerate the decrease in PM2.5 concentrations to reach the target of 35 μg m-3 over major polluted areas in China before 2025. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; China; PM2.5; PMRS; Satellite remote sensing","Pollution control; Anthropogenic emissions; Anthropogenic factors; Atmospheric fine particulate matter; Environmental problems; Meteorological factors; Meteorological influence; Meteorological parameters; Satellite observations; Satellites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090088725

Among the possible renewable sources of energy, ground source heat pump (GSHP) systems can be an effective low-carbon solution that is compatible with district heating and cooling in urban areas. There are no location restrictions for this technology, and underground energy sources are stable for long-term use. According to a previous study, buildings in urban areas have demonstrated significant spatial heterogeneity in terms of their capacity to demand (C/D) ratio under the application of GSHP due to variations in heating demand and available space. If a spatial sharing strategy can be developed to allow the surplus geothermal capacity to be shared with neighbors, the heating and cooling demands of a greater number of buildings in an area can be satisfied, thus achieving a city with lower carbon emissions. In this study, a GSHP district system model was developed with a specific embedding sharing strategy for the application of GSHP. Two sharing strategies were proposed in this study: (i) Strategy 1 involved individual systems with borehole sharing, and (ii) Strategy 2 was a central district system. Three districts in London were selected to compare the performance of the developed models on the C/D ratio, required borehole number and carbon emissions. According to the comparison analysis, both strategies were able to enhance the GSHP application capacity and increase the savings of carbon emissions. However, the improvement levels were shown to be different.

Optimizing electricity mix is critical for maintaining a stable energy supply while addressing water stress and carbon emissions associated with power generation. In this study, we developed an optimization model with the dual objectives of mitigating the risk of water scarcity and cutting carbon emissions, by adjusting the electricity mix and power generation tasks of provincial grids. Using the weighted sum method, the optimization of grids is simulated based on a scenario analysis within specified equality and boundary constraints. We quantified the impact of the spatial distribution of thermal power and power generated from clean energies (hydropower, wind power, nuclear power, and solar power) on virtual water consumption and carbon emissions at a provincial level in China. The results suggested that transferring part of power generation tasks from water-deficient areas (e.g., Shandong and Jiangsu) to water-sufficient areas (e.g., Yunnan and Guangdong) could significantly mitigate water scarcity. Water consumption of power generation could be reduced by 34.7% in highly water-deficient areas if a water-prioritized scenario is implemented. Carbon emissions related to power generation could be reduced nationwide under a carbon-prioritized scenario and a water-carbon-balanced scenario. This model could provide a synergistic perspective for improving regional water and carbon performances based on changes in electricity mix. © 2020","Carbon emissions; Energy-water-carbon nexus; Multi-objective optimization; Power generation; Water scarcity","Nuclear fuels; Solar energy; Wind power; Boundary constraints; Carbon emissions; Carbon performance; Electric power sector; Optimization modeling; Scenario analysis; Water consumption; Weighted sum method; Carbon; carbon emission; electrical power; electricity; electricity industry; electricity supply; optimization; power generation; spatial distribution; thermal power; water stress; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085287902

Climate warming has been predicted to stimulate microbial decomposition and N mineralization in these systems. However, experimental results are highly variable, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We examined the effects of warming, N input, and their combination on soil N pools and N-cycling microbes in a field manipulation experiment. Special attention was directed to the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea, and their mediated N-cycling processes (transformation rates and N2O emissions) in the third plant growing season after the treatments were initiated. Nitrogen input (12 g m−2 y−1) alone significantly increased soil mineral N pools and plant N uptake, and stimulated the growth of AOB and N2O emissions in the late growing season. While warming (by 1.4 °C air temperature) alone did not have significant effects on most parameters, it amplified the effects of N input on soil N concentrations and AOB abundance, eliciting a chain reaction that increased nitrification potential (+83%), soil NO3−-N (+200%), and N2O emissions (+412%) across the whole season. Also, N input reduced AOB diversity but increased the dominance of genus Nitrosospira within the AOB community, corresponding to the increased N2O emissions. These results showed that a small temperature increase in soil may significantly enhance N losses through NO3− leaching and N2O emissions when mineral N becomes available. These findings suggest that interactions among global change factors may predominantly affect ammonia-oxidizing microbes and their mediated N-cycling processes in alpine ecosystems under future climate change scenarios. © 2020","Alpine meadow; Ammonia-oxidizing archaea; Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria; Climate warming; N2O emission; Nitrogen addition","Ammonia; Bacteria; Climate change; Ecosystems; Minerals; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Soils; Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea; Field manipulation; Global change factors; Microbial decomposition; Mineral nitrogen; Soil organic carbon; Temperature increase; Transformation rates; Soil pollution; nitrogen; nitrogen dioxide; carbon; nitrogen; alpine environment; bacterium; global change; meadow; nitrogen cycle; soil biota; soil nitrogen; transformation; warming; air temperature; ammonia oxidizing bacterium; archaeon; Article; bacterial growth; biomass; climate warming; community structure; concentration (parameter); controlled study; geographic and geological phenomena; nitrification; nitrogen cycling; nitrogen mineralization; Nitrosospira; nonhuman; population abundance; priority journal; seasonal variation; simulation; soil acidity; species composition; species diversity; Tibetan alpine meadow; ecosystem; grassland; microbiology; soil; Tibet; China; Xizang; Nitrosomonadales; Nitrosospira; Carbon; Ecosystem; Grassland; Nitrogen; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Tibet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084519268

The heat-related condition of Washington D.C. is investigated for such purpose using the high-resolution weather research and forecasting model and the representative concentration pathway 8.5 climate scenario. Results indicate that by the end of the century, the amplitude of heat waves may grow by 5.7 °C, and frequency and duration may increase by more than twofold. The urban heat island effect plays an important role in heat wave growth even though global climate change dominates the variation. Deploying cool roofs and green roofs in Washington D.C. can effectively reduce the amplitude and duration of heat waves, whereas using reflective pavements has relatively little impact.

Here we use an integrated approach to quantify its impact on indoor and outdoor air quality and greenhouse gas emissions. This approach includes emission estimation, three-dimensional atmospheric chemistry modeling, and human health assessment. Although the production of shale gas generates PM2.5, this risk is outweighed by the benefits of the decreased PM2.5 resulted from coal combustion when shale gas replaces coal as a fuel source. The total avoided premature deaths are 14,000 (10,650–17,160 as 95% confidence interval) and 13,400 (10,350–17,100) in 2017, resulted from the outdoor and indoor pathways, respectively. Future scenario analysis suggests deploying shale gas in the residential sector, but the greenhouse gas emission reductions are minimal if replacing biomass fuel. In production regions, a net deterioration of air quality is predicted if deploying shale gas in the power and industrial sectors, but a net benefit is calculated if deploying in the residential sector.

By comparing the electronegativity, electrophilicity and nucleophilicity of different models, it was concluded that chemisorptions of nitric oxide onto carbon models were electrophilic reactions. Electrons transferred to nitric oxide during chemisorption processes. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), value of electron localization function, electrostatic potential distribution on van der Waals surface and electron density difference of char models with armchair and zigzag edges were analyzed. Zigzag edges were packed with more lone pair electrons, making them more vulnerable to electrophilic attacks. Double descriptors of different models were analyzed to elucidate why NO was more inclined to be chemisorbed at edges rather than onto carbon plane. The specific adsorption sites at edges were predicted by comprehensive analyses of atomic charge, condensed local electrophilicity, condensed local softness and the contribution to HOMO/LUMO orbital of each atom. Energies released from NO chemisorptions in different modes were calculated with and without considering London dispersion interaction. The thermodynamic results were consistent with the predictions of wave function theory and density functional reactivity theory.

This paper focuses on the optimal pricing and carbon emission strategies of the manufacturer and retailer in a supply chain containing an upstream manufacturer who produces one particular kind product and a downstream retailer. We use two-stage Stackelberg game model to show how the supply chain functions. In view of the survey collected in Berlin, willingness to pay for clear production is different between residents there. Thus, consumers' environmental awareness is introduced. In this model, the demand quantities are decided by the consumers, and both of the manufacturer and retailer can decide their own prices and carbon improvement degrees. The consumers' environmental awareness can positively affect the demand of eco-friendly product. The carbon emission quantities can be transacted in the market. We find that as the consumers environmental awareness strengthens, the total revenue of manufacturer and retailer will increase. Besides, as the environmental awareness or the carbon transaction cost increases under certain conditions, the total carbon emission will decrease. © 2020 IEEE.","Cap-and-trade; Environmental awareness; Two-stage supply chain optimization","Carbon; Commerce; Costs; Emission control; Manufacture; Sales; Supply chains; Carbon emission trading; Eco-friendly products; Environmental awareness; Environmental pollutions; Stackelberg Games; Supply chain functions; Two-stage supply chains; Willingness to pay; Environmental regulations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091596894

However, little is known about the relationship between volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted and regional air pollution. In this study, VOCs emissions from a typical iron and steel plant in Yangtze River Delta (YRD, China) were monitored from April 2018 to March 2019. The ozone formation potential (OFP) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation of VOCs were calculated to reveal the influence of VOCs emissions on regional ozone and particulate pollution, and the sensitivity analysis approach was performed to explore the qualitative and quantitative relationships between VOCs and O3, as well as VOCs and PM2.5. The VOCs concentration was 93.76 ± 266.97 ppbv during the study. The OFP was 760.08 ± 2391.90 μg m−3, and aromatics were the predominant precursors, contributing 54.05% of the total OFP. Furthermore, the SOA estimated by fractional aerosol coefficient (FAC) and time-resolved (TR) methods were 6.032 ± 13.347 μg m−3 and 0.971 ± 4.650 μg m−3, accounting for 8.65–26.39% (13.78 ± 7.46%) and 1.55–4.20% (2.22 ± 1.23%) of the PM2.5 concentrations, respectively. The results indicated that VOCs were more sensitive to O3 pollution in high pollution domains, whereas VOCs were more sensitive to PM2.5 pollution in low pollution domains. We concluded that reducing VOCs emissions might be effective in alleviating photochemical pollution episodes in areas around iron and steel industry, and the haze pollution occurred in these regions may be caused by the primary emission of PM, and the contribution of SOA was relatively small. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Iron and steel industry; OFP; Sensitivity analysis; SOA formation; VOCs","atmospheric pollution; industrial emission; iron and steel industry; ozone; particulate matter; pollution effect; pollution monitoring; quantitative analysis; volatile organic compound; China; Yangtze River; iron; ozone; steel; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; China; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; China; Environmental Monitoring; Iron; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Steel; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088403488

The results show that all four proposed control measures can help to reduce PM2.5 concentrations throughout Hong Kong (HK), Macao, and the PRD economic zone (PRD EZ) by 2020. In all cases, reductions in PM2.5 concentrations were larger over PRD EZ than over HK. For HK, the predicted annual concentrations of PM2.5 were less than 20 μg/m3 for S1–S3 and less than 15 μg/m3 for S4. For Macao, the predicted annual concentrations of PM2.5 were less than 25 μg/m3 for S1 and less than 15 μg/m3 up to S3. Regionally, HK had the lowest PM2.5 levels, and the area around Foshan had the highest. Controlling the sources of air pollution (i.e., industry, transport, power production, and other sources) within PRD can get most of the PRD EZ region to below 35 μg/m3. Similar national air quality management efforts could reduce PM2.5 levels to less than 25 μg/m3 in the PRD EZ and less than 15 μg/m3 in HK. Control measures in S1 led to significant improvement in Shenzhen and HK, but the S3 option brought the greatest improvement for PRD EZ and Macao. The S4 policy option led to substantial reductions, particularly for HK. © 2020 Elsevier LtdThis study proposes a new CMAQ model sensitivity framework to evaluate the effectiveness of integrated control policies and cross-boundary sectoral contributions to provide a holistic emission control potentials. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical transport model; China; Emission control policy; PM2.5; Scenario analysis","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Decision making; Emission control; Public policy; Quality management; River pollution; Community multi-scale air qualities; Emission control measures; Emission inventories; Emission reduction policies; Government decisions; Integrated emissions; Sectoral contribution; Substantial reduction; Quality control; air quality; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; integrated approach; particulate matter; pollution policy; air pollution control; air quality; article; comparative effectiveness; decision making; drug efficacy; government; Hong Kong; Macao; quantitative analysis; river; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; Hong Kong; particulate matter; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen; Zhujiang Delta; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Hong Kong; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083288568

Real-time data regarding engine and aftertreatment operating conditions and tailpipe nitrogen oxides (NOx) concentrations are required to be collected through electronic control unit and on-board NOx sensors by vehicle original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and then transmitted to environmental authorities. Beijing has developed a local standard that requires OEMs to design China VI-like on-board monitoring (OBM) systems for new China V HDDVs since September 2018. Additionally, Beijing has been a pioneer in retrofitting in-use China IV and China V HDDVs with OBM systems since 2017. This paper contains a timely technical and policy assessment for the state-of-the-art OBM programs in China with a focus on the recent progress in Beijing. Both OEM-performed and retrofitted OBM data were collected from a fleet of OBM-instrumented vehicles. First, our assessment shows high data integrity and quality of OEM-performed OBM systems. In contrast, a considerable fraction of HDDVs equipped with retrofitted OBM systems did not completely report NOx concentrations, intake mass air flow and other parameters. Next, eight OBM-instrumented HDDVs were tested on road by portable emissions measurement systems (PEMSs) to examine the reliability of sensor-based NOx concentrations. The majority (6 of 8) shows a good agreement between OBM and PEMS results with an average relative error of approximately −15%. Furthermore, calculation of NOx mass emissions, inter-trip variability, and alternative methods of enforcing in-use emissions management (e.g., to develop concentration metric-based emission limits) are discussed. This early-stage assessment suggests the OBM approach has the potential to play a central role in in-use emission inspections for HDDVs in China. The regulatory agency should focus more attention to the data integrity and the reliability of NOx sensors by developing effective verification processes. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","China; In-use emission compliance; Nitrogen oxides (NOx), heavy-duty diesel vehicle (HDDV); On-board emission monitoring (OBM)","Air intakes; Automobile manufacture; Exhaust systems (engine); Fleet operations; Nitrogen oxides; Vehicles; Average relative error; Electronic control units; Environmental Authority; Heavy duty diesel vehicles; Original equipment manufacturers; Policy recommendations; Portable emissions measurement systems; Verification process; Air pollution control equipment; nitrogen oxide; concentration (composition); nitrogen oxides; policy analysis; pollution monitoring; pollution policy; regulatory approach; standard (regulation); traffic emission; air pollution control; Article; chemical analysis; China; concentration (parameter); environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; environmental policy; exhaust gas; on board emission monitoring; priority journal; reliability; standardization; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084482031

Among the strategies for CO2 diminishment, carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is considered as the key option. The objective of this work is to develop an optimization-based assessment framework that aims to incorporate CO2 storage and CO2 utilization into an integrated framework. To achieve this goal, a superstructure network including all the sections of CCUS supply chain is proposed, which includes CO2 capture, transportation, storage and utilization with 15 candidate conversion process paths. Based on this superstructure, a mathematical model for the optimal design of a supply chain of CCUS is developed. CO2 would be stored underground and/or utilized to produce chemical products through candidate conversion paths. Finally, a case with real data of large emission sources in Northeast China is studied. Three different scenarios are investigated, according to key constraints on CCUS network: CO2 emission source, raw material limits and products demands limits. Results show that adsorption is the preferred capture technology at relative high flue gas flow rate and high CO2 concentration. Storing CO2 is the recommended approach compared with utilization from the point of economy, however, carbon utilization could be a more sustainable option and may generate a carbon-neutral cycle. With the increase of CO2 utilization, the cost of CCUS supply chain also increase (Scenario A: 2.49 billion $/y, Scenario B: 2.76 billion $/y, Scenario C: 2.85 billion $/y). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS); CO2 utilization; Mixed integer linear programming (MILP); Supply chain","Carbon capture; Digital storage; Flow of gases; Greenhouse gases; Storage (materials); Supply chains; Carbon utilization; Chemical products; CO2 concentration; Conversion process; Emission sources; Integrated frameworks; International community; Northeast China; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084371916

Energy intensity has declined, the installed capacity for wind and solar energy has soared, and the share of fossil fuels is falling. This success has been achieved through deploying administrative policy instruments backed by generous state finance. As this approach is yielding diminishing returns, the government has launched a number of initiatives to increase the role of market forces across the energy sector: in the oil, gas and electricity industries, and through the development of carbon markets. However, the wider political and economic context is undermining these moves. Central and local government agencies regularly intervene to disrupt the operation of these markets. At the same time, most resources and assets remain in the hands of enterprises owned by the state at central or local levels, giving them too the ability to undermine these markets. The application of institutional concepts provides insights into how the style of governance at national level and within the energy sector constrains the development of the new market initiatives. As a result, these market mechanisms will not yield their potential efficiency improvements and emissions reductions in the current institutional context. These finding are also relevant to many other countries, especially those with a long history of state involvement in the energy sector. © 2020 The Author(s)","China; Electricity; Emissions trading; Energy; Institution; Market",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081666224

The overall performance of simple stream-to-stream heat-integrated F-S-E configuration (serially preheating column inlet feeds by solvent stream) is superior to others because of the least total annual cost (TAC), CO2 emissions and highest second-law efficiency among these side-stream cases. It can further reduce 8.16% in TAC compared to the conventional extractive distillation configuration. Exergy and entropy generation analyses are employed in these heat-integrated side-stream extractive distillation arrangements to thorough evaluate the energy degeneration in each component. Furthermore, dynamic control analyses for conventional and heat-integrated side-stream extractive distillation processes are also explored. Two novel compromised tactics are proposed to make the economically optimal heat-integrated arrangement more stable at rejecting large feed disturbances according to the physical implemented issues of economizers. Both effective and robust dual-product quality controls are provided for tackling the large (20%) throughput and feed composition perturbations.

Unfortunately, the OER kinetics in neutral electrolyte is sluggish due to the low concentration of adsorbed reactants, with overpotentials of neutral OER at present much higher than that in acidic or alkaline electrolyte. Here, hydrated metal cations (Ca2+) are sought to be incorporated into the state-of-the-art Ru–Ir binary oxide to tailor the surface oxygen environments (lattice-oxygen and adsorbed oxygen species) for efficient neutral OER. Using a sol–gel method, ternary Ru–Ir–Ca oxides are synthesized in atomically homogenous manner, and the obtained catalyst on glassy carbon electrode achieves 10 mA cm−2 at a low overpotential of 250 mV, with no degradation for 200 h of operation. In situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy, in situ 18O isotope-labeling differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, and 18O isotope-labeling secondary ion mass spectroscopy studies are carried out. The results reveal that incorporation of Ca2+ can enhance the covalency of metal–oxygen bonds and the electrophilic nature of surface metal-bonded oxygen sites; and simultaneously facilitate the adsorption of water molecules on catalyst surface, which accelerates the lattice-oxygen-involved reaction, thus improving the overall OER performance of RuIrCaOx catalyst. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The results show that the BCA is more effective in reducing carbon leakage in USA than the uniform tariff mechanisms.

With the development of carbon market, carbon asset has been a popular financial product to invest and the risk management becomes important for government, regulated enterprises and other investors. As carbon prices have tail characteristics, this paper explores the extremal risks between carbon markets in US, Europe and China using tail dependence correlation coefficients. The empirical analysis demonstrates the tail dependence structure between carbon markets in US. and Europe is the same sign, which indicates that it is unwise to hold these two carbon assets as a portfolio. Moreover, the co-movements between European Union Emission Trade Scheme (EU ETS) and China's carbon markets are partly significant, and the operation mechanisms in China should be improved. In addition, the tail dependence test among the carbon pilots in China shows diversity. Hubei carbon trading pilot, located in central China, has extremal dependence with all other selected pilots for its regulatory program operation. The findings give insight to the carbon market regulars to improve the operation mechanism and are also useful for the investors to manage their portfolios, policymakers to make practically applicable regulations, and relevant organizations to develop procedures.

The assessment of exposure to PM2.5 of urban residents based on remote sensing is challenging because of the data deficiency in aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the low spatial resolution. This article is devoted to adopt an approach with 2 gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) models to fill the gaps in AOD and derive continuous PM2.5 distribution at urban scale. Then, the assessment of exposure to PM2.5 in Beijing was conducted. First, Simplified High Resolution MODIS Aerosol Retrieval Algorithm (SARA) was employed to obtain daily AOD from September 2016 to February 2017 at 500m resolution. Then we used the first GBDT to derive the gap-filled SARA AOD and the second GBDT to estimate PM2.5 spatial distribution based on multi-source data. Furthermore, population weighted exposure (PWE) levels of PM2.5 and population proportion exposed to PM2.5 concentration were estimated by PM2.5 distribution and population density data. The result demonstrates that both two GBDT models performed well with cross validation (CV) R2 of 0.86 and 0.85 on AOD gap-filling and PM2.5 concentration estimation respectively. The areas with high PM2.5 concentration are mainly distributed in the east and south of the city but the areas with higher PM2.5 exposure are mainly distributed in the urban centre. Moreover, it is found that over 80% people in Beijing are affected by PM2.5 pollution in autumn and winter. Overall, the approach this article applied and the analysis results are very useful for epidemiological investigation and air pollution control policy formulation. © Authors 2020.

However, the standards of national regulation and the World Health Organization are yet to be fulfilled in certain areas (in some urban districts among the cities) and/or certain periods (during pollution episode event). A further control policy, hence, has been issued in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020, hereafter 13th FYP). It will be of interest to evaluate the air quality before the 13th FYP (2015) and to estimate the potential air quality by the end of the 13th FYP (2020) with a focus on the area of an urban district and the periods of severe pollution episodes. Based on observation data of major air pollutants, including SO2 (sulphur dioxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), CO (carbon monoxide), PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 10 μm), PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 2.5 μm) and O3 (Ozone), the air quality of Haizhu district [an urban district in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), China] in 2015 suggested that typical heavy pollution occurred in winter and the hot season, with NO2 or PM2.5 as the key pollutants in winter and O3 as the key pollutant in the hot season. We also adopted a state-of-the-art chemical transport model, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), to predict the air quality in Haizhu District 2020 under different scenarios. The simulation results suggested that among the emission control scenarios, comprehensive measures taken in the whole of Guangzhou city would improve air quality more significantly than measures taken just in Haizhu, under all conditions. In the urban district, vehicle emission control would account more than half of the influence of all source emission control on air quality. Based on our simulation, by the end of the 13th FYP, it is noticeable that O3 pollution would increase, which indicates that the control ratio of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) may be unsuitable and therefore should be adjusted. Our study highlights the significance of evaluating the efficacy of current policy in reducing the air pollutants and recommends possible directions for further air pollution control for urban areas during the 13th FYP. © 2020 by the authors.","13th Five-Year Plan; Emission control scenario; Pollution episode; PRD; WRF-Chem",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089481359

Besides the perspective of administrative division, more rational and effective clusters based on provincial characteristics is more conducive for understanding the regional emission reduction linkages and simplifying the steps of responsibility determination. To provide a reasonable management of CEs transference mitigation in China, this study develops a provincial clustering scale CEE-IT model through three-scale accountings (i.e., aggregated-scale, consumption-scale and income-scale analysis). Specifically, 30 provinces are aggregated into several new regions with similar characteristics. Carbon emissions from different energy sources are first considered to distinguish and specify different emission reduction modes. The input output analysis (IOA) and structural decomposition analysis (SDA) are applied to quantify the embodied interprovincial carbon emissions and the relative contributions of socio-economic factors at the sector-level of disaggregation and aggregation, respectively. Three-scale accountings are innovatively employed into EEBT model to deeply analyze the emissions along China's domestic inter-regional supply chains for identifying regional production, consumption and income-based emission responsibilities. Based on three accounting perspectives, the results provide suggestions for coordinated emission reduction across regions (including specific provinces) from the overall and decomposition levels. It shows that cutting the imports of mining sector for all regions could reduce emissions from the supply side. Rural household consumption and fixed capital formation are the major drivers for Ⅳ region from the consumption side. Technological innovations in Ⅲ region have reduced carbon emissions by 55.2% and contributed 159 Mt reductions from 2007 to 2012. Ⅲ region is insensitive to energy types and the utilization of crude oil in Ⅰ region limit the improvement of its system efficiency. Importing large quantities of emission-intensive products from Beijing and Jiangsu is a cause of high income-based emissions in Ⅱ region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","EEBT model; Environmental responsibility allocation; Input output analysis; K-means; Structural decomposition analysis","Carbon; Commerce; Economic analysis; Emission control; Supply chains; Decomposition level; Different energy sources; Environmental responsibility; Input output analysis; Relative contribution; Socio-economic factor; Structural decomposition analysis (SDA); Technological innovation; Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083820161

This work examines in detail the climatically prevailing weather conditions during the Persian invasion in Greece. We perform a climatological analysis of the wind regime in the narrow straits of Salamis, where this historic battle took place, based on available station measurements, reanalysis and modeling simulations (ERA5, WRF) spanning through the period of 1960-2019. Our results are compared to ancient sources before and during the course of the conflict and can be summarized as follows: (i) Our climatological station measurements and model runs describing the prevailing winds in the area of interest are consistent with the eyewitness descriptions reported by ancient historians and (ii) The ancient Greeks and particularly Themistocles must have been aware of the local wind climatology since their strategic plan was carefully designed and implemented to take advantage of the diurnal wind variation.

Our results show that a significant amount of highly toxic hydrogen cyanide (HCN) is formed. All catalysts tested partially convert formaldehyde to HCOOH and CO. Additionally, they form secondary emissions of HCN due to catalytic reactions of formaldehyde and its oxidation intermediates with NH3. With the present components of the exhaust gas aftertreatment system the HCN emissions are not efficiently converted to non-polluting gases. The development of more advanced catalyst formulations with improved oxidation activity is mandatory to solve this novel critical issue. © 2020 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The Cu to Zn ratio in the catalysts can be easily tuned by adjusting the precursor solutions. The obtained Cu–Zn catalysts are mainly composed of polycrystalline Cu particles and monocrystalline ZnO nanoparticles.

As a result, Indonesia including Bengkulu experiences regular natural disasters. Stable isotopes (δ18O and δ2H) have been used as natural tracers in solving water resources and water-related problems. The aim of this research is to investigate the variations of stable isotopes in Bengkulu City from three locations, namely Serut and Hitam Rivers and the Universitas Bengkulu (UNIB) lake, and to understand the hydrological processes in Bengkulu City. In this research, samples of surface water from Serut and Hitam Rivers and UNIB Lake in Bengkulu City were collected over five months between December 2018 and April 2019. Stable isotope compositions of these water samples were examined to understand the local hydrological processes. The result shows that the water samples are generally situated at the right side of Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL) in δ18O and δ2. H plot, indicating that water samples are more enriched in 18O and 2H as compared with the rainwater due to fractionation processes. The surface water samples define a local evaporation line with a slope of 6.536 while the LMWL has a slope of 7.848. This result indicates a significant evaporation effect on water bodies. Moreover, the slope of the regression line in all water samples was lower than the LMWL, in order of Serut River (7.696) &gt; Hitam River (6.851) &gt; UNIB Lake (6.436), indicating that UNIB Lake experienced more significant evaporation than river waters, resulting in enrichment in heavy isotopes. Serut River, one of largest river in Bengkulu City, which also plays an important role in flooding in Bengkulu City, has a regression equation similar to the regression line of rainwater (LMWL). It may be indicated that surface water from Serut River is strongly influenced by rainwater. Consequently, high amount of rainfall can affect the water level of Serut River, and can be associated with flooding. Therefore, long-term monitoring of stable isotopes is very important in the future to provide the pattern of changes in isotopic variation, particularly during flood and drought events as climate-disaster mitigation effort. © 2020 Atom Indonesia.","Hydrological processes; Local meteoric water line; Picarro L2140-i; Stable isotopes; Surface water",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092098320

Despite social and economic concerns, this epidemiologic emergency has brought unexpected positive consequences for environmental quality as human activities were reduced. In this paper, the impact of restricted human activities on urban air quality in Ecuador is investigated. This country implemented a particularly strict set of quarantine measures at the very dawn of the exponential growth of infections on March 17, 2020. As a result, significant reductions in the concentrations of NO2 (–68%), SO2 (–48%), CO (–38%) and PM2.5 (–29%) were measured in the capital city of Quito during the first month of quarantine. This large drop in air pollution concentrations occurred at all the monitoring sites in Quito, serving as a valuable proof of the anthropogenic impact on urban air quality. The spatial evolution of atmospheric pollution using observed surface and satellite data, showed different results for the two major cities: Quito and Guayaquil. While the population in Quito adhered to the quarantine measures immediately, in the port city of Guayaquil, quarantine measures were slow to be adopted and, thus, the effect on air quality in Guayaquil occurred more slowly. This lag could have a considerable cost to the mortality rate in the port city, not only due to the spread of the disease but also due to the poor air quality. Overall, the air quality data demonstrate how quickly air quality can improve when emissions are reduced. © The Author's institution.","COVID-19; Quarantine measures; Urban air pollution","Urban growth; Anthropogenic impacts; Atmospheric pollution; Economic concerns; Environmental quality; Exponential growth; Pollution concentration; Spatial evolution; Urban air quality; Air quality; air quality; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric pollution; capital city; environmental quality; epidemiology; infectivity; mortality; quarantine; satellite data; viral disease; Ecuador; Guayaquil; Guayas; Pichincha; Quito; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088912291

Two naturally occurring compounds (glycine betaine and lecithin) are used as catalysts, and the chemical selectivity of the reaction toward formamide, aminal, or methylamine products is analyzed. The formylation and methylation reactions are both initiated by successive CO2 reduction with hydrosilane to give a stable species, diformyloxysilane [Si](OCHO)2. Formamides are then generated upon the formylation of amines with the reduced CO2 at low temperatures. At high temperatures, methylation occurs, leading to aminals and methylamine (prolonged reaction times). The real resting state of the entire process is diformyloxysilane [Si](OCHO)2, as it has strong electrophilicity, which promotes the investigated reactions.

However, developing high-performance sulfur cathodes has been proven difficult due to low electronic and ionic conductivities and large volume change of sulfur during charge and discharge. Here, we reported an approach to synthesize sulfur cathodes with a mixed electronic and ionic conductivity by infiltrating a solution consisting of Li3PS4 (LPS) solid electrolyte and S active material into a mesoporous carbon (CMK-3). This approach leads to a uniform dispersion of amorphous Li3PS7 (L3PS) catholyte in an electronically conductive carbon matrix, enabling high and balanced electronic/ionic conductivities in the cathode composite. The inherent porous structure of CMK-3 also helps to accommodate the strain/stress generated during the expansion and shrinkage of the active material. In sulfide-based all-solid-state batteries with Li metal as the anode, this cathode composite delivered a high capacity of 1025 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles at 60 °C at 1/8C. This work highlights the important role of high and balanced electronic and ionic conductivities in developing high-performance sulfur cathodes for ASSLSBs.

To solve the problem, the Chinese government proposes to replace coal-combustion heating with electricity-driven air-source heat-pump heating. In this article, the performance of an air-source heat pump was studied for suburban residential building heating in the winter in Beijing, China. The heating load of a typical suburban residential building was evaluated using a building energy simulation program according to real weather data. The performance of the heat pump was then evaluated, and the electrical load for such building heating was analyzed based on the hourly ambient temperature and heating load of the studied building. Results showed that the highest electrical load occurred between 3:00 and 7:00 and the lowest electrical load appeared between 13:00 and 15:00. These results are helpful in guiding electrical load transfer in the power grid. Compared with coal-combustion heating, heat-pump heating could save 59% of annual operating cost and reduce the emission of CO2, SO2, and NOx by 54%, 78%, and 74%, respectively.

The oxygen enrichment operation is one promising technology to reduce the carbon footprint in the ironmaking process. However, the oxygen enrichment ratio (OER) varies significantly in practices, and the proper one is still unclear, especially in terms of fuel rate saving and in-furnace phenomena. In this study, a multi-fluid BF model is used to quantitatively study the influence of oxygen enrichment on the BF process in terms of bosh gas volume, top gas composition, and inner thermochemical behaviors of solid–gas–liquid phases. Under the simulation conditions, the results show that for every increase of OER, the blast rate is decreased by ~ 85 m3/min and nitrogen content in reducing gas is decreased by ~ 1.13 pct; also, the top gas temperature is lowered by ~ 17 K, and the flame temperature is increased by 58.4 K. Descending of cohesive zone (CZ) inside the BF is observed with the region volume ratio decreased by ~ 0.102; the chemical reserve zone of wustite becomes much narrower and lower inside the BF, but does not disappear. The potential of carbon footprint mitigation in the BF process is discussed with the optimal OER recommended, 7.5 pct under the present simulation conditions. This model can help to build a comprehensive understanding of the fuel rate saving and CO2 emission reduction of a BF adopting an oxygen enrichment operation. © 2020, The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International.",,"Blast furnaces; Carbon footprint; Coal industry; Computational fluid dynamics; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Oxygen; CO2 emission reduction; Flame temperatures; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Influence of oxygen; Iron making process; Ironmaking blast furnace; Oxygen enrichment; Thermochemical behavior; Proven reserves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086425885

Cap carbonates are significant in providing a record of as-yet not fully understood ocean-chemical changes during the deglaciations following Snowball Earth events and in serving as readily recognizable event beds useful in global stratigraphic correlation of Neoproterozoic successions. Debate regarding the formation of cap carbonates has focused on three key issues: (1) alkalinity sources, (2) abiotic (chemical) versus biotic (microbial) precipitation, and (3) formation rates. Multiple hypotheses regarding cap carbonate formation have been advanced, including the weathering alkalinity model, the oceanic overturn model, the gas hydrate destabilization model, the plumeworld model, the starvation sediment model, the enhanced microbial activity model, and the calcareous loess model. We evaluated these models by considering their proposed solutions to the key issues above in the context of a global compilation of location, thickness, carbonate C-isotope, and paleomagnetic data for Cryogenian cap carbonates. Cap carbonates were probably produced through a combination of chemical and microbial processes in a strongly stratified deglacial ocean with a low-salinity lid. Correlation of δ13Ccarb profiles shows that cap carbonate precipitation began synchronously but terminated diachronously at a global scale. Cap carbonates are markedly thicker in low-paleolatitude regions, suggesting greater alkalinity production and/or more rapid carbonate precipitation in those regions, which favors alkalinity production through continental weathering rather than through oceanic upwelling or methane oxidation. Calculation of alkalinity production rates based on a range of cap carbonate masses and formation intervals shows that minimum masses (~2.2 × 1021 g, i.e., comprising only known continental deposits) could have been produced through intense continental weathering at short timescales (103–104 yr), validating rapid deposition models. Longer timescales of cap carbonate formation (105–106 yr) are not precluded by these calculations but are hard to reconcile with physical evidence of rapid accumulation and near-complete lack of terrigenous clastic impurities. Alkalinity production rate calculations also show that maximum cap carbonate masses (to ~14.4 × 1021 g; i.e., assuming unproven deep-ocean cap carbonate deposits) are probably unrealistic, requiring more alkalinity than could be generated even through a combination of mechanisms including continental weathering, deep-ocean microbial sulfate reduction, and methane release. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","alkalinity; deglaciation; Marinoan; Neoproterozoic; Snowball Earth; Sturtian","alkalinity; assessment method; carbonate system; chemical weathering; deglaciation; glaciation; Little Ice Age; microbial activity; Pleistocene; precipitation (chemistry); Proterozoic; stratigraphy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089476071

However, research evidence on its impact is mixed. To fill this gap, we construct a panel quantile regression model in this study to examine whether China's renewable energy development has effectively promoted a reduction in carbon emissions using panel data of 30 Chinese provinces from 2005 to 2016. The results show that: (1) Improving China's renewable energy development level is conducive to carbon emission reductions. Specifically, carbon intensity could drop by 0.084%–0.149% for every 1% increase in renewable energy generation. However, the inhibitory effect is limited due to trapped electricity as well as the fact that substituting renewable energy for fossil energy has not yet sufficiently transformed the energy consumption structure. (2) Renewable energy development has a greater impact on carbon intensity reduction in regions with high or low carbon intensity than in areas with intermediate carbon intensity. (3) The main factor in the decline in carbon intensity in China is a decrease in energy intensity. Nonetheless, the role of renewable energy in carbon reduction has increased over time. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions reduction; Chinese provinces; Panel quantile regression; Renewable energy development","carbon; carbon dioxide; alternative energy; carbon emission; climate change; development level; electricity; fossil fuel; resource development; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollution control; Article; carbon footprint; China; electricity; fossil energy; geography; gross national product; migration; renewable energy; urban area; urbanization; climate change; renewable energy; China; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Climate Change; Renewable Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084212186

However, their catalytic activities are hampered by charge recombination at deep level defects, which constitutes the critical challenge to practical applications of these oxide photocatalysts. To address the challenge, a strategy is proposed here that includes creating shallow-level defects above the deep-level defects and thermal activating the migration of trapped electrons out of the deep-level defects via these shallow defects. A simple and scalable solution plasma processing (SPP) technique is developed to process the presynthesized yellow TiO2 with numerous oxygen vacancies (Ov), which incorporates hydrogen dopants into the TiO2 lattice and creates shallow-level defects above deep level of Ov, meanwhile retaining the original visible absorption of the colored TiO2. At elevated temperature, the SPP-treated TiO2 exhibits a 300 times higher conversion rate for CO2 reduction under solar light irradiation and a 7.5 times higher removal rate of acetaldehyde under UV light irradiation, suggesting the effectiveness of the proposed strategy to enhance the photoactivity of colored wide-bandgap oxides for energy and environmental applications. © 2020 The Authors.

Therefore, the efforts to integrate these two approaches have been made by the political arrangements to seek the synergy effects and deal with trade-offs. To study the state of the art linkages and forest policies to realize both adaptation and mitigation, we systematically review the literature highlighting the topic (136 publications) and outline two different approaches from Germany and Japan as countries with substantial forest resources and high influences on international forest policies and wood trade. We identify three linkages: (1) an ecosystem (based) approach assuming that a resilient ecosystem (adaptation), has high potential as a carbon sink (mitigation), (2) a sustainable forest management (SFM) aiming for enhancing forests’ resilience and carbon sink potential simultaneously, and (3) a cross-sectoral approach generating synergies among multiple sectors of agriculture, forestry, urban design, and nature conservation. We find that a significant objective is still SFM for sustaining the forest area andwood production, where SFM examples in Germany and Japan exemplify contributions to carbon sinks and ongoing disaster risk management, respectively. Overall, the current differentiated objectives of SFM do not underpin the twofold approach and their synergy effects. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Under the agreement at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), covened in Paris, France (Paris Agreement), which requires all Parties to undertake emission reductions, the developing countries who were once exempted from emission reduction obligations are now becoming more and more important. This study focuses on mitigation actions in China, the largest carbon emitter, as well as the largest developing country in the world. Specifically, we examine Chinese Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) projects. The objective is to compare the reduction efficiency of three types of projects: simple abatement and completely renewable energy alternative projects at the supply side and demand side projects. From market-induced carbon leakage point of view, a dual market equilibrium model was built, with results showing that the key factors affecting the leakage rates are price elasticities of both demand and supply sides and market share parameters. In most cases, renewable energy alternative projects show the least leakage rate while demand side projects show the highest. Sensitivity analysis finds that leakage rates for the three types of projects are more sensitive to price elasticity parameters than market share parameters. Moreover, factors Ecde (electricity price elasticity of coal demand from coal-fired generation) and Eed (electricity price elasticity of electricity demand) affect not only the leakage rate of each project but also the comparative results between them. Although our study is based on China, the theoretical analysis is applicable in other regional voluntary emission reduction markets around the world. So, a systematic approach to comprehensively analyze the issue is summarized, based on which, we recommend two mitigation strategies to cope with the issue in offset projects in order to give managerial insights for the government. Firstly, the calculated leakage rates for different types of projects provide a new perspective to evaluate various offset projects, thus helping consider project types for priority validation. Secondly, we suggest to establish an accurate and classified discount coefficient system according to the project types to deal with the issue; the sensitivity analysis is helpful to find the most influential factors. A top-down approach to implement the strategy is proposed. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Certified emission reduction projects; Comparison; Market-induced carbon leakage; Reduction efficiency","carbon emission; climate change; developing world; emission control; environmental economics; market conditions; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077556868

Here, a concurrent effect refers to the occurrence of a latent impact during climate extremes, and a lagged effect appears sometime thereafter. Nevertheless, the uncertainties of these extreme drought effects on net carbon uptake and the recovery processes of vegetation in different Tibetan Plateau (TP) ecosystems are poorly understood. In this study, we calculated the Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) based on meteorological datasets with an improved spatial resolution, and we adopted the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach model to develop a net primary production (NPP) dataset based on multiple datasets across the TP during 1982-2015. On this basis, we quantised the net reduction in vegetation carbon uptake (NRVCU) on the TP, investigated the spatiotemporal variability of the NPP, NRVCU and SPEI, and analysed the NRVCUs that are caused by the concurrent and lagged effects of extreme drought and the recovery times in different ecosystems. According to our results, the Qaidam Basin and most forest regions possessed a significant trend towards drought during 1982-2015 (with Slope of SPEI &lt; 0, P &lt; 0.05), and the highest frequency of extreme drought events was principally distributed in the Qaidam Basin, with three to six events. The annual total net reduction in vegetation carbon uptake on the TP experienced a significant downward trend from 1982 to 2015 (-0.0018 ± 0.0002 PgC year-1, P &lt; 0.001), which was negatively correlated with annual total precipitation and annual mean temperature (P &lt; 0.05). In spatial scale, the NRVCU decrement was widely spread (approximately 55% of grids) with 17.86% of the area displaying significant declining trends (P &lt; 0.05), and the sharpest declining trend (Slope ≤-2) was mainly concentrated in southeastern TP. For the alpine steppe and alpine meadow ecosystems, the concurrent and lagged effects of extreme drought induced a significant difference in NRVCU (P &lt; 0.05), while forests presented the opposite results. The recovery time comparisons from extreme drought suggest that forests require more time (27.62% of grids ≥ 6 years) to recover their net carbon uptakes compared to grasslands. Therefore, our results emphasise that extreme drought events have stronger lagged effects on forests than on grasslands on the TP. The improved resilience of forests in coping with extreme drought should also be considered in future research. © 2020 by the authors.","Concurrent and lagged effects; Extreme drought; Net reduction in vegetation carbon uptake; Recovery time","Carbon; Drought; Ecosystems; Recovery; Vegetation; Annual mean temperatures; Meteorological datasets; Multiple data sets; Net primary production; Spatial resolution; Spatiotemporal variability; Terrestrial carbon cycle; Total precipitation; Forestry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089733478

In this perspective, we examine how degraded and abandoned farmland can be harnessed to fight climate change. Building upon and extending natural climate solutions, we suggest that the carbon capture and storage of abandoned farmland can be accelerated and maximized through restoring the diversity of plant species, applying biochar to soil, and co-developing renewable energy such as solar power. The benefits of these approaches extend far beyond climate-change mitigation and land restoration. © 2020 The AuthorsDegraded farmlands have been abandoned worldwide, especially in high- and middle-income countries. These lands help combat climate change as they undergo natural recovery of vegetation and soil carbon and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, recovery can be slow, requiring decades to centuries to approach pre-cultivation or natural states, and in some cases, soils remain degraded without active restoration. In this perspective, we present an overview of how carbon capture and storage on abandoned farmland can be accelerated and maximized via managing plant diversity as both a means and an end of restoration, creating and applying biochar to soil, and co-developing with renewable energy as techno-ecological synergies. These strategies can jointly tackle climate change and land degradation while contributing to and reinforcing multiple other Sustainable Development Goals. Although challenges exist, adoption of these strategies could be facilitated by increasing governmental and corporate initiatives at global and regional levels, especially developing carbon-offset markets for agriculture. © 2020 The Authors",,"adaptive management; alternative energy; carbon sequestration; climate change; environmental policy; environmental protection; policy implementation; renewable resource",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090541409

China's 70th National Day holidays, during which anthropogenic emissions were significantly reduced to ensure good air quality on Anniversary Day, provides a unique opportunity to investigate these processes. Atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC), OH reactivity, secondary transformation, O3 formation and VOCs-PM2.5 sensitivity are evaluated based on parameterization methods and simultaneous measurements of VOCs, O3, NOx, CO, SO2, PM2.5, JO1D, JNO2, JNO3 carried out at a suburban site between Beijing and Tianjin before, during, and after the National Day holiday 2019. During the National Day holidays, the AOC, OH reactivity, O3 formation potential (OFP) and secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAP) were 1.6 × 107 molecules cm−3 s−1, 41.8 s−1, 299.2 μg cm−3 and 1471.8 μg cm−3, respectively, which were 42%, 29%, 47% and 42% lower than pre-National Day values and −12%, 42%, 36% and 42% lower than post-National Day values, respectively. Reactions involving OH radicals dominated the AOC during the day, but OH radicals and O3 reactions at night. Alkanes (the degree of unsaturation = 0, (D, Equation (1)) accounted for the largest contributions to the total VOCs concentration, oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs; D ≤ 1) to OH reactivity and OFP, and aromatics (D = 4) to the SOAP. O3 production was identified as VOCs-limited by VOCs (ppbC)/NOx (ppbv) ratios during the sampling campaign, with greater VOCs limitation during post- National Day and more-aged air masses during the National Day. The VOCs-sensitivity coefficient (VOCs-S) suggested that VOCs were more sensitive to PM2.5 in low-pollution domains and during the National Day holiday. This study emphasizes the importance of not only the abundance, reactivity, and secondary transformation of VOCs but also the effects of VOCs on PM2.5 for the development of effective control strategies to minimize O3 and PM2.5 pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric oxidation capacity; National day; OH reactivity; Secondary transformation; VOCs-sensitivity coefficient","Air quality; Free radicals; Volatile organic compounds; Atmospheric oxidation capacity; Degree of unsaturations; Parameterization method; Photochemical reactivity; Secondary organic aerosols; Secondary transformation; Sensitivity coefficient; Simultaneous measurement; Pollution control; carbon monoxide; nitric oxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; ozone; volatile organic compound; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); oxidation; parameterization; particulate matter; photochemistry; radical; suburban area; volatile organic compound; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; atmosphere; chemical reaction; China; concentration (parameter); environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; exhaust gas; geography; leisure; mass fragmentography; meteorological phenomena; oxidation; particulate matter; photochemistry; secondary organic aerosol; suburban area; air pollutant; China; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; North China Block; Tianjin; Air Pollutants; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Holidays; Ozone; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084089790

To better understand the formation mechanisms of HCHO and its effects on ozone formation, carbonyl compounds were measured at a regional background site of Hong Kong from 20 August to 22 December 2012. Among the total observed carbonyls, Formaldehyde (HCHO, 2.00 ± 1.04 ppbv) presents the most abundant concentration and plays the most important role in OH removal with LOH value of 0.47 s−1. To further dissect the secondary formation mechanism of HCHO at Hok Tsui, detailed modeling analyses were conducted by the OBM-AOCP model for two cases with different meteorological conditions. The result shows that HCHO production was dominated by the reactions of CH3O + O2, and RO + O2 (first-generation precursor of RO was Alkenes). The HCHO destruction pathways during two cases were governed by the reactions with OH and photolysis. The net generation rate of HCHO was controlled by meteorological conditions with alkenes (mainly ethylene (C2H4) and propylene (C3H6)) being the dominant parent hydrocarbons of HCHO. Overall, this study provides some new insights into the formation mechanisms of HCHO, especially their parent hydrocarbon species, underlines the important role of carbonyls in ozone pollution in Hok Tsui. Reducing the emissions of alkenes would be an effective way to mitigate photochemical pollution in the background atmosphere of China. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbonyls; HCHO; O3; OBM-AOCP; Secondary formation","Ethylene; Formaldehyde; Ozone; Photolysis; Carbonyls; Formation mechanism; HCHO; Hydrocarbon species; Meteorological condition; OBM-AOCP; Photochemical pollution; Secondary formation; Air pollution; atmospheric modeling; background level; concentration (composition); formaldehyde; formation mechanism; ozone; photolysis; Cape d'Aguilar; China; Hong Kong; Hong Kong Island",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081407725

This study uses a spatial LCA model for willow biomass production to determine spatially explicit greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy return on investment (EROI), including land use conversion from pasture and cropland or grassland. There were negative GHG emissions on 92% of the land identified as suitable for willow biomass production, indicating this system’s potential for climate change mitigation. For willow planted on cropland or pasture, life cycle GHG emissions ranged from −53.2 to −176.9 kg CO2eq Mg-1. When willow was grown on grassland the projected decrease in soil organic carbon resulted in a slightly positive GHG balance. Changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) associated with land use change, transportation distance, and willow yield had the greatest impacts on GHG emissions. Results from the uncertainty analysis exhibited large variations in GHG emissions between counties arising from differences in these parameters. The average EROI across the entire region was 19.2. Willow biomass can be a carbon negative or low-carbon energy source with a high EROI in regions with similar infrastructure, transportation distances, and growing conditions such as soil characteristics, land cover types, and climate. © 2020 by the authors.

To investigate the movability of water, three shale samples were used to conduct flow experiments using the steady state and step-by-step depressurization method. The experimental results show that the movability of water strongly depends on the pressure gradient. Two water-related mechanisms, shear fluidity and electroviscous effect, are primarily responsible for the difference in movability between free water and bound water. The flow of water in these samples deviates from Darcy's law, and the threshold pressure gradient (TPG) is observed. When the pressure gradient is higher than the TPG, water starts to flow, and the permeability increases with increasing pressure gradient. Based on the analysis of the solid-liquid interfacial forces, the water in the shale was quantitatively classified into four types (L1, L2, L3, and L4) according to its movability. The calculation results indicate that most of the water, which could be up to 74.46–89.73%, is immovable under the experimental conditions. The proportion of movable water increases with increasing pressure gradient, and the relation can be expressed by a quadratic function. The moving ratio was defined as the ratio of the volume of water involved in flow to the total pore volume. The correlation between the moving ratio and permeability is a power function with exponents ranging from 1.16 to 1.43, indicating that water permeability is sensitive to the moving ratio. ©2020.

This study investigated the perceptions of primary healthcare professionals in Southern China on individual and institutional strategies for actions on health impacts of climate change and the related barriers. Methods: A mixed methodological approach was adopted, involving a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of 733 primary healthcare professionals (including medical doctors, nurses, public health practitioners, allied health workers and managers) selected through a multistage cluster randomized sampling strategy, and in-depth interviews of 25 key informants in Guangdong Province, China. The questionnaire survey investigated the perceptions of respondents on the health impacts of climate change and the individual and institutional actions that need to be taken in response to climate change. Multivariate logistic regression models were established to determine sociodemographic factors associated with the perceptions. The interviews tapped into coping strategies and perceived barriers in primary health care to adapt to tackle challenges of climate change. Contents analyses were performed to extract important themes. Results and conclusion: The majority (64%) of respondents agreed that climate change is happening, but only 53.6% believed in its human causes. Heat waves and infectious diseases were highly recognized as health problems associated with climate change. There was a strong consensus on the need to strengthen individual and institutional capacities in response to health impacts of climate change. The respondents believed that it is important to educate the public, take active efforts to control infectious vectors, and pay increased attention to the health care of vulnerable populations. The lack of funding and limited local workforce capacity is a major barrier for taking actions.

However, lean premixed combustion is subjected to combustion stability problems, which restrict the ground and altitude operation limits of the commercial engine. In this work, the effect of the swirl intensity of pilot inner swirler on combustion stability of a lean staged injector is experimentally and numerically studied. The lean staged injector is piloted by a dual swirler prefilm atomizer. The swirl intensity of the pilot inner swirler is varied by parameterizing the vane angle as +20 deg,-20 deg, and-35 deg, with-20 deg selected as the baseline with a counterswirling design. A single sector model combustor is designed, and the nonreacting flow field and fuel concentration distributions are measured by particle image velocimetry (PIV) and kerosene planar laser induced fluorescence (kerosene-PLIF) techniques. The alteration of swirl direction from counterswirling to coswirling induces a negligible effect on flow structures, but the spray distribution changes from a solid pattern to a hollow pattern. The increase in the pilot inner swirl intensity causes a shrunk cyclone recirculation zone (CRZ) and a reduction of kerosene concentration in the central region. The influences of the pilot inner swirler angle on combustion stability are evaluated. The ignition and lean blow-out (LBO) results show that the baseline injector exhibits excellent combustion stability, while the coswirling design holds the highest ignition and LBO fuel-Air ratio (FAR). In order to find out the physical mechanisms dominating the ignition and LBO processes, nonreacting numerical simulations are conducted to provide information regarding the flow structures and kerosene concentrations at ignition limits. Moreover, the ignition sequences are redefined as the radial flame propagation phase, the axial flame propagation phase, and the flame stabilization phase. The comparison of kerosene concentration along the radial and axial propagation routes concludes that the fuel enrichment in the two processes improves the ignition performance. On the other hand, the Karlovitz number of flame anchoring points in the flame rooting region is calculated to evaluate the flame stabilization characteristics. The results indicate that promoting the number of flame anchoring points and their radial range benefits the LBO performance. © 2020 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

In this study, satellite-derived surface-level PM2.5 concentration as well as landscape factors and socioeconomic data are collected to identify the inter-Annual variations and potential driving forces of population exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in Wuhan, China from 2000 to 2015. The fine-scale PM2.5 exposures in 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015 were first estimated. Then the contributions of landscape factors and socioeconomic forcing are quantified by a machine learning method (i.e. Random Forest). The results revealed that the population in Wuhan faced increasing and more clustering PM2.5 threats from 2000 to 2010. Then a weakened and dispersed health threat of PM2.5 was witnessed in 2015. In general, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) contributed the most to high-level PM2.5 exposure in the period of 2000-2015, i.e. variable importance (VIM) equalled to xxx. Among all the biophysical and landscape characteristics, the percentage of urban landscape (PLAND-UA) and urban area fraction were attributed the most to the PM2.5 population exposure. In parallel, precipitation played a crucial part in the mitigation of PM2.5 exposure. The identification of inter-Annual dynamics of population PM2.5 exposure and the underlying forcing can facilitate the decision making and epidemiological precautions in the evaluation and alleviation of population exposure risks. © Authors 2020.

The purpose of this study is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of GHG reductions and energy recovery potentials from MSW in Dammam, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). To achieve this purpose, the amount of generated landfill gas (LFG), the potential of energy recovery, and the environmental impacts in terms of GHG emissions were investigated. The methodology includes three waste management scenarios: i) a material recovery facility (MRF) with composting, ii) landfilling, and iii) incineration (waste-to-energy WtE). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), LandGEM, and iWARM of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) models were used to estimate GHG emissions, mitigation, and energy recovery. The results showed that scenarios 1 and 3 generated the least amount of GHG emissions of −2,142,618 tCO2-eq/yr and −287,873 tCO2-eq/yr, respectively. The global warming potentials (GWPs) for three scenarios revealed that the highest GHG reduction per ton of MSW was from scenario 1 (−1.091 tCO2-eq/t MSW) followed by scenario 3 (−0.147 tCO2-eq/t MSW) whereas scenario 2 generated a net GHG emission of +0.265 tCO2-eq/t MSW. Furthermore, the incineration option in scenario 3 would generate, on average, about 1.91 × 109 kWh/yr electricity, which could reduce fossil fuel usage by 1.12 × 106 barrels per year. The outcomes contribute to establishing strategy of cleaner energy production throughout the reduction of GHG emissions and energy recovery from MSW. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Composting; Greenhouse gases; Material recovery facility; Municipal solid waste; Waste-to-energy","Biogas; Climate models; Environmental Protection Agency; Facilities; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Magnetorheological fluids; Recovery; Waste incineration; Waste management; Comprehensive analysis; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas reductions; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Kingdom of Saudi Arabia; Management technologies; Material recovery facilities; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083455927

Indices such as consecutive dry and wet days, daily intensity, one-day highest precipitation, days with rainfall > 10 mm and 20 mm have been computed over the Godavari basin for the time period 1901–2015, and changes are compared between the two time periods 1901–1976 and 1977–2015. This study examines long-term trends on monthly and seasonal scales and climatological characteristics of EREs to understand the observed spatiotemporal changes in EREs. Analysis of EREs in the monsoon months further indicates significant trends over both traditionally “high-rainfall regions” (Humid) and “low-rainfall regions” (semiarid). In low-rainfall region, an increase in mean and coefficient of variability of annual rainfall has been identified during 1977–2015 as compared to pre-1977 period. It is also found that the month of September experienced statistically significant increase in frequency and intensity of all wet extreme rain indices during the period 1977–2015. Extremes in high- and low-rainfall regions show significant increase during 1977–2015 as compared to 1901–1976. Century scale analysis of extreme events with reference to regional level changes would help in looking at the grass root reality for the estimation of water budget as well as for developing region-specific adaptation measures and crop contingency plans. These findings would feed into state action plan for climate change to take appropriate measures to combat changing and rapidly occurring EREs in different climate zones of Godavari basin.

Currently, there is an increasing trend in China to build energy efficient passive houses that are capable of tolerating poor outdoor air pollution with tighter envelopes etc. This study aims to investigate the characteristics of indoor PM2.5 in the first passive residential building in Harbin and to compare them with those of a conventional building, considering different outdoor air qualities. The measurements and modeling of indoor PM2.5 were conducted in passive households (PHs) and conventional households (CHs). The air change rates were also quantitatively studied using the carbon dioxide (CO2) gas decay method and the supply airflow rate method. The results indicated that the residents of a severely polluted city had high health risks associated with exposure to PM2.5 that exceeded daily limits of 25 μg/m3. PHs could increase the acceptable time (≤75 μg/m3) ratios compared to CHs, under the limitation of heavy outdoor pollution owing to low filter efficiency. With a portable air cleaner, the CHs could reduce the PM2.5 exposure considerably; however, the ventilation rate may be insufficient. Regression analyses demonstrated that the PHs had a higher infiltration factor than the CHs, owing to the higher ventilation rate and insufficient filtration efficiency. To simultaneously obtain sufficient fresh air and maintain the PM2.5 concentrations below the guideline, mechanical ventilation with improved filtration efficiency is warranted; alternatively, a portable air cleaner is desirable. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Filtration efficiency; Mechanical ventilation; Passive house; PM2.5 concentration; Portable air cleaner","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Health risks; Housing; Regression analysis; Ventilation; Filtration efficiency; Measurements and modeling; Mechanical ventilation; Outdoor air pollution; Outdoor air qualities; PM2.5 concentration; Residential building; Severe cold regions; Air cleaners; aerosol composition; air quality; airflow; cold region; comparative study; concentration (composition); energy efficiency; filtration; indoor air; quantitative analysis; ventilation; winter; China; Harbin; Heilongjiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086075582

We conduct a retrospective analysis on 1979–2016 reanalysis data from ERA-Interim of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts over a region in North China to detect meteorological changes over the 38 years. No significant reduction in the northerly wind within the mixing layer is detected. Statistically significant increases are detected in the surface temperature, boundary layer height and dissipation, and significant decreases in relative humidity in the region between the first and second 19-year periods from 1979 to 2016. We build regression models of PM2.5 on the meteorological variables using data in 2014, 2015, and 2016 to quantify effects of the meteorological changes between the two 19-year periods on PM2.5 under the emission scenarios of 2014–2016. It is found that despite the warming, dew point temperature had been largely kept under control as the region had gotten dryer. This made the effects of temperature warming largely favorable to PM2.5 reduction as it enhances boundary layer height and dissipation. It is found that the meteorological changes would lead to 1.29% to 2.76% reduction in annual PM2.5 averages with January, March, and December having more than 4% reduction in the 3 years. Thus, the meteorological change in North China had helped alleviate PM2.5 to certain extent and should not be held responsible for the regional air pollution problem. ©2020.

Effects of interactions between different biochar and water content on N2O emissions from rice (Oryza sativa L.) paddy soils have not been thoroughly understood. We evaluated effects of different biochar (derived from Camellia oleifera fruit shell, FS; spent mushroom substrate made of Camellia oleifera fruit shell, MS; rice straw, RS; at the rate of 40 g kg−1) and water contents (70% and 120% water holding capacity, WHC) on N2O emissions from rice paddy soil fertilized with nitrogen (N, 0.2 g kg−1), and examined microbial functional genes associated with N2O emissions to understand the underlining mechanisms. The results showed that RS biochar was higher in pH, available N, dissolved organic N, and decreased more N2O emissions from soils with N and 120% WHC treatment relative to MS and FS biochar (by 363% and 200%, respectively). Although RS biochar potentially increased the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea amoA gene (AOA), changes in functional gene abundance did not concur with decreases in N2O emissions. Instead of changes in microbial communities, the relatively higher pH as well as lower available N and dissolved organic C and N of RS biochar could have contributed to the decrease in N2O emissions compared with MS and FS biochar. Thereby, the in situ application of rice straw via biochar could be considered in the mitigation of N2O emissions from fertilized rice paddy soil instead of biochar derived from ex situ feedstock. © 2020 Elsevier LtdMain finding of the work: Compared with MS and FS biochar derived from feedstock produced in Camellia oleifera industry, RS biochar mitigated more N2O emissions from fertilized paddy soils with higher water content, which could be considered in future mitigation practice of N2O emissions in intensively managed rice fields. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; Camellia oleifera; Microbial functional genes; Nitrous oxide; Paddy soil; Water regime","Ammonia; Feedstocks; Fruits; Genes; Greenhouse gases; Microorganisms; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Ammonia-oxidizing archaea; Camellia oleifera fruits; Dissolved organic C; Dissolved organic N; Microbial communities; Rice (Oryza sativa L.); Spent mushroom substrates; Water holding capacity; Gas emissions; biochar; charcoal; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; organic nitrogen; unclassified drug; water; biochar; charcoal; nitrous oxide; biochar; microbial community; nitrous oxide; paddy field; rice; soil emission; straw; waste; water content; ammonia oxidizing archaeon; Article; Camellia oleifera; China; controlled study; microbial community; microbial gene; nitrous oxide emission; paddy soil; pH; soil; soil analysis; soil fertilization; soil management; soil water content; water retention; agriculture; Oryza; Basidiomycota; Camellia oleifera; Oryza sativa; Agriculture; Charcoal; Nitrous Oxide; Oryza; Soil; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082876368

Here, we detected 40 elements in 24 h integrated daily PM2.5 samples collected in January 2014 from three typical Chinese metropolises (Beijing, Changchun, and Chengdu) to reflect elemental spatial variations, local sources, and regional transport. The measured elemental concentrations in Changchun were 11.1% and 48.4% higher than those in Beijing and Chengdu, respectively. Thus, PM2.5 from Changchun exhibited high levels and diversity in the elemental profile (characterized by high concentrations of industrial emission elemental markers). The results of elemental ratios and Pb isotopes proved that, except for a coal combustion source, vehicular emissions contributed more to PM2.5 heavy metals in Beijing than in the other two cities; Changchun PM2.5 elements received large contributions from industrial sources, including iron and steel manufacturing, and automobile industry. Moreover, crustal dust from long-range transport of regional air masses from the northwest regions of China played a crucial role in determining elemental levels in Beijing and Changchun, accounting for more than 50% of source intensity. However, a specific dominant source was not determined in Chengdu; the contribution of anthropogenic dust, mainly from construction activities, needs to be paid attention in Chengdu eastern area. This study contributed to enhancing our understanding of elemental spatial distribution characteristics and sources and to setting more judicious standards and strategies for PM2.5 bound heavy metals in China.

The staged optimization policy was employed to deal with the uncertainty of climate change. The GLUE method was adopted to analyze the uncertainty of urban hydrological model established by PCSWMM. Considering the uncertainty from urban hydrological simulation, the CCP model (one of the main methods of stochastic mathematical programming) was used to deal with the uncertainty of the optimization model. Subsequently, a case study of the Haidian Island of Hainan Province in China was used to demonstrate the proposed model. The result shows that the optimal investment is 183 million Yuan with a pumping capacity of 28.3 m3/s for the first stage and 38.4 m3/s for the next stage. The SOCU model is not only more flexible to adapt to climate change, but also is economically efficient (10% lower than implement-once plans). The urban drainage system design obtained from the SOCU model is more reliable and robust than traditional implement-once plans since the climate change and hydrological model uncertainty are simultaneously taken into account. Furthermore, the investment increases from 166 million Yuan to 195 million Yuan when the flood constraint satisfaction probability increases from 0.75 to 0.95. Therefore, the model could provide richer decision-making information than traditional implement-once plans and help decision makers seek a trade-off between system investment and acceptable flood damage. The study outcomes provide a reliable optimization model for urban drainage design and may have profound implications and contributions for urban flood management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Drainage system design; Staged optimization model; Uncertainty analysis; Urban flood management","Climate change; Computer programming; Constrained optimization; Decision making; Drainage; Economic and social effects; Flood control; Floods; Glues; Gluing; Investments; Mathematical programming; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Systems analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Chance-constrained programming; Constraint Satisfaction; Generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation; Hydrological modeling; Hydrological simulations; Optimization modeling; Urban drainage designs; Urban drainage systems; Climate models; climate change; flood damage; hydrological modeling; optimization; pumping; uncertainty analysis; urban drainage; Beijing [China]; China; Haidian; Hainan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083655990

After analysing the regional differences in YREB TFEE, the beta convergence model (BCM) was introduced to empirically explore the convergence of the YREB TFEE. The results show that: The YREB provinces (municipalities) differed greatly in TFEE. Among them, Shanghai, Zhejiang and Yunnan achieved the optimal TFEEs in the sample period; Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, Chongqing, and Sichuan realized relatively good TFEEs; Jiangxi and Guizhou did not output desirable TFEEs, leaving ample room for improvement. There were significant TFEE differences between the upstream, midstream, and downstream of the YREB. The three regions can be ranked as downstream, midstream, and upstream in descending order of the TFEE. The YREB TFEE exhibited significant absolute beta convergence. The midstream TFEE had the fastest absolute convergence speed, followed in turn by the upstream TFEE and the downstream TFEE. The addition of control variables improved the conditional convergence speeds of YREB TFEEs. Except energy structure (ECS), the control variables, including economic level (PGDP), foreign trade (TRD), environmental regulation (ERS), and urbanization rate (URB), exerted major impacts on the YREB TFEE. The impacts varied from region to region. The research results provide a good reference for energy saving and emission reduction in the YREB. © 2020 WITPress.

Here, we inspected the patterns and processes of deforestation in Zhejiang Province of China since 2000 under a background of national forest restoration. By integrating the Hansen high-resolution forest cover change products and a field study, the relationship between forest loss dynamics and topography and also the proximity to settlement and rivers, were evaluated. The results show that the total forest loss in Zhejiang Province was 266,984 ha in 2001–2018. Forest loss magnitude reached a maximum in 2008 and has maintained a high level of annual loss about 17,000 ha since. While forest loss patches are mainly located on the mountaintops, the slope and altitude of the deforested patches reached maximal values in 2008, and both of them decreased since then even though the amount of forest loss remains high. The most significant forest loss was recorded at the south of Zhejiang Province around Lishui City and the least forest loss was in the area of Jiaxing city near Hangzhou, the capital city of Zhejiang Province. The area of deforestation decreases while the distance to settlements increases. We analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics and potential factors that affect deforestation in Zhejiang Province and highlight the role of market and policy, which transformed land use.

Well-functioning vegetated roofs can provide various ecosystem services to urban residents (e.g., stormwater management, air pollution mitigation, and aesthetic value). Plants essentially determine the actualization of the ecosystem services, thus finding effective ways to establish and maintain the roof plants is important. While greenhouse experiments can be better controlled than field experiments, it is critical to test whether results gained in the greenhouse hold in actual roof conditions. Therefore, we investigated the effects of microbial inoculant, plant species, planting method, and their interactions on plant growth and the beneficial microbes in the roof substrate at the initial establishment of vegetated roofs. The selected plants (i.e., Antennaria dioica, Campanula rotundifolia, Fragaria vesca, Geranium sanguineum, Lotus corniculatus, Thymus serpyllum, Trifolium repens, and Viola tricolor) were established using pre-grown vegetation mats, plug plants, and seeds, each with and without the co-inoculation with Rhizophagus irregularis and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, two plant growth-promoting microbial species. Eventually, only F. vesca, T. serpyllum, T. repens, and V. tricolor were found successfully settled in either of the three planting methods. Dry aboveground plant biomass was measured to assess the effects of co-inoculation on plant growth. R. irregularis colonization level and B. amyloliquefaciens bacterial density were detected from root and substrate samples, respectively. The results indicated that co-inoculation with R. irregularis and B. amyloliquefaciens successfully colonized target plant species and significantly increased the initial growth of the vegetated roof plants by 18–292%. Additionally, the abundance of R. irregularis was affected by plant species (F. vesca > T. serpyllum > T. repens) and planting methods (seed > plug > mat), while the bacterial density of B. amyloliquefaciens was higher in T. repens roots than the other plant species, and was not affected by planning methods. The results suggest that co-inoculating R. irregularis and B. amyloliquefaciens at the installation phase of vegetated roofs could improve microbial settlement and colonization in the substrate, and consequently achieve synergistic effect on plant growth. The study also provides basis and reference for future vegetated roofs research. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; Plant growth-promoting; Planting methods; Rhizophagus irregularis; Vegetated roof","abundance; bacterium; colonization; ecosystem service; experimental study; field method; greenspace; growth rate; herb; inoculation; installation; microbial activity; urban population; Antennaria dioica; Bacillus amyloliquefaciens; Bacteria (microorganisms); Campanula rotundifolia; Fragaria vesca; Geranium sanguineum; Lotus corniculatus; Rhizophagus; Thymus serpyllum; Trifolium repens; Viola tricolor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086603812

The CuCl-PdOx hexagonal microplates were synthesized by a dual-potential electrodeposition technique, followed by electrochemical reduction to form Cu-Pd heterostructure. This Cu-Pd heterostructure exhibited a much higher CO2-to-CH4 selectivity (32 % Faradaic efficiency, FE) compared to pure Cu or Pd. Moreover, Cu-Pd heterostructure showed excellent suppression on C2H4 generation (below 1 % FE). The density functional theory calculations suggested that the hollow site of Pd region in the Cu-Pd heterostructure could stablize CO* intermediate and selectively lowered the energy demand for CH4 formation rather than C2H4.

This study investigated seasonal and interannual variations in the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) and CO2 flux from Lake Wuli, a small eutrophic urban lake in the heart of the Yangtze River Delta, China, based on a long-term (2000–2015) dataset. The results showed that the annual mean pCO2 was 1030 ± 281 μatm (mean ± standard deviation) with a mean CO2 flux of 1.1 ± 0.6 g m−2 d−1 during 2000–2015, suggesting that compared with other lakes globally, Lake Wuli was a significant source of atmospheric CO2. Substantial interannual variability was observed, and the annual pCO2 exhibited a decreasing trend due to improvements in water quality driven by environmental investment. Changes in ammonia nitrogen and total phosphorus concentrations together explained 90% of the observed interannual variability in pCO2 (R2 = 0.90, p &lt; 0.01). The lake was dominated by cyanobacterial blooms and showed nonseasonal variation in pCO2. This finding was different from those of other eutrophic lakes with seasonal variation in pCO2, mostly because the uptake of CO2 by algal-derived primary production was counterbalanced by the production of CO2 by algal-derived organic carbon decomposition. Our results suggested that anthropogenic activities strongly affect lake CO2 dynamics and that environmental investments, such as ecological restoration and reducing nutrient discharge, can significantly reduce CO2 emissions from inland lakes. This study provides valuable information on the reduction in carbon emissions from artificially controlled eutrophic lakes and an assessment of the impact of inland water on the global carbon cycle. © 2020 Elsevier LtdA eutrophic urban lake was a significant source of atmospheric CO2, but environmental investments significantly reduced CO2 emissions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Algal blooms; Anthropogenic activities; CO2 dynamics; Eutrophication; Urban lake","Ammonia; Eutrophication; Investments; Lakes; Organic carbon; River pollution; Water quality; Algal blooms; Anthropogenic activity; Ecological restoration; Environmental investments; Interannual variability; Long-term measurements; Seasonal and interannual variations; Urban lake; Carbon dioxide; ammonia; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; organic carbon; phosphorus; carbon dioxide; phosphorus; algal bloom; ammonia; annual variation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; concentration (composition); cyanobacterium; emission inventory; environmental management; eutrophic environment; eutrophication; lake water; nitrogen; phosphorus; pollution control; seasonal variation; water quality; water treatment; algal bloom; Article; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide tension; carbon dynamics; carbon footprint; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cyanophage; decomposition; ecosystem restoration; eutrophication; interannual variability; lake; measurement precision; nutrient dynamics; primary production (biomass); reduction (chemistry); seasonal variation; urban area; water quality; environmental monitoring; eutrophication; partial pressure; China; Jiangsu; Taihu Lake; Wuli Lake; Yangtze Delta; algae; Cyanobacteria; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; China; Environmental Monitoring; Eutrophication; Lakes; Partial Pressure; Phosphorus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082413378

Urban-rural wastes include all kinds of waste generated during human activities, which have a wide range from municipal solid waste (MSW) to agricultural residues and animal excrement, etc. In order to evaluate their potential for energy recovery and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in Guangdong province, the generation, spatial distribution and energy potential of three typical waste streams (i.e. MSW, agricultural residues and animal excrement) were investigated using statistical and estimation methods. Results showed that: (1) MSW was mainly concentrated in the Pearl River Delta, but agricultural residues and animal excrement mainly distributed in the East Wing, West Wing and Mountainous Areas; (2) energy potential of studied wastes at least can reach 15.661 million tons of coal-equivalent and corresponding GHG mitigation is 41.720 million tons CO2 equivalent.

In this study, daily PM2.5 samples were collected from September 2017 to August 2018 within the Guiyang urban area and the concentrations of the major WSIs in the PM2.5 samples were characterized. The results showed that the average concentration of SNA (SO42-, NO3-, NH4+) was 15.01 ± 9.35 μg m-3, accounting for 81.05% (48.71-93.76%) of the total WSIs and 45.33% (14.25-82.43%) of the PM2.5 and their possible chemical composition in PM2.5 was (NH4)2SO4 and NH4NO3. The highest SOR (sulfur oxidation ratio) was found in summer, which was mainly due to the higher temperature and O3 concentrations, while the lowest NOR (nitrogen oxidation ratio) found in summer may ascribe to the volatilization of nitrates being accelerated at higher temperature. Furthermore, the nitrate formation was more obvious in NH4+-rich environments so reducing NH3 emissions could effectively control the formation of nitrate. The results of the trajectory cluster analysis suggested that air pollutants can be easily enriched over short air mass trajectories from local emission sources, affecting the chemical composition of PM2.5. © 2020 by the authors.","Clustering analysis; Guiyang; PM2.5; SNA; Transformation mechanism","Ammonia; Cluster analysis; Nitrates; Sulfur compounds; Air mass trajectories; Average concentration; Chemical characteristic; Chemical compositions; Formation pathways; Regional transport; Transformation mechanisms; Water-soluble ions; Chemical analysis; aerosol composition; ammonium; concentration (composition); ion; nitrate; particulate matter; sulfate; urban atmosphere; China; Guiyang; Guizhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090036554

However, little is known about how different NF rates affect soil C balance (net ecosystem carbon budget, NECB) in flooded paddy ecosystems with SI. We conducted a two-year field experiment in a typical rice–wheat cropping system in southern China to investigate the response of soil C input (net primary production (NPP) and SI), output (ecosystem respiration and methane emissions), and NECB and N losses under five different NF rates (0/0, 120/90, 180/135, 240/180 and 300/225 kg N ha−1 for the rice/wheat season). Straw harvested from previous cropping season was chopped and fully incorporated into the soil prior to the next season. Our results showed that all treatments had a positive NECB value ranged between 4057–14380 kg C ha−1 yr−1. Compared with the no NF, NF treatments clearly increased the annual NECB by 17.2 %–185 % depending on NF rate. A 20 % reduction relative to the local NF rate (525 kg N ha−1) increased annual crop yield by 4.1 %–6.7 % and NECB by 9.6 %–16.8 %, which was attributed to the increase in NPP (2.6 %–6.2 %) and straw C input (3.8 %–6.1 %), and the decrease in ecosystem respiration (1.8 %–2.1 %) and methane emissions (8.4 %–10.4 %). Moreover, total reactive N losses were significantly decreased by 21 %. However, further reducing the rate by 40 % from local NF rate significantly decreased crop yield by 12.7 %–14.9 % and NECB by 16.7 %–19 %, mainly due to the significant decrease in soil C input through NPP by 14 %–18 % and straw C input by 7.4 %–15.8 % as the inadequate N supply impaired crop growth. Our results suggest that optimizing NF rate is effective in further enhancing soil C storage, decreasing N pollution and sustaining food security in paddy ecosystems with simultaneous SI. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem respiration; N fertilization; Net ecosystem carbon budget; Net primary production; Rice-cropping system; Straw incorporation","agricultural management; carbon sequestration; crop improvement; crop yield; fertilizer application; methane; paddy farming; paddy field; pollution incidence; soil amendment; soil carbon; straw; China; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083711271

And, the energy emission intensity effect and technological progress are the main driving forces for the reduction of three atmospheric pollutants, followed by the reduction effect of industrial structure and energy structure.

In order to study the transformation process and mechanism of the gas-liquid-solid tripe phase in biohydrogen production from coal, a biohydrogen production experiment from low-rank coal is carried out under laboratory conditions. The results show that: The daily gas production of hydrogen reaches a peak value of 1.23 mL/g on the fifth day. The cumulative hydrogen production is 6.24 mL/g. The pH of the liquid products gradually decreases to 5, and the Eh gradually increased from −180 to −50 mV during the experiment. The peak value of lignin degradation rate is 0.42% on the 7th day. The chemical oxygen demand (COD) first increases and then decreases. The highest COD is 4068 mg/L, and the final COD degradation rate is 46.3%. The peak values of cellulase are 0.021 mg/(mL h) and 0.223 mmol H2/(min mg) at 3 d later than that of hydrogenase. The absorbance of bacterial turbidity first increases and then decreases, with the community structure proving that the hydrolytic bacteria are dominated by Acinetobacter, Comamonas, Intestinimonas, and some fermentation bacteria, including Macellibacteroides. The changes of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and functional groups of carbon and oxygen in coal are obvious, with aliphatic carbon (methoxy, carbonyl, and so on) representing the main part of the biochemical reaction in the macromolecular structure of coal. The analysis of the three-phase state in the process of coal hydrogen production is helpful to study the mechanism of hydrogen production by coal fermentation from different perspectives, and also provides a reference for the promotion of coal hydrogen production by fermentation in the next step. © 2020 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Coal; Fermentation; Gas-liquid-solid tripe phase; Hydrogen; Transformation process","Bacteria; Chemical oxygen demand; Coal; Coal deposits; Degradation; Fermentation; Gas industry; Macromolecules; Methane; Oxygen; Photobiological hydrogen production; Bio-hydrogen production; Biochemical reactions; Biological hydrogen production; Community structures; Fermentation bacteria; Laboratory conditions; Macromolecular structures; Transformation process; Coal industry; Bacteria; Chemical Oxygen Demand; Coal; Degradation; Fermentation; Macromolecules",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087673662

In this study, a novel alkynylpyrene derivative 1 was synthesized, which exhibits unimolecular to excimer emission in methanol with an increasing concentration accompanied by the formation of nanovesicles via the π-π stacking, hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction. The self-assembly behavior as well as emission properties of 1 in aprotic polar solvents (ACN, acetone, DMF and DMSO) can also be adjusted by the volume fraction of the poor solvent H2O, which can induce 1 self-assembly to excimer state and could be applied in information transfer. Moreover, upon visible light irradiation, photoswitchable performance of nanovesicles of 1 was observed in which the emission markedly changes from yellow to blue; this is attributed to the cycloaddition reaction of alkynyl groups and singlet oxygen, which can be generated without the addition of external photosensitizers. The multi-responsive and fluorescence behavior of the alkynylpyrene derivative show that the self-assembly can be used to expand the development of this type of fluorophores, and the novel photoinduced tunability of the fluorescence emission provides an effective strategy to obtain high-performance transmitting and sensing materials.

However, the regulation of RTP emission faces great challenges because of untunable emissive lifetime and wavelength. Here, ultrahigh-yield acrylamide-based N-doped carbonized polymer dots (AN-CPDs) with ultralong RTP lifetime are synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal addition polymerization and carbonization strategy. The RTP lifetime and wavelength of the proposed AN-CPDs can be regulated by changing the carbonization degree. Thus, the AN-CPDs' RTP lifetimes are in the range of 61.4-466.5 ms, while the RTP emission wavelengths vary from 485 to 558 nm. Further experiment and theoretical calculation proved that RTP can be attributed to the polymer/carbon hybrid structure and nitrous functional groups as the molecular state related emission centers. Supramolecular cross-linking in the aggregated state is vital for the RTP emission of the AN-CPDs by restricting the nonradiative transition of the triplet excitons. AN-CPDs of different RTP lifetimes can be applied to time-resolved multistage information encryption and multistage anticounterfeiting. This work facilitates the optical regulation and application potential of CDs and provides profound insights into the effect of the polymer/carbon hybrid structure on the properties of CDs.

Annually integrated mass fluxes showed moderate variability of 14 ± 6 g m–2 yr–1 at 1000 m, 20 ± 6 g m–2 yr–1 at 2000 m and 21 ± 4 g m–2 yr–1 at 3800 m. Particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes were similar to the global median, indicating that the Subantarctic Southern Ocean exports considerable amounts of carbon to the deep sea despite its high-nutrient, low chlorophyll characteristics. The interannual flux variations were larger than those of net primary productivity as estimated from satellite observations. Particle compositions were dominated by carbonate minerals (&gt;60% at all depths), opal (∼10% at all depths), and particulate organic matter (∼17% at 1000 m, decreasing to ∼10% at 3800 m), with seasonal and interannual variability much smaller than for their flux magnitudes. The carbonate counter-pump effect reduced carbon sequestration by ∼8 ± 2%. The average seasonal cycle at 1000 m had a two-peak structure, with a larger early spring peak (October/November) and a smaller late summer (January/February) peak. At the two deeper traps, these peaks became less distinct with a greater proportion of the fluxes arriving in autumn. Singular value decomposition (SVD) shows that this temperate seasonal structure accounts for ∼80% of the total variance (SVD Mode 1), but also that its influence varies significantly relative to Modes 2 and 3 which describe changes in seasonal timings. This occurrence of significant interannual variability in seasonality yet relatively constant annual fluxes, is likely to be useful in selecting appropriate models for the simulation of environmental-ecological coupling and its role in controlling the biological carbon pump.

Fischer plots have been widely used to extract accommodation changes from carbonate platforms, but there are few published studies of siliciclastic or mixed carbonate-siliciclastic environments. The Middle Devonian of the Appalachian Basin is penetrated by thousands of wells, is exposed in numerous exceptional outcrops, and is an excellent place to test the usefulness of accommodation history plots as correlation tools. In the past, researchers have used cores, well cuttings, well logs, and outcrop gamma-ray profiles to correlate between outcrop and subsurface data, but all these methods have their limitations. Gamma-ray logs for wells penetrating the Middle Devonian from eight locations, from Preston County in the east to Wetzel County, West Virginia, in the west, were used in this study. Accommodation cycle thicknesses were measured from gamma-ray logs, printed at a vertical scale of one inch per ten feet (2.5 cm/3 m). The accommodation cycle thickness data were entered into Antun Husinec's FISCHERPLOTS program to produce accommodation plots. Next, well-documented, outcrop-based sequence stratigraphy was used to help interpret the results of the accommodation plots. This study demonstrates that using accommodation plots is a novel way of overcoming the uncertainties and biases of other methods. The use of this approach in other mixed carbonate-siliciclastic successions with abundant subsurface data would help to demonstrate that Fischer plots are a novel and useful approach that can help remove many of the uncertainties and biases encountered in stratigraphic correlation. © 2020 The Geological Society of America.

Fixing the polymer chain architecture without sacrificing the internal free volume and thereby the membrane permeability remains a grand challenge. The venation architecture in plant leaf, featured by its stable vein structure with abundant interveinal spaces, offers us an inspiration for designing a highly permeable and stable chain architecture. Here, we construct a venation-like chain architecture in polyphenylene oxide (PPO) membrane by introducing numerous interchain crosslinking bridges using Friedel-Crafts-based hypercrosslinking reaction. These crosslinking bridges rigidify the chains and prevent them from dense packing, inhibiting the microstructural deformation, while simultaneously generating abundant free volume. The resulting membranes display ultrahigh CO2 permeability of 5130 Barrer (73-fold higher than pristine PPO membrane), along with superior structural stability. Particularly, the plasticization is fully suppressed under high pressure even up to 70 bar and the physical aging-induced loss of CO2 permeability is reduced remarkably down to as low as 19% after 360 days, transcending most of the state-of-the-art membranes. This venation-like chain architecture opens a new avenue to solving the current permeability-stability dilemma for the implementation of polymer membrane technology. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon capture; Microporous organic membrane; Physical aging; Plasticization; Venation-like chain architecture","Architecture; Carbon dioxide; Crosslinking; Deformation; Free volume; Polyphenylene oxides; Stability; Application of polymers; Chain architecture; Interchain crosslinking; Membrane permeability; Microstructural deformation; State of the art; Structural stabilities; Undesirable deformation; Membrane technology; carbon; carbon dioxide; plasticizer; polyphenylene; polyphenylene oxide; unclassified drug; Article; artificial membrane; cross linking; membrane permeability; priority journal; Aging; Carbon Dioxide; Chains; Deformation; High Pressure; Membranes; Permeability; Stability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085110841

By the end of July 2019, there had been 150 outbreaks of ASF in 31 provinces, including 146 in domestic pigs and four in wild boar. The Chinese Government attaches great importance to the prevention and control of ASF. The Chinese animal health authority promptly launched the highest-priority emergency response against this key animal disease; initiated an extensive surveillance network covering all provinces; formulated and promulgated supporting policies, such as compensation for culled animals and financial credit for affected producers; and established a joint coordination body for ASF prevention and control, led by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs and involving a further 20 Ministries, including the Departments of Transportation, Customs and Market Supervision. All levels of local government undertook territorial management responsibilities and developed support policies to encourage all stakeholders to take part in ASF prevention and control. Furthermore, the Chinese Government developed a strategy that integrated both the legal and scientific aspects of ASF control, formulating and releasing a comprehensive policy for the whole pork production chain 'from farm to fork'. The plan included daily disease reports from the disease monitoring network, and adopted effective measures, such as blockades and culling, restricting live pig movements and implementing controls on swill feeding, to cut off viral transmission routes to the greatest extent possible.Le premier foyer de peste porcine africaine (PPA) enregistré en République populaire de Chine a été confirmé au début du mois d’août 2018. Fin juillet 2019, au total 150 foyers de PPA avaient été notifiés, répartis dans 31 provinces et affectant des porcs domestiques (146 foyers) et des sangliers (4 foyers). Le gouvernement chinois attache une grande importance à la prévention et au contrôle de la PPA. Les autorités chinoises en charge de la santé animale ont rapidement lancé un plan d’intervention d’urgence hautement prioritaire contre cette épizootie majeure. Un réseau extensif de surveillance couvrant toutes les provinces a ainsi été mis en place et diverses mesures de soutien ont été appliquées, en particulier l’indemnisation des éleveurs dont les animaux avaient été abattus et un dispositif de crédit pour les producteurs affectés. En outre, un organisme conjoint de coordination de la prévention et de la lutte contre la PPA a été créé sous la direction du ministère de l’Agriculture et des affaires rurales, avec la participation de vingt autres ministères dont ceux en charge du transport, des douanes et de la surveillance des marchés. Tous les niveaux de gouvernement local ont assumé des responsabilités de gestion territoriale et mis en place une politique de soutien afin d’encourager l’ensemble des acteurs à participer à la prévention et au contrôle de la PPA. De plus, le gouvernement chinois a élaboré une stratégie intégrant les aspects tant juridiques que scientifiques de la lutte contre la PPA à travers une panoplie complète de mesures couvrant l’intégralité de la filière porcine « de la ferme à la table ». Le plan prévoyait l’émission de rapports quotidiens par le réseau de surveillance de la PPA et diverses mesures effectives dont des ordres de blocus et d’abattage, la restriction des mouvements de porcins et le contrôle des eaux grasses destinées à l’alimentation animale, afin de faire barrage aux voies de transmission du virus, dans toute la mesure du possible.A principios de agosto de 2018 se confirmó el primer brote de peste porcina africana (PPA) registrado en la República Popular de China.

El Gobierno chino concede gran importancia a la prevención y el control de la PPA. El organismo de sanidad animal del país activó con prontitud la respuesta de emergencia de máxima prioridad contra esta importantísima enfermedad animal, poniendo en marcha una extensa red de vigilancia que cubría todas las provincias, formulando y promulgando políticas de acompañamiento (con medidas como las indemnizaciones por animales sacrificados o créditos destinados a los productores afectados) y estableciendo un órgano conjunto de coordinación para la prevención y el control de la PPA, dirigido por el Ministerio de Agricultura y Asuntos Rurales y con presencia de otros 20 ministerios, incluidos los departamentos de Transporte, Aduanas y Supervisión de Mercados. Las administraciones locales de todos los niveles asumieron responsabilidades de gestión territorial y definieron políticas de apoyo para alentar a todos los interlocutores a tomar parte en las labores de prevención y control de la PPA. Además, el Gobierno chino elaboró una estrategia que integraba los aspectos tanto jurídicos como científicos de la lucha contra la PPA, formulando e implantando una política global que abarcaba la totalidad de la cadena de producción porcina, desde la pocilga hasta el plato del consumidor. El plan incluía informes cotidianos de la red de seguimiento de la enfermedad, así como la adopción de medidas eficaces, como bloqueos y sacrificios sanitarios, la restricción de los desplazamientos de cerdos vivos y la aplicación de controles a la alimentación de animales con desechos, todo ello con el fin de neutralizar en la mayor medida posible las vías de transmisión del virus.","African swine fever (ASF); China; Emergency preparedness; Exotic animal diseases; Pig; Prevention and control; Swine","African swine fever; African swine fever virus; animal; China; civil defense; pig; swine disease; African Swine Fever; African Swine Fever Virus; Animals; China; Civil Defense; Sus scrofa; Swine; Swine Diseases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092944442

It then investigates the barriers to the construction and operation of the public charging piles based on a field survey in 101 communities in Beijing, China. We find that insufficient public charging piles would significantly limit the sales of electric vehicles, in particular when the public charging piles are built up for specific users or in developed regions where private parking spaces are limited. It is found that the top four barriers are limited parking spaces, complicated circuit modification, unclear responsibilities for property management companies, and the objection or high mobility of existing parking space users. © 2020 by the authors.","China; Electric vehicle; Panel regression; Public charging pile; Questionnaire survey","carbon emission; concentration (composition); electric vehicle; field survey; parking; regression analysis; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090083065

Given the important role of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) in ammonia oxidation and their involvement in N2O production, a clear understanding of the knowledge on archaeal N2O production is necessary for global N2O mitigation. Compared to bacterial N2O production by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), AOA-driven N2O production pathways are less-well elucidated. In this Critical Review, we synthesized the currently proposed AOA-driven N2O production pathways in combination with enzymology distinction, analyzed the role of AOA species involved in N2O production pathways, discussed the relative contribution of AOA to N2O production in both natural and anthropogenic environments, summarized the factors affecting archaeal N2O yield, and compared the distinctions among approaches used to differentiate ammonia oxidizer-associated N2O production. We, then, put forward perspectives for archaeal N2O production and future challenges to further improve our understanding of the production pathways, putative enzymes involved and potential approaches for identification in order to potentially achieve effective N2O mitigations.

The coal seam with moisture contents has unique damage deformation characteristics that differ from dry coal. Therefore, the damage deformation characteristics of coal seam with different moisture contents need to be investigated to enhance the effects of coal mining and gas extraction. To explore the damage and deformation laws and acoustic emission (AE) characteristics of coal samples with different moisture contents, coal samples with different moisture contents were prepared for triaxial compression AE localization tests, and the stress-strain characteristic parameters and AE counts, cumulative AE counts, AE energy, and cumulative AE energy of coal samples were prepared. The damage models of coal samples with different moisture contents were established based on AE counts, and the damage and deformation laws were analyzed. Results show that the peak intensities of coal samples decrease with the increase in moisture contents, the dry coal sample mainly undergoes shear failure, and the water-containing coal samples are pronounced by lateral splitting. The peak and cumulative AE counts of the coal samples decreased as the moisture contents increased. The peak and cumulative AE energies of coal samples decreased with the increase in moisture contents. The damage model established based on AE counts has a high degree of fit. Moreover, the damage amount of the coal samples increased with the moisture contents. The conclusions obtained in this study have practical guiding significance for demonstrating the mechanism and process of coal body dynamic disasters in actual engineering. © 2020, Strojarski Facultet.

In this study, the relationship between energy consumption, environmental regulation and carbon emissions is quantitatively examined after taking full control of spatial effects and potential endogeneity. To comprehensively analyze the effects of environmental regulation, it is also divided into performance-based environmental regulation and cost-based environmental regulation. To control endogenous problems caused by causal relationships between variables and allow possible nonlinear relationships between energy consumption and carbon emissions, a newly developed dynamic threshold panel model that incorporates the characteristics of generalized method of moments (GMM) is utilized to explore how energy consumption affects carbon emissions under different environmental regulations. The estimation results indicate that the rising energy consumption has an important role in promoting carbon emissions, but the promotion effect has declined as the level of environmental regulation increased. Furthermore, given that there is remarkable gap in economic and social development across different Chinese regions, the relationship is reexamined for three geographical regions (i.e., east, center and west). The results indicate that energy consumption significantly promoted carbon emissions in the three regions, and the promotion effect in the western region was highest. In addition, there is evidence that environmental regulation has effectively constrained the increase in carbon emissions in eastern and central China, while it did not function as expected to curb carbon emissions in the western region. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Dynamic threshold model; Energy consumption; Environmental regulation; Spatial durbin model","Carbon; Energy utilization; Geographical regions; Method of moments; Sustainable development; Causal relationships; Dynamic threshold; Economic and social development; Environmental issues; Estimation results; Generalized method of moments; Non-linear relationships; Performance based; Environmental regulations; carbon emission; energy use; environmental economics; environmental issue; environmental policy; numerical model; panel data; regulatory framework; sustainable development; threshold; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083210009

By spatio-temporal coordination of hydropower production over larger regions, the energy storage demand will be reduced and contribute to a “virtual” energy storage gain that in Europe was found to be almost twice the actual energy storage capacity of hydropower reservoirs. In an attempt to quantify this gain, hydropower availability was simulated for most parts of the European continent for a 35-year period based on historical hydrometeorological data. The most significant benefits from spatio-temporal management arise at distances between 1200 and 3000 km, i.e., on the continental scale, which can have implications for a future renewable energy system at large. Furthermore, we discuss a condition termed “energy-domain-specific drought”, which is a risk that can be reduced by the spatio-temporal management of power production.

However, these data do not take into account the health consequences of air pollution for unborn children. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of the fine particulate matter air pollution (less than 2.5 μm in diameter) on pregnancy outcomes. An analysis of pregnant women and their children was made using a questionnaire survey from a nationwide study conducted in 2017. Questionnaires from 1095 pregnant women and data from their medical records were collected. An analysis of air pollution in Poland was conducted using the air quality database maintained by the Chief Inspectorate for Environmental Protection in Poland. A higher concentration of PM2.5 was associated with a decrease in birth weight and a higher risk of low birthweight (i.e., <2500 g). We also observed lower APGAR scores.

For example, it is crucial to understand how plant physiological performance varies through time for different functional groups to forecast how terrestrial ecosystems will respond to change. Here, we tracked the seasonal progress of 13 plant species representing C3 shrub, perennial C3 and C4 grass, and annual forb functional groups of the Colorado Plateau, USA. We tested for differences in carbon assimilation strategies and how photosynthetic rates related to recent, seasonal, and annual precipitation and temperature variables. Despite seasonal shifts in species presence and activity, we found small differences in seasonally weighted annual photosynthetic rates among groups. However, differences in the timing of maximum assimilation (Anet) were strongly functional group-dependent. C3 shrubs employed a relatively consistent, low carbon capture strategy and maintained activity year-round but switched to a rapid growth strategy in response to recent climate conditions. In contrast, grasses maintained higher carbon capture during spring months when all perennials had maximum photosynthetic rates, but grasses were dormant during months when shrubs remained active. Perennial grass Anet rates were explained in part by precipitation accumulated during the preceding year and average maximum temperatures during the past 48 h, a result opposite to shrubs. These results lend insight into diverse physiological strategies and their connections to climate, and also point to the potential for shrubs to increase in abundance in response to increased climatic variability in drylands, given shrubs’ ability to respond rapidly to changing conditions. © 2020, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Colorado Plateau; Drought; Ecophysiology; Photosynthesis; Water-use efficiency","carbon cycle; climate change; growth; plant community; terrestrial ecosystem; Colorado Plateau; United States; Poaceae; carbon; Colorado; ecosystem; Poaceae; season; Carbon; Colorado; Ecosystem; Poaceae; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088785816

We conducted a common garden experiment to explore the combined effects of decreasing cloud influence—lower humidity, warmer temperature, brighter light—and meteorological drought (i.e. absence of rain) on the physiology and morphology of vascular epiphytes native to primary forests of Monteverde, Costa Rica. The epiphytes, which exhibited C3 photosynthesis, were sourced from a lower montane cloud forest (CF) or a rainforest (RF) below the current cloud base and transplanted into nearby shadehouses (CF or RF shadehouse respectively). Vapour pressure deficit (VPD) and light availability, measured as photosynthetically active radiation, were 2.5 and 3.1 times higher in the RF than the CF shadehouse. Half of the plants were subjected to a severe 4-week drought followed by a recovery period, and the other half were watered controls. Plants subjected to low VPD/light conditions of the CF shadehouse were physiologically and morphologically resistant to the drought treatment. However, compared to control plants, both sources of plants subjected to high VPD/light conditions of the RF shadehouse experienced declines in maximum net photosynthesis (Amax), stomatal conductance (gs) and the proportion of healthy leaves (those not exhibiting chlorosis, desiccation or necrosis). At peak drought, leaves from the RF were 19% thinner than controls. Within 7–14 days after rewatering, Amax, gs and leaf health recovered to nearly the levels of controls. Growth rate, mortality and phenology were unaffected by the treatments. The divergent responses to drought in the CF versus RF shadehouses, combined with the recovery in the RF shadehouse, indicate that these epiphytes possess adaptive properties that confer low resistance, but high recovery capacity, to episodes of short-term drought over a range of cloud influence. In addition, the reduction in Amax suggests stomatal regulation that favours water conservation over carbon acquisition, a strategy that may inform epiphyte responses to rising clouds and increasing drought frequency expected in the long term.

At the same time, Pacific Island nations are economically and technically under-resourced in the face of tremendous environmental challenges. Destructive weather events, ocean acidification, mining, logging, overfishing, and pollution increasingly degrade ecosystems and affect fishing, farming, and other cultural practices of Pacific Islanders. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to understand and analyse the role of law and governance in responding to these pressures in the Pacific. Drawing on academic and practitioner expertise from the Pacific region, as well as Europe and the United States, this unique collection navigates the major environmental law and governance challenges of the present and future of the Pacific. Environmental Law and Governance in the Pacific discusses 21 Pacific Island countries and territories, including Cook Islands, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Samoa, and a broad range of themes, such as deep-sea mining, wetlands and mangroves, heritage, endangered species, human rights, and access to justice, are addressed, thus providing a comprehensive and state-of-the-art overview of environmental law and governance within specific jurisdictions as well as across the Pacific region as a whole. This volume will be essential reading for students and scholars interested in environmental law and governance in the Pacific region, as well as policy-makers, practitioners and NGOs involved in the development and implementation of environmental law and policy. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh and Evan Hamman.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091959477

One of the risks of relying on beaver to enhance ecosystem water storage is that their dams are reportedly more apt to fail during floods which can exacerbate flood severity. Missing are observations of beaver dam persistence and water storage capacity during floods, information needed to evaluate the risk of relying on beaver as a nature-based flood solution. A June rainstorm in 2013 triggered the largest recorded flood in the Canadian Rocky Mountains west of Calgary, Alberta. We opportunistically recorded hydrometric data during the rainfall event at a beaver-occupied peatland that has been studied for more than a decade. We supplemented these observations with a post-event regional analysis of beaver dam persistence. Results do not support two long-held hypotheses—that beaver ponds have limited flood attenuation capacity and commonly fail during large flood events. Instead we found that 68% of the beaver dam cascade systems across the region were intact or partially intact after the event. Pond fullness, in addition to the magnitude of the water-sediment surge, emerged as important factors in determining the structural fate of dam cascade sequences. Beaver ponds at the instrumented site quickly filled in the first few hours of the rain event and levels were dynamic during the event. Water storage offered by the beaver ponds, even ones that failed, delayed downstream floodwater transmission. Study findings have important implications for reintroducing beaver as part of nature-based restoration and climate change adaptation strategies. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2013 Alberta flood; beaver dams; Canadian Rockies; Castor canadensis; nature-based flood solutions; surface hydrology","Dams; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Floods; Lakes; Rain; Regional planning; Storms; Cascade systems; Climate change adaptation; Flood attenuation; Hydrological impacts; Hydrometric data; Regional analysis; Riparian ecosystem; Water storage capacity; Climate change; extreme event; flood; hydrometry; peatland; rainfall; rainstorm; rodent; water storage; Alberta; Calgary; Canada; Rocky Mountains; Castor canadensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087725813

However, the contributions of specific income classes and the effects of their population expansion have not been quantitatively evaluated. Here, we incorporated national household surveys with input-output tables from 2010–2016 and used structural decomposition analysis to determine the effects at both the national and sectoral levels. We found that the urban and rural middle classes (including lower-middle, middle, and higher-middle income groups), accounting for 39% and 27% of the total population, contributed nearly 40% and 15% of the total household consumption emissions in 2016, respectively. In comparison, the urban rich class contributed 32% of carbon emissions, with only 11% of the total population in 2016. Furthermore, the population expansion of the urban middle and rich classes strongly drove the growth of emissions from 2012 to 2016 (26% and 38% of the total increase, respectively). The consumption pattern changes of the middle and rich classes drove 131% and 83% of the growth from 2010 to 2016, respectively. Other factors, e.g., carbon intensity and industrial structure, exerted negative effects in some years. Thus, the rising middle and rich classes were the primary drivers of China's carbon emissions. Energy supply, metal smelting, wholesale and retail were the most affected sectors. The results suggested a sustained pressure of climate change mitigation in consideration of its grand plan for middle-class expansion. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; Consumption pattern; Input-output model; Middle class; Structural decomposition analysis","Carbon; Climate change; Economic analysis; Expansion; Population statistics; Surveys; Climate change mitigation; Consumption patterns; Household Consumption; Household surveys; Industrial structures; Input-output table; Population expansion; Structural decomposition analysis; Urban growth; carbon emission; class; climate change; consumption behavior; decomposition analysis; household income; household survey; population growth; urban population; Article; carbon footprint; chemical analysis; chemical structure; China; decomposition; economic status; energy resource; highest income group; middle income group; rural population; urban population; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082854844

While an inland propagation of abrupt temperature changes into Eurasia from the North Atlantic realm during the last glacial (Weichselian) receives increasingly broad support, much less is known regarding the penultimate glacial (Saalian) temperature variability, especially from a continental interior perspective. Here, we present a TEX86-derived lake surface temperature (LST) record from the former Black Sea “Lake” covering nearly the entire Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6. While orbital-scale LST cooling likely relates to meltwater discharge from the retreating Eurasian Ice Sheet during insolation maxima, millennial-scale LST variability suggests interstadial warming in phase with Greenland and northern Mediterranean Sea temperature records during the first half of MIS 6. Although summer insolation reached an interglacial-like level during this period, we propose that the reduced extent of the Eurasian Ice Sheet associated with northward shifted atmospheric fronts was ultimately responsible for the inland propagation of Dansgaard-Oeschger-like temperature variability. During the second half of MIS 6, temperature patterns across the North Atlantic-Eurasian corridor were more variable and less comparable with each other, likely because of the larger continental ice sheet weakening northern hemisphere atmospheric teleconnections. Temperature records across the North Atlantic-Eurasian realm suggest a weaker atmospheric teleconnection during MIS 6 compared to MIS 3, likely related to a stronger imprint of the Eurasian Ice Sheet on the continental and regional climate. © 2020.

Remote Terminal Units and SCADAs monitor these networks primarily at the substation level. However, with the widespread integration of Distributed Generation units (DGs), the need for real-time control of Active Distribution Networks is urgent. While DGs can improve the performance of power systems through voltage support, price elasticity, and reduced emissions of greenhouse gases, they also present challenges such as voltage spikes and bidirectional power flows. The distribution systems' state needs to be known accurately with high refresh rates and low time latency to deal with these issues. Real-time state estimation (SE) that use of Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) data allows the prediction of the distribution systems' nodal voltages and phasor angles. This paper presents a performance analysis comparison between the Weighted Least Square (WLS) and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithms on active distribution grids. The WLS is a static SE algorithm, while EKF is a recursive SE method. The paper first recounts the analytical formulation of both approaches and then quantifies the differences in their performance. The tests were carried out on a modified IEEE-33 bus test feeder that included an optimally placed DG. For the test feeder's nodes load profile, the PMU-data generated during the ADRES-CONCEPT project was used. MATLAB and OpenDSS software were used to run the experiments. The results show that if the process model is correct, the EKF approach performs better. © 2020 IEEE.","Active Distribution System State Estimation; Extended Kalman Filters; Optimal DG placement; Phasor Measurement Units; State Estimators; Weighted Least Squares","Computerized tomography; Greenhouse gases; MATLAB; Phasor measurement units; Real time control; State estimation; Active distribution networks; Active distribution systems; Analytical formulation; Bidirectional power flow; Distributed generation unit (DGs); Extended Kalman filter algorithm; Power distribution system; Weighted least squares; Extended Kalman filters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095116234

Here, we quantitatively investigated the variation of air pollutants in China using long-term comprehensive data sets from 2013 to 2017, during which Chinese government made major efforts to reduce anthropogenic emission in polluted regions. Our results show a significant decreasing trend in the PM2.5 concentration in heavily polluted regions of eastern China, with an annual decrease of ∼7% compared with measurements in 2013. The measured decreased concentrations of SO2,NO2 and CO (a proxy for anthropogenic volatile organic compounds) could explain a large fraction of the decreased PM2.5 concentrations in different regions. As a consequence, the heavily polluted days decreased significantly in corresponding regions. Concentrations of organic aerosol, nitrate, sulfate, ammonium and chloride measured in urban Beijing revealed a remarkable reduction from 2013 to 2017, connecting the decreases in aerosol precursors with corresponding chemical components closely. However, surface-ozone concentrations showed increasing trends in most urban stations from 2013 to 2017, which indicates stronger photochemical pollution. The boundary-layer height in capital cities of eastern China showed no significant trends over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta regions from 2013 to 2017, which confirmed the reduction in anthropogenic emissions. Our results demonstrated that the Chinese government was successful in the reduction of particulate matter in urban areas from 2013 to 2017, although the ozone concentration has increased significantly, suggesting a more complex mechanism of improving Chinese air quality in the future. © 2020 The Author(s).","Air pollution; Chemical composition; China; Clean-air action; Particulate matter; Surface ozone","Aerosols; Air quality; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Chlorine compounds; Ozone; River pollution; Sulfur dioxide; Volatile organic compounds; Air pollutant concentrations; Air pollution in chinas; Anthropogenic emissions; Boundary layer heights; Pearl River Delta region; Photochemical pollution; Surface ozone concentrations; Yangtze river delta; Ozone layer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096840666

However, the issue of energy and environment has challenged the sustainable development of the industry a lot in China. Investigating the non-separable relationship among energy, capital, and CO2 emission under natural and managerial disposability, this paper proposes two hybrid measure approaches to measure unified environmental efficiency of industry in China during 2011–2016. Besides, production efficiency, emission efficiency, damage to scale, and return to scale of 30 regions in China are calculated and recognized. The results show that (1) unified environmental efficiency of Chinese industry under natural disposability is higher than that under managerial disposability in early few years, but they are close to each other finally. (2) Unified environmental efficiency gaps among regions under natural disposability are wider than those under managerial disposability. Increasing capital investment and improving technology can help reduce efficiency gaps among regions. (3) It is available to increase production efficiency and reduce CO2 emission by cutting down energy consumption for most regions; insufficient capital investment and poor production technology cause the decreasing return to scale and production efficiency. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Data envelopment analysis; Natural and managerial disposability; Non-separation; Unified environmental efficiency","capital; carbon dioxide; efficiency measurement; energy efficiency; investment; sustainable development; China; China; environmental protection; industry; productivity; technology; China; Conservation of Natural Resources; Efficiency; Industry; Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084464975

Varies diurnally and seasonally, light—the crucial environmental factor—may be a fundamental factor elucidating temporal and spatial variabilities of carbon-containing gases emission. The role of sunlight in the iron-mediated carbon cycle, however, has not been fully elucidated. We conduct this study to test the role of light in the iron-mediated carbon cycling. Materials and methods: In this study, we conducted anaerobic incubation experiments of a calcareous paddy soil in serum vials under alternating dark and light conditions. The dynamic evolution of the carbon and iron contents was evaluated by measuring the CO2, CH4, and O2 concentrations in the headspace of the vials, as well as the water-soluble inorganic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, and HCl-extractable ferrous iron contents in soil slurries. We also analyzed the soil microbial community structure by high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results and discussion: The results highlighted the positive correlation between carbon mineralization and ferric iron reduction under dark conditions. Under light conditions, however, ferrous iron was oxidized by the O2 generated via oxygenic photosynthesis of phototrophic bacteria such as Cyanobacteria, along with a decreased production of CO2, CH4, and water-soluble inorganic carbon. The abundance of Cyanobacteria positively correlated to O2 levels and MBC content significantly. Light-induced periodic variations in the redox conditions facilitated carbon fixation in microbial biomass and up to 31.79 μmol g−1 carbon was sequestrated during 30 days light incubation. Conclusions: These results indicate that light inhibits the emission of carbon-containing greenhouse gases associated with the iron redox cycle in calcareous paddy soil. Assimilation of inorganic carbon by phototrophs may responsible for the inhibition of carbon mineralization. Our study suggests that procedures allowing more light to reach the soil surface, for instance, reducing the planting density, may mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and promote carbon sequestration in paddy soils. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon mineralization; CO2 emission; Greenhouse gases; Iron redox cycling; Oxygenic photosynthesis","biomass; carbon fixation; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); correlation; cyanobacterium; genetic analysis; greenhouse gas; microbial community; paddy field; photoautotrophy; redox conditions; Cyanobacteria; Photobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084367098

Earlier accomplishments of net-zero GHG emissions in developed regions support this global target. Here, we develop a road map for California to achieve net-zero GHG emissions sustainably in 2050 by using detailed modelling of energy system transformation, cross-sectoral connectivity and technology penetration, as well as quantify the associated health co-benefits from reduced co-emitted air pollutants. We find that approximately 14,000 premature deaths can be avoided in California in 2050 and that these health co-benefits are disproportionately higher in disadvantaged communities (that is, 35% of avoided deaths will come from 25% of the state’s population). The annualized monetary benefits (US$215 billion) exceed the GHG abatement cost (US$106 billion) by US$109 billion. This road map requires the use of bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration technology to offset some GHG emissions. However, this technology comes at a price as it would emit a considerable amount of air pollutants and reduce health co-benefits by US$4 billion. Nevertheless, our analysis shows that ambitious GHG reduction efforts can provide substantial health co-benefits, especially for residents of disadvantaged communities. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Air pollution; Carbon capture; Gas emissions; Health; Maps; Carbon capture and sequestrations; Developed regions; Energy system transformation; Global targets; Global temperatures; Health co-benefits; Pre-industrial levels; Premature death; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085149479

First, the hybrid electric vehicle powertrain is modelled, and the communications via Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) are introduced as the main data sources for the decision-making of the control system. Next, the problem is divided into three objectives, namely, (1) safe driving, (2) energy management, and (3) exhaust emission reduction. Based on the real-time road information, the driving scenario classifier (DSC) works towards determining the corresponding vehicle mode on which the cost function can be adjusted accordingly. The simulation is carried out in a realistic urban traffic simulation environment in SUMO. The results show that with the proposed model predictive control (MPC)-based strategy applied, safe driving in a trip involving a mixture of driving scenarios can be guaranteed throughout the entire driving. In addition, in comparison to the rule-based benchmark strategy, the proposed strategy can reduce the fuel consumption by 34.10% with battery kept in a healthy state of charge range, and the exhaust emissions (HC, CO, and NOx) are reduced by 25.36%, 72.30%, and 30.39%, respectively, which demonstrates the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MPC-based strategy for CAHEVs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Connected and automated vehicle; Eco-driving; Energy management strategy; Hybrid electric vehicle; Intelligent transportation system; Model predictive control","Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Classification (of information); Cost functions; Decision making; Emission control; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Vehicle to infrastructure; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Data-sources; Exhaust emission; Exhaust emission reduction; Safe driving; State of charge; Urban traffic; Vehicle to infrastructure (V2I); Vehicle to vehicles; Hybrid vehicles; automation; decision making; electric vehicle; energy efficiency; exhaust emission; fuel consumption; infrastructural development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085285692

China and India, the top two developing countries confronted heavy pressure to handle the dilemma of “environmental protection or economic increase”. In this context, we switched focus to carbon intensity (defined as carbon emission per unit of economic output) to investigate carbon performance and economic performance simultaneously. In this study, we fully considered the impact of sector heterogeneity on carbon intensity, that is, we decomposed the carbon intensity of the 56 industries, which subsequently reclassified into 18 industries in China and India using the data from WIOD (world-input-output database). The results indicate that: (1) India's carbon intensity presented a constant increasing trend, while China appeared a stable decreasing trend, and the former exceeded the latter since 2009; (2) all industries of China exerted efforts to decrease carbon intensity, conversely, India only had a few industries decreasing carbon intensity; (3) energy intensity significantly decreased China's carbon intensity, while increased India's carbon intensity surprisingly; (4) in general, structure effect made negative contribution to carbon intensity improvement in China, while positive in India.

Currently, &gt;200 countries and regions have been affected by the epidemic, with the number of infections and deaths still increasing. As an extreme event, the outbreak of COVID-19 has greatly damaged the global economic growth and caused a certain impact on the environment. This paper takes China as a case study, comprehensively evaluating the dynamic impact of COVID-19 on the environment. The analysis results indicate that the outbreak of COVID-19 improves China's air quality in the short term and significantly contributes to global carbon emission reduction. However, in the long run, there is no evidence that this improvement will continue. When China completely lifts the lockdown and resumes large-scale industrial production, its energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are likely to exceed the level before the event. Moreover, COVID-19 significantly reduces the concentration of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the atmosphere. The decline initially occurred near Wuhan and eventually spread to the whole country. The above phenomenon shows that the decreasing economic activities and traffic restrictions directly lead to the changes of China's energy consumption and further prevent the environment from pollution. The results in this study support the fact that strict quarantine measures can not only protect the public from COVID-19, but also exert a positive impact on the environment. These findings can provide a reference for other countries to assess the influence of COVID-19 on the environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","China; Coronavirus; Environmental pollution; NO2 emission","Air quality; Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Gas lifts; Nitrogen oxides; Economic activities; Global carbon emission; Global economic growth; Impact on the environment; Industrial production; Nitrogen dioxides; Preliminary assessment; Traffic restrictions; Greenhouse gases; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; COVID-19; emission control; energy use; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; nitrogen dioxide; viral disease; air pollution; Article; case study; China; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; disease association; energy consumption; environmental health; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; epidemic; geographic distribution; human; infection rate; particulate matter; priority journal; public health; quarantine; satellite imagery; virus transmission; work resumption; Betacoronavirus; energy resource; environment; pandemic; virus pneumonia; China; Coronavirus; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Energy-Generating Resources; Environment; Humans; Nitrogen Dioxide; Pandemics; Pneumonia, Viral",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083746471

Abundance of bacteria and fungi as well as the induced climate change effects varied with seasons. The highest PLFA concentrations were found in frozen soils of the climate change treatment in which organic carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) substrates accumulated. It indicated that frozen soil can be the hot moment for soil microbial community. We found that climate change significantly increased total PLFA concentrations while decrease F:B ratio in July. It suggested that climate change could increase growth of bacteria more than that of fungi, and thus changed the soil microbial community structure. On the other hand, net N turnover itself was largely negative (i.e. illustrating net immobilization and the high N retention capacity). Since the ability of net rates of N turnover to predict plant N availability is relying on the (invalid) assumption that plants poorly compete for mineral N against soil microbes, this might be related to the strong plant-soil-microbe carbon-nitrogen interactions in the investigated soil, and unfortunately climate change would enhance the interaction. Therefore, net N mineralization has its limitation to deeply study the microbial N turnover in N biogeochemistry cycles. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Global change; Grassland; Microbial community; Nitrification; Nitrogen mineralization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079368859

They were derived from ultrathin CoNi-based zeolitic imidazolate framework (CoNi-ZIF) nanosheets vertically grew on three-dimensional (3D) pRGO networks by pyrolysis at different temperatures (300, 600, and 900 °C) in N2 atmosphere. Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy measurements showed that the metal coordination centers (Co or Ni) were transferred into NiCo2O4 spinel and CoNiO2 nanostructures, along with a small number of metallic states of Co and Ni. In view of good electrochemical conductivity and large specific surface area of pRGO, good catalytic activity of Co- and Ni-contained NPs, and homogeneous distribution of NPs within the pRGO network, the NiCo2O4/CoNiO2@pRGO600 nanohybrid calcined at 600 °C displayed superior electrocatalytic activity toward hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) reduction. A glassy carbon electrode modified with NiCo2O4/CoNiO2@pRGO600 was used for determination of H2O2 by amperometry at an applied potential of − 0.4 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The nonenzymatic amperometric sensor exhibited high sensitivity and low detection limit (0.41 μM) within a wide working range (5 μM–3 mM and 3–12 mM) toward H2O2, as well as good selectivity, reproducibility, and long-term stability. Benefiting from the good biocompatibility and remarkable analytical performances of NiCo2O4/CoNiO2@pRGO600, the assay was used to determine real-time H2O2 released from living cancer cells.

Interestingly, catalytic behavior of LDH/GO varied with GO ratio increasing as volcano curve, in which 5%GO/LDH exhibited superior efficiency and C1 selectivity. Primarily, delaminated LDH and GO led to structural unsaturated coordination, and thus generated Ti3+-Vo and electron-rich carbon defects. Once coupling with GO, joint function of Ti3+-Vo and transition from C1 s level to conduction band level of reduced valence states expanded absorption range to visible-light. Furthermore, adsorption/activation of CO2 was mainly promoted by electron-rich carbon defects.

Also, most inversions place CO2 release from fossil fuel combustion and biospheric sources entirely at the surface. However, a non-negligible portion of the emissions actually occurs in the form of reduced carbon species, which are eventually oxidized to CO2 downwind. Omission of this 'chemical pump' can result in a significant redistribution of the inferred total carbon fluxes among regions. We assess the impacts of different prescriptions of fossil fuel emissions and accounting for the chemical pump on flux estimation, with a novel aspect of conducting both satellite CO2 observation-based and surface in situ-based inversions. We apply 3-D carbon monoxide (CO) loss rates archived from a state-of-the-art GEOS chemistry and climate model simulation in a forward transport model run to simulate the distribution of CO2 originating from oxidation of carbon species. We also subtract amounts from the prior surface CO2 fluxes that are actually emitted in the form of fossil and biospheric CO, methane, and non-methane volatile organic compounds (VOCs). We find that the posterior large-scale fluxes are generally insensitive to the finer-scale spatial differences between the ODIAC and CDIAC fossil fuel CO2 gridded datasets and assumptions about international bunker emissions. However, accounting for 3-D chemical CO2 production and the surface correction shifts the global carbon sink, e.g. from land to ocean and from the tropics to the north, with a magnitude and even direction that depend on assumptions about the surface correction. A GOSAT satellite-based inversion is more sensitive to the chemical pump than one using in situ observations, exhibiting substantial flux impacts of 0.28, 0.53, and -0.47 Pg C yr-1 over tropical land, global land, and oceans, due to differences in the horizontal and vertical sampling of the two observation types. Overall, the biases from neglecting the chemical pump appear to be minor relative to the flux estimate uncertainties and the differences between the in situ and GOSAT inversions, but their relative importance will grow in the future as observational coverage further increases and satellite retrieval biases decrease. © 2020 The Author(s).

The TiO2 nanosheets/C composite exhibited a boosted photocatalytic activity under visible light condition up to three times of benchmark Degussa P25. It was revealed that the high photocatalytic activity can be ascribed to three major aspects. One was that the stacked nanosheets with ordered structure inherited from the 2D MXene, endowed a favorable electron-hole separation and transportation. The second was the decoration of carbon layer that evidently extended the absorption to more visible light region. Besides, the carbon layer also facilitated the separation and migration of photogenerated carriers.

In this paper, a multi-timescale coordinated operation framework is proposed to dispatch the CHP plant and wind farm in a deregulated day-ahead heat market and a real-time balancing electricity market. In the framework, the portfolio operation strategy that operates the portfolio jointly in the market is applied to increase the real-time operation profits. Multiple uncertainties of heat load, wind power generation, day-ahead electricity price, up- and down-regulation prices are taken into account for the optimal operation.

Ethanol is a hydrogen-rich renewable liquid hydrogen source, and it is more convenient to store and transport than H2 . In this study, a “storage-discharge” ethanol cold plasma was used to prepare Pd/Al2O3-EP catalysts, and the obtained catalysts are used for CO oxidation. The complete oxidation of CO temperature (T100) over Pd/Al2O3-EP was 145◦C, which was comparable to the performance of Pd/Al2O3-HP that was synthesized by atmospheric pressure hydrogen cold plasma. Pd/Al2O3-EP-C obtained by calcining Pd/Al2O3-EP at 450◦C for 2 h in air atmosphere in order to remove residual carbon species showed much higher CO oxidation activity, and T100 was 130◦C. The Pd/Al2O3 catalysts were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPS), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the structure-performance relationship was analyzed. The results indicate that the “storage-discharge” ethanol cold plasma can reduce the Pd precursor ions into metallic Pd state, and the dissociation of ethanol forms lots of highly active chemisorbed oxygen species, which can enhance the performance of Pd/Al2O3-EP for CO oxidation.

The results showed that the CO2 emissions from urban transportation in China featured significant spatial agglomeration. The high emission areas were mainly concentrated in Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Chengdu, Nanjing, and other regional core cities, while the low emission areas were mainly concentrated in the cities of Gansu, Guizhou, Yunnan, and other underdeveloped provinces. Considering the overall evolution of the factors affecting transportation CO2 emissions, private car ownership, technological innovation, and industrial structure correlated positively with transportation CO2 emissions. Population density, urbanization rate, per capita urban road area, and transportation structure could significantly inhibit transportation CO2 emissions. The impact of per capita GDP, public transportation, and environmental regulation on transportation CO2 emissions was insignificant. From the perspective of spatial heterogeneity, there were significant regional differences in the impact of various factors on CO2 emissions. Private car ownership, technological innovation capacity, and per capita GDP all had a positive impact on transportation CO2 emissions. Urbanization rate, urban road area per capita, and transportation structure all had a negative impact on transportation CO2 emissions.

Results show that carbon market linkage can mitigate the adverse impacts of emission trading on regional sectoral competitiveness across the BTH region. However, carbon market linkage may lead to the imbalances of regional sectoral competitiveness. In particular, energy production and energy-intensive sectors in Hebei would experience higher sectoral competitive losses under the restricted linkage scenario. Revenue recycling can effectively reduce sectoral competitive losses from carbon market linkage. Especially, using revenues to deduct indirect tax can make the sectoral competitive losses in Hebei significantly decrease.

Two increasingly popular soil amendments, biosolids and biochar, may reduce the negative impacts of extreme hydrological processes as well as provide a low-cost carbon sequestration strategy, increase nutrient and soil water retention, and increase nutrient availability. We measured the response of microbial communities to amendments of biochar (walnut shell, 900 °C) and biosolids amendments, separate and mixed, under different water regimes. We used phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) to monitor microbial communities during a 12-week incubation experiment in which we applied different levels of biochar (0, 0.5 and 1% dry wt. added to dry soil) and biosolids (0 and 0.5% air-dry wt. added to dry soil) to agricultural soils under different soil moisture conditions (wet, drought, or wet-dry cycles). Biochar increased soil pH across the soil moisture and biosolids treatments at both 4-week and 12-week. Biosolids only significantly decreased soil pH in wet treatment and the change in soil pH was within 0.5 units. Biosolid increased soil mineral nitrogen. Biochar only increased microbial biomass at week 4 in the absence of biosolids, while biosolids increased microbial biomass regardless of biochar and water regime by 55% on average over 12 weeks. Drought and wet-dry cycles strongly influenced microbial communities in soil, reducing biomass and altering community composition. Biosolids amendment increased soil nutrient level, helped maintain soil microbial biomass and reduced impacts of soil moisture stress on soil microbial community. The effect of biochar on soil microbial community composition depended on its dose and soil nutrient conditions. The co-amendment of biosolids and biochar helped to reduce the changes in soil pH and mineral nitrogen. Amending soils with biosolids or biochar may provide an effective management tool to reduce the negative impact of drought and wet-dry cycles on microbial communities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biochar; Biosolids; Drought; Microbial community; Phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA); Wet-dry cycle",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081000720

In addition, different people are affected differently because of factors such as age, gender and education level. To enhance the understanding of the benefits of low carbon transition from the labor supply perspective and help to identify strategies of collaborative control for CO2 and local air pollutants in China, an integrated assessment model linking the air quality module and the health impact module with a disaggregated labor sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) economic system is developed and applied in this study. Results show some key findings. First, renewable energy development and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies will contribute significantly to GDP in terms of their impact on air quality improvement by 0.99% and 0.54%, respectively, in 2050. Second, due to differences in labor composition, air pollution has, and will continue to have, the greatest impact on sectors with a higher proportion of male and lower-educated workers - such as the coal sector, and it will have the least impact on sectors with a higher proportion of female and higher-educated workers - such as the public administration sector. Third, the different impacts of sector output will increase economic inequality. Highlights • The economic impact of climate change and air pollution is assessed. • A CGE model with disaggregated labor sectors is developed. • The secondary industry is most affected by pollution from a health perspective. • Low-income groups suffer the largest loss of income due to pollution. • A low carbon policy will improve air quality and economic equity. © 2020 The Author(s).","air pollution; economic inequality; health impact; Integrated assessment model; low-carbon development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091773239

Its development also poses greater challenges to those seeking to reduce the level of CO2 emissions within the transportation sector. This paper selects panel data from 51 countries along the belt and road over the 2000–2014 period. First, using the Theil model, we analyze the transportation sector CO2 emissions intensity trends from countries along the belt and road for the period under observation. The Tapio decoupling model is also conducted to better understand the relationship between the overall and regional CO2 emissions and transportation industry growth for countries along belt and road. Additionally, using ArcGIS, the significant evolving regions of CO2 emission intensity in the transportation sector is visualized, and a series of relevant policy suggestions are put forward. The empirical results indicate that the output value and CO2 emissions of the transportation sector of all the countries along the belt and road increased, however the CO2 emissions intensity showed an overall decline with a polarization trend. This study also found that there are three states of decoupling: weak decoupling, recessive coupling and expansive negative decoupling over the period of analysis. Moreover, by offering different regions along the belt and road decoupling state, this study can provide a reference for governments by proposing carbon-reduction policies and promoting green developments within the transportation sector. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission; Decoupling analysis; The belt and road; Transportation sector","Carbon dioxide; Motor transportation; Carbon reduction; CO2 emissions; Decoupling models; Economic exchange; Output values; Policy suggestions; Transportation industry growths; Transportation sector; Roads and streets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083332140

Where ablation of the silver substrate took place, a highly textured nanoscale topography is generated. In contrast, a film-like oxide is formed next to the machined areas. Interestingly, it was observed that Ag2O formed within the laser tool path was significantly more reactive towards atmospheric H2O and CO2 compared to the film-like oxide, leading to the formation of silver carbonate, Ag2CO3, only in this region. The ability to generate a periodic topography, in the form of a bulls-eye grating, combined with periodic surface chemistry, consisting of alternating regions of Ag2O and Ag2CO3 is also shown. Depending on the machining parameters and tool path used, the surfaces can become quite optically active.

Therefore, the influence of increasing e-mobility and synergy effects between e-mobility and renewable energy sources need to be investigated. The case study presented here shows results from the analysis of grid-side and energetic synergy effects between e-mobility charged only at work and photovoltaic (PV) potentials. The basis of the grid study is a simplified cell-based grid model. Following the determination of synthetic charging profiles for e-mobility, PV potential profiles, load and production profiles, we perform load flow calculations for different scenarios and a simulation period of one year using the grid model. After the grid study, the energy analyses are carried out using four key performance indicators. The grid study shows that line overloads caused by PV production are only reduced and not avoided by increasing e-mobility and vice versa. The increase in the power peak of e-mobility, by shifting the charging processes into the peak of PV potentials, leads to a reduction of the production surplus in summer, while in winter the line utilisation increases. By modelling PV potentials on real irradiation and temperature data, the investigation of key performance indicators can identify not only seasonal fluctuations but also daily fluctuations. © 2020 MDPI AG.

As the Arctic warms, shrubs have been widely observed to expand, which has potentially serious consequences for global climate regulation and for the ecological processes characterising these ecosystems. However, it is currently unclear why this shrubification has been spatially uneven across the Arctic, with herbivory being suggested as a key regulating factor. By taking advantage of freely available satellite imagery spanning three decades, we mapped changes in shrub cover in the Yamal Peninsula and related these to changes in summer temperature and reindeer population size. We found no evidence that shrubs had expanded in the study site, despite increasing summer temperatures. At the same time, herbivore pressure increased significantly, with the local reindeer population size growing by about 75%. Altogether, our results thus point towards increases in large herbivore pressure having compensated for the warming of the Peninsula, halting the shrubification of the area. This suggests that strategic semi-domesticated reindeer husbandry, which is a common practice across the Eurasian Arctic, could represent an efficient environmental management strategy for maintaining open tundra landscapes in the face of rapid climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Arctic; Climate change; Grazing; Satellite remote sensing; Semi-domesticated reindeer; Shrubification; Tundra","animal husbandry; climate change; grazing pressure; herbivory; plant-herbivore interaction; population growth; satellite imagery; shrub; temperature effect; ungulate; vegetation cover; Arctic; article; climate change; environmental management; grazing; herbivore; human; human experiment; nonhuman; population size; reindeer; satellite imagery; shrub; summer; tundra; warming; animal; Arctic; climate change; ecosystem; tundra; Arctic; Eurasia; Russian Federation; Yamal Peninsula; Yamalo-Nenets; Rangifer tarandus; Animals; Arctic Regions; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Reindeer; Tundra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084054711

Thus, the work was developed in three phases: i) a theoretical phase, ii) a validation phase and iii) a statistical analysis. For the theoretical phase, a literature review was conducted to determine a set of competencies for developing these type of projects. Next, in the validation phase, fifty participants were invited to complete a two-round Delphi questionnaire to rank the competencies detected in the literature review. The participants were classified according to their level of knowledge (skilled or expert) and place of work (countries with upper-middle-income or high-income). The results showed that twenty-one competencies were identified. In the validation phase, for the first Delphi round, the different groups studied (skilled vs expert; high-income vs upper-middle-income) did not agree about the most important competencies. However, after the second Delphi round, an agreement was achieved. Therefore, competencies related to water quality and process design for improving its quality were defined as “extremely important” competencies. In addition, the entire panel of experts also highlighted competencies related to legislation, circular economy, equipment, climate, and construction materials. Thus, for the first time, a set of competencies that needs to be included in educational programs for engineers with a special focus on developing water infrastructure based on NBS in the urban context of developing countries has been proposed in this work. © 2020","Delphi methodology; Developing countries; Engineering education; Nature-based solutions; Urban water infrastructure","Construction equipment; Developing countries; Laws and legislation; Water quality; Circular economy; Educational program; Engineering program; ITS applications; Literature reviews; Middle incomes; Validation phase; Water infrastructure; Application programs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084070859

We test the hypothesis that this has reduced tropospheric and ground-level air pollution concentrations, using satellite data and a network of >10,000 air quality stations. After accounting for the effects of meteorological variability, we find declines in the population-weighted concentration of ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2: 60% with 95% CI 48 to 72%), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5: 31%; 95% CI: 17 to 45%), with marginal increases in ozone (O3: 4%; 95% CI: -2 to 10%) in 34 countries during lockdown dates up until 15 May. Except for ozone, satellite measurements of the troposphere indicate much smaller reductions, highlighting the spatial variability of pollutant anomalies attributable to complex NOx chemistry and long-distance transport of fine particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5). By leveraging Google and Apple mobility data, we find empirical evidence for a link between global vehicle transportation declines and the reduction of ambient NO2 exposure.

To demonstrate urban waste potentials for biogas production by anaerobic digestion, a comprehensive analysis on the availability of organic waste hotspots and its biogas potential for the exemplary case of Chennai, India, was undertaken. The identified hotspots and their biogas potential were plotted with Geographical Information System as thematic maps. The results of biogas potential tests revealed strong variations in the biogas potentials of individual waste streams from 240.2 to 514.2 mLN/g oDM (organic dry matter) with oDM reduction in the range of 36.4–61.5 wt.-%. Major waste generation hotspots were identified from the surveyed urban bio-reserves and the biogas potentials within an effective area of 5 km radius surrounding the hotspot were estimated. It was found that the biogas potential of individual hotspots ranged between 38.0–5938.7 m3/day. Further results revealed that the biogas potential during anaerobic co-digestion, by considering nearby bio-reserves in the effective areas of major hotspots, with and without residential organic waste, ranged between 4110.4–18–106.1 m3/day and 253.2–5969.5 m3/day, originating from 144.0–620.0 tons and 3.1–170.5 tons, respectively. Despite variations in the composition of the wastes, the Carbon/Nitrogen ratio, oDM reduction, biogas production and substrate availability were improved during co-digestion of nearby bio-reserves within the major hotspots, thereby improving the prevailing barriers in substrate management during anaerobic digestion of wastes. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biogas; Co-digestion; Hotspot; Municipal solid wastes; Organic wastes; Urban city","anaerobic digestion; bioactivity; GIS; inventory; municipal solid waste; substrate; thematic mapping; urban area; urbanization; waste treatment; Chennai; India; Tamil Nadu; biofuel; methane; anaerobic growth; Asia; bioreactor; city; India; solid waste; waste disposal; waste management; Anaerobiosis; Asia; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Cities; India; Methane; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077023510

Although the mechanisms of N2O emission after soil rewetting have been previously studied, potential mitigation of agronomic practices on N2O pulses is still poorly understood. We studied the N2O emissions after rewetting of degraded soils managed by no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT), both with or without lime application under laboratory conditions. The soil was rewetted to 50 and 100% of field capacity (FC) and the N2O fluxes, size, structure and gene transcription of the microbial communities involved in the N2O emissions were evaluated. Liming reduced the cumulative N2O emission by more than 70 and 65% respect to the unamended soil after soil rewetting to 50% and 100% of FC, respectively, whereas no significant effect of tillage on N2O emission was observed. Liming strongly influenced the size and structure of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and denitrifier communities, increased the transcription of the nirK after soil rewetting, while transcription of genes encoding nitrification enzymes was undetectable. Tillage slightly affected the nitrifier and denitrifier communities, with CT increasing the size of nosZ community. The results indicated that the N2O pulse after soil rewetting was caused by denitrification rather than nitrification. In addition, the increase of nirK transcription suggested that the mitigation of N2O emissions observed in limed soils was due to changes in the denitrification process, possibly with a higher or more efficient reduction of N2O to N2. This study showed the potentials of NT and liming management to mitigate the N2O emission from degraded Mediterranean soils after soil rewetting due to changes in the efficiency of the denitrification process. Our results also showed the usefulness of coupling determinations of gas emission, microbial community structure and gene transcription to clarify the underlying mechanisms of N2O emissions from soil. © 2020","Denitrifiers; Greenhouse gas emissions; Nitrifiers; Nitrous oxide; No-tillage; Soil liming","Ammonia; Bacteria; Cultivation; Denitrification; Gas emissions; Lime; Nitrification; Soils; Transcription; Ammonia oxidizing bacteria; Conventional tillage; Denitrification process; Laboratory conditions; Mediterranean region; Mediterranean soils; Microbial communities; Microbial community structures; Soil pollution; ammonia; bacterium; denitrification; field capacity; genetic analysis; liming; Mediterranean soil; microbial activity; microbial community; nitrification; nitrous oxide; oxidation; rewetting; Nitrosomonadales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084139525

As a result of heavy oil exposure to water, it has been found that in various thermodynamic conditions, water shows different reactivity and selectivity. In a series of experiments of the hydrothermal effect at temperatures in the range between 360 and 420 °C and the pressures in the range between 4 and 24 MPa, a decrease in the content of aromatic and resinous hydrocarbon compounds and reduced density of liquid end products have been detected. It has been shown that supercritical water provides the most significant formation of light fractions: compared to the source oil, their content increases 2.5 times. Mostly paraffin-naphthenic hydrocarbons are formed on the background of aromatic and resinous hydrocarbons destruction, while subcritical water ensures less significant formation of light fractions (their content increased by 73 %, compared to the source oil); however, it contributes to the most significant reduction in the content of asphaltenes (by 53 rel% compared to the source oil).

This, in combination with associated vegetation changes and increased animal migration, increases the potential incidence of tick-borne diseases (TBD) where already occurring, and emergence in new places. At the same time, vegetation and animal management influence tick habitat and transmission risks. In this paper, we review the literature on Ixodes ricinus, the primary vector for TBD. Current and projected distribution changes and associated disease transmission risks are related to climate constraints and climate change, and this risk is discussed in the specific context of reindeer management. Our results indicate that climatic limitations for vectors and hosts, and environmental and societal/institutional conditions will have a significant role in determining the spreading of climate-sensitive infections (CSIs) under a changing climate. Management emerges as an important regulatory “tool” for tick and/or risk for disease transfer. In particular, shrub encroachment, and pasture and animal management, are important. The results underscore the need to take a seasonal view of TBD risks, such as (1) grazing and migratory (host) animal presence, (2) tick (vector) activity, (3) climate and vegetation, and (4) land and animal management, which all have seasonal cycles that may or may not coincide with different consequences of climate change on CSI migration. We conclude that risk management must be coordinated across the regions, and with other land-use management plans related to climate mitigation or food production to understand and address the changes in CSI risks. © 2020 by the authors.

This situation is most serious in regions, where the terrain is sloped and subjected to heavy rainfall. Our research was conducted in a mountainous area, belonging to Central Vietnam, the area of Song Kon commune in the Dong Giang district. The objective of this study is first to estimate the impact of soil erosion risk in these areas, and second to assess the capacity of farming systems which are based on indigenous knowledge (IK) to respond to soil erosion. Our data were collected by Participatory Rural Appraisal (PRA) and processed using Geographical Information System (GIS) methods. We then interpreted this research using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) in order to calculate the soil erosion rate. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) were also used as measurements to compare the difference of land surface covers between different farming systems. The results showed that the lowest soil erosion rate was found in the narrow valley regions, which are populated by both agricultural and residential areas. On the other hand, soil erosion was extremely high in the more northerly quadrant of our research area. Our findings also indicate that local farmers are highly aware of soil erosion, which has positively influenced the adoption of adaptation measures (AMs) in their agricultural activities. The most common AMs are as follows: changes in cropping patterns, the adjustments of their planting calendars, the use of native varieties, and intercropping methods. These AMs are mediated by the cultural observances of the local ethnic minority peoples in relation to their IK. We have concluded that when farmers apply IK in their farming systems, the soil erosion rate tends to decrease as compared with non-indigenous knowledge (NIK) practices. We hope to bring a better understanding of the processes that shape farmers' AMs and thereby to develop well-targeted adaptation policies that can then be applied at the local level. Our findings may be instrumental in future adaptation planning and policies in regard to climate change, and that they will help to increase awareness not only in matters of the soil erosion but also in other interconnected aspects of climate change in these areas. © 2020 by the authors.","Central Vietnam; Enhanced vegetation index (EVI); Geographic information system (GIS); Indigenous knowledge (IK); Soil erosion; Universal soil loss equation (USLE)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088860356

Recently, the potential of historical phytosociological plot data has been emphasised as a means to study vegetation change over time. Vegetation change occurs naturally but also as a result of land use and climate change. In order to quantify change, the current vegetation has to be compared with the vegetation that occurred historically at a site. The objectives of this study were to describe the vegetation on two properties (Losberg and Meysdam) purchased by the National Research Foundation on which the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will be developed, and publish, in the scientific arena, the vegetation and landscape unit descriptions of these properties to promote awareness that baseline data exists before significant land use change occurred on the properties. One hundred and eighty Braun Blanquet surveys were conducted in units stratified using satellite images, topography, land type, geology and drainage information. The plot data were analysed using standard Braun Blanquet methodology. Ten plant communities and 2 sub-communities were identified. These plant communi-ties and sub-communities were used, together with landforms and associated environmental parameters, to produce five landscape units for decision making and management purposes. The data shows the past effect of disturbance. Historical overgrazing is speculated to have resulted in large patches denude of vegetation and the densification of the naturally occurring spinescent shrubs Rhigozum trichotomum and Lycium cinereum over large areas as in other parts of the Karoo. Significant soil erosion is evident. Soil conservation infrastructure erected in the past to combat further erosion, together with the highly disturbed vegetation and soils, has enabled the alien invasive tree species Prosopis glandulosa to proliferate in exceptionally large numbers, particularly on the flats and drainage areas. This highlights the importance of limiting disturbance to the natural vegetation and soils during the construction of SKA infrastructure. The study provides baseline vegetation data to inform the management of the proposed SKA protected area and for researchers working at this site. These data will also prove useful for ongoing monitoring efforts to detect the impact of local and global change on the vegetation of the Nama Karoo. © 2020 SAAB","Braun Blanquet method; Land use change; Large scale development; Nama Karoo; Phytosociology","climate change; decision making; disturbance; global change; land use change; phytosociology; plant community; protected area; shrub; soil-vegetation interaction; vegetation dynamics; Karoo; Nama Karoo; South Africa; Lycium cinereum; Prosopis glandulosa; Rhigozum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084637975

This is predicated, however, on our ability to combine climate and health data to investigate the ways in which variations in climate, weather, and health outcomes interact. There is growing evidence to support the value of place- and community-based monitoring and surveillance efforts, which can contribute to improving both the quality and equity of data collection needed to investigate and understand the impacts of climate change on health. The inclusion of multiple and diverse knowledge systems in climate-health surveillance presents many benefits, as well as challenges. We conducted a systematic review, synthesis, and confidence assessment of the published literature on integrated monitoring and surveillance systems for climate change and public health. We examined the inclusion of diverse knowledge systems in climate-health literature, focusing on: (1) analytical framing of integrated monitoring and surveillance system processes; (2) key contributions of Indigenous knowledge and local knowledge systems to integrated monitoring and surveillance systems processes; and (3) patterns of inclusion within these processes. In total, 24 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included for data extraction, appraisal, and analysis. Our findings indicate that the inclusion of diverse knowledge systems contributes to integrated climate-health monitoring and surveillance systems across multiple processes of detection, attribution, and action. These contributions include: the definition of meaningful problems; the collection of more responsive data; the reduction of selection and source biases; the processing and interpretation of more comprehensive datasets; the reduction of scale dependent biases; the development of multi-scale policy; long-term future planning; immediate decision making and prioritization of key issues; as well as creating effective knowledge-information-action pathways. The value of our findings and this review is to demonstrate how neither scientific, Indigenous, nor local knowledge systems alone will be able to contribute the breadth and depth of information necessary to detect, attribute, and inform action along pathways of climate-health impact. Rather, it is the divergence or discordance between the methodologies and evidences of different knowledge systems that can contribute uniquely to this understanding. We critically discuss the possibility of what we, mainly local communities and experts, stand to lose if these processes of inclusion are not equitable. We explore how to shift the existing patterns of inclusion into balance by ensuring the equity of contributions and justice of inclusion in these integrated monitoring and surveillance system processes. © 2020 The Author(s).

But the inevitable climate change effects due to constant feeding of emissions into atmosphere leads to severe and extreme precipitation causing flooding. The combined impact of flooding, rapid urbanization and vehicular growth has become a looming threat to the transportation system which is affecting the developing economies disproportionately. There is an urgent need for the transport infrastructure to adapt to these climate change effects to reduce human as well as economic losses and adaptation is seen as the necessary tool to address this. In this paper, a methodological approach to formulate the adaptation strategies from urban transport to urban flooding in developing economies is presented. Further three adaptation policy bundles are formulated specifically to enhance the resilience of transportation system against urban flooding thereby strengthening the adaptive capacity of the system. These strategies are evaluated for the years 2030 and 2050 along with base year for various travel parameters to estimate the impact of flooding. This study finds that the implementation of bundle 1 is an effective adaptation measure when compared to bundle 2 and 3. The comparative analysis with BAU flooding scenario shows that VKT of bundle 1 is reduced by 4% and 3%, speeds increased by 21% and 45%, vehicle hours travelled by 9% and 8% for the years 2030 and 2050 respectively.

To date, the literature on the energy profile of food systems addresses individual countries and/or food products, and therefore a comparable assessment across regions is still missing. This paper uses a global multi-regional environmentally extended input–output database in combination with newly constructed net energy-use accounts to provide a production and consumption-based stock-take of energy use in the food system across different world regions for the period 2000–2015. Overall, the ratio between energy use in the food system and the economy is slowly decreasing. Likewise, the absolute values point toward a relative decoupling between energy use and food production, as well as to relevant differences in energy types, users, and consumption patterns across world regions. The use of (inefficient) traditional biomass for cooking substantially reduces the expected gap between per capita figures in high- and low-income countries. The variety of energy profiles and the higher exposure to energy security issues compared to the total economy in some regions suggests that interventions in the system should consider the geographical context. Reducing energy use and decarbonizing the supply chains of food products will require a combination of technological measures and behavioral changes in consumption patterns. Interventions should consider the effects beyond the direct effects on energy use, because changing production and consumption patterns in the food system can lead to positive spillovers in the social and environmental dimensions outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2020 by Yale University","energy footprint; energy use; food system; industrial ecology; input–output analysis","Climate change; Energy security; Energy utilization; Geographical regions; Supply chains; Sustainable development; energy footprint; Energy use; Food system; Industrial ecology; Output analysis; Chemical contamination; biomass; consumption behavior; decadal variation; emission control; energy use; food intake; low income population; spillover effect; supply chain management; Sustainable Development Goal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078857798

Buildings are one of the largest energy consumers in the world. Thermal protection in a building is the most effective way for energy saving. Many stimulatory measures for the spreading of energy savings technologies have been recently applied into the building sectors. In this study, an investigation was carried out based upon an experimental investigation to decide the thermal properties of the lightweight concrete with different ratios of vermiculite. Moreover, analytical simulation to evaluate the energy consumption in a real building application was carried out for various fuels and different climate regions of Turkey. The results show that the most significant reduction in the total heat need occurs in the 4th region, with about 5.6 kWh/m2-year for a thickness of 0.2 m. An energy-saving of 7.5% can be achieved in the 1st region. The proposed concrete can provide a significant reduction in energy consumption and can reduce the carbon emission related to the lower energy need of the buildings. The annual saving can increase to 0.61 $/m2 for LPG in the 4th region. The payback period varies between 1.4 years and 9 years, depending on the fuel. Many OECD countries having a high population pay higher prices for electricity and natural gas compared to Turkey. It means that such an energy-efficient material can save more price due to their higher fuel cost. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Energy analyses; Fuel cost; Lightweight concrete; Thermal insulation; Thermal performance; Vermiculite","carbon; concrete; fuel; liquefied petroleum gas; natural gas; vermiculite; building; carbon emission; electricity; natural gas; OECD; performance assessment; simulation; vermiculite; Article; carbon footprint; climate; consumer; electricity; energy; energy conservation; technology; thermal conductivity; thickness; electricity; thermal conductivity; turkey (bird); Turkey; Climate; Electricity; Thermal Conductivity; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084425469

While traditional methods for measuring outdoor interference include collecting real-world data by walking or driving, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offers an attractive alternative due to their flexible mobility and adaptive altitude. As UAVs perform measurements quickly and semiautomatically, they can potentially assist in near-real-time adjustments of the network configuration and fine-tuning its parameters, such as antenna settings and transmit power, as well as help improve indoor connectivity while respecting outdoor emission constraints. This article offers a firsthand tutorial on using aerial 5G emission assessment for interference management in nonpublic networks by reviewing the key challenges of UAV-mounted radio scanner measurements. In particular, we outline the challenges of practical assessment of the outdoor interference originating from a local indoor 5G network while discussing regulatory and other related constraints, and address practical methods and tools while summarizing the recent results of our measurement campaign.

However, an increase in gasoline prices in Russia and Iran while the decrease in gasoline prices in the USA, Russia, Japan, and Canada decreases in carbon emissions in the long run. Asymmetric findings also suggest that positive and negative changes in oil prices affect carbon emissions differently in China, the USA, India, Russia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Canada in the short and long run.

Changes in climate and forest composition may pose challenges for animal communities found in PJ woodlands, especially if animals specialize on tree species sensitive to drought. Here we test habitat specialization of ground-dwelling arthropod (GDA) communities underneath pinyon and juniper trees. We also investigate the role of climate and productivity gradients in structuring GDAs within PJ woodlands using two elevational gradients. We sampled 12,365 individuals comprising 115 taxa over two years. We found no evidence that GDAs differ under pinyon or juniper trees, save for a single species of beetle which preferred junipers. Climate and productivity, however, were strongly associated with GDA communities and appeared to drive differences between sites. Precipitation was strongly associated with arthropod richness, while differences in GDA composition were associated with environmental variables (precipitation, temperature, vapor pressure, and normalized difference vegetation index). These relationships varied among different arthropod taxa (e.g. ants and beetles) and community metrics (e.g. richness, abundance, and composition), with individual taxa also responding differently. Overall, our results suggest that GDAs are not dependent on tree type, but are strongly linked to primary productivity and climate, especially precipitation in PJ woodlands. This implies GDAs in PJ woodlands are more susceptible to changes in climate, especially at lower elevations where it is hot and dry, than changes in dominant vegetation. We discuss management implications and compare our findings to GDA relationships with vegetation in other systems. Copyright: © 2020 Uhey et al.

Based on vehicle registration and population growth data for each year the creep trend method using historical data for the years 2007–2017 is applied for forecasting development up to 2030. Moreover, the original method for calculating the primary energy factor (PEF) was applied to the analysis of power engineering systems in the regions investigated. The assessment of the effects of electromobility development on air quality has been performed, reduction values for pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions have been determined, which was the main objective of this manuscript. Mitigation of air pollutant emissions, i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) was estimated and compared to the eventual expected increase of emissions from power plants due to an increase of the demand for electricity. It can be concluded that electricity powered cars along with appropriate choices of energetic resources as well as electricity distribution management will play the important role to achieve the sustainable energy economy.

This analysis is often cumbersome and technically challenging due to spectral overlap and vicinity of the two emission bands. These limitations can be overcome by a new, single emission band ratiometric (SBR) approach which involves excitation through thermally induced excited state absorption (ESA) and ground state absorption (GSA). What is more, the frequent problem of low intensity of one of the radiative transitions, which are analyzed in conventional luminescent thermometry, is overcome owing to the involving of the SBR approach. Due to the opposable behavior of the emission intensity with temperature changes upon these two excitation schemes, improved thermal sensitivity can be achieved. In this work, the suitability of Nd3+-doped oxyfluorotellurite (65-x)TeO2–20ZnF2–12PbO–3Nb2O5–xNd2O3 (x = 0.1, 1, 2, 5 and 10) glasses (TZPN) was analyzed for SBR-based luminescent thermometry. To excite Nd3+ ions, the 808 nm and 1060 nm wavelengths, which are related to GSA and ESA, respectively, were involved. In the biological temperature range the relative sensitivity reached SR = 2.95%/°C. The highest value of SR = 6.15%/°C was obtained at low temperature range for the 10%Nd3+:TZPN glass LT and decreased below 1%/°C only at temperatures above 200 °C. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Excited state absorption; Glasses; Luminescence thermometry; Resonant and non-resonant excitation","Glass; Ground state; Luminescence; Temperature; Thermometers; Excited state absorption; Ground state absorption; Luminescence intensity; Radiative transitions; Relative sensitivity; Temperature changes; Temperature readout; Thermal sensitivity; Excited states",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083582978

Traditionally, loads in residential microgrids are mainly supplied by diesel generators. Increasing development and integration of renewable energy resources and battery energy storage system into a residential microgrid, decreases the cost of generation, and increases environmental emission mitigation and generation efficiency. In this study, the optimization problem is solved using a Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The primary objectives of the optimization procedure can be expressed as follows: (i) the minimization of total costs of DERs (ii) reduction of environmental emission in the MG system (iii) increasing the penetration level of RES. Several numerical results are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method using demand, local solar irradiance, and wind speed. The proposed method results are shown that there is about a 35% reduction in CO2 emission in the optimal configuration in comparison with the scenario in which only diesel generators provide the total demand of the MG system. It is observed that installing the optimum configuration during different years brought down the fuel to 44.36 (M-Liter). It is also worth mentioning that the optimal installation of DER units in different years plays an important role in increasing the MG system performance. The simulation results for the case verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Battery energy storage systems; Energy optimization; Microgrid systems; Renewable energy resources","Cost reduction; Diesel engines; Electric batteries; Housing; Microgrids; Numerical methods; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Wind; Battery energy storage systems; Distributed Energy Resources; Environmental emissions; Integration of renewable energies; Optimization procedures; Optimization solution; Optimum configurations; Residential microgrid; Battery storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085576688

Using the Senegal River basin as a case study, we generate probabilistic trade-offs to analyze the competition between objectives that are vulnerable to both natural and anthropogenic factors. Here the natural factors essentially correspond to the hydrologic processes and their natural variability, while the anthropogenic factors include future water allocation policies as well as the level of development of the water resources system. Our analysis of the trade-off relationships reveals the existence of two coalitions of objectives: traditional food production (agriculture and floodplain fisheries) versus hydropower-navigation. The probabilistic trade-offs also show that of the two main coalitions of objectives, the one dealing with traditional food production is much more vulnerable to changes in both hydro-climatic conditions and allocation policies. Since traditional food production mostly concerns economically and politically-marginal communities in downstream riparian countries, this larger vulnerability should be factored in when negotiating water and benefits sharing schemes. © 2020","River basin modelling; Tradeoffs analysis; Water management; Water policy","Agricultural robots; Economic and social effects; Stochastic systems; Water management; Watersheds; Anthropogenic factors; River basin modelling; Senegal river basins; Trade-off relationship; Tradeoffs analysis; Uncertain environments; Water policies; Water resources systems; Rivers; anthropogenic effect; environmental factor; floodplain; food production; hydroelectric power plant; policy making; trade-off; vulnerability; water management; water planning; Senegal Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082999771

This gold deposit is one of the most important types in the Jiaodong Peninsula. Four stages have been identified based on the cross-cutting relationships and mineralogical and textural characteristics. The study of quartz vein fluid inclusions show that the inclusions can be divided into three categories: pure liquid or pure gas phase inclusions (type S), two-phase gas and liquid inclusions (type W), and three-phase inclusions rich in CO2 (type C). The results of laser Raman probe analysis show that the fluid inclusions are generally rich in CO2, thus forming a typical CO2–H2O–NaCl system. The fluid temperature results show that in stage I, only the type W fluid inclusions are identified by microthermometry, the homogenized temperatures (to liquid) are 210–343°C and mostly range from 260 to 280°C, the range of salinity is 1.57–10.98 wt.% NaCl, with a peak value of 8–11 wt.% NaCl, and the density is 0.65–1.02 g/cm3, with a peak value of 0.81–0.87 g/cm3; in stages II and III, the primary fluid inclusion assemblages include both type W and C inclusions, which show similar phase-transition temperatures and are trapped between 190 and 300°C, and the peak values of salinities are 4–10 wt.% NaCl equivalent; and in stage IV, the total homogenization temperatures (Th-TOT) into liquid range from 120 to 220°C, and the range of salinities is 4.2–7.9 wt.% NaCl. These values indicate that temperature, salinity, and density gradually decreased from the early to late mineralization stage. The ore-forming fluid of the deposit was a thermal liquid system with medium–low temperature, medium–low salinity, and low density and was rich in reducing CO2. The H–O isotope shows that the ore-forming fluids were dominated by metamorphic fluid with only minor amounts of meteoric water involved in the ore-forming process. According to the S, Pb, and Sr isotopes analysis, it indicated that the source of ore-forming materials is mainly crustal fluid. The measured Rb–Sr isochron age of pyrite is 123.4 ± 2.9 Ma, which indicates that the metallogenic age corresponded to the Early Cretaceous. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","fluid inclusion; H–O–S–Pb isotopes; Jiaodong Peninsula; Majiayao gold deposit; Rb–Sr isochron age","Cretaceous; fluid inclusion; gold; hydrogen isotope; lead isotope; ore deposit; ore-forming fluid; oxygen; pyrite; rubidium-strontium dating; sulfur; China; Shandong; Shandong Peninsula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076340033

Two 5 wt%Fe-based catalysts, supported on mixed MgO-ZrO2 and NiO-MgO-ZrO2 oxides, prepared by auto-combustion sol-gel method, were investigated for CO2-EDH. The crystallographic structure of the catalysts was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), while the surface composition and oxidation state were identified using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effect of catalyst pre-treatment, reduction by H2, on catalytic activity, selectivity and carbon-resistance was evaluated for the studied samples. Both catalysts provided high ethylene selectivity and activity during CO2-oxidative dehydrogenation of C2H6 at 873 K, atmospheric pressure and equimolar CO2/C2H6 ratio. The addition of NiO in the support material had a promoting effect, since it resulted in a catalyst with a twofold higher activity. Similarly, the selectivity towards C2H4 remained at high levels, above 70%, slightly increased, as it was exemplified during an iso-conversion experiment. The best candidate lost 25% of its initial activity during the first 3 h of a stability test, while it remained unchanged from 3 to 17 h. Deposited carbon was negligible, whereas sintering was identified as the main deactivation reason. Systematic XPS analysis revealed that deposition of Fe on NiO-MgO-ZrO2 support significantly affected the local environment of Ni, contributing to the enhanced catalytic performance.

The vast majority of this industrial hydrogen is produced from coal gasification or steam methane reforming, both of which need a lot of energy and generate significant carbon dioxide emissions. A much smaller proportion of hydrogen is produced from the electrolysis of water, which can be a far more sustainable and clean method if the electricity is produced from renewable sources. While the urgency of greenhouse gas emission mitigation has increased, many countries have begun to take action to decarbonize their economies. Nepal is expected to have about a 3000 MW electricity surplus by the Year 2030. It is a time to explore alternative use of electricity to make hydropower projects financially feasible. Hence it is also high time to investigate Hydropower-to-Hydrogen (H2H) technology and transfer the relevant knowledge in the region.

KU has played a role model to introduce and establish innovative and unique programs in engineering education in Nepal since it was established in 1994.

Data are analysed using a multivariate probit model to assess how perceptions and other factors influence coping and adaptation strategy choices. Seven main coping/adaptation strategies are used by goat farmers to deal with weather variability and climate change. Our econometric results show that goat farmers’ perceptions and being located in a climate-smart village, as well as market and extension information influence the choice of coping and adaptation strategies towards climate change. The results suggest that perceptions of weather variability and climate change have significant positive influence on all adaptation strategies, and that these adaptation strategies are complementary to each other as evidenced by their high inter-correlations. The fact that farmers located in climate-smart villages are more likely to adopt strategies that enable them to cope with and adapt to weather variability and climate change signals the need for project implementers to extend the number of villages benefiting from the climate-smart village concept. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change adaptation; Climate-smart village; goat producers; Lawra and Jirapa districts; multivariate probit","adaptive management; climate change; coping strategy; detection method; perception; strategic approach; village; Ghana; Lawra; Upper West Region; Capra hircus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073940197

As an environmentally friendly construction method, prefabrication should lead to reduced buildings' emissions. However, few studies have considered the uncertainty caused by errors in input parameters, scenario assumptions and choices of analytical uncertainty models when examining the embodied carbon of prefabricated high-rise buildings, leading to the misinterpretation of results. To address this, a five-level framework is developed for assessing the deterministic embodied carbon of prefabricated buildings using the process-based method. A Data Quality Index based Monte Carlo Simulation is applied for the uncertainty analysis using SimaPro 9.0 software. A typical prefabricated high-rise residential building in Hong Kong is examined. Seven scenarios are developed by varying system boundaries, materials used, partition wall thickness, waste rate, prefabrication rate, transportation distance, and analytical uncertainty model's transformation coefficients, to examine the influences of the scenario and model uncertainty. Results indicate that the embodied carbon of the case averages 561 kg CO2/m2. When considering both deterministic results and parameter uncertainty, the key processes are identified as being the production of concrete, steel and timber, as well as transportation activities. The results reveal that 31.6% of the embodied carbon can be possibly reduced by combining the pre-defined scenarios. The selection of transformation coefficients in analytical uncertainty model significantly affects the variances of the results and should be carefully examined. This paper can better facilitate the uncertainty measurement of prefabricated buildings' embodied carbon assessment for improving the reliability of results. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon reduction; Embodied carbon emission; Prefabricated high-rise building; Scenario analysis; Uncertainty analysis","Analytical models; Carbon; Computer software; Concrete industry; Concrete products; Housing; Intelligent systems; Materials handling; Monte Carlo methods; Prefabricated construction; Tall buildings; Analytical uncertainty; High rise residential building; Model uncertainties; Parameter uncertainty; Reliability of results; Transformation coefficients; Transportation distance; Uncertainty measurements; Uncertainty analysis; building; carbon emission; data quality; parameter estimation; reliability analysis; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085729699

By conducting a questionnaire survey regarding people’s willingness to adopt CS, as well as constructing metrological models to estimate the environmental consequences of the People’s Republic of China’s (hereinafter “China”) CS market, we find that environmental consequences are closely associated with the CS market. The present study makes a significant breakthrough in the field by building a bridge between them. Previous studies only estimated the environmental impact of CS independently. Analysis shows that a high level of people’s acceptance of CS predetermines the market trend and its continuity. Environmental benefits increase with market size. Results suggest that in 2017 alone, 1.69 × 109 million joules (MJ) of energy savings and an equivalent carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction of 13,6000 tons were due to China’s CS market. During the same period, China’s CS market size increased from 430 million Renminbi (RMB) in 2016 to 1.729 billion RMB in 2017. A greater magnitude of the impact is predicted in 2020 and 2025, according to an analysis of China’s lasting CS market. The impact of CS on parking land use can be quantified through a metrological model. Notably, this is the first study to build a combined dynamic and static model for estimating the reduced parking demands with regard to land use due to CS. Results suggest that in 2017, 4.68 × 109 square meters (m2) of land use savings was theoretically due to China’s CS market. While previous studies have qualitatively linked reduced vehicle ownership and parking demand, few studies have quantified the magnitude of that impact, and no models have been developed. Such complementarity makes it possible to use multiple methods in a single research program, including a mixture of quantitative and qualitative approaches. While CS originated in Europe and America, numerous studies have examined the environmental impact of CS operations worldwide. Surveys in Europe indicate that per CS user reduces CO2 emissions by 50% and that the local environmental quality has been improved by CS. An estimated annual reduction of 0.58 tons of CO2-equivalent (CO2e) per household member per year was reported in North America due to observed changes in household driving. Analysis shows that mode shifts from public transit or private car usage to CS vehicles result in an average of 146–312 kilograms (kg) of CO2 reduction per member per year in Ulm, Germany, and that employing hybrid vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs) can reduce CO2 emissions by approximately 35% and 65%, respectively, in Lisbon, Portugal. Additionally, CS users reduce transportation-related carbon dioxide emissions by up to 45–55% per household. Results suggest that upon joining a CS organization, current CS members in the United States of America (USA) reduce their average individual transportation energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by approximately 51%. With regard to the impact of CS on parking demands, results suggest that overall parking needs are reduced owing to the reduced volume of the vehicles caused by the adoption of CS. Additionally, policy implications affect CS operations greatly. Keen interest from policymakers gives a further boost to CS with regard to parking space and synergies with other mobility modes. Accordingly, recommendations for sustainable improvement of CS’s environmental benefits are as follows: CS systems should complement public transportation, as well as the proliferation of fuel-efficient CS EVs; CS operations should share preferential policies on energy savings and emission reductions; the induction of collateral environmental benefits in the context of intermodal supply, in consideration of the possible rebound effects of CS; the certification of credits for CS environmental impacts. The analysis presented herein is aimed at helping policymakers better appreciate the environmental contributions of the CS market, support the market continuously, and provide a platform for the exchange of experience (e.g., arguably, generalization of China’s CS’s operation pattern characteristic of a large proportion of new EV use in the CS market) and learn from each other in mitigating climate change in the transportation sector. We conclude with a summary of key findings and recommendations for policy formulation and future research. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon footprint; Carsharing; Energy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Sustainability; Well-to-wheel analysis","carbon dioxide; carbon footprint; climate change; energy use; environmental impact; environmental quality; greenhouse gas; innovation; land use change; mobility; ownership; questionnaire survey; willingness to pay; Baden-Wurttemberg; China; Europe; Germany; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; North America; Portugal; Ulm; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074468777

Particulate concentrations measured at high sampling rates allowed the capture of fine gradients along the route and the comparison of in-cabin air pollution on buses of different technologies. Of all metrics, BC showed the largest discrepancies, with mean concentrations of 20.1 ± 20.0 μg m−3 and 3.9 ± 26.0 μg m−3 on diesel- and biodiesel-fuelled buses, respectively. Mean PM2.5 concentrations were similar (31.6 ± 28.5 μg m−3 and 29.0 ± 17.8 μg m−3), whilst mean PN concentrations were larger on the biodiesel buses (56,697 ± 26,800 # cm−3 vs. 43,322 ± 32,243 # cm−3). The results are in line with studies on biodiesel emission factors that reported lower BC mass but more particles with smaller diameters. Our hypothesis is that different emission factors of diesel and biodiesel engines reflected in differences of in-cabin particulate concentrations. We found that the passenger exposure during the bus commutes was affected not only by the fuel used but also by the street geometry along the route, with segments with canyon configurations resulting in peak exposure to particulates. The results suggest that i) switching from diesel to biodiesel may help abate commuters’ exposure to BC particles on-board buses of the BRT system, whilst it would need to be complemented with after-treatment technologies to reduce emissions; ii) further reductions in exposure (to peaks in particular) could be achieved by changing bus routes to ones that avoid passing through narrow urban street canyons. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Black carbon; BRT; PM2.5; Short-lived climate pollutants; Ultrafine particles","Air pollution; Biodiesel; Diesel engines; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Rapid transit; Aerodynamic diameters; After-treatment technology; Bus rapid transit systems; High sampling rates; Mean concentrations; PM2.5 concentration; Street geometries; Urban street canyon; Buses; biodiesel; black carbon; diesel fuel; biofuel; atmospheric pollution; biofuel; black carbon; bus transport; concentration (composition); diesel engine; emission control; particulate matter; pollution exposure; street canyon; air pollution; Article; Brazil; carbon footprint; concentration (parameter); diesel engine; environmental exposure; environmental impact; geometry; human; particle size; particulate matter; sampling; urban area; urban population; air pollutant; city; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; Brazil; Curitiba; Parana [Brazil]; Air Pollutants; Biofuels; Brazil; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Motor Vehicles; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083566030

In this study, we used multisatellite data (from satellite altimetry, remote sensing, and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)) to investigate water storage changes in the Aral Sea and its endorheic basin. The water storage depletion rate in the Aral Sea from calibrated hypsometric curves (CHCs) created by satellite altimetry and image data agrees with the GRACE-derived result using the Slepian space domain inverse method (SSDIM). Compared with the combined filtering method (CFM) and mascon solutions, the SSDIM was shown to be an effective method of reducing the GRACE leakage error and restoring the signal attenuation in the Aral Sea. Moreover, we used the WaterGAP global hydrology model (WGHM) to qualitatively analyze the variations in the water storage components. The results show that the groundwater in the Aral Sea affects the change in the interannual water storage, especially during the extreme dry and humid periods. However, from the long-term water storage trend, the decrease in the surface storage dominates the shrinking of the Aral Sea. In addition, more details of the water storage change pattern in the endorheic basin were revealed by the enhanced GRACE solution. Our findings accentuate the severe water storage states of the Aral Sea endorheic basin under the impact of climate change and human interventions. © 2020 by the authors.","Aral Sea; CryoSat-2; Endorheic basin; ENVISAT; GRACE; Landsat; Water storage","Aneroid altimeters; Digital storage; Filtration; Geodetic satellites; Groundwater; Hydrology; Inverse problems; Remote sensing; Water resources; Anthropogenic activity; Gravity recovery and climate experiments; Human intervention; Hydrologic cycles; Hydrological modeling; Hypsometric curves; Satellite altimetry; Signal attenuation; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089465616

Most political actors who are not committed to climate change denial favor carbon pricing, either as emissions trading or carbon taxation. In this article, I argue that carbon pricing should be considered unfair in most of its forms. I present a line of criticism called the Unfair Burdens Argument. It states that the most politically relevant ways to price carbon needlessly burden the less affluent more than the more affluent. This is unfair because, among other things, the more affluent have on average done more to create the problem of climate change in the first place. Principles for the fair distribution of burdens under climate change mitigation like the Polluter Pays Principle, which were thought to support carbon pricing, turn out to speak against it, when interpreted properly. Although the Unfair Burdens Argument on its own cannot show that carbon pricing is impermissible, it offers important clues for what a morally permissible form of climate change mitigation would look like. © 2020 The Authors.

Increasing attention has been paid to the efficiency evaluation of industrial system due to its fast development and severe air pollution emissions, but the efficiency evaluation on China’s industrial waste gas still has scope for improvement. This paper proposes a global non-radial Network Data Envelopment Analysis (NDEA) model from the perspective of pollution prevention (PP) and end-of-pipe treatment (ET), to explore the potential reduction of generation and emission of air pollutants in China’s industrial system. Given the differences of different air pollution treatment capacities, the ET stage is further subdivided into three parallel sub-stages, corresponding to SO2, NOX, and soot and dust (SD), respectively. Then, grey relation analysis (GRA) is adopted to figure out the key factor affecting the unified efficiency. The main findings are summarized as follows: firstly, the unified efficiency of China’s industrial waste gas underperformed nationwide, and most provinces had the potential to reduce the generation and emission of industrial waste gas. Secondly, the PP efficiency outperformed the ET efficiency in many provinces and the efficiency gap between two stages increasingly narrowed except in 2014. Thirdly, the unified efficiency in the eastern area performed well, while the area disparities increased significantly after 2012. Fourthly, significant differences were found in three ET efficiencies and the ET efficiency of NOX was higher than that of SO2 and SD in the sample period. Finally, the results of GRA indicated that different air pollutants had distinct influence on the improvement of the unified efficiency in three areas. To promote the unified efficiency of industrial waste gas, some pertinent policy suggestions are put forward from the perspectives of sub-stages, air pollutants and areas. © 2020 by the authors.

This work presented an integrated method designed for recycling of valuable copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) through hydrochloric acid leaching and sequential extraction (using LIX 860N-I and Cyanex 572 for Cu and Zn as extractants, respectively) and clean-up of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) in consequential waste effluent by adsorption with a versatile material – bundle-like hydroxyapatite (B-HAP). The method was applied in the pilot scale tests with recovery yields of 95% and 61% for Cu and Zn, respectively. Additionally, satisfied removal efficiencies of Cd and Pb (over 95% for both) were realized, reaching the acceptable emission level for Cd and Pb in China. A scenario based on the latest MSW data in 2018 in Guangzhou was assessed through the integrated pilot experiment. The evaluation demonstrates a reduction of a $ 20.8 million cost; over 48.2 k GJ of energy consumption and 5800 tons of CO2 emission can be reduced in 2018, comparing to that landfilled in hazardous waste sites, which reveals great benefits. The valuable metal recovery in combination with decontamination of toxic elements/substances as a complete and combined process gives a promising fly ash treatment strategy in future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cd/Pb; Cu/Zn; Decontamination; Metals recycling; MSWI fly ash; Process assessment","Cadmium; Copper; Decontamination; Effluents; Energy utilization; Fly ash; Hydroxyapatite; Lead; Municipal solid waste; Waste incineration; Comprehensive evaluation; Environmental contamination; Hazardous waste sites; Hydrochloric acid leaching; Hydrometallurgical process; Municipal solid waste incineration fly ashes; Sequential extraction; Valuable metal recovery; Metal recovery; cadmium; carbon dioxide; copper; hydrochloric acid; hydroxyapatite; lead; zinc; adsorption; cadmium; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; effluent; fly ash; incineration; lead; municipal solid waste; waste treatment; adsorption; Article; carbon footprint; China; controlled study; cost control; decontamination; effluent; evaluation study; extraction; fly ash; greenhouse effect; hydrometallurgical process; incineration; leaching; metal recovery; municipal solid waste incineration; pilot study; priority journal; processing; recycling; sequential extraction; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084329763

Case summary: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons present in cigarette smoke are well-known inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. CYP1A2 induction by cigarette smoking increases metabolic clearance of substrates of this enzyme; smoking cessation results in a decrease in CYP1A2 activity, which causes an increase in serum substrate levels. Although these effects are well documented, the effect of smoking cessation remains a hidden danger, in part, because computerized drug interaction surveillance systems are not designed to alert clinicians when an offending agent is discontinued. Practice implication: To raise awareness and demonstrate the importance of a thorough assessment of smoking status, we present a case in which the temporal relationship of smoking cessation to the emergence of nausea, vomiting, and tachycardia 3 days later (day 3); the development of myoclonic jerks by day 5; and the resolution of symptoms on reduction of duloxetine dosage on day 44 implicates duloxetine toxicity in a patient with ischemic cardiomyopathy awaiting implantation of a left ventricular assist device. © 2020 American Pharmacists Association®",,"acetylsalicylic acid; amiodarone; atorvastatin; budesonide plus formoterol; carvedilol; clonazepam; clopidogrel; digoxin; duloxetine; enoxaparin; febuxostat; finasteride; formoterol fumarate plus mometasone furoate; levetiracetam; lisinopril; magnesium; mexiletine; nicotine patch; ondansetron; pantoprazole; potassium; sacubitril plus valsartan; spironolactone; tamsulosin; tiotropium bromide; warfarin; duloxetine; absence; aged; Article; cardioversion; case report; clinical article; dizziness; drug dose increase; drug dose reduction; drug withdrawal; emergency care; emergency ward; epigastric discomfort; falling; heart rate; heart ventricle tachycardia; hospital discharge; hospital readmission; human; magnesium blood level; male; myoclonus; nausea; neurologic examination; potassium blood level; rehabilitation center; smoking cessation; tremor; vomiting; adverse event; drug interaction; smoking; tobacco; Drug Interactions; Duloxetine Hydrochloride; Humans; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Tobacco",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079837385

The biogeochemical significance of submarine karstic springs and their impact on coastal primary production are often difficult to quantify. We investigated several karstic springs, including the first-order Port-Miou spring, in an urbanized watershed that is also severely impacted by sewage effluent (Calanques of Marseille-Cassis, France). Karstic springs were elevated in major nutrients and bioactive trace metals over Mediterranean seawater, with relatively low concentration ranges. Groundwater NO3 − was likely derived from atmosphere-aquifer interactions, while DOC:DON ratios reveal that NO2 − and NH4 + was autochthonously produced during mixing between karst groundwater and seawater. Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) during March 2018 (wet season, baseflow conditions) was 6.7 ± 2.0 m3 s−1 for the entire investigated coastline, determined from simultaneous 224Ra and 226Ra mass balances. The contribution of groundwater PO4 3−, the major limiting nutrient of the Mediterranean Sea, sustained only 1% of primary production adjacent to sewage outfall, but between 7 and 100% of the local primary production in areas that were not impacted by sewage. Groundwater and seawater Fe:DIN and Fe:DIP ratios suggest that Fe was not a limiting micro-nutrient during the period of study, where bioactive trace metal fluxes were dominated by sewage and atmospheric deposition, although excess Fe from groundwater may locally enhance N fixation. Groundwater solute fluxes may easily vary by a factor of two or more over time because karst aquifers are sensitive to precipitation, as is the case of the regional carbonate karstified aquifer of Port-Miou, highlighting the critical importance of properly characterizing nutrient and trace metal inputs in these coastal environments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","GEOTRACES; Karst; Nutrients; Radium isotopes; Springs; Submarine groundwater discharge","Aquifers; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Iron; Landforms; Meteorological problems; Seawater; Sewage; Springs (water); Submarines; Trace elements; Atmospheric depositions; Carbonate aquifer; Coastal environments; Groundwater springs; Karst groundwater; Low concentrations; Primary production; Submarine groundwater discharge; Nutrients; ground water; nitrogen; organic carbon; sea water; sulfate; sulfite; surface water; trace metal; aquifer; biogeochemistry; karst hydrology; nutrient; oligotrophic environment; primary production; seawater; spring water; trace metal; aquifer; Article; atmosphere; atmospheric deposition; biogeochemistry; biological activity; chemical analysis; climate; environmental management; environmental temperature; flow cytometry; geographic and geological phenomena; geomorphology; karstic spring; Mediterranean Sea; nitrogen fixation; phytoplankton; precipitation; priority journal; salinity; sewage effluent; submarine groundwater discharge; waste water treatment plant; water flow; weathering; winter; Bouches du Rhone; France; Mediterranean Sea; Port Miou; Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084504133

Research has confirmed that 15 to 20% further energy efficiency improvement is possible, which would reduce the sector’s greenhouse gas emissions and help meet global emission reduction initiatives. In this context, this research aims at developing a bottom-up system-based model to evaluate the long-term potential of energy efficiency alternatives in greenhouse gas mitigation. A case study was conducted for the Canadian iron and steel sector. The developed framework involves review of the state of the art in iron and steel production technologies, demand tree development, energy-environmental modeling, scenario development, and analysis. Twenty-six mitigation scenarios were developed in planning horizons ending in 2030 and 2050. A 13% improvement in Canadian iron and steel energy efficiency could be achieved by increasing the production share of the electric arc furnace route from 41% in the base year to 56% by 2050. The results of the analysis suggest that 19 and 38 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emission reduction are achievable in the 2010–2030 and 2010–2050 planning horizons, respectively. This translates to an approximately 6% reduction in emissions compared to the baseline scenarios at a cost of − $76 and − $51 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent in the 2010–2030 and 2010–2050 time periods, respectively. The results also reveal that more than 85% of the potential emission reductions are achievable with negative costs and are economically attractive. The study provides insights to decision makers at different levels of industry and government. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Energy efficiency; Energy modeling; GHG mitigation; Iron and steel; Scenario analysis","Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Decision making; Electric arcs; Electric furnaces; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Metallurgical furnaces; Steelmaking; Carbon dioxide emissions; Electric arc furnace; Energy efficiency improvements; Environmental model; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Iron and steel productions; Scenario development; Iron and steel industry; carbon emission; decision making; demand-side management; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; iron and steel industry; scenario analysis; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088116312

In various single photon emitters, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) with point defects is one of the most promising candidates as a single photon emitter for high photostability, ultrahigh brightness, nonlinearity, and narrow emission line width. In applying hBN with a single point defect to those applications, three-dimensional determination of its dipole orientation is critically important. In this paper, we three-dimensionally determine the dipole orientation of single defects in hBN nanoflakes. By measuring the second-order correlation function and emission spectra, hBN nanoflakes with single defects were found from hBN nanoflakes placed on microscope coverslips. High-resolution emission intensity patterns were measured by exciting the defects in the hBNs with a focused radially polarized beam and azimuthally polarized beam. By comparing these patterns with theoretical calculations, we determined the polar angle and azimuthal angle of the dipole moment and found that they were oriented near the plane of the layers of the hBN nanoflakes on the microscope coverslip on which they were placed. This information is important to realize highly efficient quantum information devices in which the dipole orientation has to be precisely controlled. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","2D materials; confocal microscope; dipole orientation; hexagonal boron nitride; single-photon emitters; vector beam","Boron nitride; Emission spectroscopy; III-V semiconductors; Nitrides; Photons; Point defects; Quantum optics; Azimuthally polarized beams; Hexagonal boron nitride; Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN); High-resolution emission; Quantum information device; Radially polarized beam; Second-order correlation functions; Theoretical calculations; Particle beams",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088871275

Since climate conditions control tree secondary growth throughout the growing season, it is assumed that climate change will differently impact the formation of particular tree-ring sectors. In this study, we evaluated spatiotemporal trends in Pinus sylvestris L. tree-ring traits: tree-ring (RW), earlywood (EW) and latewood (LW) widths, as well as their climate response in order to understand potential reactions of P. sylvestris radial growth to climate change along a 4900 km longitudinal transect of increasing continentality in southern Siberia. Results indicated an increasing tree radial growth from the West to the East along the transect. Tree-ring parameters were sensitive to drought, showing a temporal delay in the climatic signals of LW (summer) relative to EW (spring). Climate control of tree growth was stronger at the western site, while it was alleviated over time in eastern sites. This study highlighted the wide plasticity of P. sylvestris to thrive within a wide range of climatic conditions, also suggesting that future drought, as predicted by climate change simulations, will potentially impact P. sylvestris growth differently along the studied gradient, being more susceptible at the western sites due to the current growth limitation. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Drought; Earlywood; Forest-Steppe; Latewood; Radial growth; SPEI","climate change; climate conditions; coniferous tree; environmental factor; forest-steppe; growing season; growth; transect; tree ring; Siberia; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085313123

The photosensitization of NiO by the organic dye P1, with a surface coverage of 1.5 × 10-8 mol cm-2, allows the hybrid material to absorb light in the 400-650 nm range. In addition, it improves the stability and the catalytic activity of the final material decorated with palladium nanoparticles (nPd). The resulting multi-layered-type photocathode operates according to the electron-transfer-cascade mechanism. On the one hand, the photosensitizer P1 plays a central role as it generates excited-state electrons and transfers them to nPd, thus producing the catalytically active hydride material PdHx. On the other hand, the dispersed nPd, absorb/adsorb hydrogen and accumulate electrons, thus easing the reductive electrocatalysis process by further driving the separation of charges at the photoelectrochemical interface. Surface analysis, morphology, and roughness have been assessed using SEM, EDS, and AFM imaging. Both conventional electrochemical and photoelectrochemical experiments have been performed to confirm the catalytic activity of hybrid photocathodes toward the CO2 reduction. The recorded cathodic photocurrents have been found to be dependent on the loading of Pd nanoparticles. A sufficient amount of loaded catalyst facilitates the electron transfer cascade, making the amount of dye grafted at the surface of the electrode the limiting parameter in catalysis. The formation of CO as the main reaction product is postulated, though the formation of traces of other small organic molecules (e.g. methanol) cannot be excluded. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Catalyst activity; Electrocatalysis; Electrochemistry; Electron transitions; Excited states; Field emission cathodes; Hybrid materials; Light; Morphology; Nanoparticles; Nickel oxide; Palladium; Photocathodes; Photosensitizers; Reduction; Selective catalytic reduction; Surface analysis; Cascade mechanism; Cathodic photocurrent; Electron transfer; Palladium nanoparticles; Photoelectrochemicals; Selective reduction; Small organic molecules; Visible-light-driven; Palladium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090986298

Our literature search included all publications on drought stress related to either the biosynthetic context of volatiles, or the ecophysiology and environmental interactions of species via these compounds. In addition, we surveyed publications on practical questions, such as the optimization of cultivation techniques of essential oil bearing plants. Emphasis was placed on theories explaining regularities in the detected symptoms of test plants and discrepancies of other results. Carbon allocation from primarily metabolism to secondary one, competition of parallel terpenoid pathways and the surplus of reductive power are the main theories that are discussed around. During evaluation, the main question was: which principles have already been justified in the biosynthesis/accumulation/emission of plant volatiles due to drought stress? What are the strengths and limitations of the theories? In discussing results from different scientific fields, the intention is to reveal logical connections that are yet to be addressed in the future co-operative multidisciplinary research. The simple question—whether drought stress increases the biosynthesis/accumulation/emission of plant volatiles—is not adequate any more.

Fluctuations in daytime and nighttime temperatures due to climate change narrows diurnal temperature amplitude which can alter circadian rhythms in plant, thus influence the ability of plants to cope with temperature changes and cause contradictory responses in carbon tradeoff, particularly in night respiration during dark phase, and growth. Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is a key C4 cereal crop grown in high temperature challenging agro-climatic regions. Hence, it is important to understand its response to diurnal temperature amplitude. This is the first systematic investigation using controlled environmental facility to monitor the response of sorghum to different diurnal temperature amplitudes with same mean temperature. Two sorghum hybrids (DK 53 and DK 28E) were grown under optimum (27°C) and high (35°C) mean temperatures with three different diurnal temperature amplitudes (2, 10, and 18°C) accomplished by modulating daytime and nighttime temperatures [optimum daytime and nighttime temperatures (ODNT): 28/26, 32/22, and 36/18°C and high daytime and nighttime temperatures (HDNT): 36/34, 40/30, and 44/26°C]. After exposure to different temperature conditions, total soluble sugars, starch, total leaf area and biomass were reduced, while night respiration and specific leaf area were increased with narrowing of diurnal temperature amplitude (18 to 2°C) of HDNT followed by ODNT. However, there was no influence on photosynthesis across different ODNT and HDNT. Contradiction in response of foliar gas exchange and growth suggests higher contribution of night respiration for maintenance rather than growth with narrowing of diurnal temperature amplitude of ODNT and HDNT. Results imply that diurnal temperature amplitude has immense impact on the carbon tradeoff and growth, regardless of hybrid variation. Hence, diurnal temperature amplitude and night respiration should be considered while quantifying response and screening for high temperature tolerance in sorghum genotypes and comprehensive understanding of dark phase mechanisms which are coupled with stress response can further strengthen screening procedures. © Copyright © 2020 Sunoj, Prasad, Ciampitti and Maswada.","carbohydrates composition; diurnal temperature amplitude; growth; high night temperature; night respiration; sorghum",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090282671

Global warming and consequent changes in climate adversely affect wheat plant growth and yield. To elucidate genetic basis and map heat tolerance traits, a set of 134 backcross inbred lines (BILs) derived from the cross between WH730/*2 HD2733 was used. The population was evaluated under late sown (LS) and very late sown (VLS) conditions, by exposing to heat stress during rabi season. Positive association of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), thousand grain weight (TGW), grain weight per spike (GWS), biomass and grain yield (GY) under both production conditions was observed. However, canopy temperature (CT) and days to heading (DH) showed negative correlation with GY under heat stress. A total of 9 Quantitative trait loci (QTL) were discovered on 7 chromosomes, which includes 4 QTLs in LS and 5 QTLs under VLS condition. Combining the results of these QTLs revealed a major stable QTL for DH (qDH_iari_5A) on chromosome 5A with 23% and 26% explaining phenotypic variance under both sowing conditions. QTL for NDVI was detected on chromosome 1B while QTL for SL and GY on chromosome 2A.

The aim of the reported research was to estimate effects on food production, household energy access and life cycle climate impact from introduction of biochar-producing cookstoves on smallholder farms in Kenya. Participatory research on biochar production and use was undertaken with 150 Kenyan smallholder farming households. Gasifier cookstove functionality, fuel efficiency and emissions were measured, as well as biochar effects on agricultural yields after application to soil. Cookstoves provided benefits through reduced smoke, fuel wood savings and char production, but challenges were found related to labour for fuel preparation, lighting and refilling. On-farm trials with varying rates of biochar inputs, in combination with and without mineral fertilizers, have led to a sustained increase of maize yields following one-time application. The climate impact in a life cycle perspective was considerably lower for the system with cookstove production of biochar and use of biochar in agriculture than for current cooking practices. Climate benefits from biochar production and use are thus possible on smallholder farms in sub-Saharan Africa, through reduced use of biomass in cooking, reduced emissions of products of incomplete combustion and sequestration of stable biochar carbon in soils. Biochar-producing cookstoves can be implemented as a climate change mitigation method in rural sub-Saharan Africa. Successful implementation will require changes in cooking systems including fuel supply, as well as farming systems, which, in turn, requires an understanding of local socio-cultural conditions, including power relations and gender aspects. © 2020, The Author(s).","Biochar-producing gasifier stove; Bioenergy; Greenhouse gas; Life cycle assessment; Woodfuel","biochar; climate change; cooking appliance; crop yield; emission control; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; participatory approach; rural area; smallholder; Africa; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087043194

At the municipal level, multi-stakeholder partnerships are often formed to implement community sustainability plans. However, these partnerships can create new challenges, as it is cumbersome to coordinate action among a group that is made up of such diverse stakeholders. Past research suggests that it is important for these partnerships to have the appropriate structures in place to mitigate some of the coordination challenges to which they are prone. Yet, very few studies have examined the influence that different structural features have on plan outcomes. This article seeks to address this important research gap by using quantitative methods to examine five different features that can compose partnership structures-oversight, monitoring and evaluation, partner engagement, communication, and community wide-actions and their impact on climate change mitigation outcomes. Based on data collected through a global survey and publicly available greenhouse gases emission data from 72 different partnerships that implement community sustainability plans (CSPs), this study finds that structural features related to oversight and community-wide actions are positively associated with climate change mitigation outcomes. These results indicate that certain features of partnership structures may be more important for achieving desirable climate change mitigation outcomes, and thus contribute to research on collaborative governance structures and climate action. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate action; Climate change; Climate mitigation; Collaboration; Collective action; Cross-sector partnership; Local Agenda 21; SDG 17; Sustainable communities; Urban sustainability","action plan; business; climate change; governance approach; greenhouse gas; mitigation; participatory approach; partnership approach; policy implementation; research work; stakeholder; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089395051

It is of great significance for regional socio- eco-nomic sustainable development and environmental protection to conduct a glacier service value assessment and to analyze its spatiotemporal characteristics. Based on the first and second Chinese glacier inventories of the Qilian Mountains, a glacier service value evaluation system was established. Then the glacier service value and its spatiotemporal variation were assessed by combining the methods of unit area service price, value equivalent factor, and the glacier service value change index (GSCI). Three key results were obtained. (1) The total service value of glaciers in the Qilian Mountains for 2016 was 24.354 billion yuan. The main services provided were climate regulation and runoff regulation, which accounted for 60.58% and 33.14% of the total service value, respectively. Minor services were freshwater supply and hydropower, which accounted for 3.47% and 1.75% of the total value, respectively. The value of other types of services was about 0.259 billion yuan. (2) Among the various river systems in the Qilian Mountains, the Shule River basin had the highest glacier service value (7.771 billion yuan, 31.91%), followed by the Haltang River basin (4.321 billion yuan, 17.74%) and the Beida River basin (3.281 billion yuan, 13.47%). In terms of administrative divisions, the glacier service value of the Qilian Mountains in Qinghai Province was 1.138 billion yuan higher than that of Gansu Province at 11.608 billion yuan, of which the services in the Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Jiuquan City were valued at 11.124 (45.68%) and 7.758 (31.86%) billion yuan, respectively. (3) During the period from 1956 to 2010, the service value of glaciers in the Qilian Mountains declined by 435 million yuan, with an acceleration in the decreasing trend from west to east. © 2020, Science in China Press.","functions and services; glacier; Qilian Mountains; spatiotemporal characteristics; value evaluation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087769210

What issues make efforts to change from conventional taxis to electric taxis an important measurement to achieve targets in energy-saving and reduce emissions because electric taxi has the potential to resource savings and to improve urban air quality. This study was conducted to diagnose the potential application of electric taxis by conducting a feasibility study, social impact, and environmental analysis in the implementation of the electric taxis to measure sustainability aspects.

Results show that propulsion control and electric power generation modes have a notable influence on the ship's fuel consumption and emissions during the voyage. During close-to-port manoeuvres, propelling the ship in power-take-in (PTI) mode and generating the electric power by auxiliary engines rather than the main engine will reduce the local NOx and HC (hydrocarbons) emissions significantly. Sailing the ship on LNG will reduce the fuel consumption, CO2 and NOx emissions notably while producing higher HC emissions than traditional fuels. The hybridisation of the ship propulsion and using LNG together with ship voyage optimisation, considering the ship mission, ship operations and sea conditions, will improve the ship's fuel consumption and emissions over the whole voyage significantly. © 2020 by the authors.","Electric power generating system; Hybrid propulsion; LNG; Mission profile; Power take off/in; Propulsion control; Ship propulsion system",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089837837

In this paper, we propose a novel process for production of liquefied synthetic natural gas (SNG) from waste tires via a rotary kiln gasification process. We use a combination of experimental data available in the open literature, first principles mathematical models and empirical models to study three design cases (without CO2 Capture and Sequestration (CCS), with precombustion CCS and with pre- and postcombustion CCS) in two locations (USA and Norway). The thermodynamic, economic and environmental performance of the concept is studied. The results show that minimum selling prices of 16.7, 17.5 and 19.9 $/GJLHV,SNG are required for USA and 20.9, 21.8 and 24.9 $/GJLHV,SNG for Norway. We note that these prices may become competitive under certain regulatory conditions (such as recent public policy movement in British Columbia, Canada requiring public utilities to purchase natural gas made from renewables at prices up to 30 $/GJLHV,SNG). The minimum selling price reduces substantially with process scale and with levying tipping fees.

Shifts in vegetation productivity and composition in permafrost regions could influence soil organic carbon (SOC) turnover rates via rhizosphere (root zone) priming effects (RPEs), but these processes are not currently accounted for in model predictions. We use a radiocarbon (bomb-14C) approach to test for RPEs in two Arctic tall shrubs, alder (Alnus viridis (Chaix) DC.) and birch (Betula glandulosa Michx.), and in ericaceous heath tundra vegetation. We compare surface CO2 efflux rates and 14C content between intact vegetation and plots in which below-ground allocation of recent photosynthate was prevented by trenching and removal of above-ground biomass. We show, for the first time, that recent photosynthate drives mineralization of older (&gt;50 years old) SOC under birch shrubs and ericaceous heath tundra. By contrast, we find no evidence of RPEs in soils under alder. This is the first direct evidence from permafrost systems that vegetation influences SOC turnover through below-ground C allocation. The vulnerability of SOC to decomposition in permafrost systems may therefore be directly linked to vegetation change, such that expansion of birch shrubs across the Arctic could increase decomposition of older SOC. Our results suggest that carbon cycle models that do not include RPEs risk underestimating the carbon cycle feedbacks associated with changing conditions in tundra regions. © 2020 The Authors.

With increases in the area burned by severe wildfire in seasonally dry forests expected to result from climate change, judicious, science-based fire and restoration strategies will be essential for improving the resilience of forest ecosystems. We argue that fire use treatments (including prescribed fires and managed wildfires) as well as restoration thinning strategies, rather than conflicting with existing environmental objectives, will provide numerous co-benefits, including enhanced biodiversity, increased water availability, greater long-term and more sustainable carbon storage, improved forest resilience and adaptation to climate change, and reduced air pollution. Timber production, however, may have to be better aligned with fire management goals to achieve these co-benefits.

It is found that the postmidnight FAI echoes show high percentage of occurrence (PO) during June–July and low PO in December–January of low solar activity years. As solar activity approaches minimum, the PO increase is extended to May, August, and September. The space-time Fourier analysis on the temperature information obtained from the Sounding of Atmosphere by Broadband Emission Radiometry instrument onboard Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics satellite reveals that at the low-latitude upper mesospheric heights, though the migrating diurnal tide propagating westward with zonal wavenumber (k) 1 (DW1) dominates the migrating semidiurnal tide propagating westward with k = 2 (SW2) particularly during the equinox months, the SW2 tidal amplitudes are larger than DW1 during June–July. The postmidnight FAI echoes appear to be more frequent during the sudden stratospheric warming of the Solar Minimum Years 2018–2019 and 2008–2009 but not in the Solar Maximum Year 2013. The dominance of SW2 over DW1 is also noted during these years. This indicates that the SW2 plays a major role in the occurrence of postmidnight spread F.

Its character can be considered unique due to its geographical location, topography and the functioning PGE GiEK S.A. Turów Power Complex (ELT), and, in particular, the PGE GiEK S.A. Turów Coal Mine (KWBT). The conducted analyses have defined three scenarios of emission changes: (1) scenario related to the activities of the energy complex resulting from the minimizing measures indicated in the report on the environmental impact of the mine, (2) scenario resulting from the so-called ""anti-smog""regional resolution and (3) scenario compiling the abovementioned scenarios. According to the analyses, the lowest values of the annual mean PM2.5 concentration were noted in the eastern part of the studied area and did not exceed 14 μg/m3 (56% of the permissible level). The best results in improving air quality were proven for scenario 3, i.e., a 10% reduction in concentration values over the entire analyzed area of the commune. In the case of this scenario, as the most effective and health-promoting solution, only in 25% of the area was the improvement in the residents' health below 5%, while the reduction in the estimated number of premature deaths by over 15% was observed in nearly one third of the studied area. © 2020 by the authors.","Health risk; Lignite mine; PM10; PM2.5; WRF-CALMET/CALPUFF","Air quality; Coal industry; Coal mines; Decision support systems; Emission control; Health; Topography; Concentration values; Decision supports; Emission change; Emission reduction; Geographical locations; PM2.5 concentration; Power complex; Premature death; Quality control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090216416

An improved understanding of on-road FFCO2 emissions is essential to both carbon science and mitigation policy. Previous studies have identified the driving factors and quantified their relationship to on-road FFCO2 emissions. However, they have been primarily based on case studies conducted in individual cities, and the research results remain inconclusive due to the considerable heterogeneity of cities and associated outcomes. In order to achieve more general results and to further understand their uncertainties, this study explored the relationships between socio-economic/urban form data and self-reported on-road ffco2 emissions for a sample of global cities based on the adjusted Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence and Technology (STIRPAT) model. The robustness and sensitivity of these relationships was evaluated by introducing artificial errors, conducting cross-validation, and examining various model specifications. Results indicated that fuel economy (p-value &lt; 3.1 × 10-8), vehicle ownership (p-value &lt; 3.0 × 10-4), road density (p-value &lt; 4.4 × 10-3) and population density (p-value &lt; 3.1 × 10-3) were statistically significant factors that correlate with on-road FFCO2 emissions. Of these four variables, fuel economy and vehicle ownership had the most robust relationships. These results offer potential policy insights into on-road FFCO2 emissions mitigation in cities, in addition to offering a means to generate emissions estimates without detailed bottom-up information. © 2020 by the authors.","Global cities; On-road emission; Sensitivity analysis; Socio-economic/urban form factors","car ownership; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; global perspective; heterogeneity; population density; socioeconomic status; traffic emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089475972

However, these springs and seeps are potentially vulnerable to contamination, increased groundwater extraction, or reduced recharge due to climate change. In this study, statistical methods are used to investigate δ2H and δ18O in precipitation, surface water, and groundwater to determine groundwater source. A mixing model for δ18O is developed using statistically distinct seasonal end-members represented by modeled winter (Nov–Apr) precipitation and summer (May–Oct) surface-water run-off. The calculated fraction of winter recharge (Fwin) indicates that South Rim groundwater is primarily sourced from snow-melt and winter rains with an average Fwin of 0.97 ± 0.09. Groundwater sourced from the highest elevations of the study area are more depleted than the winter end-member, suggesting values of Fwin are overestimated or a meaningful portion of winter recharge occurs at lower elevations. Lower-elevation recharge from the Coconino Plateau is supported by consistent spatial trends in δ2H and δ18O with respect to longitude, Fwin values &lt;0.9 for 9 of the 50 samples, and age tracer data indicating young groundwater discharging from springs which is distinct from old groundwater observed in the regional flow system. These results suggest a new conceptual model is needed to account for recharge sources from low elevation and summer precipitation. Results imply resource managers may need to reconsider current land-use and water management practices on the South Rim to protect future water quantity and quality. © 2020, The Author(s).","Groundwater recharge; Stable isotopes; USA; Water-resources conservation","groundwater; hydrogen isotope; hydrological modeling; mixing; oxygen isotope; precipitation (climatology); recharge; source identification; stable isotope; water management; Arizona; Grand Canyon; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086713983

The short-term impacts of forest residue biochar (BC) on the productivity and carbon (C) storage of arable boreal clay soil were studied in a field experiment. In addition, rain simulations and aggregate stability tests were carried out to investigate the potential of BC to reduce nutrient export to surface waters. A BC addition of 30 t ha−1 increased soil test phosphorus and decreased bulk density in the surface soil but did not significantly change pH or water retention properties, and most importantly, did not increase the yield. There were no changes in the bacterial or fungal communities, or biomasses. Soil basal respiration was higher in BC-amended plots in the spring, but no differences in respiration rates were detected in the fall two years after the application. Rain simulation experiments did not support the use of BC in reducing erosion or the export of nutrients from the field. Of the C added, on average 80% was discovered in the 0–45 cm soil layer one year after the application. Amendment of boreal clay soil with a high rate of BC characterized by a moderately alkaline pH, low surface functionalities, and a recalcitrant nature, did not induce such positive impacts that would unambiguously motivate farmers to invest in BC. BC use seems unviable from the farmer's perspective but could play a role in climate change mitigation, as it will likely serve as long-term C storage. © 2018 The Authors","Biochar; Carbon sequestration; Microbial community; Nutrient leaching; Soil productivity; Soil quality","Alkalinity; Clay; Climate change; Forestry; Nutrients; Rain; Surface testing; Aggregate stability; Basal respiration; Climate change mitigation; Environmental benefits; Respiration rate; Soil test phosphorus; Surface functionalities; Water retention properties; Soil testing; charcoal; forest residue biochar; phosphorus; rain; unclassified drug; biochar; charcoal; agricultural soil; biochar; carbon storage; clay soil; soil amendment; soil respiration; water retention; agricultural land; agronomy; alkalinity; amplicon; Article; biomass; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; climate change; controlled study; environmental impact; environmental parameters; forest; fungal community; leaching; micro-computed tomography; microbial community; nonhuman; pH measurement; physical chemistry; physical parameters; polymerase chain reaction; porosity; priority journal; quantitative analysis; soil amendment; soil microflora; soil moisture; soil quality; water retention; clay; forest; soil; Bacteria (microorganisms); Charcoal; Clay; Forests; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084456173

The combustion of large amounts of conventional fuels by cars contributes to a significant release of various compounds into the atmosphere, such as solid particles, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. In order to reduce these pollutants in places of their high concentration (especially in urban agglomerations), the use of ecological means of transport for daily driving is highly recommended. Electric vehicles (EV) are characterized by ecological potential due to their lack of direct emissions and low noise. However, in Poland and many other countries, electricity production is still based on fossil fuels which can significantly influence the indirect emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere associated with battery charging. Thus, indirect emissions from electric cars may be comparable or even higher than direct emissions related to the use of traditional cars. Therefore, the aim of the work was to analyze the amount of carbon dioxide emissions associated with the use of electric vehicles for daily driving (City, Sedan, SUV) and their impact on the environment on a local and global scale. Based on the assumed daily number of kilometers driven by the vehicle and the collected certified catalog data (Car Info Nordic AB), the direct emissions generated by the internal combustion engines (ICE) were calculated for specific cars. These values were compared to the indirect emissions related to the source of electricity generation, for the calculation of which the CO2 emission coefficient for a particular energy source and energy mix was used, as well as reference values of electricity generation efficiency in a given combustion installation, in accordance with the KOBiZE (The National Centre for Emissions Management) and European Union regulation. Indirect emissions generated from non-renewable fuels (lignite, hard coal, natural gas, diesel oil, heating oil, municipal waste) and renewable emissions (wind energy, solar energy, hydro energy, biomass, biogas) were considered. The results indicated that for the Polish case study, indirect carbon dioxide emission associated with the daily driving of EV (distance of 26 km) ranges 2.49–3.28 kgCO2∙day−1. As a result, this indirect emission can be even higher than direct emissions associated with ICE usage (2.55–5.64 kgCO2∙day−1). © 2020 by the authors.","CO2 emission; Daily driving; Direct emission; Electric car; Indirect emission","Automotive batteries; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Charging (batteries); Coal combustion; Coal industry; Diesel engines; Electric power generation; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Waste incineration; Wind power; Carbon dioxide emissions; Electricity generation; Electricity generation efficiencies; Electricity production; Emissions management; European Union regulations; Impact on the environment; Urban agglomerations; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090891746

Its goal is to prevent violation of health standard of air quality in a few monitored zones. The control establishes restrictions on the emission rates of industrial sources and includes the identification of the industrial sources violating (exceeding) the emission rates set by the control. Both control and identification are based on using solutions to an adjoint dispersion model. Conditions that show the convergence of the emission rates, prescribed by the control, to the original emission rates of the industrial sources are given (Theorems 4 and 5). These results ensure that the new emission rates of industrial sources (established by the control) will be as close as possible to the original emission rates throughout the entire period of application of the control. This creates the minimum possible restrictions on the functioning of industrial enterprises. The highlight of the new control is the possibility of selecting special weights for each pollution source in the goal function that is minimized. These weights are mainly aimed at reducing the intensity of emissions of the main sources of pollution. An example demonstrates the ability of the new method. A similar approach can also be used to develop methods for cleaning water zones polluted by oil (the problem of bioremediation), and to prevent excessive pollution of urban areas with automobile emissions. © 2020, South China University of Technology, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adjoint estimates; adjoint model; Dispersion model; optimal control; source detection","Air quality; Bioremediation; Industrial emissions; Water pollution; Atmospheric inversions; Automobile emission; Dispersion modeling; Industrial enterprise; Industrial sources; Intensity of emission; Optimal controls; Pollution sources; Quality control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089381606

Thus, it is imperative to examine potential invasion dynamics of P. juliflora at national level under climate change scenario to better influence decision making processes on the management of this invasive species. We derived a consensus model from five modeling approaches to examine the current and future (2050 and 2070) climatic suitability for P. juliflora under two climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) in Ethiopia. Under the current climatic scenario, 94.8% of the country was non-suitable for P. juliflora establishment and invasion while 0.4% (4.56 million ha) was highly suitable. In 2050, highly suitable area for P. juliflora is expected to increase by 55.6% and 63.6%, while moderately suitable area is projected to increase by 33.3% and 42.9% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios, respectively. Compared to the current climatic condition, in 2070, highly suitable area for the species is projected to increase by 73.3% (3.43 million ha) and 80.0% (3.65 million ha) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenario, respectively. With the current cover, this invasive species had already caused significant impact on rangelands in many parts of the country. Its further expansion would worsen the problem, leading to great environmental and economic damage, thereby threatening the livelihood of the community. Negative environmental and economical impacts caused by the species will be high if preventive and effective management measures are not earnestly taken, and it becomes one of the major challenges for the 21st century pastoralism and their livelihoods.

Aedes-borne diseases, in particular, including dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, are increasing at an alarming rate due to urbanisation, population movement, weak vector control programmes, and climate change. The World Health Organization calls for strengthening of vector control programmes in line with the Global Vector Control Response (GVCR) strategy, and many vector control programmes are transitioning to this new approach. The Singapore dengue control programme, situated within the country’s larger vision of a clean, green, and sustainable environment for the health and well-being of its citizens, provides an excellent example of the GVCR approach in action. Since establishing vector control operations in the 1960s, the Singapore dengue control programme succeeded in reducing the dengue force of infection 10-fold by the 1990s and has maintained it at low levels ever since. Key to this success is consideration of dengue as an environmental disease, with a strong focus on source reduction and other environmental management methods as the dominant vector control strategy. The programme collaborates closely with other government minis-tries, as well as town councils, communities, the private sector, and academic and research institutions. Community engagement programmes encourage source reduction, and house-to-house inspections accompanied by a strong legislative framework with monetary penalties help to support compliance. Strong vector and epidemiological surveillance means that routine control activities can be heightened to specifically target dengue clusters. Despite its success, the programme continues to innovate to tackle challenges such as climate change, low herd immunity, and manpower constraints. Initiatives include development of novel vector controls such as Wolbachia-infected males and spatiotemporal models for dengue risk assessment. Lessons learnt from the Singapore programme can be applied to other settings, even those less well-resourced than Singapore, for more effective vector control. © 2020 Sim et al.",,"climate change; dengue; disease surveillance; disease transmission; environmental disease; geographic distribution; health program; health promotion; herd immunity; human; intersectoral collaboration; mobilization; nonhuman; private sector; public health; Review; risk assessment; Singapore; vector control; virus transmission; wellbeing; Wolbachia; World Health Organization; Aedes; animal; community participation; dengue; mosquito control; mosquito vector; organization and management; procedures; virology; Aedes; Animals; Community Participation; Dengue; Humans; Mosquito Control; Mosquito Vectors; Singapore",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090020507

This study aimed to assess the temporal evolution of the air quality in the city of Setúbal (Portugal) during a time period of 10 years (2003–2012), by evaluating seasonal trends of air pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, O3, NO, NO2 and NOx) measured in nine monitoring stations. In order to identify emission sources of particulate matter, PM2.5 and PM2.5–10 were characterized in two different areas (urban traffic and industrial) in winter and summer and, afterwards, source apportionment was performed by means of Positive Matrix Factorization. Overall, the air quality has been improving over the years with a decreasing trend of air pollutant concentration, with the exception of O3. Despite this improvement, levels of PM10, O3 and nitrogen oxides still do not fully comply with the requirements of European legislation, as well as with the guideline values of the World Health Organization (WHO). The main anthropogenic sources contributing to local PM levels were traffic, industry and wood burning, which should be addressed by specific mitigation measures in order to minimize their impact on the local air quality. © 2020 by the authors.

Sudden failure can cause serious problem to safety and halt in production. Failure analysis is mostly carried out by Thermal Analysis, Oil Debris Analysis, Vibration Analysis, Acoustic Emission analysis. Contact stresses reduce the service life of a rolling bearing and very less investigated. In roller bearings, the outer ring is usually fixed and the inner ring has the rolling motion. Concerning TRB (tapered roller bearings); this motion generates forces that are transmitted to the outer ring by the tapered rollers. Thus, contact stresses occur and the number of rollers plays a major role with respect to the load distribution. This influence is analyzed in this study by the FEM (finite element method). In this paper, FEA model is used to calculate the structural deformation and contact stresses. Harmonic response analysis in ANSYS is carried out to obtain steady-state response of a model subjected to a load that changes harmonically (sinusoidally). Such load has specific amplitude and frequency at which it acts. This type of loading cause forced vibrations. The calculated response is a function of frequency. The dynamic characteristics of the bearing are analyzed using FEA software ANSYS. The influence of varying the harmonic load and the dynamic characteristics of the roller bearing are analyzed by mechanical APDL using GUI interface. Result indicates that the increase in harmonic force will result in increase in contact stresses and displacement. © TJPRC Pvt.

This study aimed to evaluate the spatial distribution of A. glabripennis in South Korea by simultaneously considering climate and host plants. Climatic suitability was firstly evaluated using a CLIMEX model; then, it was combined with the areal distribution of host plants using a simple mathematical formulation. We finally projected the spatial distribution of A. glabripennis onto the map of administrative districts to identify hazardous areas to watch. As a result, the developed model predicted that over 40% of areas in South Korea could be exposed to A. glabripennis damage, and most of them were located in mountainous areas with abundant host plants. In addition, climatic suitability was higher in coastal areas, which was different than a previous record of A. glabripennis occurrence, while the prediction by a comprehensive model was consistent with the record. In conclusion, the model including both climate and host plant occurrence was more reliable than the model which only included climate, and could provide useful data for determining areas for monitoring and control. © 2020 Korean Society of Applied Entomology","Anoplophora glabripennis; Climatic suitability; Host plant distribution; Spatial distribution; Species distribution modeling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086596759

The visible light-absorption capability of the copolymerized NS-C3N4 can be improved with an increase in the ABN content in the starting material, while maintaining the rather negative conduction band potential of NS-C3N4. With the aid of a ruthenium(II) complex catalyst, the copolymerized NS-C3N4 becomes active for CO2 reduction into formate (&gt;90% selectivity) under visible light (λ &gt; 400 nm) in the presence of triethanolamine as an electron donor. The activity is enhanced with increasing the starting ABN content to reach a maximum at a certain amount, beyond which it declines. The optimized material, modified with a silver promoter and a phosphonate-functionalized ruthenium(II) catalyst, gives a high turnover number of 6000 (vs Ru catalyst) for formate production.

Therefore, an appropriate adjustment of the ABN comonomer amount is essential to obtain copolymerized NS-C3N4, which shows high photocatalytic activity. © 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

These forests often experience various levels of inundation and play an important role in CH4 emissions, but the taxonomy of methanotrophs in these systems remains poorly understood. In this study, DNA-based stable isotope probing showed significant niche differentiation in active aerobic methanotrophs in response to niche differentiation in upstream and downstream mangrove soils of the Tamsui estuary in northwestern Taiwan, in which salinity levels differ between winter and summer. Methylobacter and Methylomicrobium-like Type I methanotrophs dominated methane-oxidizing communities in the field conditions and were significantly13 C-labeled in both upstream and downstream sites, while Methylobacter were well adapted to high salinity and low temperature. The Type II methanotroph Methylocystis comprised only 10–15% of all the methane oxidizers in the upstream site but less than 5% at the downstream site under field conditions.13 C-DNA levels in Methylocystis were significantly lower than those in Type I methanotrophs, while phylogenetic analysis further revealed the presence of novel methane oxidizers that are phylogenetically distantly related to Type Ia in fresh and incubated soils at a downstream site. These results suggest that Type I methanotrophs display niche differentiation associated with environmental differences between upstream and downstream mangrove soils. © MDPI AG.

However, scattered coal is underestimated in emission inventories generally because the activity data are incompletely recorded in official energy statistics. Results of positive matrix factorization (PMF) models confirmed that coal burning was the largest contributor to VOC mixing ratios prior to the emission limitations of 2017, and a reduction in scattered coal combustion, especially in the rural residential sector, was the primary factor in the observed decrease in ambient VOCs and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation potential in urban Beijing after 2017. Scattered coal burning was included in a corrected emission inventory, and we obtained comparable results between this corrected inventory and PMF analysis particularly for the non-control period. However, a refined source subclassification showed that passenger car exhaust, petrochemical manufacturing, gas stations, traffic evaporation, traffic equipment manufacturing, painting, and electronics manufacturing are also contributors to ambient VOCs. These sources should focus on future emission reduction strategies and targets in Beijing. Moreover, in other regions with scattered coal-based heating, scattered coal burning is still the key factor to improve the air quality in winter. © 2020 Author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090514967

Methane generation potential was obtained by measurements and estimation methods with similar values of 23.38 and 27.79 kg CH4/t waste, respectively. CH4 and CO2 production was quickly achieved in the STASAB, and the total amount of CH4 and CO2 was low due to the mixed leachate-recirculation operation process among bioreactors, which were at different stages of operation. The microbial communities in different bioreactors were diverse. The leachate-recirculation operation was a critical parameter to effectively enhance the microbial community structure in the STASAB, which can regulate CH4, CO2 and N2O production with global warming potential of 7.479 kg CO2e/(t·d). The STASAB had higher energy potential of 1.011 kWh/(t·d) compared with that of conventional landfills and sequentially anaerobic/semi-aerobic bioreactors. Moreover, direct electricity production in the STASAB is recommended for energy utilization with 38.38% GHG emission reduction, and with 131.43 million CNY (Chinese Yuan) benefit per year for national rural waste disposal via utilization of biogas from the STASAB for power generation.

This article incorporates renewable energy green innovation (REGI), fossil energy consumption (FEC), and air pollution into a unified analysis framework. Using China's provincial panel data, a spatial measurement model was used to investigate the spatial effects of renewable energy green innovation and fossil energy consumption on air pollution in China from 2011 to 2017. The global Moran index shows that over time, the spatial correlation of air pollution has gradually weakened, while the global correlation of renewable energy green innovation and fossil energy consumption is increasing year by year. ArcGIS visualization and partial Moran index show that air pollution, renewable energy green innovation, and fossil energy consumption are extremely uneven in geographic space. The spatial distribution of air pollution, renewable energy green innovations, and fossil energy consumption are all characterized by high in the east and low in the west and they all show a strong spatial aggregation. Applying the spatial adjacency matrix to the spatial Durbin model gave the results that China's air pollution has a significant spatial spillover effect. Replacing fossil fuels with clean renewable energy will reduce air pollutant emissions. The Environment Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis has not been supported and verified in China. The partial differential method test found that the spatial spillover benefits can be decomposed into direct effects and indirect effects. The direct and indirect effects of renewable energy green innovation on air pollution are both significantly negative, indicating that green innovation of renewable energy not only inhibits local air pollution, but also inhibits air pollution in nearby areas. The consumption of fossil energy will significantly increase the local air pollution, while the impact of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and soot (DS) pollution in nearby areas is not obvious. It is recommended to increase investment in renewable energy green innovation, reduce the proportion of traditional fossil energy consumption, and pay attention to the spatial connection and overflow of renewable energy green innovation and air pollution. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; Energy consumption; Renewable energy; Spatial analysis; Spatial durbin model","alternative energy; ArcGIS; atmospheric pollution; empirical analysis; energy use; fossil fuel; innovation; soot; spatial distribution; sulfur dioxide; visualization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090085390

Air pollutant emissions in conjunction with changing meteorological conditions create environment pollution in China. Aerosol pollution is spatially centralized in four regions of China, including the North China Plain, Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and Sichuan Basin. In this observational study, a new center of aerosol pollution was identified in the Twain-Hu Basin (THB), covering the Hubei and Hunan provinces in central China. Based on the analysis of 19 years of satellite remote sensing data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the THB experiences high aerosol optical depth (AOD) values exceeding 0.9. The fine mode fraction (FMF) values below 0.3 were also detected over the aerosol polluted THB region, where aerosol pollution was dominated by the mixed aerosol type. This reflects the role of intense human activities and the unique aerosol processes involved in the regional aerosol pollution over central China. The interannual AOD variations for THB present an increasing trend (mostly &gt;0.02 yr−1) between 2000 and 2011 and a significant descending trend (mostly &lt; -0.06 yr−1) between 2011 and 2018. This inverse trends in AOD with an overall increasing trend in FMF characterizes the past 19 years. This highlights the contribution of the increase in submicron particles and meteorological effects to the regional aerosol concentrations during recent years when considering the reduced anthropogenic aerosol emissions in the THB. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol optical depth; Aerosol type; Submicron particles; Trend analysis; Twain-Hu basin","Aerosols; Radiometers; Remote sensing; River pollution; Aerosol optical depths; Air pollutant emission; Anthropogenic aerosols; Meteorological condition; Meteorological effects; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Satellite remote sensing data; Spatio-temporal variation; Air pollution; aerosol; annual variation; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); MODIS; optical depth; regional pattern; satellite data; trend analysis; aerosol; air pollutant; article; attention; China; haze; human; meteorology; observational study; optical depth; remote sensing; river; China; Hubei; Hunan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083739245

During the evolutionary process, plants have developed different photosynthetic strategies that are accompanied by complementary biochemical and anatomical features. Members of family Chenopodiaceae have species with C3 photosynthesis, and variations of C4 photosynthesis in which photorespiration is reduced by concentrating CO2 around Rubisco through dual coordinated functioning of dimorphic chloroplasts. Among dicots, the family has the largest number of C4 species, and greatest structural and biochemical diversity in forms of C4 including the canonical dual-cell Kranz anatomy, and the recently identified single cell C4 with the presence of dimorphic chloroplasts separated by a vacuole. This is the first comparative analysis of chloroplast genomes in species representative of photosynthetic types in the family. Results: Methodology with high throughput sequencing complemented with Sanger sequencing of selected loci provided high quality and complete chloroplast genomes of seven species in the family and one species in the closely related Amaranthaceae family, representing C3, Kranz type C4 and single cell C4 (SSC4) photosynthesis six of the eight chloroplast genomes are new, while two are improved versions of previously published genomes. The depth of coverage obtained using high-throughput sequencing complemented with targeted resequencing of certain loci enabled superior resolution of the border junctions, directionality and repeat region sequences. Comparison of the chloroplast genomes with previously sequenced plastid genomes revealed similar genome organization, gene order and content with a few revisions. High-quality complete chloroplast genome sequences resulted in correcting the orientation the LSC region of the published Bienertia sinuspersici chloroplast genome, identification of stop codons in the rpl23 gene in B. sinuspersici and B. cycloptera, and identifying an instance of IR expansion in the Haloxylon ammodendron inverted repeat sequence. The rare observation of a mitochondria-to-chloroplast inter-organellar gene transfer event was identified in family Chenopodiaceae. Conclusions: This study reports complete chloroplast genomes from seven Chenopodiaceae and one Amaranthaceae species. The depth of coverage obtained using high-throughput sequencing complemented with targeted resequencing of certain loci enabled superior resolution of the border junctions, directionality, and repeat region sequences. Therefore, the use of high throughput and Sanger sequencing, in a hybrid method, reaffirms to be rapid, efficient, and reliable for chloroplast genome sequencing. © 2020 The Author(s).

As e-waste has exponentially been increasing the burden on our environment with long-term effects on the ecosystem, the need for finding sustainable means to recover, reuse, and recycle the materials available in the e-waste is much sought after in the present time. In this background, we demonstrate an easily scalable green route for the beneficiation and effective usage of metallic materials from the e-waste using cryo-temperature grinding with the primary objective of retrieving the near-full metallic residue from e-waste by an energy-efficient and eco-friendly approach. The metallic nanoparticles thus obtained are subsequently utilized for the selective reduction of CO2 into different gaseous products via the electrochemical route, leading to the evolution of CH4, H2, and CO as major gaseous products at neutral pH and CO as the major product at basic pH. In a nutshell, the current approach can provide useful means for achieving major metallic residue from the e-waste, which can further be utilized for green energy production in an eco-friendly manner, making the process sustainable. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","CO2electrocatalysis; cryo-grinding; e-waste; energy recovery; metal recovery; printed circuit boards (PCBs)","Beneficiation; Carbon dioxide; Concentration (process); Electronic Waste; Energy efficiency; Environmental protection; Metals; Reduction; Sustainable development; Waste disposal; Wastes; Electrochemical routes; Electronic waste (e waste); Green energy production; Metallic material; Metallic nanoparticles; Primary objective; Selective reduction; Technological communities; Electronic equipment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090983250

However, they support ethnic communities whose livelihood activities are climate driven. Consequently, these communities are keen observers of the same and documenting their perception on changing climate is now an important area of global research. Therefore, the present study was conducted with the prime objective of documenting the climate change perception of Bhangalis—a resident community of western Himalaya, and analyzing variation in their perceptions in relation to age and gender. For this, respondent surveys (household, n = 430; individual interviews, n = 240) were carried out and the collected data were subjected to statistical analyses. The study also validated the perception of Bhangalis using the available weather data (1974–2017) through the Mann-Kendall test. The results reveal that Bhangalis perceived 11 indicators of changing climate, of which decrease in snowfall was the most prominent (reported by ~ 97% of the respondents). The perceptions varied between the two genders with males having significantly higher proportion of responses for all the 11 indicators. Similarly, differences in perception among the age groups were also observed, elderly people reported higher proportion of climate change indicators as compared to respondents of lower age. Notably, patterns of temperature and rainfall perceptions by the Bhangalis agreed with the trends of meteorological data. This highlights the importance of the study in documenting knowledge of ethnic communities especially from areas that lack monitoring stations. It argues for involving them in climate change programs. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptation; Climate; Communities; Himalaya; Rainfall; Temperature","Surveys; Altitude regions; Change perceptions; Climate change indicators; Climate monitoring; Ethnic community; Mann-Kendall test; Meteorological data; Monitoring stations; Climate change; climate change; elderly population; ethnic group; gender; livelihood; perception; statistical analysis; adaptation; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; algorithm; Article; bovine; climate change; documentation; ethnic group; female; forest; household; human; male; nonhuman; perception; phenology; soil moisture; temperature sensitivity; winter; documentation; environmental monitoring; meteorology; temperature; Himalayas; Aged; Climate Change; Documentation; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Male; Meteorology; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088814286

Here we collect China's provincial panel data (1995–2017) of primary and final energy consumption to evaluate China's unequal and polarized regional pattern in energy intensity, decompose the inequality index into contributing components, and investigate possible driving factors behind the unequal pattern both regionally and structurally, for the first time. The results show that China's interprovince disparities in energy intensity increase and are exacerbated by the enlarging disparities in energy intensity between the least developed and most developed regions of China. The causes for this phenomenon are as follows: (i) rather loose regulatory measures on mitigating coal consumption; (ii) inferior energy processing technology in areas specializing in energy-intensive industries; (iii) increasing interregional energy fluxes embodied in trade; and (iv) separate jurisdictions at provincial administrative levels. These factors can synthetically result in unintended spillover to areas with inferior green technologies, suggesting an increasingly uneven distribution of energy-intensive and carbon-intensive industries and usage of clean energy.

Nonetheless, their formation and development still face vital problems such as complexity and long gelation times. In this paper, we report a facile, one-pot, and short gelation time strategy for making a Pd-Au aerogel consisting of extended metal backbones by using a self-Assembly process. The Pd-Au aerogel is achieved by reducing H2PdCl4 and HAuCl4·3H2O as metal precursors in the presence of sodium carbonate by using glyoxylic acid monohydrate as a reductant, followed by supercritical CO2 drying. In this process, the kinetics and the type of reaction product are controlled by sodium carbonate concentration. Characterization of the highly porous three-dimensional network is performed by utilizing field emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, selected area electron diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, nitrogen isotherm, X-ray diffraction, and inductively coupled plasma-Atomic emission spectroscopy analyses. The resultant aerogel is applied as an advanced three-dimensional supportless catalyst for the oxidation reaction of ethanol in direct ethanol fuel cells at low temperatures (25 and 40 °C) in alkaline media and depicts an extraordinary electrocatalytic performance compared to that of Pd/C. The excellent efficiency of the three-dimensional architecture as an advanced electrocatalyst is ascribed to its amazing characteristics such as being supportless, macroporous, mesoporous, and microporous. In addition, the existence of a cometal (Au) in the structure of the Pd-Au aerogel can increase the chance for improving the adsorption of OHads onto the aerogel surface, thus helping to improve the oxidation process of ethanol. Undoubtedly, the resultant aerogel can be utilized as a promising anode component for direct ethanol fuel cells.

In order to predict how these C stores may be affected by environmental change, it is critical to assess current CO2 and CH4 production and efflux from these ecosystems. Production and efflux of these greenhouse gases (GHGs) are governed by coupled geochemical, hydrological, physical and biological processes in sediments that are sensitive to local conditions, which can result in large spatial and temporal heterogeneity of GHGs dynamics within the ecosystem. To understand how the drivers of GHGs dynamics vary across salt marsh ecosystems, we coupled solid-phase geochemistry to measurements of porewater chemistry (to ∼1 m), CO2 and CH4 production in sediments and efflux to the atmosphere in a temperate tidal salt marsh for over one year to capture seasonal patterns within two vegetation zones of the marsh landscape that have distinct biogeochemical and hydrologic conditions: Tall Spartina (TS) and Short Spartina (SS). The SS vegetation zone experienced nearly constant inundation, low redox values (−200 to 200 mV), porewater pH 6–7 that did not vary with depth or time, an enrichment of pyrite and goethite with depth and up to 3 mM porewater sulfide. In contrast, the TS vegetation zone on the natural levee proximal to a tidal channel experienced large water level oscillations due to spring-neap tides that resulted in variable but higher redox values (0–700 mV), porewater pH 6–7 at depth but surface (0–3 cm) as low as 4 in the spring, an enrichment of ferrihydrite and a depletion of pyrite at ∼30 cm, and up to 0.8 mM ferrous Fe in porewater. At 50–56 cm, solid phase analyses (STXM-NEXAFS) revealed differential C speciation between the two vegetation zones, with stronger C-Fe spatial association at TS and stronger C-Ca co-association at SS despite both having similar soil pH of 3–4. These results suggest that soil pH may not be strongly predictive of C-mineral control in flooded marsh sediments. Both vegetation zones showed consistent CO2 and CH4 emissions from sediments to the atmosphere throughout the study period with TS having ∼60% higher median CO2 and SS having ∼55% higher median CH4 efflux. Using depth profiling, unexpectedly high concentrations of CO2 (&gt;200 μM) and CH4 (&gt;200 μM) were observed at depths 50–75 cm at both zones that were higher for SS in these sulfate-rich (up to 17 mM) sediments, which suggests methylotrophic methanogenesis occurs deep within the profile of salt marsh sediments away from the tidal channel. Moreover, if we extrapolate our median depth values of CH4 and CO2 to the 5.3 Mha of global salt marshes, this could account for a conservative estimate of ∼70 Gg of unaccounted C stored in gaseous form (i.e., CH4 and CO2) in marsh sediments, which should be considered when attempting to understand the current patterns and future responses of carbon dynamics from these ecosystems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","CH4; CO2; Fe EXAFS; Fluxes; Redox; STXM-NEXAFS; X-ray diffraction","carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; greenhouse gas; heterogeneity; methane; porewater; saltmarsh; spatiotemporal analysis; water chemistry; Spartina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085545558

Climate maps allow building designers and city planners to get adequately informed without accessing, analyzing or interpreting dense textual information. In this study, a representative residential benchmark model was simulated in seventy-four cities of Algeria. The simulation results were interpolated using geographic information systems to generate six high-resolution maps that spatially estimate and visualize the discomfort hours and cooling/heating energy needs. The unique methodology relies on a reliable weather dataset (2004-2018) and combines the power of building performance simulation and geographic information systems. The results of these analyses provide easy to understand and web-based atlas that can be used to explore regional and local climate and quantify the discomfort hours, the heating/cooling energy needs and energy use intensity. The spatial maps are not a static product, but rather data-rich content, which can be expanded to include the most important cities of Algeria. The capabilities of the tool allow architects and urban planners to understand the climate better and propose practical design guidance. © 2020 by the authors.","Building performance simulation; Climatic zoning; Discomfort hours; Geographic information system; Residential building","demand analysis; energy use; estimation method; GIS; heating; spatial distribution; thermal power; Algeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089338331

This combination of factors causes an increase in urban population that is exposed to poor air quality, leading to public health burdens. In this work, theWeather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry is applied to simulate air quality over Brazil for a short time period under three future emission scenarios, including current legislation (CLE), mitigation scenario (MIT), and maximum feasible reduction (MFR) under the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5), which is a climate change scenario under which radiative forcing of greenhouse gases (GHGs) reach 4.5W m-2 by 2100. The main objective of this study is to determine the sensitivity of the concentrations of ozone (O3) and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter 2.5 μm or less (PM2.5) to changes in emissions under these emission scenarios and to determine the signal and spatial patterns of these changes for Brazil. The model is evaluated with observations and shows reasonably good agreement. The MFR scenario leads to a reduction of 3% and 75% for O3 and PM2.5 respectively, considering the average of grid cells within Brazil, whereas the CLE scenario leads to an increase of 1% and 11% for O3 and PM2.5 respectively, concentrated near urban centers. These results indicate that of the three emission control scenarios, the CLE leads to poor air quality, while the MFR scenario leads to the maximum improvement in air quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to investigate the responses of air quality to changes in emissions under these emission scenarios for Brazil. The results shed light on the linkage between changes of emissions and air quality. © 2020 by the authors.","Air quality responses; Atmospheric emissions; Climate change; WRF-Chem","Air quality; Atmospheric radiation; Climate change; Climate models; Emission control; Laws and legislation; Quality control; Aerodynamic diameters; Climate change scenarios; Emission scenario; Forecasting modeling; Particulate Matter; Radiative forcings; Spatial patterns; Urban population; Greenhouse gases; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; emission inventory; future prospect; greenhouse gas; public health; radiative forcing; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089595536

Despite a growing number of assessments on the national or global scale, there is still a need for regionalized studies with a high resolution to identify meso-scale vulnerability patterns. In this paper, we present an indicator-based assessment that was carried out in the Trinational Metropolitan Region Upper Rhine within the Interreg-V project Clim'Ability. The analyzed region is characterized by strong cross-border and transnational linkages, similar ecological features and climatic stressors but differing political, administrative, cultural and legal conditions. In this rather complex setting, we operationalized a state-of-the art vulnerability framework using 18 quantified indicators and aggregating them into a vulnerability index. We show that it is possible to downscale the methods used in recent assessments to a regional context with a challenging data situation and discuss strengths and uncertainties. The results are mapped for stakeholder communication purposes. They provide an evidence-base to the identification of the trinational vulnerability pattern and may enable stakeholders and decision-makers to enhance their own climate adaptation planning. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptation strategies; Assessment; Climate communication; Indicators; Mapping; Operationalization; Regional climate vulnerability","adaptive management; assessment method; climate change; environmental assessment; environmental planning; metropolitan area; strategic approach; vulnerability; Germany; Rhine Valley; Upper Rhine Valley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089795914

Burrows, J., Institute of Environmental Physics (IUP), University of Bremen FB1, Bremen, Germany","The switch from the use of coal to natural gas or oil for energy generation potentially reduces greenhouse gas emissions and thus the impact on global warming and climate change because of the higher energy creation per CO2 molecule emitted. However, the climate benefit over coal is offset by methane (CH4) leakage from natural gas and petroleum systems, which reverses the climate impact mitigation if the rate of fugitive emissions exceeds the compensation point at which the global warming resulting from the leakage and the benefit from the reduction of coal combustion coincide. Consequently, an accurate quantification of CH4 emissions from the oil and gas industry is essential to evaluate the suitability of natural gas and petroleum as bridging fuels on the way to a carbon-neutral future. We show that regional CH4 release from large oil and gas fields can be monitored from space by using dense daily recurrent measurements of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) onboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite to quantify emissions and leakage rates. The average emissions for the time period 2018/2019 from the five most productive basins in the United States, the Permian, Appalachian, Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Anadarko, are estimated to be 3:181:13, 2:360:88, 1:370:63, 0:890:56, and 2:740:74 Mtyr1, respectively. This corresponds to CH4 leakage rates relative to the associated production between 1:2% and 1:4% for the first four production regions, which are consistent with bottom-up estimates and likely fall below the break-even leakage rate for immediate climate benefit. For the Anadarko Basin, the fugitive emission rate is larger and amounts to 3:91:1%, which likely exceeds the breakeven rate for immediate benefit and roughly corresponds to the break-even rate for a 20-year time horizon. The determined values are smaller than previously derived satellitebased leakage rates for the time period 2009-2011, which was an early phase of hydraulic fracturing, indicating that it is possible to improve the climate footprint of the oil and gas industry by adopting new technologies and that efforts to reduce methane emissions have been successful. For two of the world s largest natural gas fields, Galkynysh and Dauletabad in Turkmenistan, we find collective methane emissions of 3:261:17 Mtyr1, which corresponds to a leakage rate of 4:11:5%, suggesting that the Turkmen energy industry is not employing methane emission avoidance strategies and technologies as successfully as those currently widely used in the United States. The leakage rates in Turkmenistan and in the Anadarko Basin indicate that there is potential to reduce fugitive methane emissions from natural gas and petroleum systems worldwide. In particular, relatively newly developed oil and gas plays appear to have larger leakage rates compared to more mature production areas. © Author(s) 2020.

They also host the largest coal-fired power stations in the country. We reconstructed metal deposition records in lake sediments in the Hunter and Latrobe Valleys to determine if metal deposition in freshwater lakes have increased in the region. The current regulatory arrangement applied to metal emissions from coal-fired power stations in Australia are presented, discussing their capacity to address future increases in metal deposition from these sources. Sediment records of spheroidal carbonaceous particles (SCPs), a component of fly-ash, were also used as an additional line of evidence to identify the contribution of industrial activities related to electricity generation to metal deposition in regions surrounding open-cut coal mines and coal-fired power stations. Sediment metal concentrations and SCP counts in the sedimentary records, from the Hunter and Latrobe Valleys, both indicated that open-cut coal mining and the subsequent combustion of coal in power stations has most likely resulted in an increase in atmospheric deposition of metals in the local region. In particular, the metalloids As and Se showed the greatest enrichment compared to before coal mining commenced. Although the introduction of bag filters at Liddell Power Station and the decommissioning of Hazelwood Power Station appear to have resulted in a decrease of metal deposition in nearby lakes, overall metal deposition in the environment is still increasing. The challenge for the years to come will be to develop better regulation policies and tools that will contribute to reduce metal emissions in these major electricity production centres in Australia. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bituminous coal; Hunter Valley; Latrobe Valley; Lignite coal; Metal deposition","Coal; Coal deposits; Coal mines; Deposition; Electric power generation; Environmental regulations; Filtration; Fly ash; Fossil fuel power plants; Lakes; Landforms; Metals; Meteorological problems; Sediments; Atmospheric depositions; Coal fired power station; Electricity generation; Electricity production; Environmental contamination; Industrial activities; Metal concentrations; Spheroidal carbonaceous particles; Coal combustion; heavy metal; coal mining; coal-fired power plant; deposition; electricity generation; heavy metal; lacustrine deposit; pollution policy; regulatory approach; risk assessment; Article; Australia; coal mining; concentration (parameter); contamination; electricity; government regulation; priority journal; water pollution; Australia; Hunter Valley; Latrobe Valley; New South Wales; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084083385

Despite these technical advantages, the technology cost used in this process requires an evaluation of the economic viability. Therefore, this article presents a methodology that aims to identify the economic viability of investments projects for the generation of electrical energy through biogas from the anaerobic bio-digestion of vinasse, and the most sensitive parameters that affect it. Such methodology is substantiated on the execution of i) the investment risk analysis of this project type, and ii) the univariate sensitivity analysis of some strategically selected variables. The results of its application, using data from a sugar-energy plant located in Brazil, indicate that the plant can produce 554,000 m³ of biogas and 1.3 MWh/month of electricity. This amount can be traded in the Free Contracting Environment and in the Regulated Contracting Environment. A risk analysis employing the Net Present Value indicator shows that the probability of the project being viable in both environments is 78.55% and 87.50%, respectively.

The results of calculating the available pressure for different orientations of the buildings to the prevailing wind directions showed that the maximum capture of the wind pressure can sometimes lead to a deterioration of natural ventilation of buildings and tipping over traction even in the cold season. One-sided apartments are particularly sensitive to wind environment. Correcting the orientation of the buildings in relation to the prevailing wind directions significantly increases the performance of natural ventilation.

In regions where natural gas grids already exist, there is a system suitable for distribution of the biomethane as well. Moreover, improving energy efficiency and sustainability of the gas infrastructure, it can be used as total substitute for natural gas. Since it has the same chemical properties as natural gas, with methane content level greater than 96 %, biomethane is suitable both for heat and electricity generation, and the use in transport. Biomethane is injected into the natural gas networks of many Member States of the European Union (hereafter - the EU) on a regular basis for more than a decade, with the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Sweden and France being among pioneers in this field. In most early cases, permission to inject biomethane into the natural gas grids came as part of a policy to decarbonize the road transport sector and was granted on a case-by-case basis. The intention to legally frame and standardise the EU's biomethane injection into the natural gas networks came much later and was fulfilled in the second half of the present decade. This paper addresses the biomethane injection into the natural gas grids in some EU countries, highlights a few crucial aspects in this process, including but not limited to trends in standardisation and legal framework, injection conditions and pressure levels, as well as centralised biogas feedstock collection points and the biomethane injection facilities. In a wider context, the paper deals with the role of biomethane in the EU energy transition and further use of the existing natural gas networks. © 2020 J.

Particulate organic carbon (POC) is a key biogeochemical parameter that helps us characterize export processes of the ocean. Ocean color observations enable the estimation of bio-optical proxies of POC (i.e. particulate backscattering coefficient, <i>bbp</i>) in the surface layer of the ocean quasi-synoptically. In parallel, the Argo program distributes vertical profiles of the physical properties with a global coverage and a high spatiooral resolution. Merging satellite ocean color and Argo data using a neural networkbased method has already shown strong potential to infer the vertical distribution of bio-optical properties at global scale with high space-time resolution. This method is trained and validated using a database of concurrent vertical profiles of temperature, salinity, and bio-optical properties, i.e. <i>bbp</i>, collected by Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) floats, matched up with satellite ocean color products. The present study aims at improving this method by 1) using a larger dataset from BGC-Argo network since 2016 for training, 2) using additional inputs such as altimetry data, which provide significant information on mesoscale processes impacting the vertical distribution of <i>bbp</i>, 3) improving the vertical resolution of estimation, and 4) examining the potential of alternative machine learning-based techniques. As a first attempt with the new data, we used some feature-specific preprocessing routines followed by a Multi-Output Random Forest algorithm on two regions with different ocean dynamics: North Atlantic and Subtropical Gyres. The statistics and the <i>bbp</i> profiles obtained from the validation floats show promising results and suggest this direction is worth investigating even further at global scale. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

However, now that REDD+ policies are being increasingly implemented, a number of justice-related challenges have emerged, including how social heterogeneity should be approached to avoid deepening the unequal access to land, resources and livelihood opportunities or even violating human rights in rural contexts. Applying an environmental justice lens, this article analyses the experience of three local communities in Nepal participating in REDD+ pilot projects, focusing on how indigenous peoples, women and Dalits have participated in and been affected by such initiatives. Our research shows that the studied REDD+ pilot activities in Nepal have been, to some extent, able to recognise, empower and benefit certain social groups, indigenous women in particular, whilst Dalits (particularly Dalit women) had a different experience. REDD+ projects have had limited impact in addressing more entrenched processes of political discrimination, male dominance in decision-making, and uneven participation driven by spatial considerations or specific social targeting approaches. While the projects examined here have been partially just, and rather sensitive to existing patterns of social differentiation, the complexity of social differentiation still makes it difficult to operationalise environmental justice in REDD+ implementation. Hence, we conclude that deficits in distributive, recognition and procedural justice cannot be resolved without first addressing wider issues of social injustices throughout Nepal, historically inherited along the dimensions of class, caste, ethnicity, gender, and spatiality. © 2020 The Authors","Benefit-sharing; Environmental justice; Nepal; Participation; Recognition; Redd+; Social differentiation","Decision making; Deforestation; Sustainable development; Environmental justice; Forest degradation; Forest governance; Livelihood opportunities; Procedural justice; Reducing emissions; Spatial considerations; Sustainable management; Economic and social effects; Decision Making; Deforestation; Differentiation; Impact; Nepal; Patterns; Planning; Women",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084582283

Transportation is one of the necessary infrastructures for cities and over 80% of the population in Singapore depends on public transportation systems. To significantly cut emissions, smart cities are expected to play an essential role, therefore the conventional transportation systems are transforming to be intelligent. The emission of vehicles depends on various factors like the average speed of the vehicle, total distance covered by the vehicle, urban driving conditions, and type of vehicle.

It may be a mechanism of persistence to fire temperatures, but could also form part of a gap-detecting mechanism to provide germination cues under arid conditions. To disentangle this, we studied the phylogenetic structure of plant communities against fire frequency and aridity gradients. The phylogenetic structure in Mediterranean Basin ecosystems was analysed for the hardseededness trait as a whole and was separated by the families composing this trait (Fabaceae and Cistaceae). This study focused on woody perennial species. The phylogenetic structure was also contrasted against soil classes. Hardseededness on the whole, and for the Fabaceae family alone, showed phylogenetic clustering as aridity increased. Cistaceae displayed the opposite pattern with phylogenetic clustering in most humid areas, together with a significant soil effect. Surprisingly, fire frequency had no influence in any case. This climate-driven phylogenetic clustering indicates that the hardseededness trait could confer some fitness advantage under dry conditions. For this reason, coexisting species were more closely related in the community with increasing aridity. This effect was especially evident for the Fabaceae family. These results shed some light on the evolutionary selection of this adaptive trait under Mediterranean conditions. Our results question the role of fire in the selection of the hardseededness trait in Mediterranean Basin ecosystems and indicates that climate is the most important factor. Therefore, we should be cautious in assigning to fire a preponderant role in the selection of some plant traits. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Adaptive trait; Community assembly; Habitat filtering; Hard coat; Seeder; Soils","arid environment; aridity; coexistence; fitness; germination; Mediterranean environment; phylogenetics; plant community; seed; Mediterranean Sea; Cistaceae; Fabaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086604471

Worlwide ruminants are an important source of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) as they contribute with around 115 million tons of methane on a yearly basis. Methane is generated by the fermentation of the feed inside the rumen by a microbial consortia constituted by bacteria, archaea, fungi and protozoa. Due to the warming power of methane, which is 28 higher than carbon monoxide, current research focuses on diminishing the emissions of this gas by domestic ruminants. The use of several species of tropical trees and shrubs as a supplement of ruminant feed have resulted ideal within silvopastoral systems. Objective. To analyze the current research on trees tropical foliage through the implementation of silvopastoral systems in conventional livestock systems with the aim to diminish GHG generated by ruminal fermentation. Methodology. The search of bibliographic information was performed during august 2018 and june 2019 using key terms. Results. The results from the diverse research shows that foliage from trees and shrubs located in tropical regions not only increase livestock performance, but al so diminish methane synthesis within the rumen due to the action of derived plant secondary metabolites such as condensed tannins, phenolic compounds, essential oils, flavonoids and saponins present in leaves and pods. Implications. The information presented in this paper focuses on the use of foliage of tree and shrub species with forage potential in tropical conditions, which have a significant effect on the reduction of methanogenesis in ruminants due to an improvement in nutritional quality of the diet and the presence of secondary metabolites Conclusion. The use of silvopastoral systems with tropical legumes species have the potential of reducing the GHG produced by cattle by 20 up to 38 %. © 2020 Universidad Autonoma de Yucatan.

Several studies have independently examined the impacts of urban planning and climate change on water demand, but little attention has been given to their combined impact. Here we forecast urban water demand using a Geographically Weighted Regression model informed by socio-economic, environmental and landscape pattern metrics. The purpose of our study is to evaluate how future scenarios of population densities and climate warming will jointly affect water demand across two rapidly growing U.S. states (North Carolina and South Carolina). Our forecasts indicate that regional water demand by 2065 will increase by 37%-383% relative to the baseline in 2010, across all scenarios of change. Our results show future water demand will increase under rising temperatures, but could be ameliorated by policies that promote higher density development and urban infill. These water-efficient land use policies show a 5% regional reduction in water demand and up to 25% reduction locally for counties with the highest expected population growth by 2065. For rural counties experiencing depopulation, the land use policies we considered are insufficient to significantly reduce water demand. For expanding communities seeking to increase their adaptive capacity to changing socio-environmental conditions, our framework can assist in developing sustainable solutions.

Because buildings are an important component of the built environment vis-à-vis both energy use and heat resiliency in cities, we explored their climate mitigation and adaptation potential. Specifically, we investigated how design decisions interact with regard to three heat-related factors—namely, energy use/CO2 emissions, passive survivability, and heat rejection to the urban climate. We selected an archetypical building as our test case, created various design permutations, and used whole-building simulations to analyze their performance. Our simulations show that permutations of the building with a smaller carbon footprint also emit less heat to ambient air and had a better passive survivability. However, we also noted potential trade-offs (e.g., where ventilation is inadequate, increasing insulation levels for energy efficiency may hurt passive survivability). Based on our findings, we argue that, at least at a policy level, it is imperative to take advantage of the synergies, and their collective benefits. Moreover, building regulations or incentive programs should look beyond energy as the sole performance metric of interest and consider passive survivability as well as thermal interactions with urban climate. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy analysis; Climate adaptation; Climate mitigation; Energy efficiency; Resiliency to heat; Urban heat","Building codes; Buildings; Carbon footprint; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Building regulations; Building simulation; Built environment; Climate mitigations; Design decisions; Incentive programs; Performance metrices; Thermal interaction; Climate change; climate change; energy efficiency; energy use; mitigation; savings; simulation; urban climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085892673

It is impossible to eliminate road traffic noise, thus regulation and limitation of environmental noise pollution are important and obligatory actions. Noise can negatively affect human health, vegetal and animal world. Its harm depends on intensity, frequency and duration. Under the current conditions noise control is technically complicated, complex and economically wildly expensive. The study of noise level was performed in the territories, boarded on main traffic arteries of Kharkiv without rail transport and with rail transport. The studies showed that the roads with rail transport are 7-14 dB louder than the roads without it. The average noise level on highways of the city ranged 80-94 dB, besides on some of the highways the average noise level did not reach the statutory level at 100 m from traffic roads. Such noise load level in the urban environment requires implementation of solutions, directed at its reduction. The impact of the noise barrier and green planting on noise emission is studied. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091186710

The meteorological conditions favoring a high-pressure situation resulting in the formation of inversion layer inhibits pollutant dispersion. The aim of the study was to obtain vertical profiles of meteorological parameters and air pollutants in order to investigate the impact of inversion on the air quality of this city. Vertical profiles help to understand the behaviour of temperature inversion, pollutants and their relationship to each other. The tethered balloon was equipped with in-situ instruments to measure Particulate Matter (PM), Black Carbon (BC), Ultra Fine Particles (UFP) as well as meteorological parameters such as air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction of the lower troposphere. The measurements were carried out in “Schlossgarten”, a park area near the city center of Stuttgart. Vertical profiles were obtained by ascending the balloon from ground up to a height of a maximum of 470 m and then descending it back to the ground. One complete sounding (ascent and descent) took around 30–40 min. The measurement campaign took place on 8th and July 9, 2018. 43 soundings were performed during that period. During the measurement campaign, a distinct inversion was observed at nighttime, which trapped the pollutants, hence increasing the pollutant concentration near the ground within the inversion layer. PM, UFP and BC concentrations showed a decreasing trend with increasing altitude but during noon, when the atmosphere was well mixed, the concentrations were relatively constant along with increasing altitude. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air pollutants; Air quality; Inversion layer; Tethered balloon measurements; Vertical distribution; Vertical profiles",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085949523

This is particularly important for land cover data, as an essential source of data for a wide range of applications and real-world challenges including climate change mitigation, food security planning, resource allocation and mobilization. While global land cover datasets are available, their usability is limited by their coarse spatial and temporal resolutions. Furthermore, having a good understanding of the fitness for the purpose is imperative. This paper compares two datasets from a spatial data quality perspective: (1) a global land cover map, and (2) a fit-for-purpose training dataset that is generated using visual inspection of very high-resolution satellite data. The latter dataset is created using Google Earth Engine (GEE), a cloud-based computing platform and data repository. We systematically evaluate the two datasets from spatial data quality (SDQ) perspective using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to prioritise the criteria, i.e. SDQ. To validate the results, land cover classifications are conducted using both datasets, also within GEE. Based on the results of the SDQ evaluation and land cover classification, we find that the second training dataset significantly outperformed the global land cover maps. Our study also shows that cloud-based computing platforms and publicly available data repositories can provide an effective approach to filling land cover data gaps in data-scarce regions. © Authors 2020.

So, it is required to find ways such as SCR catalysts to reduce this hazard pollutant emission. In this work, a 3D model of cordierite/Pt SCR catalyst has been developed by using AVL FIRE software to analyze the NOx conversion efficiency. The simulation was performed based on experimental tests conducted on a single-cylinder engine. The exhaust gas from the engine that appears at the inlet of the catalyst was measured for E20B50D30 (20% ethanol, 50% biodiesel, 30% diesel) D100, E10D90, E20D80, B25D75 and B50D50 fuel blends at the engine speeds of 1800, 2150 and 2500 rpm under full load. The results showed that an increase in the engine’s rotational speed resulted in a reduction of NOx conversion, and the conversion rate reaches its minimum value at speed of 2500 RPM for all fuel mixtures. Moreover, increasing the ammonia mass flow rate resulted in higher NOx conversion for all fuel mixtures. However, the effect of increasing ammonia flow rate from 0.2 to 0.3 kg/h on the NOx conversion is lower than that when the ammonia mass flow changes from 0.1 to 0.2 kg/h. The maximum NOx conversion rate was observed for the mixture containing 20% ethanol and 80% diesel at the rotational speed of 1800 RPM while the lowest conversion rate is observed for pure diesel fuel. According to the results, it was seen that the SCR catalytic process for fuel blends contained ethanol have a better performance to reduce the NOx pollutant compared to the mixtures containing biodiesel at lower engine speeds; but at higher rotational speeds ethanol and biodiesel has not a positive effect on the NOx conversion.

Therefore, there is a need to evaluate the pollution status of towns through the identification of bio-monitor and bio-indicator trees. Keeping this in view, a work was undertaken to study the Air Pollution Tolerance Index (APTI) and Expected Performance Index (EPI) of trees in Sambalpur town, located in Western flanks of Eastern India during three seasons (monsoon, post-monsoon and pre-monsoon) in 2015–16. The measurements of different biochemical parameters (ascorbic acid: di-chlorophenol indophenol method of Keller and Schwager (Eur J For Pathol 7:338–350, 1977); leaf extract pH: electrometric method of Liu and Ding 2008; relative water content: oven dry method of Prajapati and Tripathi (2008) and total chlorophyll: acetone extraction method of Arnon (Plant Physiol 24:1–15, 1949), and socio-economic characters (plant habit, canopy structure, and type of plant, laminar structure and economic value as per Moore and Chapman (Methods in plant ecology, Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, 1986) and Noor et al. (Environ Geochem Health 1–15, 2014) of selected 21 trees were carried out from five polluted or experimental sites (i.e. Remed, Ainthapali, Dhankauda, Dhanupali and Durgapali) and a non-polluted or control site (i.e. Sambalpur University campus) based on commonness of tree species to all the sites and close proximity to the roads. A total of 45 samples (3 trees of each species × 5 leaves from each tree x three replicates per treatment) for every species in each site were analysed as per above standard protocol and methodology. The APTI of the trees in the control site ranged from 8.99 (Butea monosperma) to 31.63 (Peltophorum pterocarpum), while that in the experimental sites it was ranged from 10.47 (Tamarindus indica) to18.04 (Mimusops elengi). In most cases of trees (67.71%), the APTI values were higher in experimental sites than the selected trees in control site, indicating thereby that the species having higher APTI values had a greater tolerance against air pollution. The categories of various trees, classified on the basis of overall APTI, revealed that in the control site 66.67, 19.05 and 14.28% of the total trees were in the intermediately tolerant (IT), moderately tolerant (MT) and tolerant (T) categories respectively; whereas in the experimental sites, 42.86, 23.81, 19.05 and 14.28% of the species were in the intermediately tolerant (IT), moderately tolerant (MT), tolerant (T) and sensitive (S) categories respectively. Finally, based on the EPI scores, the trees found to be fit for plantations are Ficus religiosa, Madhuca indica, Azadirachta indica, Artocarpus heterophyllus, Mangifera indica, Ficus benghalensis and Syzygium cumini, owing to their placement in Best or Excellent category (81–100%).

The development of carbon regulations (CRs) beside carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems is part of carbon mitigation policies (CMPs), which are following in recent years to control and manage carbon liberation. Along with environemtal policies, the utilization of renewable energy resources have been promoted significantly. However, the economic opportunities for renewable energy development considering CMPs have not addressed extensively. In this study, a stochastic mathematical programming model has been presented to minimize cost and downside risk (DSR) of the bioelectricity generation supply chain considering the pre- and postdisaster conditions. The role of several CMPs on the economic behavior of the system has been analyzed by investigating the potential uncertainties on material availability, material quality, and consumer demand. To consider disruption effects, the postdisaster stage has been classified into several substages including damage, recovery, and back to the sustainability stages. Mississippi State after the Katrina Hurricane is addressed as a case study to examine the performance of the proposed model. The results demonstrated that the occurrence of disruptive uncertainties creates 8,978,502 $, 8,864,335 $ and 8,884,055 $ as the DSR, under carbon tax policy (CTP), carbon offset policy (COP), and CCS, respectively. The effect of disruptive scenario (Formula presented.) with a 15% reduction of resource has led to the greatest postdisaster supply chain costs in comparison with other scenarios. Although the financial analysis showed CTP has the greatest DSR after the occurrence of disaster, this policy has the most investment attractions, as well as COP, with the internal rate of return (IRR) of 9%. While implementing the CCS policy with the IRR of 2% creates 7% missed opportunity costs compared with other CMPs. © 2020 The Authors.

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of self-consolidating concrete (SCC) fabricated with treated sediments. The sediments were thermally treated at 800 °C for 1 h. The packing density of the granular skeleton was optimized to reduce the paste content and produce SCC with relatively low binder content. Three different SCC mixtures were prepared with 0%, 10%, and 20% cement replaced with treated sediments by mass. Key fresh, physical, hardened, and microstructural properties of the investigated SCC mixtures subject to different curing regimes were evaluated. The test results showed that the optimized SCC mixtures exhibited adequate self-consolidation characteristics. The particle size and high chemical activity of the sediments led to pore refinement of micro-pores, increased density, improved microstructure, and reduced micro-cracks of the investigated SCC mixtures. Furthermore, the use of up to 20% of treated sediments resulted in a compressive strength of 66 ± 1 MPa at 91 days, which is comparable to that of the reference mixture made without any sediments. Leaching test results confirmed the ecological potential of producing SCCs based on sediments, which could be an interesting alternative of using local materials to reduce the high demand of cement, thus further reducing the CO2 footprint of concrete structures. © 2020","Dredged sediments; Mechanical properties; Packing density; Self-consolidating concrete; Supplementary cementitious material; Ultrasonic pulse velocity","Cements; Compressive strength; Density (specific gravity); Dredging; Hardening; Mechanical properties; Mixtures; Particle size; Self compacting concrete; Dredged sediments; Packing density; Self-consolidating concrete; Supplementary cementitious material; Ultrasonic pulse velocity; Sediments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083002357

Quantifying carbon stocks and species diversity in forests at different successional stages and assessing their recovery capacity is important for designing local conservation and restoration strategies. We investigated the resilience potential of lowland Atlantic forests at landscape-scale using a chronosequence approach in 160 0.1-ha permanent plots, three old-growth and 13 second-growth forests at various stages of recovery. We assessed whether tree species richness, including species with high conservation values (endemic and threatened), composition and aboveground carbon stock recover along succession; and estimated how much of the old-growth forest values the 20-yr-old secondary forests had attained and the time needed to reach old-growth forests levels. Species richness, composition and carbon stock tended to recover along the chronosequence, while endemic and threatened species showed no relationship with forest age. After 20 yr of succession, the secondary forests recovered on average 52% of total species richness, 21% of species composition and only 16% of carbon stock of old-growth forests. We predicted that the absolute recovery of lowland Atlantic forests would take eight decades to thousands of years, much longer than the 10–40 years targeted by national efforts to restore degraded ecosystems. Despite slow recovery, these regenerating forests are important for climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation as they potentially sequester 1.78 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 and harbor a number of species comparable to old-growth forests. Our findings indicate that achieving landscape restoration and conservation goals through passive restoration can be a challenge, highlighting the need to invest in management plans in areas with relatively low resilience and high biodiversity and carbon conservation values. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aichi biodiversity targets; Brazil; Disturbance; ENREDD+; Environmental policies; Natural Regeneration; Space-for-time substitution","Biodiversity; Carbon; Ecosystems; Land reclamation; Recovery; Reforestation; Restoration; Above-ground carbons; Biodiversity conservation; Carbon conservations; Fragmented landscapes; Landscape restoration; Passive restorations; Restoration strategies; Second-growth forests; Conservation; biodiversity; chronosequence; conservation status; ecosystem resilience; endemic species; forest ecosystem; habitat fragmentation; habitat restoration; old-growth forest; tropical forest; Biodiversity; Carbon; Ecosystems; Land Reclamation; Recovery; Reforestation; Atlantic Forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084647183

Data products and models are subject to bias because they rely on data that inadequately capture mesoscale spatiotemporal (kilometers and days to weeks) changes. High-resolution measurement strategies need to be implemented to adequately evaluate the global ocean carbon cycle. To augment the spatial and temporal coverage of ocean–atmosphere carbon measurements, an Autonomous Surface Vehicle CO2 (ASVCO2) system was developed. From 2011 to 2018, ASVCO2 systems were deployed on seven Wave Glider and Saildrone missions along the U.S. Pacific and Australia’s Tasmanian coastlines and in the tropical Pacific Ocean to evaluate the viability of the sensors and their applicability to carbon cycle research. Here we illustrate that the ASVCO2 systems are capable of long-term oceanic deployment and robust collection of air and seawater pCO2 within ±2 matm based on comparisons with established shipboard underway systems, with previously described Moored Autonomous pCO2 (MAPCO2) systems, and with companion ASVCO2 systems deployed side by side. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.",,"Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Oceanography; Unmanned surface vehicles; Autonomous surface vehicles; Biogeochemical cycle; Carbon dioxide system; Global ocean carbon cycle; High-resolution measurements; Measurement strategies; Temporal coverage; Tropical Pacific ocean; Autonomous vehicles; biogeochemical cycle; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; global ocean; sensor; spatiotemporal analysis; transport vehicle; Australia; Pacific Coast [North America]; Pacific Coast [United States]; Tasmania; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089121515

The ability of these protected areas to meet future management objectives may be compromised if the effects of climate change are not considered in acquisition decisions. Unfortunately, the effects of climate change on ecological systems are complex and plagued by uncertainty, making it difficult for organizations to prioritize research needs to improve decision-making. Herein, we demonstrate the use of qualitative value of information analysis to identify and prioritize which sources of uncertainty should be reduced to improve land acquisition decisions to protect migratory birds in the face of climate change. The qualitative value of information analysis process involves four steps: (i) articulating alternative hypotheses; (ii) determining the magnitude of uncertainty regarding each hypothesis; (iii) evaluating the relevance of each hypothesis to acquisition decision-making; and (iv) assessing the feasibility of reducing the uncertainty surrounding each hypothesis through research and monitoring. We demonstrate this approach using the objectives of 3 U.S. federal land acquisition programs that focus on migratory bird management. We used a comprehensive literature review, expert elicitation, and professional judgement to evaluate 11 hypotheses about the effect of climate change on migratory birds. Based on our results, we provide a list of priorities for future research and monitoring to reduce uncertainty and improve land acquisition decisions for the programs considered in our case study. Reducing uncertainty about how climate change will influence the spatial distribution of priority species and biotic homogenization were identified as the highest priorities for future research due to both the value of this information for improving land acquisition decisions and the feasibility of reducing uncertainty through research and monitoring. Research on how changes in precipitation patterns and winter severity will influence migratory bird abundance is also expected to benefit land acquisition decisions. By contrast, hypotheses about phenology and migration distance were identified as low priorities for research. By providing a rigorous and transparent approach to prioritizing research, we demonstrate that qualitative value of information is a valuable tool for prioritizing research and improving management decisions in other complex, high-uncertainty cases where traditional quantitative value of information analysis is not possible. Given the inherent complexity of ecological systems under climate change, and the difficulty of identifying management-relevant research priorities, we expect this approach to have wide applications within the field of natural resource management. © 2020 Cambridge Philosophical Society","climate change; land acquisition; migration; migratory birds; protected areas; structured decision-making; value of information",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083582065

The region is of high ecological importance, is crucial for conservation and management of natural resources, and contains substantial carbon and biodiversity stocks. Nevertheless, few studies have developed allometric equations for this part of the Amazon, which differs ecologically from the parts of Amazonia where most allometric studies have been done. To fill this gap, we developed allometric equations to estimate the volume, biomass, and carbon in commercial trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) 50 cm in an area under forest management in the southeastern portion of Brazil's state of Acre. We applied the Smalian formula to data collected from 223 felled trees in 20 species, and compared multiple linear and nonlinear models. The models used diameter (DBH) measured at 1.30 m height (d), length of the commercial stem (l), basic wood density (p), and carbon content (t), as independent variables. For each dependent variable (volume, biomass, or carbon) we compared models using multiple measures of goodness-of-fit, as well as graphically analyzing residuals. The best fit for estimating aboveground volume of individual stems using diameter (d) and length (l) as variables was obtained with the Spurr model (1952; logarithmic) (root mean square error (RMSE) = 1.637, R2 = 0.833, mean absolute deviation (MAD) = 1.059). The best-fit equation for biomass, considering d, l, and p as the explanatory variables, was the Loetsch et al. (1973; logarithmic) model (RMSE = 1.047, R2 = 0.855, MAD = 0.609). The best fit equation for carbon was the Loetsch et al. (1973; modified) model, using the explanatory variables d, l, p, and t (RMSE = 0.530, R2 = 0.85, MAD = 0.304). Existing allometric equations applied to our study trees performed poorly. We showed that the use of linear and nonlinear allometric equations for volume, biomass, and carbon can reduce the errors and improve the estimation of these metrics for the harvested stems of commercial species in the southwestern Amazon. © 2020 by the authors.","Brazil; Carbon sequestration; Managed forests; Rainforest; State acre; Timber; Tropical forest","Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon; Conservation; Forestry; Mean square error; Natural resources management; Allometric equations; Dependent variables; Diameter-at-breast heights; Explanatory variables; Independent variables; Linear and nonlinear models; Mean absolute deviations; Root mean square errors; Nonlinear equations; allometry; biodiversity; biomass; carbon sequestration; conservation management; forest management; rainforest; timber; tropical environment; Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon; Conservation; Equations; Forestry; Variables; Volume; Amazon River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090413947

A statistical method using a partial least square regression for daily temperatures has been applied to study the chilling and heat requirements over a continuous period. Background and Objectives: The olive is one of the main causes of pollen allergy for the population of Mediterranean cities. The physiological processes of the reproductive cycle that governs pollen emission are associated with temperature, and thermal requirements strongly regulate the different phases of the plant's life cycle. However, the point when several specific processes occur-Such as the phases within the dormancy period-Is unclear, and the transition between endodormancy and ecodormancy is not easily distinguishable from an empirical point of view. This work focuses on defining the thermal accumulation periods related to the temperature balance needed to meet the chilling and heat requirements for the metabolic activation and budbreak in olive trees. Results and Conclusions: Thermal accumulation patterns in olive trees are strongly associated with the bioclimatic conditions of olive-growing areas, and the olive flowering start dates showed significant differences between the three studied stations. Our results show that the chilling requirements were fulfilled between late autumn and early winter, although the chilling accumulation period was more evident in the coldest and most continental bioclimatic areas (central Spain). The heat accumulation period (forcing period) was clearly defined and showed a close relationship with the timing of olive flowering. Heat requirements were therefore used to generate accurate forecasting models to predict the beginning of the olive bloom and subsequent olive pollen emission. A forecasting model considering both the chilling and heat requirements was generated in Toledo, where the estimated days displayed an error of 2.0 ± 1.8 days from the observed dates. For Lecce, the error was 2.7 ± 2.5 days and for Chaal, 4.2 ± 2.4 days. © 2020 by the authors.","Dormancy; Flowering; Olive tree; Phenology; Pollen emission; Thermal requirements","Forecasting; Forestry; Least squares approximations; Life cycle; Timing circuits; Chilling requirement; Forecasting modeling; Mediterranean cities; Mediterranean region; Partial least square regression; Physiological process; Thermal accumulation; Thermal requirements; Plants (botany); angiosperm; cooling; estimation method; heat transfer; least squares method; pollination; temperature effect; Accumulation; Forecasts; Forestry; Heat; Life Cycle; Mediterranean; Pollen; Specifications; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089802485

In that sense, the integrated assessment model (IAM) could complement the shortcomings of previous studies. IAM, capable of analyzing PM2.5 pollution levels at the provincial level in Korea, however, has not been developed yet. Hence, this study (i) expands on IAM which can represent provincial-level spatial resolution in Korea (GCAM-Korea) with air pollutant emissions modeling which focuses on the road transportation sector and (ii) examines the zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) subsidy policy's effects on PM2.5 mitigation using the expanded GCAM-Korea. Simulation results show that PM2.5 emissions decrease by 0.6-4.1% compared to the baseline, and the Seoul metropolitan area contributes 38-44% to the overall PM2.5 emission reductions. As the ZEVs subsidy is weighted towards the light-duty vehicle 4-wheels (LDV4W) sector, various spillover effects are found: ZEVs' share rises intensively in the LDV4W sector leading to an increase in its service costs, and at the same time, driving bus service costs to become relatively cheaper. This, in turn, drives an increase in bus service demand and emissions discharge. Furthermore, this type of impact of the ZEVs subsidy policy does not reduce internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) in freight trucks, although diesel freight trucks are a major contributor to PM2.5 emissions and also to NOx.

Paris Dauphine, Paris, France","Integrated simulation models are commonly used to provide insight on the complex functioning of social-ecological systems, often drawing on earlier tools with a narrower focus. Forest sector models (FSM) encompass a set of simulation models originally developed to forecast economic developments in timber markets but now commonly used to analyse climate and environmental policy. In this paper, we document and investigate this evolution through the prism of the inclusion of several non-timber objectives into FSM. We perform a systematic, quantitative survey of the literature followed by a more in-depth narrative review. Results show that a majority of papers in FSM research today focuses on non-timber objectives related to climate change mitigation, namely carbon sequestration and bioenergy production. Habitat conservation, deforestation and the mitigation of disturbances are secondary foci, while aspects such as forest recreation and many regulation services are absent. Non-timber objectives closest to the original targets of FSM, as well as those for which economic values are easier to estimate, have been more deeply integrated to the models, entering the objective function as decision variables. Others objectives are usually modelled as constraints and only considered through their negative economic impacts on the forest sector. Current limits to a deeper inclusion of non-timber objectives include the models’ ability to represent local environmental conditions as well as the formulation of the optimisation problem as a maximisation of economic welfare. Recent research has turned towards the use of model couplings and the development of models at the local scale to overcome these limitations. Challenges for future research comprise extensions to other non-timber objectives, especially cultural services, as well as model calibration at lower spatial scales. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","C61; Economics; Ecosystem services; Environmental modelling; Forest sector model; Forestry; Integrated assessment; L7; Q21; Q23; Q57","Climate change; Deforestation; Economics; Environmental protection; Timber; Bioenergy productions; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Environmental conditions; Environmental policy; Integrated simulation models; Optimisation problems; Social-ecological systems; Climate models",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082106441

However, our current insight as to the fraction of CO in the spiral arm and interarm regions is still limited by large uncertainties in assumed rotation curve models or distance determination techniques. In this work we use the Bayesian approach from Reid et al. (2016, ApJ, 823, 77; 2019, ApJ, 885, 131), which is based on our most precise knowledge at present about the structure and kinematics of the Milky Way, to obtain the current best assessment of the Galactic distribution of 13CO from the Galactic Ring Survey. We performed two different distance estimates that either included (Run A) or excluded (Run B) a model for Galactic features, such as spiral arms or spurs. We also included a prior for the solution of the kinematic distance ambiguity that was determined from a compilation of literature distances and an assumed size-linewidth relationship. Even though the two distance runs show strong differences due to the prior for Galactic features for Run A and larger uncertainties due to kinematic distances in Run B, the majority of their distance results are consistent with each other within the uncertainties. We find that the fraction of 13CO emission associated with spiral arm features ranges from 76 to 84% between the two distance runs. The vertical distribution of the gas is concentrated around the Galactic midplane, showing full-width at half-maximum values of ~75 pc. We do not find any significant difference between gas emission properties associated with spiral arm and interarm features. In particular, the distribution of velocity dispersion values of gas emission in spurs and spiral arms is very similar. We detect a trend of higher velocity dispersion values with increasing heliocentric distance, which we, however, attribute to beam averaging effects caused by differences in spatial resolution. We argue that the true distribution of the gas emission is likely more similar to a combination of the two distance results discussed, and we highlight the importance of using complementary distance estimations to safeguard against the pitfalls of any single approach. We conclude that the methodology presented in this work is a promising way to determine distances to gas emission features in Galactic plane surveys. © M.

Recently, two-dimensional (2D) black phosphorus (BP) has been developed and recognized to be an ideal platform for anchoring metal ions through lone pair electrons. Herein, we propose a new structure that cobalt atomically dispersed on BP nanosheets (BP−Co), and apply it as cocatalyst for photocatalytic H2 evolution and CO2 reduction under visible light (&gt;420 nm) irradiation. Both scanning transmission electron microscope and X-ray absorption near edge structure verified the existence of phosphorous-coordinated Co sites. The interaction between Co and P brings greatly improvement on photocatalytic activities, and 18-fold enhancement can be achieved on CdS when taking BP−Co as a noble-metal-free cocatalyst for H2 evolution, which is higher than that of Pt under the same conditions. Besides, BP−Co can also be used as an effective cocatalyst to promote photocatalytic CO2 reduction in the presence of photosensitizer [Ru(2, 2’-bipyridy)3]Cl2 with a CO evolution rate of 88.6 μmol h−1, superior to those obtained from the state-of-the-art cocatalysts. It is anticipated that the current work might provide basic understanding as well as new opportunities on 2D BP nanosheets for versatile photocatalytic reactions. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This analysis uses a least-cost generation and transmission capacity expansion model to assess economic and CO2 emissions reduction benefits from different levels of integration. These benefits are assessed for several policy scenarios around renewable energy, national energy security and CO2 emission reduction targets. In addition, we have explored if major drought events may significantly alter the benefits of trade. The World Bank Electricity Planning Model (EPM) is used to represent 11 countries in the EAPP, Eritrea, South Sudan (and SAPP as an external system) for 2020–2030 including all existing, committed and planned generation and interconnectors. Our analysis shows encouraging prospects for EAPP to potentially gain $7.6 billion from a “Shallow” level of integration wherein countries retain their national plans and interconnections are limited to existing and already committed transmission links. A “Tight” integration that requires generation and (new) interconnection plans to be optimized at a regional level, would increase benefits to $18.6 billion. Tight integration would be most efficient in meeting a 30% CO2 emission reduction target by 2030 retaining $11.8 billion of benefits. This CO2 target can be met at 3.8 times lower cost of $6.6 billion compared to the $25.7 billion needed to meet the target in the Business-as-usual (BAU) scenario of very low trade. We find that imposing a 20% upper limit on imports would still retain 80% of the benefits that allays a large part of the concerns around national energy security. We have also simulated extreme droughts that may reduce benefits of trade due to 20%–30% lower hydro availability from hydro dominated systems like Ethiopia. This indeed affects the benefits of a Shallow integration although more than 60% of base case benefits are still retained. Higher flexibility of a Tight integration, on the other hand, allows for a benefit retention of 89% or more, by adjusting flow volumes and directions of trade. A Tight integration renders a greater ability to the system to reduce the impact of major droughts and meet policy constraints including CO2 emission and import restrictions at a lower cost, due to the intrinsic flexibility of a stronger and wider network. Since all these issues are very realistic, the additional investments in major cross-border links and institutional challenges should be addressed to achieve significant benefits over the medium term. Overall, our exploration of the key facets of trade in EAPP suggests an overwhelmingly positive case for trade pointing to a rapid increase in trade volume by an order of magnitude over the next decade. © 2020","East Africa; Hydro power; Optimization model; Power System Planning; Regional integration","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Drought; Economic analysis; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy security; Integration; Investments; Business-as-usual; CO2 emission reduction; Hydro-dominated systems; Level of integrations; Policy constraints; Renewable energies; Tight integrations; Transmission capacities; Cost reduction; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; emissions trading; energy planning; environmental economics; integrated approach; power generation; targeting; East Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086394295

The objective is to reduce CO2 emissions to reach Europe’s targets of 2050. Three different centralized solar-based district heating systems integrated either with non-renovated or renovated old buildings in the community were simulated and compared against the reference city-level district heating system. The three proposed centralized systems were: Case 1: photovoltaic (PV) with a ground source heat pump (GSHP); Case 2: PV with an air-water heat pump (A2WHP); and Case 3: PV with A2WHPs, seasonal storage, and GSHPs. TRNSYS simulation software was used for dynamic simulation of the systems. Life cycle cost (LCC), CO2 emissions and purchased electricity were calculated and compared. The results show that the community-level district heating system (Case 3) outperformed Case 1, Case 2, and the city-level district heating. With non-renovated buildings, the relative emissions reduction was 83% when the reference energy system was replaced with Case 3 and the emissions reduction cost was 3.74 €/kg.CO2/yr. The relative emissions reduction was 91% when the buildings were deep renovated and integrated with Case 3 when compared to the reference system with non-renovated buildings and the emission reduction cost was 11.9 €/kg.CO2/yr. Such district heating systems could help in meeting Europe’s emissions target for 2050. © 2020 by the authors.

To complement CO2 passive sensing, the National Research Council recommended active remote sensing techniques, which are valuable for validating current space-based measurements and potential future missions. Recently, a 2-μm triple-pulse integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) lidar was developed for simultaneous and independent measurements of atmospheric CO2 and H2O. This instrument was operated at fixed wavelengths, precisely selected to avoid mutual interferences. Focusing on optimized CO2 measurements, this instrument has been updated to operate in double-pulse mode. The objective is to demonstrate high-precision and high-accuracy column CO2 measurements using tunable on-line wavelength suitable for adaptive targeting. Statistical analysis of long record CO2 field measurement and retrieval results in 1.92-ppm accuracy, equivalent to 0.44% systematic error, and 1.66-ppm precision, equivalent to 0.39% random error. Referring to the R30 CO2 absorption line, this was achieved using an on-line laser frequency offset of 1 GHz, a 5.2% target reflectivity, and 10-s average. The record indicated a better than 99% data success rate. Tuning the on-line frequency offset to 0.5 GHz results in 1.11- and 0.33-ppm measurement accuracy and precision, equivalent to 0.26% and 0.08% systematic and random errors, respectively, obtained using 13.6% target reflectivity. Range measurements indicate 0.7-m precision and 0.2-m accuracy. These results demonstrate the reliability of atmospheric CO2 measurements with high precision and high accuracy, using the pulsed 2-μm IPDA lidar. © 1980-2012 IEEE.","Active remote sensing; carbon dioxide; differential absorption lidar (DIAL); infrared; integrated optical depth","Frequency allocation; NASA; Optical radar; Random errors; Reflection; Remote sensing; Systematic errors; Differential absorption; Independent measurement; Measurement accuracy; Mutual interference; National Research Council; Range measurements; Remote sensing techniques; Space based mission; Carbon dioxide; accuracy assessment; carbon dioxide; image resolution; lidar; mixing; precision; satellite altimetry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089229227

These contrasts may influence species' interactions and the invasion potential of nonnative species; however, a limited number of phenology studies expressly consider phenological mismatches among native and nonnative species over broad spatial or temporal scales. To fill this knowledge gap, we used two complementary approaches: First, we quantified the flowering phenology of native and nonnative plants at five old-field sites across a spatially extensive range of eastern North America. Second, we used herbarium records to compare the sensitivity of flowering and fruiting phenology to climate across a 114-yr time period in a subset of common old-field species in southwestern Pennsylvania. Across the study region, nonnatives reproduced substantially earlier in the growing season than natives, suggesting that nonnatives occupy a unique phenological niche (0.55 months earlier flowering across the North American study sites; 50.1 d earlier flowering and 17.5 d earlier fruiting in southwestern Pennsylvania). Both natives and nonnatives advanced their reproductive phenology between 1900 and 2014 but exhibited contrasting phenological sensitivity to climate factors. During the flowering stage of phenology, nonnatives were more sensitive to changes in precipitation than natives and generally delayed flowering in wetter years. Nonnative plants had greater sensitivity and advanced fruiting when the month preceding fruiting was warmer, while native plants had greater sensitivity and advanced fruiting when the three-month period preceding fruiting was warmer. Our findings suggest that nonnative old-field species occupy an earlier phenological niche relative to native species, which may facilitate their invasion into old-field communities. However, given the different sensitivities of native and nonnative plants to climate factors, present-day patterns of phenology are likely to shift with future climate changes, potentially leading to novel species interactions that may influence the outcomes of invasion. © 2020 The Authors.","climate change; flowering; fruiting; herbarium; invasion; North America; old-field; phenology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089974872

However, the effect of age of exclosures on vegetation and soil property of communal lands is not yet well studied. In this study, the effect of land exclusion and age of exclosure on plant species richness, diversity, density and dominance, herbaceous standing biomass, woody biomass, woody biomass carbon, soil organic carbon (SOC) and other soil properties were assessed. To study the above listed variables, exclosures in three age classes (5–7, 12–15 and >20 years) and adjacent free grazing areas were selected. We replicate each age class three times considering agroecological similarity. From each exclosure and free grazing area, six larger plots (10m × 20m) each having five small quadrats were taken. Totally, 72 larger plots and 360 small quadrats were sampled. The result of this study indicates that exclusion of communal lands significantly improved species richness, diversity, biomass, woody biomass carbon, SOC, total nitrogen (TN) and total potassium (TK). Similarly, the density of perennial species and the density of grass species were found increased with the age of exclosure. Herbaceous species richness, diversity and annual species density were higher in the young-aged exclosures than in the older exclosures. Woody species richness, diversity, density, biomass, and woody biomass carbon were highest in the older exclosures. Besides, age of exclosure increases the content of SOC, TN and TK. Furthermore, it was found that the old-aged exclosures stored more biomass carbon (267 %) and SOC (37.66 %) than the young-aged exclosures. The study indicates the benefits of land exclosure for permanent carbon storage, which is vital to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration. © 2020","Carbon sequestration; Exclosure age; Northern Ethiopia; Vegetation properties","age; biomass allocation; carbon sequestration; herb; land management; soil carbon; species richness; vegetation; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085329149

The agriculture sector is responsible for ca. 94% of global NH3 emissions, mostly associated with manure management (56%), animal manure applied to soil (18%) and inorganic N fertilization (21%). Furthermore, N fertilization enhances N2O emissions from cropping systems. The assessment of NH3, and also N2O, abatement strategies on a regional basis has, therefore, become a strategic priority for sustainable food production worldwide. A field experiment, under Mediterranean conditions, was carried out to assess the N2O and NH3 mitigation efficiency of different synthetic inhibitors in an irrigated maize crop fertilized with urea (U). The nitrification inhibitor (NI) 3,4 dimethylpyrazole succinic acid (DMPSA), and the combination of the DMPSA and the urease inhibitor (UI), N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT), were used in the experiment. Our findings indicate that, following top-dressing N fertilization, the highest NH3 emissions were observed after U + NI and U applications (12.2 and 11.1 kg N ha−1, respectively), with no significant differences between them. The application of urea with both inhibitors (U + 2I) significantly reduced these emissions down to 3.3 kg N ha−1. During canopy senescence, NH3 emissions were not negligible and were statistically similar between treatments, with an average value of 2.3 kg N ha−1. In addition, the treatments with NI were effective in reducing cumulative N2O losses (ca. 79%). © 2020","Ammonia emissions; Double inhibitor; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrogen cycle; Nitrous oxide","Agricultural robots; Efficiency; Manures; Metabolism; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Urea; Agriculture sectors; Cropping systems; Manure management; Mitigation efficiency; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrogen-use efficiency; Synthetic inhibitors; Urease inhibitors; Ammonia; ammonia; cropping practice; enzyme activity; food production; inhibitor; maize; manure; nitrous oxide; nutrient use efficiency; sustainability; Animalia; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088630098

This study applies the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) and Tapio's decoupling approach to estimate decoupling state and mitigation potential of CO2 emissions from the transport sector during 1984–2018. LMDI technique is applied to detect the influencing variables (i.e. carbon coefficient, fuel consumption, total energy consumption, and turn over economy), which oversee CO2 emissions. The outcomes show that CO2 coefficient effect is the factor which is decreasing CO2 emissions while economic growth (EG) effect is the factor which is growing CO2 emissions. The decoupling index is also applied to influencing factors which reflect the EG factors on CO2 emissions from the transport sector. The consequences confirm that during 1984–2018, the CO2 emissions show an expensive coupling with EG. Weak decoupling occurred only in the sub-periods 1999–2003, 2004–2008, and 2009–2013. Similarly, the CO2 emissions occurred from only three decoupling grades. Furthermore, a mitigation model based on the above impacting variables estimates the mitigation rate of CO2 emissions and showed that the CO2 mitigation seemed in 1999–2003, 2004–2008, and 2009–2013. Finally, forecasting outcomes of Tapio decoupling index show a weak decoupling during 2018–2030.

The SPM, PM10, NOx, and SO2 depict site-specific variation having different anthropogenic activities. The results indicate that PM10 levels in Chandigarh remain higher than the prescribed annual ambient air quality standards (60 μg m−3) of India. Seasonal Kendall test indicates a declining trend of PM10 for the year 2003 to 2018 at an industrial and commercial site (1996–2016). There is a significant increase in NOx levels at all locations except at commercial sites. The results of the linear regression model and Theil–Sen slope show that SPM is declining at all locations, but results are not statistically significant. Interestingly, PM10 levels at the industrial site display a significant declining trend (1.3% year−1). Similarly, NOx levels are increasing at all sites but having a statistically significant trend at a rural location (8.9% year−1) and residential site (15.2% year−1). Air pollutants show strong seasonal variability having a higher concentration in post-monsoon and winter season, which found to be linked with regional anthropogenic activities such as crop residue burning and use of solid biomass fuel for cooking and other purposes. Lowest PM10 levels were observed during the monsoon and having a decline of 47.4–66.4% as compared to winter levels. Site-specific variations in air pollutants were found to be associated with air quality improvement policies such as shifting of an interstate bus terminal, ban on diesel autos, including strict implementation of air quality norms on industries.

Specifically—in line with California’s plans that aim to increase the renewable energy share into the electric grid—in this study, PV installed capacity is assumed to reach 43.7 GW in 2030, resulting of 52% of the 2030 domestic electricity generation.

Results also show that such energy transition strategy would be effective at curbing California’s domestic electricity grid mix carbon emissions by 50%, and reducing demand for non-renewable primary energy by 66%, while also achieving a 10% increase in overall EROI (in terms of electricity output per unit of investment). © 2020 by the authors.

India has not been spared of this malaise and accounts for the third-largest carbon dioxide emitter in the world. Thus, the present study revisits the curvilinear relationship between economic growth and environmental pollution in case of India over the period of 1971-2014. Design/methodology/approach: Dickey–Fuller generalised least square (DF-GLS) test developed by Elliott et al. is used to ensure that none of the variables is I(2). The study applies the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds estimation technique to test for the existence of cointegration among variables and estimate long-run and short-run parameters. The study also applies the Bai–Perron structural break test with unknown break date to determine the threshold point. The study further uses the vector error correction model (VECM) Granger causality test to check the direction of causality between variables. Findings: The ARDL bounds estimation technique confirms the cointegration among variables. The long-run coefficients of energy consumption, economic growth and financial development are found to have an adverse impact on environmental quality. The results also validate the existence of conventional EKC hypothesis. Bai–Perron structural break test, along with t-test and scatter graph, shows that inverted U-shaped relationship between environmental pollution and economic growth holds true. The VECM-based causality results support “growth hypothesis” both in the long run and short run. Research limitations/implications: This study refrained from considering a variety of variables, as the main intention of the study is to investigate whether any threshold or turnaround point exists for India. The future studies should consider a new set of variables (e.g. population, corruption index, social indicators, political scenario, energy research and development expenditures, foreign capital inflows, public investment towards alternate energy exploration, etc.) in the estimation of EKC hypothesis. Practical implications: The results validate the existence of conventional EKC hypothesis. Thereby the study argues that instead of being a threat to environmental quality, economic growth is observed to generate a sustainable environment to live in. Further, bi-directional causality is found between carbon emissions and economic growth. Thus, any effort to mitigate CO2 or environment conservation policy will impede economic growth. Consequently, controlling primary energy consumption and supply and replacing it with renewable and clean energy could be desirable for climate change mitigation. Originality/value: The data set has been refined so that the EKC estimation issues raised by Stern (2004) are addressed. In particular, statistical properties of the data set such as serial correlation, presence of a stochastic or deterministic trend, has been adequately taken care of to remove any spurious correlation. Finally, various control variables have been included to provide consideration to issues of model adequacy, such as the possibility of omitted variables bias. To the authors’ best knowledge, there is no India-specific study which has taken care of data-related issues, as suggested by Stern, in the estimation of a curvilinear relationship between environmental degradation and economic growth in India. Further, this is the first study which has used Bai–Perron structural break test with unknown break date to identify the threshold point while estimating EKC in India. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","ARDL; Carbon emissions; Co-integration; Economic growth; Energy consumption; Error correction models; Financial development; India; Time-series analysis","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Deterioration; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Error correction; Investments; Pollution; Stochastic systems; Time series analysis; ARDL; Carbon emissions; Cointegration; Economic growths; Error correction models; Financial development; India; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081727030

To ensure a stable emulsion, surfactant is used during the formation of W/D emulsion which causes additional costs for this alternative fuel. A device called as Real-Time Non-Surfactant Emulsion Fuel Supply System (RTES) was invented to eliminates the use of surfactant and rapidly supply the W/D emulsion to the engine. The efficiency of 1-ton light-duty diesel truck fueled with W/D emulsion fuel produced by RTES was tested. Two types of the experimental method were used which chassis dynamometer testing and on-road are testing. The optimum water percentage and vehicle speed were evaluated from the result of exhaust emissions and fuel consumption measurement. Chassis dynamometer testing showed that the optimum water percentage for DE2 were 6.5% and vehicle speed aimed at 52 km/h was selected as the optimum vehicle speed. In on-road testing, the urban route gave the deficient results for both exhaust emissions and fuel consumption which agree with chassis dynamometer testing result where emulsion fuel is not suitable to be used at low speed vehicle operation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chassis dynamometer testing; Diesel emulsion; Diesel vehicle testing; Low grade diesel","Air pollution; Alternative fuels; Chassis; Diesel engines; Efficiency; Emulsification; Fuel systems; Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Surface active agents; Vehicle performance; Additional costs; Chassis dynamometer testing; Combustion efficiencies; Consumption measurement; Experimental methods; Low speed vehicle; Performance analysis; Surfactant emulsion; Dynamometers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083003554

The regional and local wind resources measured at a height of 100 m above sea level were assessed by taking into account 20 years (2000-2019) of ERA5 wind data. The wind speed significantly increases as we move towards the offshore areas, with the wind Class C7 reporting a maximum of 41%. By combining the annual electricity production with the emissions associated with the port activities, it was possible to show that at least 385 turbines (each rated at eight MW) will be required to cover the electricity demand for this port. The present study has found it difficult to implement such a project based only on the available wind resources and has identified that more likely a mixed project that involves some other resources will be more appropriate. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the future of the ship industry is becoming greener and definitely, a wind project located near Constanta harbour will represent a viable solution in this direction. © 2020 by the authors.","Air pollution; Coastal area; Constanta port; ERA5; Wind turbines",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089590054

We also assessed how these interactions could influence the availability of Cd and its possible phytoextraction by these grasses. The Cd fraction bound to carbonates was higher in the winter conditions, while Cd bound to Fe- and Mn oxides was higher in the summer conditions, which resulted in a higher Cd availability in winter compared to summer conditions. B. decumbens and P. maximum took up more Cd when grown in the winter conditions, but their biomasses were not affected by the higher Cd uptake.

Design/methodology/approach: This study proposes a mixed-integer nonlinear programming model. For solving this multi-objective problem, the authors use epsilon constraint method, which presented eight Pareto solutions. For selecting the best solution, the analytic hierarchy process approach is used. The presented model is applied on a real case study, and the results are discussed and sensitivity analysis is implemented on the parameters of the concern. Findings: This study confirms the assumption that by allocating budget to NGOs for increasing CEA, the produced waste will be decreased. Research limitations/implications: In the present study, the authors only investigate air pollution caused by TS. Future studies can investigate other types of pollution. Furthermore, uncertainty in the amount of produced waste can be variable making the problem closer to the real environment. In this case, robust optimization may have better results. Practical implications: Based on the results of sensitivity analysis, some implications obtain that can highlight by managers in the decision-making process. The operational costs of TS have a critical aspect in founding TS, so using new technology and high-tech machines for operational processes of TSs, can result in decreasing the running cost of TSs. Also, the determination of TS capacity is a remarkable issue in optimization, which should be paid special attention to this for the design of TSs in the planning phase of the system. Moreover, collaborating with NGOs has a good effect on increasing CEA that results in a decrease of MSW. Originality/value: The role of NGOs and government simultaneity has been considered in a green supply chain. Moreover, the authors considered TS between source and disposal that reduce the time of transferring waste. Therefore, this study can be beneficial for the MSW management system, which faces the problems in the lack of capacity and transportation problems and environmental issues by proposing solutions in three studies including economic, environmental and social aspects. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Consumer environmental awareness; Epsilon constraint method; Logistics; Mathematical programming; Municipal solid waste management; NGO’s role; Operations research; Optimization; Transfer station",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088853252

Wood pellets are normally produced in industrial pellet plants (centralised production), but decentralised small-scale local production also occurs. This study applies Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to quantify and compare the environmental profile of one centralised and two decentralised alternatives for wood pellet production for residential heating in Portugal: (1) industrial wood pellets production (centralised), (2) wood pellets production at sawmills (decentralised) and (3) wood pellets production at households (decentralised). System boundaries include the stages of forest management, wood pellet production, wood pellet distribution and wood pellet energetic conversion. The impact results show that industrial pellet production ranks as the worst alternative, while pellet production at households has the best environmental profile for all the impact categories under study. However, the environmental impacts of pellet production at the sawmill do not differ greatly from those of the pellet production at households; they are 14 to 16% higher for global warming and fossil resources scarcity and 0.3 to 3% higher for the remaining impact categories. The worst environmental performance of the industrial pellet production alternative is mainly due to high electricity and diesel consumption during wood pellet production and the use of logging residues to generate heat for drying biomass feedstock. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the influence of changing the distance travelled during the transport of packed pellets to stores and sawdust to households. The results show changes in the environmental performance ranking, highlighting that for short distances, both decentralised alternatives can be more sustainable from an environmental perspective than the centralised alternative, but for larger distances, the pellet production at households should be avoided. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Bioenergy; Environmental impact; LCA; Pellet stove; Residential heating","Environmental impact; Environmental management; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Housing; Pelletizing; Sawing; Sawmills; Sensitivity analysis; Wood fuels; Wood products; Comparative life cycle assessment; Diesel consumption; Energetic conversions; Environmental performance; Environmental profile; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Pellet production; Residential heating; Life cycle; bioenergy; comparative study; cooking appliance; environmental impact; heating; life cycle analysis; wood; article; bioenergy; biomass; electricity; forest management; fossil; greenhouse effect; heat; heating; household; life cycle assessment; logging; nonhuman; Portugal; quantitative analysis; sawdust; sensitivity analysis; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084406435

We show that a scenario consistent with the 2°C target that peaks China's emissions before 2025 could avoid around 190 thousand premature deaths in 2030. The health benefits could partially or fully cover the policy costs under different assumptions of the value of a statistical life (VSL). Our framework also illustrates that estimated costs and health benefits distribute unevenly across regions in China. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","climate change; co-benefit; CO2emissions; integrated assessment model; REACH Modeling Framework",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095130134

Countries have made active efforts to reduce carbon emission while economic development. As the largest developing country and the second largest economy, China promises to reduce carbon emissions to the world in the critical period of industrial transformation, so the impact of industrial structure on carbon emissions has become an important problem to be solved. Based on the provincial panel data of China from 1999 to 2016, this paper estimates the influencing factors of carbon dioxide emissions, constructs threshold regression model, and studies the non-linear impact of industrial structure on carbon emissions in China. The results show that carbon emissions are increasing, while the industrial structure has a single threshold effect. And based on the empirical conclusion, according to the actual situation of our country, this paper put forward brief policy recommendations, including low-carbon technology development and the use of renewable clean energy, in order to better promote carbon emission reduction in our country. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Chemical equipment; Developing countries; Emission control; Global warming; Regression analysis; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emission reductions; Environmental governances; Industrial structures; Industrial transformations; Low-carbon technologies; Policy recommendations; Threshold regression models; Industrial economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090457470

Most studies have been conducted in regions with harsh winters; it remains unclear whether snowfall is associated with risk of MI in regions with milder or more varied climates. A case-crossover design was used to investigate the association between snowfall and death from MI in British Columbia, Canada. Deaths from MI among British Columbia residents between October 15 and March 31 from 2009 to 2017 were identified. The day of each death from MI was treated as the case day, and each case day was matched to control days drawn from the same day of the week during the same month. Daily snowfall amount was assigned to case and control days at the residential address, using weather stations within 15 km of the residence and 100 m in elevation. In total, 3,300 MI case days were matched to 10,441 control days. Compared with days that had no snowfall, odds of death from MI increased 34% (95% confidence interval: 0%, 80%) on days with heavy snowfall (≥5 cm). In stratified analysis of deaths from MI as a function of both maximum temperature and snowfall, risk was significantly increased on snowfall days when the temperature was warmer. © The Author(s) 2020.

Besides the tremendous efforts to use CDs as phosphors of GaN-based blue or UV LED chips to produce photoluminescent WLEDs, it is really not easy to produce electroluminescent WLEDs with CDs as the active layer owing to the complex emission mechanism of the CDs. Here, by combining the merits of both the blue emissive CDs and ZnO nanowires (NWs), near-white electroluminescence (EL) is demonstrated by enhancing blue emission from the blue CDs and with the help of a thin PMMA polymer layer for the PEDOT:PSS/ZnO NWs organic/inorganic hybrid heterojunction LEDs. By interfacial modification with the thin PMMA layer, EL intensity of the device is boosted strikingly (especially for the blue emission from CDs and ZnO NWs), making the emission color of the device tune from yellowish green toward near white.

It contains more than 50% TiO2 along with iron, silica and alumina. The spinel structure of ilmenite (FeO·TiO2) is such that iron is bound in the lattice of TiO2 matrix. To remove iron from the ilmenite is a major task for process metallurgists. Various processes have been applied to remove this iron. One of them is reduction and leaching. The carbon containing pellets and environment of Jhama coal reduces the iron oxide to metallic state. This metallic iron is then leached in dilute hydrochloric acid (20% vol) and a greenish color leach liquor is obtained. The pH of the leach liquor solution is found to be 0.31. This leach liquor contains hydrochloric acid and iron as ferrous chloride. These acid and solid masses were separated by hydrothermal process in the present investigation. The residue containing ferrous chloride was characterized with the help of XRD and EPMA. During the experiment it was found that complete separation of HCl and FeCl2 is feasible. The final pH of separated HCl is found to be 1.66 and it is suitable for reuse in the leaching of reduced ilmenite and the process makes a loop. The purity of ferrous chloride is in line with commercial grade which is a saleable product. © 2020, The Indian Institute of Metals - IIM.","Ferrous chloride; Flux; Ilmenite; Leaching; Reduction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086448652

In the present study, special attention was given to slurry acidification and slurry crust enhancement and our objective was to assess the effect of slurry bio-acidification using sugar and cheese whey as an alternative to sulphuric acid, and the potential of rice bran as crust enhancer on NH3 and greenhouse gases emissions during storage. Both the cheese whey and the rice bran are materials, available in large amounts, with low commercial value in some EU regions as Portugal and its use, at farm scale, will be a win-win situation. Sugar is also a good alternative to acid attending its relatively low value. A laboratory experiment was performed for 2 months with five treatments: non-treated cattle slurry (CTRL), slurry treated with sulphuric acid (ACID), slurry treated with sugar (SUGAR), slurry treated with cheese whey (WHEY) and rice bran applied on the slurry surface (RICE). The SUGAR treatment led to a reduction of NH3 emissions by 45% relative to CTRL while WHEY and RICE resulted in a reduction of 68% and 25%, respectively. Nevertheless, this effect of SUGAR and WHEY was shorter than in ACID, since NH3 emissions started to be observed in those 2 treatments after 31 and 35 days of storage, respectively. Nitrous oxide emissions remained close to zero in ACID and SUGAR. RICE led to the highest emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) releasing almost 5% of carbon present in the initial mixture (slurry + rice bran) and presented the highest methane emissions. The ACID and SUGAR led to a significant decrease of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our results indicate that bio-acidification using a source of sugar could be a good alternative to H2SO4 to reduce simultaneously NH3 and GHG emissions during storage. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-acidification; Cheese whey; Crust formation; Rice bran; Slurry; Sugar","Acidification; Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Nitrogen oxides; Storage (materials); Sulfuric acid; Cattle slurry; GHG emission; Greenhouse gases emissions; Laboratory experiments; Large amounts; Methane emissions; Nitrous oxide emissions; Short term storage; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083312350

Coded program in MATLAB software is then distributed to calculate the optimum tilt angle for extracting the highest solar radiation in different months of the year for five cities of Iran with different geographic latitudes. An optimal annual slope is obtained for maximum utilization and for conditions where the collector can only be adjusted at an angle during the year. Using an interpolation, an equation has been derived for obtaining the optimal tilt angle of collector for areas with latitude between 27° and 37°. Inasmuch as the top heat loss coefficient is required for evaluating the thermal performance of solar collectors, the value for different temperatures is obtained at ambient temperature up to 200°C for the absorber plate. Effects of key parameters such as collector slope, number of covers, wind speed, emittance coefficient of adsorption plate, and cover spacing on top heat loss coefficient are investigated.

Much of our current understanding of convective clustering comes from simulations in idealized radiative convective equilibrium (RCE) configurations. In these simulations the two forms of convective clustering tend to covary, and their individual effects on the climate are thus hard to disentangle. This study shows that in aquaplanet simulations with more realistic boundary conditions, such as meridional gradients of surface temperature and rotational forces, the two aspects of convective clustering are not equivalent and are associated with different impacts on the large-scale climate. For instance, reducing the convective area in the equatorial region in the aquaplanet simulations results in broader meridional humidity and rain distributions and in lower tropospheric temperatures throughout the tropics. By contrast, the number of convective regions primarily impacts the zonal variance of humidity-related quantities in the aquaplanet simulations, as the distribution of convective regions affects the size of the subsidence regions and thereby the moistening influence of convective regions. The aquaplanet simulations confirm many other qualitative results from RCE simulations, such as a reduction of equatorial tropospheric humidity when the area covered by convection diminishes. © 2020.

We evaluate the influence of altitude and climatic variables related to temperature and precipitation on plant community composition and species richness on Brazilian inselbergs. We assume as a premise that both climate and altitude would induce changes on plant community composition and species richness at the local level. We used plant inventory data from 370 sampling units across four inselberg sites in the Atlantic Forest of Espírito Santo State, south-eastern Brazil. We tested the univariate and multivariate effects of altitude and climate variables on community composition and species richness with multiple models. Differences in species richness between inselbergs were evaluated using sample-based data to estimate rarefaction and extrapolation curves. In addition, differences in species composition and taxonomic beta diversity were examined via novel frequency-based metrics. A contrasting climate pattern was observed between the inselberg sites, with south sites being wet compared to the dry conditions found in northern sites. Species richness by rarefaction showed a similar pattern within regional sites; however, there were marked differences between regions. Species richness and beta diversity showed significant differences among sites, with higher values in southern sites than in northern sites. In a multi-model comparison between inselberg sites, altitude significantly influenced community composition and species richness and explained more variance than climate models. This finding suggested that climate could act to some extent on these tropical inselbergs; however, altitude was a better predictor of plant community composition and species richness at the local level. © 2020, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Abiotic filtering; Atlantic Forest Biome; Beta diversity; Climate models; Environmental filtering; Latitudinal gradient","climate effect; community dynamics; inselberg; plant community; species diversity; species richness; Atlantic Forest; Brazil; Espirito Santo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088246388

To reduce the amount of time spent in searching, downloading and pre-processing data, the remote Sensing community is coming to an agreement on the minimum amount of corrections satellite images must convey in order to reach the broadest range of applications. Satellite imagery meeting such criteria (which usually include atmospheric, radiometric and topographic corrections) are generically called Analysis Ready Data (ARD). Furthermore, ARD is being assembled into multidimensional data cubes, minimising preprocessing tasks and allowing scientists and users in general to focus on analysis. A particular instance of this is the Brazil Data Cube (BDC) project, which is processing remote sensing images of medium spatial resolution into ARD datasets and assembling them as multidimensional cubes of the Brazilian territory. For example, BDC users are released from performing tasks such as image co-registration , aerosol interference correction. This work presents a BDC proof of concept, by analysing a BDC data cube made with images from the fourth China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite (CBERS-4) of one of the largest biodiversity hotspot in the world, the <i>Cerrado</i> biome. It also shows how to map and monitor land use and land cover using the CBERS data cube. We demonstrate that the CBERS data cube is effective in resolving land use and and land cover issues to meet local and national needs related to the landscape dynamics, including deforestation, carbon emissions, and public policies. © Authors 2020.

These events often lead to loss of productivity in ecosystem-based livelihoods, biodiversity, ecosystem goods and services. Communities directly dependent on socio-ecological systems for primary livelihood need to strengthen their resilience for early recovery and prepare for the impacts of future hazards. Current policies often assume that households are equally vulnerable to hazards. However, there is no robust empirical study available on the level and distribution of vulnerability amongst marginalised households. This study compared the levels of vulnerability amongst 500 households in five villages situated in the Mangrove ecosystem of the Indian Sundarban using the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVIs). The results uncover significant variations in levels and distribution of vulnerability between the villages. These findings could be used to tailor need-based bespoke adaptation and mitigation interventions to combat climate-induced variability or hazard events in the future. In order to optimise the benefits of policy or program for strengthening resilience of these households–this article recommends that policymakers consider micro-level differences in levels and distribution of vulnerability. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate Change; Hydro- meteorological hazards; livelihood Vulnerability Index; sustainable Development; vulnerability","climate change; ecosystem resilience; ecosystem service; flooding; hydrometeorology; livelihood; mangrove; optimization; policy making; vulnerability; India; Sundarbans; West Bengal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086329342

In this study, we confirm that reduced levels of air pollution correlate with unusually high levels of clear-sky insolation in Delhi, India. Restrictions here were announced on March 19th, with the nation going into lockdown on March 24th. Comparing insolation data before and after these dates with insolation from previous years (2017 to 2019), we observe an 8.3% ± 1.7% higher irradiance than usual in late March and a 5.9% ± 1.6% higher one in April, while we find no significant differences in values from previous years in February or early March. Using results from a previous study, we calculated the expected increase in insolation based on measured PM2.5 concentration levels. Measurements and calculations agree within confidence intervals, suggesting that reduced pollution levels are a major cause for the observed increase in insolation. A broadly noticed consequence of the restrictions enacted to counter the spreading of COVID-19 was unusually clear skies in many regions of the world. Better air quality has an impact on solar power generation, as fewer pollution particles in the air means that more sunlight will reach solar panels on the ground. In this study, we explore how air pollution in Delhi has developed following the lockdown on March 24th and how this reduction has affected how much sunlight the city received. First, we looked at measured particle concentration levels and noticed that after lockdown, levels dropped to about half of where they had been in previous years. Then, we looked at how much sunlight was received by solar panels. Before lockdown, insolation was similar to previous years. Yet, after lockdown, there was a clear and significant increase. In late March, insolation was up by 8.3% compared with levels in previous years. This is comparable to moving a solar panel from Toronto to Houston. Following restrictions to counter the spread of COVID-19, reports about unusually clear skies appeared in many regions of the world. In this study, we explore how air pollution in Delhi has developed following the lockdown on March 24th and how this reduction has affected how much sunlight the city received. Until early April, pollution levels had dropped to half of their usual levels. The cleaner air allowed more sunlight to pass, increasing insolation by more than 8%. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","air pollution; COVID-19; solar energy","Air cleaners; Air quality; Pollution control; Solar cell arrays; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Confidence interval; Delhi , India; Particle concentrations; PM2.5 concentration; Pollution level; Pollution particles; Previous year; Solar resources; Incident solar radiation; air quality; atmospheric pollution; clear sky; concentration (composition); COVID-19; insolation; particulate matter; viral disease; Delhi; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087807335

It is also important for many hydrological and water resource applications. This, however, remains a challenge in regions that are poorly covered by meteorological stations, such as northern Canada or mountainous regions. Reanalyses may represent an interesting option to define a reference climate in such regions. However, these need to be validated and corrected for bias before they can be used. In this paper, two data assimilation methods, Optimal Interpolation (OI) and Ensemble Optimal interpolation (EnOI), were used to combine four reanalysis datasets with observations in order to improve the representation of various precipitation indices across Canada. A total of 986 meteorological stations with minimally 20-year precipitation records over the 30-year reference period (1980–2009) were used. Annual values of ten Climate Precipitations Indices (CPIs) were estimated for each available dataset and were then combined (reanalysis plus observations) using OI and EnOI. A cross-validation strategy was finally applied to assess the relative performance of these datasets. Results suggest that combining reanalysis and observations through OI or EnOI improves CPI estimates at sites where no recorded precipitation is available. The EnOI dataset outperformed OI applied to each reanalysis independently. An evaluation of the gridded interpolated observational dataset from Natural Resources Canada showed it should be used with considerable caution for extreme CPIs because it can underestimate annual maximum 1-day precipitation, as well as overestimate the annual number of wet days. © 2020 The Author(s).

Due to climate changes, plants need to withstand extreme environmental conditions through adaptation and changings in developmental pathways. Among other paths, plants undergo changes in developmental pathways controlled by phytohormones. At the same time, somatic embryogenesis has been widely used as a model to understand the mechanisms involved in plant response to different stresses. In this study, in order to induce a strong effect of temperature stress on plants regenerated from somatic embryos, higher temperatures (40 °C for 4 h, 50 °C for 30 min, and 60 °C for 5 min) than the control (23 °C) were applied during the induction stage of somatic embryogenesis in Pinus halepensis. A morphological characterization of the embryogenic cultures showed small differences in the number of starch grains, lipid bodies, and phenolic compounds between treatments. Results showed that high temperatures (60 °C) led to higher rates at the maturation stage of somatic embryogenesis when compared to the control (23 °C), strengthening the productivity through the increase in the number of somatic embryos obtained. Finally, analysis of endogenous concentration of cytokinins showed that different conditions applied during the initiation phase of somatic embryogenesis led to different hormonal profiles; isoprenoid cytokinins showed a clear defined pattern with the higher total hormone concentration being found in embryonal masses induced at 50 °C for 30 min, while different aromatic cytokinins presented different individual responses to the treatments applied. These differences corroborate the idea that cytokinins could be potential regulators of stress-response processes during initial steps of somatic embryogenesis. © 2020 by the authors.","Abiotic stress; Phytohormones; Pinus halepensis; Somatic embryogenesis; TEM analysis","Animal cell culture; Climate change; Effect of temperature; Endogenous concentration; Environmental conditions; Hormone concentration; Late-successional species; Morphological characterization; Pinus halepensis mills; Somatic embryogenesis; Plants (botany); adaptation; colonization; coniferous tree; cytology; embryo; high temperature; morphology; native species; phytohormone; temperature effect; Control Systems; Cytokinins; Embryos; Mediterranean; Pinus Halepensis; Plants; Somatic Embryogenesis; Stresses; Pinus halepensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090243624

However, the effects of different chemical bonding states between P and the carbon matrix for potassium-ion storage and cycling performance still need to be investigated. Herein, three P/C composites with different chemical bonding states were successfully fabricated through simply ball-milling red P with carboxylic group carbon nanotubes (CGCNTs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and reduced carboxylic group carbon nanotubes (RCGCNTs), respectively. When used as potassium-ion battery (PIB) anodes, the red P and CGCNT (P-CGCNT) composite deliver the most outstanding cycling stability (402.6 mAh g-1 over 110 cycles) with a favorable capacity retention of 68.26% at a current density of 0.1 A g-1, much higher than that of the phosphorus-CNT (P-CNT) composite (297.5 mAh g-1 and 50.40%). Based on the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical performance, we propose that the existence of a carboxyl functional group will be instrumental for the formation of the P-O-C bond. More importantly, when compared with the P-C bond, the P-O-C bond can lead to a higher reversible capacity and a better long-Term cycling stability as a result of the more robust bonding energy of the P-O-C bond (585 KJ mol-1) than that of the P-C bond (264 kJ mol-1). This work provides some insights into designing high-performance P anodes for PIBs.

The results show that the greater the drilling depth and the closer the drilling location is to the upper coal seam, the better the effect of destabilizing the impact-prone coal seam is. With the increase of drilling depth, the maximum value of acoustic emission events in coal-rock mass decreases first, and then stabilizes; with the increase of drilling location (height), the maximum value of acoustic emission events in coal-rock mass increases first, and then decreases; the stability of coal-rock can be monitored by the evolution law of acoustic emission. The failure modes of coal-rock samples with different drilling depths and locations are different, and large cracks mostly exist in the local part of coal-rock samples. The damage evolution of coal-rock mass can be divided into three stages: initial non-damage stage, slow increase stage and rapid increase stage. Different drilling depth and location have different effects on rock damage evolution characteristics. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Acoustic emission; Coal-rock; Damage; Drilling depth; Drilling location","Acoustic emissions; Boreholes; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal mines; Computer software; Infill drilling; Location; Rock bursts; Rock mechanics; Rocks; Acoustic emission characteristics; Borehole pressure; Coal rock; Damage; Damage evolution characteristics; Different effects; Numerical simulation software; Prediction and control; Acoustic emission testing; acoustic emission; borehole logging; coal seam; drilling; numerical model; rock mass response; rock mechanics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082775003

Since then, Australia has experienced unprecedented warming related to climate change and an associated increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, droughts, storms, bushfires and air pollution. These events have had major impacts on community physical and mental health. Objective The aim of this article is to describe the health impacts of climate change and the role of general practitioners (GPs) in responding to these impacts. Discussion While the clinical skills that underpin general practice have not changed, the environmental and planetary context has shifted. A 'planetary health' approach is required. Climate change should now be considered a health emergency. GPs have a critical role in mitigation and adaptation. Responding to climate change aligns with principles of preventive health and can produce 'co-benefits' for individual and population health. © The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners 2020.",,"article; climate change; general practitioner; human; human experiment; population health; skill; Australia; climate change; general practice; global health; mortality; procedures; public health; Australia; Climate Change; General Practice; Global Health; Humans; Public Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088908465

Therefore, an increase in steel production inevitably entails an increase in the production of ferroalloys. The global steel production has increased by about 30% in the past decade. This article discusses the general condition of the ferroalloy sector in the CIS countries and, in particular, in Russia. The main consumers of ferroalloy products in the domestic markets among Russian metallurgical enterprises are listed, and the structure of production and consumption in other producing economies (China, India, the EU, the United States, Japan) is examined. It is revealed that the overproduction of ferroalloys in the CIS is nearly 400%. In addition, the ways of developing the ferroalloy sector are considered, that is, aimed at reducing the share of ore raw materials, reducing agent, and electricity in the production cost, which is achieved by using cheaper ore, applying new types of processes and outfits, and designing alternative ferroalloys to replace their conventional counterparts. One of such novelties is smelting in DC furnaces, which allows using unprepared fine chrome ore as a raw material instead scarce lump ore in combination with a cheap fine reducing agent (anthracite) for ferrochrome production. Another promising technology is melting in an oxygen reactor by postcombustion with gaseous oxygen released with the reduction of carbon monoxide inside the outfit. In addition, alternative kinds of ferroalloy products can gain ground, such as KAUR calcium carbon which can replace calcium carbide in steelmaking. © 2020, Allerton Press, Inc.","bulk ferroalloy; CIS countries; ferroalloys; ferrochrome; ferromanganese; ferrosilicon; global market; silicomanganese","Calcium carbide; Carbon monoxide; Economics; Ores; Oxygen; Smelting; Steelmaking; Domestic markets; Ferrochrome production; Metallurgical enterprise; Oxygen reactors; Post-combustion; Production and consumption; Production cost; Steel production; Ferroalloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099877603

In this frame, the development of a modern mine land rehabilitation strategy is considered as a prerequisite for mitigating the social and economic impacts for the local communities. In the case of western Macedonia lignite mines, these prospects are investigated based on a PEST (political, economic, social, technological) analysis of seven alternative land uses. Urban (industrial) development, green houses, and industrial heritage parks are considered as the most appropriate land uses for mitigating the socioeconomic impacts due to the loss of employments. For the land uses occupying large areas (i.e., agriculture, forestry, livestock farming, and photovoltaic parks), an optimisation algorithm is proposed for determining the mix of land uses that maximise revenue, equity, and natural conservation and minimise investment. The algorithm was applied using the opinions of 10 experts, who were involved in mine land reclamation projects carried out in the western Macedonia region in the recent past. According to the results obtained, photovoltaic parks are rated as a more attractive investment than extensive agriculture, as regards the anticipation of revenues, while livestock farming and forests are necessary to safeguard the ecosystem's functions. © 2020 by the authors.","Coal; Decision-making; Land use; Lignite; Mines; Optimisation; Reclamation; Rehabilitation; Sustainability","Agricultural robots; Coal industry; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Forestry; Gas emissions; Green manufacturing; Land reclamation; Land use; Lignite; Petroleum prospecting; Industrial heritage; Land rehabilitation; Livestock farming; Natural conservation; Reclamation project; Social and economic impacts; Socio-economic impacts; Surface coal mining; Lignite mines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090099410

However, these impacts are entirely obscured by conventional least-cost analyses. Thus, this work compares the socio-economic impacts of various strategies to decarbonize the energy system by 2050 within the framework of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We demonstrate that transitions that protect domestic strategic assets and preserve key industrial sectors correspondingly deliver a socially equitable transition. Adopting a technology-agnostic approach to decarbonizing the European electricity system maximizes the associated co-benefits and potentially increases the gross value added (GVA) to the economy by 50% relative to a business as usual scenario. This new way of thinking about the economic transition fundamentally reframes the discussion from one of cost to one of opportunity. To date, the scientific and policy debates around energy systems transition have mainly focused on the cost performances of energy technologies. This tendency has resulted in “one size fits all” solutions that neglect any social, geopolitical, and macro-economic considerations. The technical and socio-economic framework proposed in this work has demonstrated that the relative costs and opportunities descending from the transition to net-zero are unevenly distributed between countries. Failing to account for national and region-specific characteristics is likely to exacerbate labor market inequalities and will result in deeper social divisions, with adverse implications for growth, productivity, well-being, and social cohesion. Hence, maximizing social value by accounting for national strategic assets, rather than pursuing exclusively cost minimization, is key. In this work, we propose a new narrative for the European transition to net-zero energy systems. Considering the specific cases of Poland, Spain, and the UK, we show that describing the transition exclusively as “costly” is incorrect. Rather, maximizing social value and protecting national strategic assets is key to deliver a technically feasible, financially viable, and socially equitable transition. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","employment; energy systems transitions; gross value added; just transition; net-zero economy; sustainable development","Binary alloys; Cost accounting; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Planning; Potassium alloys; Uranium alloys; Business-as-usual; Economic transitions; Electricity system; Energy technologies; Gross value added; Least-cost analysis; Socio-economic frameworks; Socio-economic impacts; Industrial economics; cost analysis; energy policy; market transition; regional economy; socioeconomic impact; Sustainable Development Goal; technology adoption; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089350587

The first system was initially started in the year 1965 at Amsterdam and now it has been expanded almost in all the continents of the globe. The adoption of this concept was initially seen in developed countries. Now in the past decade various developing countries also have implemented the PBSS in their urban areas. However, the developing countries are facing many implementations and less ridership issues due to various barriers. This paper identifies the barriers which are hinders in the way of implementation of PBSS. An identified 31 barrier was categorized under six groups for ranking. The Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchical Process (FAHP) is applied to examine the relevance and prioritize them with the help of different stakeholders. Total 31 stakeholders were selected as experts from different working backgrounds for this study. The experts were grouped into six namely decision makers, academicians, consultants, scientists and researchers, operators, and users. The perspective of each group is also examined and checked using Kendall' coefficient. The majority of experts opine that City infrastructure barrier and travel characteristics barriers are most influential barriers for successful implementation of PBSS while technological and geographical barriers are least influential barriers. The overall results and opinions by different group of experts will help the decision makers to formulate effective policy to tackle all the barriers prior to implementation of PBSS in Indian urban areas. With the help of this framework, time and financial resources of the government can be utilized in an optimum way and the savings can be utilized for improving necessary city infrastructure. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Barriers; Bicycle sharing; FAHP; Perspective; Prioritization; Stakeholder","Developing countries; Traffic congestion; Analytical hierarchical process; Decision makers; Developed countries; Financial resources; First systems; Health effects; Infrastructure barriers; Public bicycle sharing systems; Decision making; analytical hierarchy process; cycle transport; developing world; policy making; public transport; stakeholder; urban policy; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086708662

Here, we evaluate leaf gas exchange responses of five perennial grassland species from four functional groups to individual and interactive global changes in an open-air experiment in Minnesota, USA, including elevated CO2 (eCO2), warming, reduced rainfall and increased soil nitrogen supply. All four factors influenced leaf net photosynthesis and/or stomatal conductance, but almost all effects were context-dependent, i.e. they differed among species, varied with levels of other treatments and/or depended on environmental conditions. Firstly, the response of photosynthesis to eCO2 depended on species and nitrogen, became more positive as vapour pressure deficit increased and, for a C4 grass and a legume, was more positive under reduced rainfall. Secondly, reduced rainfall increased photosynthesis in three functionally distinct species, potentially via acclimation to low soil moisture. Thirdly, warming had positive, neutral or negative effects on photosynthesis depending on species and rainfall. Overall, our results show that interactions among global changes and environmental conditions may complicate predictions based on simple theoretical expectations of main effects, and that the factors and interactions influencing photosynthesis vary among herbaceous species. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","climate change; CO2; drought; functional groups; global change; grassland; photosynthesis: carbon reactions; stomata","acclimation; carbon dioxide; experimental study; functional group; gas exchange; global change; global warming; grassland; leaf; nitrogen; perennial plant; rainfall; Minnesota; United States; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; rain; chemistry; ecosystem; grassland; greenhouse effect; metabolism; Minnesota; physiology; plant leaf; Poaceae; soil; temperature; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Global Warming; Grassland; Minnesota; Nitrogen; Plant Leaves; Poaceae; Rain; Soil; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086369360

Achieving high injection rates in deep saline aquifers requires a detailed assessment of injectivity performance and evaluation of the processes that alter the permeability of the near-well region. One of the most common forms of the injectivity loss in the context of CO2 storage in saline aquifers is salt precipitation driven by the evaporation of brine into the relatively dry injected CO2 stream. We present a novel compositional transport formulation based on overall-composition variables which models salt as a separate solid phase which could potentially form through two essentially different ways, i.e., kinetic or equilibrium. To model formation drying-out and subsequent halite-precipitation, an accurate and reliable fluid model ePC-SAFT, which can effectively account for ionic effects, is applied. In addition, a volume balance approach (i.e., depending on how far the salt saturation is from the solubility limit) is implemented to estimate solid saturation in a simulation cell. The resulting simulator is benchmarked against several well-known examples, with analytical solutions demonstrating the ability of the code to cover a variety of physical mechanisms. Finally, injection of dry CO2 into a brine-saturated core-scale domain is simulated and sensitivity analyses over various parameters are performed. We show that the new model is capable to quantitatively represent the physics of salt precipitation (for example salt self-enhancing) under different reservoir conditions. © 2020 The Authors","CCS; CO2 storage; Injectivity; Salt precipitation; Self-enhancing","Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Hydrogeology; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Sensitivity analysis; Sodium chloride; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Climate change mitigation; Deep saline aquifers; Model formations; Physical mechanism; Reservoir conditions; Salt precipitation; Solubility limits; Carbon capture; aquifer; carbon dioxide; carbon storage; modeling; precipitation (chemistry); reservoir rock; salt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086757260

The Korean economy relies heavily on large thermal power plants—a major source of PM2.5 emissions. Although air quality regulations can negatively impact local economies, the Korean government announced two strict air quality mitigation policies in 2019. We develop a regional static computable general equilibrium model to simulate the economic and environmental impacts of these polices under alternative hypothetical scenarios. We separate two regions, Chungcheongnam-do, the most polluted region, and the rest of the country, in our model. As policy options, we introduce a regional development tax and a tradable market for PM emission permits, similar to an air pollution tax and a carbon permits market, respectively. The results show that allowing higher tax rates and a tradable permits market gives the optimal combination, with the PM2.5 emissions reduced by 2.35% without sacrificing economic growth. Since alternative options present, for example, a 0.04% loss of gross domestic product to reduce PM emissions by the same amount, our results here may present a new policy paradigm for managing air pollutants such as PM2.5. © 2020 by the authors.

In a scheme with high pressure on the environment, solar power appears as an opportunity for nonrenewable energy expenditure reduction and emissions elimination. In Spain, new legislation that eliminates old taxes associated with solar energy production, a drop in the cost of solar photovoltaic modules, and higher values of irradiance has converted solar powered water systems into one of the trendiest topics in the water industry. One alternative to store energy (compulsory in standalone photovoltaic systems) when managing pressurized urban water networks is the use of head tanks (tanks accumulate water during the day and release it at night). This work intends to compare the pressurized network running as a standalone system and a hybrid solution that incorporates solar energy supply and electricity grids.

Information and technology advancements, aided by predictive tools, can optimize this energy demand and help reduce harmful carbon emissions. Out of the multiple factors governing the energy consumption and comfort of buildings, indoor room temperature is a critical one, as it envisages the need for regulating the temperature. This paper aims to propose a mathematical model for short-term forecasting of indoor room temperature in the Indian context to optimize energy consumption and reduce carbon emissions in the environment. Design/methodology/approach: A study is conducted to forecast the indoor room temperature of an Indian corporate building structure, based upon various external environmental factors: temperature and rainfall and internal factors like cooling control, occupancy behavior and building characteristics. Expert insight and principal component analysis are applied for appropriate variables selection. The machine learning approach using Box–Jenkins time series models is used for the forecasting of indoor room temperature. Findings: ARIMAX model, with lagged forecasted and explanatory variables, is found to be the best-fit model. A predictive short-term hourly temperature forecasting model is developed based upon ARIMAX model, which yields fairly accurate results for data set pertaining to the building conditions and climatic parameters in the Indian context. Results also investigate the relationships between the forecasted and individual explanatory variables, which are validated using theoretical proofs. Research limitations/implications: The models considered in this research are Box–Jenkins models, which are linear time series models. There are non-linear models, such as artificial neural network models and deep learning models, which can be a part of this study. The study of hybrid models including combined forecasting techniques comprising linear and non-linear methods is another important area for future scope of study. As this study is based on a single corporate entity, the models developed need to be tested further for robustness and reliability. Practical implications: Forecasting of indoor room temperature provides essential practical information about meeting the in-future energy demand, that is, how much energy resources would be needed to maintain the equilibrium between energy consumption and building comfort. In addition, this forecast provides information about the prospective peak usage of air-conditioning controls within the building indoor control management system through a feedback control loop. The resultant model developed can be adopted for smart buildings within Indian context. Social implications: This study has been conducted in India, which has seen a rapid surge in population growth and urbanization. Being a developing country, India needs to channelize its energy needs judiciously by minimizing the energy wastage and reducing carbon emissions. This study proposes certain pre-emptive measures that help in minimizing the consumption of available energy resources as well as reducing carbon emissions that have significant impact on the society and environment at large. Originality/value: A large number of factors affecting the indoor room temperature present a research challenge for model building. The paper statistically identifies the parameters influencing the indoor room temperature forecasting and their relationship with the forecasted model. Considering Indian climatic, geographical and building structure conditions, the paper presents a systematic mathematical model to forecast hourly indoor room temperature for next 120 h with fair degree of accuracy. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Auto-regressive moving average Box–Jenkins models; Energy efficiency; Indoor room temperature forecasting; Machine learning; Time series forecasting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079755952

This paper proposes a bi-level low-carbon optimal dispatch model for the P2G plant within the power and natural gas markets. The upper-level model presents the optimal dispatch strategy of the P2G plant with a multi-operation-state model of methane reactor (MR) and a multi-mode model of hydrogen storage (HS). The lower level aims at maximizing social benefits, considering the operational constraints of power and natural gas networks and market clearing. In addition, carbon trading is further considered in both levels to characterize the function of the P2G plant in the low-carbon economy. In the model solution, the optimal condition of the lower-level model can be expressed by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and then the bi-level optimization model is transformed into a mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC).

While tailoring the electronic structure of active components to modulate their intrinsic reactivity could tune the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), their use is limited by the linear scaling relation of intermediates. Due to the high susceptibility of the CO2RR to the local CO2 concentration/pH and mass transportation of CO2/intermediates/products near the gas-solid-liquid three-phase interface, engineering catalysts' morphological and interfacial properties holds great promise to regulate the CO2RR, which are irrelevant with linear scaling relation and possess high resistance to harsh reaction conditions. Herein, we provide a comprehensive overview of recent advances in tuning CO2 reduction electrocatalysis via morphology and interface engineering. The fundamentals of the CO2RR and design principles for electrode materials are presented firstly. Then, approaches to build an efficient three-phase interface, tune the surface wettability, and design a favorable morphology are summarized; the relationship between the properties of engineered catalysts and their CO2RR performance is highlighted to reveal the activity-determining parameters and underlying catalytic mechanisms.

Information is lacking on how increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations in seawater could impact seaweeds in wild harvest situations. This study focuses on a mixed unattached loose-lying red algal community of Furcellaria lumbricalis in close association with Coccotylus truncatus that is found in the West Estonian Archipelago Sea, NE Baltic Sea. In Estonian coastal waters, the wild harvest of F. lumbricalis started in 1960s and it has since been used as raw material for furcellaran production. The aim of this study was to determine how ocean acidification may impact the balance of these two red algal species in the community. Mechanistic assessment of the carbon physiology of F. lumbricalis and C. truncatus was used to predict productivity and competitive interactions between these species in a high-CO2 world. Carbon use strategies in macroalgae were determined by analysing the natural abundances of carbon isotopes (δ13C), pH drift experiments and photosynthesis vs. dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) curves. Photosynthesis of F. lumbricalis (operating with a CO2 concentrating mechanism or CCM) performed worse along the broader range of DIC concentrations compared to C. truncatus (non-CCM), especially those characterized under future climate conditions. Therefore, changing seawater carbon chemistry through ocean acidification has the potential to influence the balance of F. lumbricalis and C. truncatus in the community and the efficiency of the wild harvest of this community and the quality of product provided. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Brackish water; Carbon dioxide; Carbon physiology; Coccotylus truncatus; Furcellaria lumbricalis; Ocean acidification; Rhodophyta",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074499104

Rolling data indicate that 257,3605 people are infected by the disease, from which 701,838 have recovered and 178,562 have died. No specific medicine or vaccine is available yet to control the disease, hence, social distancing via lockdown is widely adopted as the only preventive measure. Social distancing is observed at different level of strictness in different counties but it almost made the world to stands still. Although scientific articles on this largest social move are scanty, it resulted in benefiting the deteriorated environment to revive back. Many environmental indices such as lowering NO2 and CO2 emissions and reduction in particulate matters in air as a result of less human activities have led to clean air and pollution free water in many countries. Undoubtedly, the world was experiencing pollution in several countries due to mainly human activities including urbanization, industrialization, fossil fuel exhaustion etc. Under such situation a special (natural) a protective measure was awaited to fix environmental issues. Probably, the lockdown is one of the natural effects expected by nature via introduction of COVID-19. It is because, introduction of COVID-19 to nature was an outcome of mutation from two of its pre-existing forms, although, debate on it is still continuing. Viability of CoV-19 virus found to have a lot of correlation with aquatic and terrestrial environmental parameters such as pH, surface type, temperature etc. Air pollution is found to increase the risk of COVID-19 infection, therefore, use of mask and alcohols based standard sterilisers is strongly recommended.

Environmental (GHG emissions, using the CO2ZW tool) and economic (operating and investment costs and climate change externalities) indicators were determined and analysed per ton of MSW treated, based on field work and national data. An analysis was made of six scenarios of transitions of MSW management and treatment via wet processes (composting and mechanical biological treatment – MBT), dry routes (recycling and incineration) and disposal in sanitary landfills (DSL). The most eco-efficient scenario for Brazil and the municipalities with the largest populations, such as São Paulo and Sorocaba, corresponded to: 70% composting and 30% DSL for wet MSW and; 70% recycling and 30% DSL for dry MSW. In the smaller municipalities such as Humaitá, Piedade and Santa Cruz do Sul, the best results in TEE were: 42% composting and 58% DSL for wet MSW and; 41% recycling and 59% DSL for dry MSW. The scenarios showing the lowest TEE performance were MBT and incineration, due to the high costs of these technologies in Brazil. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cities; Climate change; CO2ZW; Developing countries; Economic impacts; Life cycle assessment","Climate change; Developing countries; Digital subscriber lines; Economics; Efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Life cycle; Recycling; Shotcreting; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Cities; CO2ZW; Economic impacts; Ghg emission mitigations; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mechanical-biological treatment; Mitigation strategy; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083001486

Field observation results showed that AWD irrigation was found to reduce the total seasonal methane (CH4) emission by 22.3% to 56.2% compared with CF while maintaining rice yield. By using the observed two-year field data, validation of the DNDC-Rice model was conducted for CF and AWD practices. The model overestimated rice grain yield by 24% and 29% in CF and AWD, respectively, averaged over the rice-growing seasons compared to observed values. The simulated seasonal CH4 emissions for CF were 6.4% lower and 4.2% higher than observed values and for AWD were 9.3% and 12.7% lower in the summer and monsoon season, respectively. The relative deviation of simulated seasonal nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from observed emissions in CF were 27% and −35% and in AWD were 267% and 234% in the summer and monsoon season, respectively. Although the DNDC-Rice model reasonably estimated the total CH4 emission in CF and reproduced the mitigation effect of AWD treatment on CH4 emissions well, the model did not adequately predict the total N2O emission under water-saving irrigation. In terms of global warming potential (GWP), nevertheless there was a good agreement between the simulated and observed values for both CF and AWD irrigations due to smaller contributions of N2O to the GWP compared with that of CH4. This study showed that the DNDC-Rice model could be used for the estimation of CH4 emissions, the primary source of GWP from double-cropping paddy rice under different water management conditions in the tropical regions. © 2020 by the authors.

Gorodovikov, 11 Pushkin Str., Elista, 358000, Russian Federation","A growing anthropogenic impact on the environment and an increase in the deficit of drinking water are the most priority and global issues of today. Water deficit is especially relevant in densely populated regions; its main reason is anthropopressing both on the biosphere as a whole and on its individual components. In particular, processes such as population growth, climate change, global warming, droughts, intensive use of chemicals in the farm, mining, etc. lead to the strengthening of existing environmental problems, have a critical impact on nature, disrupt ecosystem processes. And as a result – a deterioration in the quality of the hydrosphere as a whole and a catastrophic shortage of drinking water in particular. Therefore, minimising the anthropogenic load and improving the technology of water treatment are priority in solving such a global issue. An unprecedented stress factor for the environment is climate change on the planet, as a result of which there is an increase in the gap between the demand and supply for drinking water. The global consequences of this process are manifested in the form of extreme weather events, in particular, lack of precipitation due to rising temperatures. Therefore, a new archetype is needed today, the introduction of which would not only prevent further damage to aquatic ecosystems, but also emphasise the point that wastewater is also a resource and, therefore, should be used in the interests of efficient crop production and solving water security problems in the future. The article analyses the necessity for a paradigm shift in wastewater management, from “treatment for disposal” to “treatment for reuse”. The study provides a new understanding of the economics of water use applicable to steppe regions that seek to regenerate water as much as possible and thus obtain a valuable asset and maximise recovery of resources. © Rushing Water Publishers Ltd. 2020.","Irrigation; Nanotechnology; Reverse osmosis; Ultrafiltration; Wastewater treatment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089819923

Using a regional climate model, through the dynamic downscaling approach, present and future climate data were generated at a 2 km spatial resolution. The pseudo-global warming downscaling approach under the A1B scenario was adopted for future climate prediction. Then, the optimized SWAT model, driven by the present and future climate data, was executed. The following results were obtained: (1) the significant increase of precipitation in May and June and decrease in August in the future climate scenario, and consequent discharge from the target watersheds also increased in May and June and decreased in August and September; (2) Due to the change in discharge, nitrate-nitrogen loads of the Kiso, Nagara, and Ibi rivers also increased in May and June and decreased in August and September; and (3) While nitrate-nitrogen load from deciduous forest tends to decrease, the one from evergreen forest tends to increase. The response of the model indicated the possibility of an increase in nitrogen uptake by deciduous forests. © 2020, The Japanese Society of Limnology.","Climate change; Ise bay; Nitrate load; SWAT","climate change; climate effect; deciduous forest; nitrate; nitrogen; soil and water assessment tool; spatial resolution; watershed; Honshu; Ise Bay; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085108984

Relatively better performing RCM runs are then used to assess projected precipitation changes (for the period 2071–2099 relative to 1977–2005) over the study domain under the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario. The performance of RCMs is found to be descriptor and scope specific. Overall, RCA4 (r1i1p1) forced by CNRM-CERFACS-CNRM-CM5 and MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR, REMO2009 (r1i1p1) forced by MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR, and RCA4 (r2i1p1) forced by MPI-M-MPI-ESM-LR emerge as the top four RCM runs. We show that an ensemble mean of the top four model runs outperforms an ensemble mean of 24 model simulations and ensemble means for all runs in an RCM. Our analysis of projections shows a reduction (increase) in mean daily precipitation for MAM(OND), an increase(decrease) in CDD(CWD) events, and a general increase in SDII and the width of the right tail of the precipitation distribution (99p–90p). An increase in SDII and 99p–90p implies a possibility of occurrence of heavy and extreme precipitation incidences by the end of the twenty-first century.

The uneven distribution of tree cover in urban areas and subsequently the ecosystem services and benefits it provides has potential implications related to environmental justice, especially if disadvantaged socio-demographic or socio-economic and marginalized communities lack these services and benefits. This study explores the distribution of ecosystem services and benefits provided by tree cover in the Bronx, NY. Utilizing census block group specific spatial datasets, we employ a Mann-Kendall trend test and the Sen slope estimator to describe the relationship between median income, per capita income, percent minorities, population density, poverty percent and total educational attainment, and carbon storage and sequestration, stormwater runoff reduction, air pollutant removal and heat index reduction ecosystem services and benefits for 2010 tree cover conditions. We explore the equality in ecosystem service and benefit distributions across socio-demographic and socio-economic subgroups using the Atkinson inequality and Theil entropy indices decomposed into within and between subgroup inequalities for each ecosystem service and benefit. These inequality indices allow us to better assess current inequalities and work to achieve greater equity in the distribution of ecosystem services. Using population and ecosystem service data, all ecosystem services and benefits appear to be unequally and inequitably distributed in the Bronx, with disadvantaged socio-demographic and socio-economic block groups receiving disproportionately lower ecosystem services from urban trees. The vast majority of the inequality is explained by variations within each socio-demographic and socio-economic subgroup rather than variations between subgroups. To reduce this inequity, efforts should be made to strategically increase services and benefits by initially targeting disadvantaged block groups with extremely low tree cover. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Benefits; Ecosystem services; Environmental justice; Equality; Equity","carbon storage; census; demography; ecosystem service; environmental justice; forest ecosystem; pollutant removal; poverty; public health; socioeconomic conditions; urban forestry; wastewater; Bronx County; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085919701

This paper reports on the results of a qualitative cross-cultural research collaboration about climate change adaptation for the Arabana, an Indigenous people from South Australia. We find that the Arabana people have a corpus of observed historical knowledge of climate change, forged through a sustained period of colonial invasion, that offers fine level detail about likely climate impacts that is not captured by regional scientific projections. This knowledge includes actual observations about recent climate variability, as well as changes to flora, fauna, land and cultural sites. This historical knowledge about and observation of the environment is as important to the Arabana people as ancestral traditional knowledge for informing the contemporary climate change policy that affects them and their surroundings. Arabana knowledge sets about climate change and its impacts were also found to be intimately interconnected with other regional socio-economic activities (such as pastoralism and mining) which are the legacy of colonisation, and cannot be divorced from cultural perceptions and discussions about climate impacts. We conclude that in order to forge appropriate responses to the impacts of climate change, dialogues between policy makers and the Arabana needs to acknowledge the legitimacy of all Arabana knowledge, particularly historical knowledge that has been grafted through colonial dispossession. © 2020 The Authors","Adaptation; Agency; Climate; Colonisation; Indigenous; Scale","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; colonization; cultural relations; ethnic group; governance approach; indigenous knowledge; indigenous population; perception; Australia; South Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086430847

However, upstream climate control on sediment supply and discharge variability causes fluvial incision and aggradation as well. Orbital forcing often regulates climate change at 10 to 500 kyr timescales while tectonic processes such as flexural (un)loading exert a dominant control at timescales longer than 500 kyr. It remains challenging to attribute fluvial incision and aggradation to upstream or downstream processes or disentangle allogenic from autogenic forcing, because time control is mostly limited in fluvial successions. The Palaeocene outcrops of the fluvial Lebo Shale Member in north-eastern Montana (Williston Basin, USA) constitute an exception. This study uses a distinctive tephra layer and two geomagnetic polarity reversals to create a 15 km long chronostratigraphic framework based on the correlation of twelve sections. Three aggradation–incision sequences are identified with durations of approximately 400 kyr, suggesting a relation with long-eccentricity. This age control further reveals that incision occurred during the approach of – or during – a 405 kyr long-eccentricity minimum. A long-term relaxation of the hydrological cycle related to such an orbital phasing potentially exerts an upstream climate control on river incision. Upstream, an expanding vegetation cover is expected because of an increasingly constant moisture supply to source areas. Entrapping by vegetation led to a significantly reduced sediment supply relative to discharge, especially at times of low evapotranspiration. Hence, high discharges resulted in incision. This study assesses the long-eccentricity regulated climate control on fluvial aggradation and incision in a new aggradation–incision sequence model. © 2020 The Authors.

However, practical application of such a photocatalytic system requires significant efforts for improved CO2 photoreduction performance and product selectivity. Thus, in the present work, CuO nanoparticles were combined with Nb2O5 in order to improve the photocatalytic properties of these semiconductors in the CO2 photoreduction process. Nb2O5/CuO heterojunctions were prepared via a solvothermal treatment method, while the experimental tools, such as FESEM, HRTEM, and DRS, were employed to evaluate the microstructural and electronic properties. We describe how CuO decoration over Nb2O5 adjusts its selectivity for CO2 reduction to CH4, HCOOH, or H3CCOOH in different contents. An investigation of CO2 photoreduction using different electron donors/scavengers (water, sodium oxalate, and potassium bromate) under ultraviolet radiation revealed that its decoration influences local CO production by modifying the selectivity. CO has been confirmed as the main intermediate for HCOOH and CH3COOH production, and CO2 reduction efficiency increases at low CuO content (2.5% wt), leading to the formation of soluble hydrocarbons, and increases for CH4 in higher amounts (10% wt).

Meanwhile, the Afvalzorg model determines the LFG emissions using the Methane correction factor, yearly waste mass disposal, waste composition, Degradation Organic Carbon, CH4 generation rate constant, LFG recovery efficiency. The findings indicated that the CH4 and CO2 emitted from the landfill estimated from LandGEM will peak in the year 2026 at 3517 Mg/yr and 9649 Mg/yr, respectively. Results from the Afvalzorg model showed that CH4 emission will peak in the year 2026 (3336 Mg/yr). The LandGEM model showed that the total LFG, CH4 and CO2 emitted from the landfill between 2005 and 2040 are 293239.3 Mg/yr, 78325.7 Mg/yr, and 214908.6 Mg/yr, respectively. The simulation from the Afvalzorg model found that the CH4 emitted from the years 2005–2040 was 74302 Mg/yr.

However, in water-scarce countries, irrigation management frequently becomes a complex task. Deficit irrigation and the use of non-conventional water resources (e.g., wastewater, brackish groundwater) has been adopted in many cases as part of a climate change mitigation measures to tackle the water poverty issue.

The Lo Gam domain being part of the NE Vietnam, hosts the Lang Vai gold district, a several Pb–Zn deposits, and the recently discovered super-large W-Bi-Cu-F (Au) Nui Phao deposit. The Nui Phao deposit is 87.9 Mt at 0.19% WO3, 7.95% CaF2, 0.18% Cu, 0.19 g/t Au, and 0.09% Bi, while the measured resource is 25.1 Mt at 0.25% WO3, 8.4% CaF2, 0.23% Cu, 0.26 g/t Au, and 0.108% Bi. The Nui Phao deposit is a very interesting object for research due to location of the orebodies between of two granite massifs of the Cretaceous (Da Lien) and Triassic (Nui Phao) age. Consequently, the temporal and genetic relationships of mineralization with a certain magmatic events are unclear. Here we present mineralogical, compositional, and geochronological data of the Nui Phao deposit in conjunction with physical-chemical researches to understand the ore genesis and its genetic link to a certain magmatic events. According to our observations, at least three different mineral associations are distinguished at the Nui Phao deposit, which include greisens, skarns, and quartz-sulfide ore. Skarn and sulfide ore mineral assemblages generally contain abundant scheelite associated with pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite, and native bismuth. The greisens consist of fluorite, muscovite, and rare molybdenite. The results of fluid inclusions study indicate that at the Nui Phao deposit the initial ore-forming fluid was represented by the reduced (CO2-CH4)–H2O–NaCl(CaCl2) system characterized by high temperatures and moderate salinities. The fluid boiling is the dominant mechanism for ore deposition at the Nui Phao deposit. Relatively homogeneous isotopic compositions of oxygen (δ18OH2O = +6.73 to +9.24‰) and sulfur (δ34S = +1.6 to +3.5‰) that closely correspond to magmatic source, suggest that the ore-forming fluid was generated from cooling granite pluton without contribution meteoric water. The systematic studies of scheelite composition show that ΣREE contents decrease from early to late scheelite generations, which suggest gradual REE depletion of the ore-forming fluid without significant fractionation between LREE, MREE, and HREE. The REEs of scheelite are mainly controlled by the substitution mechanisms Ca2++W6+ ↔ REE3+ + Nb5+ and 3Ca2+ = 2REE3+ + □(Ca). By combining REE features, Y/Ho ratios and other characteristics of the Nui Phao deposit, we propose a single magmatic source for hydrothermal ore-firming fluids without fluid mixing; a significantly contribution of material during fluid/rock interaction is also unlikely. The combination of mineralogical and geochemical features as well as complex studies of the formation conditions allowed us to conclude that gold at the Nui Phao deposit occur as impurities in the native bismuth. The ages of the Da Lien and Nui Phao granite massifs and the Nui Phao deposit have been estimated to be ca. 84 Ma (Ar-Ar), 244 Ma (U-Pb) and ca. 85 Ma (Ar-Ar), respectively, indicating a genetic relationship between the mineralization and the Cretaceous magmatic event. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","40Ar/39Ar dating; Bi melt; Da Lien; Fluid inclusions; Lo Gam domain; Northeast Vietnam; Nui Phao; REEs in scheelite; S-O isotopes; U-Pb dating","Binary alloys; Bismuth compounds; Calcium fluoride; Copper compounds; Deposits; Fluorspar; Geochemistry; Geochronology; Gold compounds; Gold deposits; Granite; Isotopes; Mica; Mineralogy; Molybdenum compounds; Ores; Sodium chloride; Sulfur compounds; Tungstate minerals; Zinc compounds; Dominant mechanism; Fluid/rock interaction; Formation condition; Genetic relationships; Geochemical features; Isotopic composition; Mineral associations; Substitution mechanisms; Fluorine compounds; age determination; argon-argon dating; bismuth; fluid inclusion; geochemistry; geochronology; gold; magmatism; mineralization; oxygen isotope; rare earth element; scheelite; sulfur isotope; uranium-lead dating; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084523220

Mitigation must be about grasping the need for decoupling fossil fuel use from GDP and data indicates this is underway. Cities like Shanghai and Beijing are showing how emerging cities can decouple wealth and car use. Disruptive innovations underway are solar and wind power, batteries, and electrifying transport but need planning tools to mainstream them. Emerging disruptive innovations include Trackless Trams that function like light rail but at significantly less cost and Hydrogen in fuel-cell vehicles for heavy transport and as an industrial fuel.

While distancing measures can safeguard public health, they also can profoundly impact the economy and may have important indirect effects on the environment. The extent to which physical distancing measures should be applied therefore depends on the trade-offs between their health benefits and their economic costs. We develop an epidemiological-economic model to examine the optimal duration and intensity of physical distancing measures aimed to control the spread of COVID-19. In an application to the United States, our model considers the trade-off between the lives saved by physical distancing—both directly from stemming the spread of the virus and indirectly from reductions in air pollution during the period of physical distancing—and the short- and long-run economic costs that ensue from such measures. We examine the effect of air pollution co-benefits on the optimal physical distancing policy and conduct sensitivity analyses to gauge the influence of several key parameters and uncertain model assumptions. Using recent estimates of the association between airborne particulate matter and the virulence of COVID-19, we find that accounting for air pollution co-benefits can significantly increase the intensity and duration of the optimal physical distancing policy. To conclude, we broaden our discussion to consider the possibility of durable changes in peoples’ behavior that could alter local markets, the global economy, and our relationship to nature for years to come. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Air pollution; Co-benefits; COVID-19; Optimal control; Physical distancing; Social distancing","Air pollution; Costs; Disease control; Economics; Public health; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Viruses; Airborne particulate matters; Disease spread; Economic costs; Economic modeling; Global economies; Health benefits; Indirect effects; Uncertain modeling; Economic and social effects; atmospheric pollution; cost analysis; disease spread; economic conditions; particulate matter; public health; virus; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089036001

Their functioning conditions reveal often several contaminations. The Cheria carbonate aquifer (NE Algeria) has never had management tools to deal with the pollution of this resource. The outlining and protection of the vulnerable areas are essential to ensure the water purity and the consumer health. Based on the EPIK multicriteria analysis method, we aim in our study to assess the karstic aquifers intrinsic-vulnerability to contamination in the Cheria Plateau. This method has been already applied for contamination problems in Northeast Algeria. It uses a conceptual scheme that considers epikarst, protective cover, infiltration, and karst network as parameters. In addition, it also uses the interpolation of the geophysics data to define the conditioning attributes. The resulting vulnerability map categorizes all the basin vulnerable areas and the groundwater protection zones. Nearly 30% of the study area was judged as highly vulnerable to anthropogenic pollution, whereas around 10% is moderately vulnerable. These results confirm that the karst aquifer of the Cheria Plateau is severely polluted by chemical pesticides resulting from farming activity. In addition to the surrounding agricultural lands, the underground of Cheria city was found as extremely vulnerable to pollution (F < 19). Our study delimited boundaries for the karst aquifer protection zones and for an integrated resource management in this region. It recommends applying this method for comparable problems. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Drinking water resource; Epikarst; Infiltration conditions; Karst network; Protective cover","anthropogenic effect; aquifer pollution; assessment method; climate conditions; karst hydrology; multicriteria analysis; numerical method; pollution control; semiarid region; vulnerability; Algeria; Cheria Basin; Middle East; North Africa; Tebessa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088369539

As one of the oldest regions of UOG activity in the United States, this area has experienced significant land-use changes, specifically development of natural habitat and agricultural land for gas infrastructure. In recent years, drilling of new wells has stopped and production has declined. By 2017, 1038 wells had ceased production and been abandoned, which makes them eligible for land reclamation. However, most of these sites (80%) have not been reclaimed and continue to cause losses in ecosystem services. If reclamation was performed on lands associated with abandoned infrastructure, we estimate more than $2 million USD annually in agricultural, timber, and carbon sequestration values would be gained. These benefits far outweigh the costs of reclamation, especially since the benefits accrue over time and reclamation is a short-term cost. Our estimates indicate a 2–4 year break-even time period when cumulative ecosystem services benefits will outweigh reclamation costs. We predicted a well-abandonment rate of 155 per year until 2050 when 98% of wells will be abandoned, which indicates great potential for future ecosystem services restoration. Thus, we recommend that Arkansans at the government and citizen level work to restore lands impacted by UOG development in the Fayetteville Shale region so that their value to landowners and society can be recovered, which will enhance long-term economic and environmental benefits. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Agriculture; Climate regulation; Ecosystem services; Fayetteville Shale; Reclamation; Shale gas","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Cost benefit analysis; Ecosystems; Infill drilling; Land reclamation; Land use; Reclamation; Restoration; Shale; Agricultural land; Carbon sequestration; Economic and environmental benefits; Ecosystem services; Shale formation; Short-term costs; Unconventional oil and gas; Well abandonment; Abandoned wells; abandoned land; agricultural land; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; land reclamation; land use change; restoration ecology; agricultural land; Arkansas; Article; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; ecosystem; ecosystem restoration; environmental reclamation; gas field; government; land use; loblolly pine; Oklahoma; pastureland; plantation; United States; agriculture; Arkansas; ecosystem; oil and gas field; Arkansas; Fayetteville; United States; natural gas; Agriculture; Arkansas; Ecosystem; Natural Gas; Oil and Gas Fields; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085989033

Non-woven thermoplastic veil interleaves have been modified by spray deposition with a GNP dispersion to give either a continuous or strip-patterned distribution. The coated interleaves were used to modify the interlaminar region of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates. The fracture surfaces were characterised by scanning electron and optical microscopy. The continuous GNP distribution in mode I prevented the formation of carbon fibre bridging, resulting in similar initiation and propagation values. In mode II, the increased thickness of the interlaminar region, coupled with the uneven fracture surface showed the highest increase in the mode II ILFT for the continuous GNP distribution. The strip-patterned GNP distribution showed reduced carbon fibre bridging compared to the baseline CFRP and thermoplastic interleave laminates. This may be due to small scale fibre bridging between the deposited GNP-strips which also lead to peaks and troughs in the load-displacement response. In mode II, it is suggested that the deposited GNP-strips were sufficiently tough to re-direct the propagating crack from the modified interlaminar region to the adjacent ply. © 2020 The Authors","Carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP); Graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs); Interlaminar fracture toughness (ILFT); Modified interleave; Spray deposition; Toughening","Bridge decks; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Deposits; Fracture toughness; Graphene; Laminated composites; Platelets; Reinforcement; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Composite laminate; Initiation and propagation; Load-displacement response; Mode ii interlaminar fracture toughness; Patterned distribution; Scanning electrons; Thermoplastic veils; Carbon fibers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085728539

However, magmatic pre-enrichment linked to the igneous processes at the origin of carbonatites are likely to contribute to the REE fertilisation. Experimental constraints reveals that immiscibility processes between carbonate and silicate melts can lead to both REE enrichments and depletions in carbonatites making the magmatic processes controlling REE enrichments unclear. We link REE contents of carbonatites to the magmatic stage at which carbonatites are separated from silicate magma in their course of differentiation. We present results of experiments made at pressure and temperature conditions of alkaline magmas and associated carbonatites differentiation (0.2–1.5 GPa; 725–975 °C; FMQ to FMQ + 2.5), simultaneously addressing crystal fractionation of alkaline magmas and immiscibility between carbonate (calcio-carbonate type) and silicate melts (nephelinite to phonolite type). The experimental data shows that the degree of differentiation, controlling the chemical composition of alkaline melts, is a key factor ruling the REE concentration of the coexisting immiscible carbonate melts. In order to predict carbonate melt REE enrichments during alkaline magma differentiation, we performed a parameterisation of experimental data on immiscible silicate and carbonate melts, based exclusively on the silica content, the alumina saturation index and the alkali/alkaline-earth elements ratio of silicate melts. This parameterisation is applied to more than 1600 geochemical data of silicate magmas from various alkaline provinces (East African Rift, Canary and Cape Verde Islands) and show that REE concentrations of their potential coeval carbonatite melts can reach concentration ranges similar to those of highly REE enriched carbonatites (∑REE > 30 000 ppm) by immiscibility with phonolitic/phono-trachytic melt compositions, while more primitive alkaline magmas can only be immiscible with carbonatites that are not significantly enriched in REE. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Alkaline magma; Carbonatite; Immiscibility processes; Magma differentiation; Rare earth elements","alkalinity; carbonatite; chemical composition; enrichment; experimental study; igneous geochemistry; immiscibility; magmatic differentiation; P-T conditions; rare earth element; Canary Islands; Cape Verde [Macaronesia]; East African Rift; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085329827

The study aims to determine how an industrial application might affect air pollution levels in the urban area of that city. Different types of PM10 emission sources at the plant were analyzed to determine their contribution to the overall PM10 level. The main concern of the study was to define whether the PM10 emission from the plant produced any air quality effects on the nearby hospital and downtown area. According to the modeling result, the maximum daily PM10 concentration was observed mostly in the southern part of the plant. The highest daily downwind PM10 was estimated to be 286.3 μg m−3, while the annual mean of downwind PM10 concentration was estimated to be 72.6 μg m−3. It was found that the highest PM10 was emitted from the line source (282.2 μg m−3)—located at the south and southwest of the plant—that has been continuously used for hauling raw materials to the cement plant. In this study, the hauling roads (as a line source) were the hot-spot at the plant and needed serious maintenance for the reduction of PM10 emissions from the plant. In the study area, a sensitive community state facility was subject to be considered an environmental concern since the central hospital complex was located nearby the PM10 source. For this purpose, the American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD) was followed to determine whether the plant caused any severe PM10 effect on the central hospital. The results indicate that the maximum hourly PM10 concentrations were predicted as 20 μg m−3 for the central hospital area. Overall, the modeled PM10 concentrations from the source at different time scales and locations did not exceed the national air quality limits in the area. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AERMET; AERMOD; HYSPLIT; OpenAir","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Hospitals; Air quality impacts; Air quality modeling; American meteorological societies; Atmospheric dispersion; Different time scale; Environmental concerns; Industrial sources; PM10 concentration; Particles (particulate matter); air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; numerical model; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; satellite data; satellite imagery; air pollution; air quality; Article; atmospheric dispersion; cement industry; community; concentration (parameter); environmental impact; hospital; meteorological phenomena; particulate matter; prediction; urban area; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; turkey (bird); Turkey; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088641281

In order for food production systems to remain viable and resilient under a changing climate, novel approaches, which integrate risk management (i.e. adaptation) and risk transfer strategies, such as insurance, are required. We argue that the coordinated integration of risk management and risk transfer approaches will support greater resilience of food production systems under climate change. Conversely, if risk management and risk transfer strategies are not carefully integrated, there is potential to undermine adaptive capacity (e.g. insurance subsidies may dissuade farmers from investing in climate adaptation) and ultimately reduce the capacity of food production systems to cope with and recover from the adverse impacts of climate change. Here we propose a resilience-based conceptual framework for integrating risk management and risk transfer strategies along with four key principles, which we believe could underlie their successful integration and thus enhance food production system resilience under climate change. These are as follows: (1) pro-active investments in farmer climate adaptation rather than re-active disaster relief, (2) structuring of government subsidies around insurance and climate disaster relief to incentivise farmer climate adaptation, (3) rewarding farmer efforts towards climate adaptation with cheaper insurance premiums for those farmers that invest resources into climate adaptation and (4) recognising investments in the integration of farm climate adaptation and risk transfer schemes within the broader context of future climate disaster risk management and global food security.

In the southern High Plains of USA, buffer strips of perennial grasses alternating with cultivated corn strips were introduced in center-pivot irrigated crop fields to increase agronomic production and ecosystem services. A study was conducted to evaluate soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and soil health benefits of integrating circular grass buffer strips in the center-pivot irrigated corn production system. Multiple parameters were assessed in the grass buffer strips, and at distances of 1.52, 4.57, and 9.14 m away from the edges of grass strips in corn strips. While grasses in the buffer strips depleted N compared to corn strips, potential C mineralization (PCM) was 52.5% to 99.9% more in grass strips than in corn strips. Soil microbial biomass C (MBC) content was 36.7% to 52.5% greater in grass strips than in corn strips. Grass buffer also reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from corn strips. Grass buffer strips can improve soil health and sustainability in center-pivot irrigated cropping systems by increasing soil C components and reducing GHG emissions. © 2020 by the authors.","Grass buffer; Nutrient cycling; Soil organic carbon; Water conservation","agronomy; carbon dioxide; crop plant; cropping practice; ecosystem service; grass; greenhouse gas; irrigation system; nitrous oxide; soil carbon; soil degradation; soil nutrient; sustainability; Great Plains; United States; Poaceae; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089531434

This paper evaluates experiences from the application of a CCA planning methodology that leverages social learning as the main approach for local communities to plan and design their CCA strategies in Burkina Faso, Chile and Senegal. In each case, the paper analyses the key features of the emerging social learning processes during the application of the methodology, presents and analyses participants’ feedback and impressions of the process, as well as facilitators’ feedback on the strengths and weaknesses of the methodology. An engaging social learning process was demonstrated through observing varying levels of occurrence of seven features - the pooling of different fields and forms of knowledge amongst the participants; creation of joint language; reshaping of perceptions and preconceptions; transformation of attitudes and patterns of communications; redefining of roles in the learning process; establishment of common values and mutual trust building. The methodology was referred to as being simple, inclusive, helping create ownership and highly interactive, by facilitators who used it. While this research demonstrated the immediate and short-term impacts of social learning to be positive for the CCA planning process, longer term monitoring is needed to fully understand the opportunities and limitations of social learning for CCA planning. In doing so, it is important to recognise the project driven modalities of CCA for rural communities is a limitation in itself in truly benefiting from the long-term benefits of social learning. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change adaptation; Participatory tool; Social learning; Transdisciplinary research",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067265427

However, the advent and diffusion of alternative fuel vehicle technologies could result in vehicle transport becoming a major energy load in urban energy systems in addition to heating and electricity. The building and personal transport sectors both have a large potential for CO2 emissions reductions, however the energy must come from mainly renewable sources. In this work, a multi-objective optimisation model is developed that considers a multi-energy system and minimises both the total cost and life-cycle emissions of both the buildings and vehicles. The model selects both the conversion and storage technologies that the community uses to produce electricity and heat, as well as vehicle powertrain types. The resulting Pareto solutions rely on transitions away from internal combustion engine vehicles to battery electric vehicles, and to a much lesser extent plug-in hybrid vehicles. The heating energy is decarbonised with a transition to heat pumps and away from gas boilers. The optimisation model is tested with 77 vehicles and 50 buildings, and results shows that the emission reductions could be as high as 79% by 2035 and 85% by 2050. © 2020","Decentralised energy systems; Multi-objective optimisation; Power-to-Mobility; Renewable energy sources; Storage technologies","Battery electric vehicles; Emission control; Life cycle; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Urban transportation; Alternative fuel vehicles; Emissions reduction; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Life cycle emissions; Multi-energy systems; Optimisation models; Urban energy systems; Vehicle powertrains; Multiobjective optimization; alternative fuel; carbon emission; combustion; electric vehicle; electricity generation; energy planning; engine; heating; multiobjective programming; optimization; storage structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086095397

Climate change will have an impact on food availability and accessibility, thereby disrupting the food security and vulnerability of farmer households. This study aimed to: analyze the livelihood vulnerabilities, determine the food security level, and assess the livelihood vulnerability on the food security of upland rice farmer households against climate change. This study was conducted in Sidomulyo Sub-district, South Lampung District. The samples were randomly selected among farmers, resulting in 66 selected farmers. The analysis included: the livelihood vulnerability index– intergovernmental panel of climate change (LVI-IPCC), food security index based on the Indonesian Institute of Sciences, and the Ordinal Model Logit (Ologit). The results showed that the upland rice farmer’s household had a livelihood vulnerability of 0.071, belonged to the medium category. Most farmer households (77.27%) were categorized as food secure. The “secure” category in the food security index is obtained if the upland rice farmers fulfill three criteria includes food availability, food stability, and food sustainability. The strategy of climate change adaptation, rice price, and phonska fertilizer price affects the food security of farmers’ households.

Its impact however is not homogeneous across countries. Some studies show that urban populations have a higher carbon footprint due to higher consumption levels, whereas other research suggests that higher population density decreases energy demands and the associated emissions. Due to the importance of collecting in-depth evidence for countries and regions on a case-by-case basis, this article investigates the impact of urbanization on carbon dioxide emissions for Austria as supporting empirical evidence for a high-income economy. The study particularly unpacks profiles of carbon footprints for more than 8000 households located according to three different levels of urbanization: urban, semi-urban and rural. Findings reveal that urban residents in Austria have the lowest Carbon Footprint (CF) of the three groups; this is followed by rural and then semi-urban residents. Overall, the study highlights that urbanization in Austria may represent a relative reduction of emissions in the future due to more compact cities, which should be considered along with other drivers of greenhouse gas emissions in order to achieve national and European climate targets. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Austria; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Emission inequality; Input-output analysis; Urbanization","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Population statistics; Urban growth; Carbon dioxide emissions; Climate targets; Consumption levels; Energy demands; Population densities; Relative reduction; Urban and rural; Urban population; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083327700

This study firstly applied Life Cycle Assessment for evaluating the quantitative environmental impacts at the regional and national levels to facilitate the national policy decision on the expansion of organic rice cultivation areas. The impact categories of interest included global warming, terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, terrestrial ecotoxicity, and freshwater ecotoxicity, and the life cycle impact assessment method applied was ReCiPe. The results showed that the life cycle environmental impacts from organic rice cultivation in the nine provinces in the North were lower than those from the 12 provinces in the Northeast, due mainly to the higher yields and lower use of fertilizers in the former. The methane emissions in the North (11,147 kg CO2e/ha) were similar to those in the Northeast (11,378 kg CO2e/ha). However, nitrous oxide emissions in the Northeast were higher than in the North due to the higher amounts of fertilizer used. If Thailand expands the rice farming by 50% in the North and by 50% in the Northeast, the greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced from 11,400 to 11,100 kg CO2e/ha, but the impacts of terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, terrestrial ecotoxicity, and freshwater ecotoxicity could be increased by 0.0257 kg PO4e (95%), 0.508 kg 1,4-DBe (53%), and 33.1 kg 1,4-DBe (17%), respectively. To reduce the global warming as well as other environmental impacts, Thailand should expand rice farming areas to the North. This information could be useful for supporting the policy decisions on which areas the organic rice farming should be expanded in to minimize the potential life cycle environmental impacts. © 2020 by the authors.","Hom Mali rice; Life Cycle Assessment; Organic rice; Policy decision; Thailand","agricultural policy; carbon emission; cultivar; environmental impact assessment; fertilizer application; freshwater environment; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; organic farming; paddy farming; rice; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089378785

Primary household surveys (528 households in seven mouzas) are carried out to procure data on indicators of socio-demographic profile, livelihood strategies, health, food, water, social networks, natural disaster and climatic fluctuations. The data then have been processed by indices like livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) and livelihood vulnerability index-intergovernmental panel on climate change (LVI-IPCC) to evaluate and compare vulnerabilities of mouzas currently suffering from physical processes like coastal erosion, embankment breaching and flood events. The research outcome implies that Baliara and Iswaripur mouzas are highly vulnerable (LVI score > 0.600 and LVI-IPCC score > 0.170); Narayanpur, Mousuni, Kusumtala mouzas are moderately vulnerable (LVI score 0.540–0.600 and LVI-IPCC score 0.060–0.170); and Bagdanga, Patibania mouzas are least vulnerable (LVI score > 0.540 and LVI-IPCC score < 0.060) to changing climate phenomena. The foremost reasons behind higher vulnerability are greater exposure to climatic fluctuation, natural hazards and higher sensitivity to improper access to food, health, water and finally lower adaptive capacity in terms of poor socio-demographic profile and livelihood security. Findings of the study provide a deeper understanding of people’s perception, adaptation and their ever-increasing vulnerability to changing climate. This approach based on indicators emphasizes sectors that necessitate particular intercession to design management plans for threatened communities.

The investigations were conducted during the summer, 2018 to better characterize airborne VOC and their influence on O3 and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) formation. The average hourly total VOCs (TVOCs) concentration was 35 ± 21 ppbv which was mainly contributed by different alkanes (41%) followed by halohydrocarbons and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (31%), aromatics (16%), alkenes (9%), and alkyne (3%). The TVOCs concentration was in a similar range with the ones observed in other urban and suburban areas in China. Traffic had an important influence on the air quality in the study area as the diurnal variation of the trace gases depicted a bimodal distribution that coincides with the rush-hours. The O3 concentrations exceeded both the national and international air quality standards. The VOC:NOx was much higher than 8:1, indicating ambient air was NOx limited to atmospheric O3 formation, therefore, reduction of NOx concentration could reduce O3 formation rates more effectively. The average hourly ozone formation potential (OFP) of the VOCs was 218 μg m−3 and the major contributors to it were aromatics (43%) and alkenes (23%). The average hourly secondary organic aerosol formation potential (SOAFP) of the VOCs was 0.9 μg m−3. Similar to the OFP, aromatic VOCs were the major contributors to the total SOAFP. To improve the air quality in the study area traffic emissions as well as the aromatic and alkene VOCs emissions reduction are necessary. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","China; NOx; O3; SOA; Suburban; VOC","Aerosols; Air quality; Air quality standards; Aromatic compounds; Aromatization; Carbon monoxide; Emission control; Gases; Olefins; Ozone; Sulfur dioxide; Volatile organic compounds; Atmospheric trace gas; Bimodal distribution; China; Emissions reduction; Ozone formation potentials; Secondary organic aerosols; Suburban; Urban and suburban areas; Nitrogen oxides; aerosol; air quality; concentration (composition); nitrogen oxides; ozone; suburban area; sulfur compound; summer; volatile organic compound; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081391620

Recently, in developed countries, the majority of cities has grown rapidly and has experienced increasing environmental problems. In this article we analyze the effect of urban air pollution considering the available data for the years 2007, 2010 and 2013 in 24 German cities. Proposing a new model, we start the analysis using data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to predict eco-efficiency scores for the 24 German cities. Afterwards, it is applied fractional regression to infer about the influencing factors of the eco-efficiency scores, at the city level. Results suggest a significant impact over eco-efficiency due to the excess of PM10, the average temperature, the average of NO2 concentration and rainfall. The findings in this study hold important implications for policymakers and urban planners in Germany, especially those that coordinate environmental protection and economic development in cities. Therefore, interventions to reduce urban air pollution can be accomplished on different regulatory levels, leading to synergistic effects as the decrease of climate change effects and noise. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","(FRM); Air pollutants; Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA); Eco-Efficiency; Fractional Regression Models; German Cities; Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA)","Climate change; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Environmental protection; Regression analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Developed countries; Eco-efficiency analysis; Efficiency predictions; Environmental problems; Environmental risk factor; Stochastic frontier analysis; Synergistic effect; Urban air pollution; Air quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083492659

Research has focused on commercial crops, especially tree crops, for their potential to mitigate the impacts of climate change. In Brazil interest is growing in the commercial cultivation of macauba (Acrocomia aculeata), a palm native to the tropical regions of the American continents with fruit that can be used as the primary ingredient in the production of oils and bioenergy. However, we did not find any prior studies that had assessed macauba's carbon sequestration potential nor any exploration in the literature of the income generation potential for commercial macauba producers to sell carbon credits. In order to understand opportunities to commercialize carbon credits from macauba, research was needed on the palm's long-term carbon sequestration and stock capacity. In this study we measured the accumulation of carbon in commercially cultivated macauba's biomass both below and above-ground using a selection of plants of different ages. An assessment was also made of the crop's potential to generate carbon credits. Macauba plants were sampled in a nursery with seedlings aged 3 and 8 months, and with more mature plants cultivated in fields aged 1.6, 4.8, and 9 years. The samples were fully harvested by complete removal (including roots and above ground structures), followed by separation, quantification and carbon analysis of the different plant biomass components. The data obtained allowed for estimating the production of carbon credits and the resulting annual income. Findings indicated a differential distribution of both biomass and carbon below and above-ground in field-cultivated macauba palms. The stock of carbon in the plants aged 9 years reached 61.6 t C ha−1 with a corresponding sequestration of 226.17 t CO2 eq ha−1. The expected generation of carbon credits of palms from 1.6 to 9 years was 28.73 t CO2eq. ha− 1 per year, which could result in an annual gross income of € 761.06 per hectare. Significant amounts of stored carbon were found in both the above and below-ground biomass, suggesting that the macauba has significant potential to generate carbon credits and contribute to the mitigation of the effects of climate change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Acrocomia aculeata; Carbon market; Carbon Sequestration; Climate changes","Agricultural robots; Biomass; Climate change; Composting; Crops; Cultivation; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Forestry; Palm oil; Petroleum prospecting; Seed; Above and below-ground carbons; Carbon analysis; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sequestration potential; Commercial crops; Ecosystem services; Income generation; Tropical regions; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084363596

These maps, which show the breadth (who participated), depth (how), and objects (issue) of participation, can summarize large amounts of information on participation in just a few visualizations. For this study, these maps describe how communities organized to decrease the consumption of gas and electricity at the municipal and residential levels during the prize. Our results show that broader and deeper participation would not always lead to greater energy savings. Thus, instead of blindly aiming for higher participation to achieve better outcomes, results suggest that breadth, depth and objects of participation must be strategized based on the context and possibilities of the community, as well as the goals of the project. Maps do not only add transparency in decision-making processes by disclosing the who, how and on what of participation, but also facilitate the comparison of participatory efforts across process, communities and time. While the maps visualized participation that occurred in the past, the framework and method can be customized and used by governments, planners, community stakeholders, etc. in understanding, mapping and strategizing ongoing future participatory efforts in energy projects.

By using cyclic voltammetry, transitions in the composition of dissolved and surface-adsorbed species could be identified. At a highly negative potential [more negative than -1.2 V (vs RHE)], the formation of OD- and D2 is dominant, resulting in a relatively high concentration of dissolved carbonate, with a maximum IR intensity at ∼1410 cm-1. When the potential is less negative than -1.2 V, spectroscopically resolved interconversion of carbonate (CO32-) to bicarbonate (D)CO3- is evident, explained by a decrease in the local pH. Furthermore, adsorbed carbonate can now be distinguished from dissolved carbonate due to the strongly potential-dependent peak position of adsorbed carbonate ranging from ∼1510 to 1570 cm-1. In the potential range of -1.2 to -0.5 V (vs RHE), using D2O, the recently proposed CO2-dimer-radical-anion was observed, adsorbed on the polycrystalline copper film. We also assign a previously unresolved band at ∼1610 cm-1 to this species. The dimer disproportionates to adsorbed CO and CO32-, the latter being converted to bicarbonate by proton addition. Adsorbed CO is sensitive to a Stark shift, that is, a shift as a function of applied potential. Eventually, CO disappears, and the infrared signature of (dissolved) formate at ∼1590 cm-1 appears at ∼-0.5 V. We discuss the spectra and chemistry in detail, based on the reference spectra of carbonate, bicarbonate, and formate and using 13CO2 to substantiate the formation of the dimer intermediate. The results are discussed and compared to recent literature on infrared analysis of electrochemical reduction of CO2.

However, using additional cooling flow bled from the upstream compressor causes a corresponding detriment to overall efficiency. A primary candidate for cooling flow optimization is purge flow, which contributes to sealing the stator-rotor cavity and prevents ingestion of hot main gas path (MGP) flow into the wheelspace. Previous research has identified that the external main gas path flow physics play a significant role in driving rim seal ingestion. However, the potential impact of other cooling flow features on ingestion behavior, such as vane trailing edge (VTE) flow, is absent in the open literature. This paper presents experimental measurements of rim cavity cooling effectiveness collected from a one-stage turbine operating at engine-representative Reynolds and Mach numbers. Carbon dioxide (CO2) was used as a tracer gas in both the purge flow and vane trailing edge flow to investigate flow migration into and out of the wheelspace. Results show that the vane trailing edge flow does in fact migrate into the rim seal and that there is a superposition relationship between individual cooling flow contributions. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations using unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) were used to confirm VTE flow ingestion into the rim seal cavity. Radial and circumferential traverse surveys were performed to quantify cooling flow radial migration through the main gas path with and without vane trailing edge flow. The surveys confirmed that vane trailing edge flow is entrained into the wheelspace as purge flow is reduced. Local CO2 measurements also confirmed the presence of VTE flow deep in the wheelspace cavity. © 2020 by ASME.","Cavity and leaking flows; Fluid dynamics and heat transfer phenomena in compressor and turbine components of gas turbine engines; Impact on cavity leaking flows on performance","Carbon dioxide; Computational fluid dynamics; Cooling; Efficiency; Gases; Navier Stokes equations; Rhenium compounds; Surveys; Turbine components; Component failures; Computational fluid dynamics simulations; Firing temperature; Overall efficiency; Potential impacts; Rim seal ingestions; Unsteady reynolds-averaged navier-stokes; Wheel-space cavity; Seals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106053666

The objective of this study was to determine research needs identified by stakeholders in the Northeast needed for decision-support and policy creation so that scientists can target future research efforts to fill gaps. Modeled after document analysis methods in Dilling et al. (2014), this study examines documents sourced from local and regional organizations in both the public and private sectors to determine gaps in information necessary for climate resilience planning. Stakeholders throughout the Northeast expressed a need for solution-based research, in particular natural and nature-based solutions such as wetlands. Additionally, there was a need to better understand the economic impacts of climate change on key industries in the region as well as cost-benefit analyses of different adaptation options. It was also determined that government organizations, such as Sea Grant, play a crucial role in supporting stakeholder needs assessments both in terms of funding and providing necessary expertise.

To promote sustainability at ports, regulatory authorities have introduced the concept of regulations and economic incentives. In this paper, we analyze the process in which a regulatory authority defines regulations, incentives, and tax policies to motivate one or more ports in the region to initiate energy sustainability and emission-reduction efforts. We model the behaviors of both the regulatory authority and the participating ports in the form of a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear bilevel optimization problem to capture the hierarchy of the policy-making process and the existing competitions among the ports. The proposed model finds the optimal incentive and tax policies for the policy-maker in the upper-level and provides the ports in the region with the optimal choice of sustainable energy solutions and service prices in the lower-level.

The main areas of concern for Greenland are waste management and climate change. Despite the participation of Greenland in the Arctic and European Union programs and the development of its national policies to combat climate change, the level of greenhouse gas emissions from the rest of the world has a negative effect on the environmental situation in Greenland, thereby confirming the fears of researchers about the irreversibility of the Greenland glaciers melting and the general climate warming by more than 1.5 C to the beginning of 2100.

For the validation, the authentic data has been collected from an implemented CCPP. This comprehensive study has been performed to perceive the relation between the most significant parameters on the performance of CCPP. The main obtained results include five points. First, the thermal recovery boiler and combustion chamber have the highest exergy destruction among the power plant components. Second, the optimization based on the entire cycle at all temperatures has no economic justification, and its total exergy efficiency and cost are better than optimizations based on the recovery boiler and HRSG. Third, the value of the CCPP decision parameters is highly dependent on the ambient temperature. Therefore, it is not possible to apply the same value for CCPP at various temperatures. Fourth, the genetic algorithm improved the optimized cycle parameters by considering two objectives of the power plant costs reduction and CO2 emission.

Despite significant participation in the agricultural labor force in Pakistan, women's contribution is not properly acknowledged and rewarded. The issue is further aggravated by the dearth of literature on gender-labor relations in cropping and livestock activities. Considering this gap in the literature, the current study was conducted with the specific objective of exploring the labor composition of different agricultural activities in different farm size categories in general and, particularly, female agricultural labor (family and hired labor) participation and its determinants in the rice-wheat cropping system of the Punjab province, Pakistan. The data were collected from 300 households across four districts of the province. Labor participation was calculated on an official farm size classification basis, i.e., small (<12.5 acres), medium (12.6-25 acres) and large (>25 acres) farms. The findings show that female labor is predominantly demanded in the manual harvesting of wheat, rice nursery transplantation and harvesting, and the majority of the livestock-related activities. The regression model results showed that family female labor and hired female labor participation significantly depend on the landholding status of farmers, household size, family type and level of education. The interviews also illustrated that labor relations are rapidly changing-ongoing mechanization threatens conventional female labor activities due to the lack of machinery operation skills among females, caused by informal state policies and cultural barriers. The findings of the study have important policy implications for mainstreaming gender status in agricultural policy and rural development and contribute directly to the Sustainable Development Goals on Gender Equality (SDG#5) and Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG#8), and indirectly to No Poverty (SDG#1), Zero Hunger (SDG#2), Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG#12) and Climate Action (SDG#13). © 2020 by the authors.","Agricultural labor; Farm size; Female labor; Gender bias; Pakistan; Rice-wheat system","agricultural labor; agricultural policy; agricultural worker; equity; farm size; gender role; harvesting; labor participation; labor relations; landholding; livestock farming; machinery; rural development; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089842144

To the end, the trends in the concentrations of O3, NO2, CO, SO2, PM10, and PM2.5 as the main atmospheric pollutants of Karaj were studied. Five time series models of autoregressive (AR), moving average (MA), autoregressive moving average (ARMA), autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) were used to predict changes in air pollutant concentrations. Air pollution zoning is conducted via ArcGIS10.3 by using spline tension interpolation method. Then, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was obtained from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images to analyze vegetation dynamics as an index of ecosystem functioning. NDVI thresholds were selected to present guidelines for qualitative and quantitative changes in green cover and were divided into five different categories. Based on the results, AR (1) and ARIMA (1,2,1) were recognized as appropriate models for predicting the concentration of air pollutants in the study area. A decrease in very dense vegetation coverage and increase in poor vegetation areas, followed by an increase in air pollution, revealed that the loss of urban green coverage and decreased ecosystem services were positively related. Furthermore, the expansion of urban lands toward the north and the west from the baseline to future condition led to great changes in the land cover and losses in vegetation along these axes, which finally resulted in increased air pollution in these areas. Thus, the results of this study can be directly used in decision-making in the area of air pollution. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Air pollution; Ecosystem service; Land cover; NDVI; Time series models; Urban vegetation","Autoregressive moving average model; Decision making; Ecosystems; Interpolation; Vegetation; Air pollutant concentrations; Atmospheric pollutants; Auto-regressive integrated moving average; Autoregressive moving average; Landsat Thematic Mapper; Normalized difference vegetation index; Operational land imager; Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving averages; Air pollution; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; ArcGIS; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); decision making; ecosystem service; Landsat thematic mapper; NDVI; trend analysis; urban ecosystem; air pollution; air quality; Article; autoregressive integrated moving average model; autoregressive model; autoregressive moving average model; concentration (parameter); ecosystem; environmental decision making; environmental factor; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; environmental parameters; geographic distribution; Iran; land use; mathematical computing; moving average model; particulate matter; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model; trend study; urban population; air pollutant; ecosystem; Iran; Alborz; Iran; Karaj; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087794835

Through an examination of scale in political ecology, world regional political ecology is identified as a promising analytical and political approach to understanding and addressing the current challenges associated with climate change. In light of this, political ecology scholarship in the region is reviewed to identify current strengths and lacunae. Whilst there is indeed a rich tradition of political ecology research across the Asia Pacific, much of this research focuses upon local/national/global dynamics with relatively little attention devoted to supra-national processes, missing important social, political, financial and material processes constructed at the world regional scale. It is argued that a world regional political ecology of climate change should build upon strengths in previous political ecology work yet extend these in three generative directions: comparative analysis of place-based, single issue research; generation of diverse counter-narratives at the regional scale; and consideration of flows and networks. We argue a rescaled political ecology that incorporates world regional scales opens a range of possibilities for practicing and pursuing more just and progressive climate politics and initiatives. © The Author(s) 2019.","adaptation; climate change; mitigation; political ecology; REDD+; scale; world region","climate change; comparative study; environmental policy; global climate; political economy; regional planning; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066869819

Indisputably, what is needed is not just a reduction in the emissions of CO2 (greenhouse gases in general) from the technosphere, but also a manipulated diversion of CO2 from the atmosphere to 'traps' in the lithosphere, technosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. The case study in this paper focused on Stockholm Exergi's proposed waste-to-energy incineration plant in Lövsta, which is keen on incorporating carbon capture and storage (CCS), but is also interested in understanding the potential of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCU/S) in helping it to achieve 'carbon-dioxide-negativity'. Waste-to-energy incineration plants (in cases where the petro-plastics in the waste mix can be substantially reduced) are a key component of a circular bio-economy, though the circularity here pertains to recovering energy from materials which may or may not be recyclable. CCS (storage in the North Sea) was compared with CCU/S (CO2 sintered into high-quality building blocks made of recycled slag from the steel sector) from techno-economic and environmental perspectives. The comparative analysis shows, inter alia, that a hybridized approach-a combination of CCS and CCU/S-is worth investing in. CCU/S, at the time of writing, is simply a pilot project in Belgium, a possible creatively-destructive technology which may or may not usurp prominence from CCS. The authors believe that political will and support with incentives, subsidies, and tax rebates are indispensable to motivate investments in such ground-breaking technologies and moving away from the easier route of paying carbon taxes or purchasing emission rights. © 2020 by the authors.","Building blocks; Carbon capture; Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Carbon sinks; Carbonation; Utilization and storage (CCU/S)","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; food storage; incentive; incineration; pollution tax; slag; steel; Atlantic Ocean; Belgium; North Sea; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089676416

Cbls are cobalt-containing corrin complexes, vibrations of which can be probed using rR spectroscopy. The oxidation state of Co ion in Cbls can range between Co3+, Co2+, and Co1+, and axially, cobalt can be coordinated by variety of ligands. Recent spectroscopic study revealed that Co2+Cbl reduced by dithionite (DTH) exhibited a unique property distinct from other Co2+Cbls. Accordingly, in this study, rR spectra of Co2+Cbls reduced by DTH were compared with these reduced by dithiothreitol (DTT). The DTT-reduced Cbl gave ordinary rR spectrum at pH 3 and 8. On the other hand, the DTH-reduced Cbl gave different rR spectra at pH 3 and 8 and contained a new rR band at 987 cm−1, which is absent with the DTT-reduced one. The α and γ Abs bands of DTH-reduced Cbls were also shifted to shorter wavelengths and exhibited broadening. To understand these rR spectra, geometry optimization and frequency calculations using DFT have been carried out for different structural models of Cbls and compared with experiment. Based on current spectroscopic studies and computation, we deduced that the DTH-reduced Cbl has SO2-. radical anion at an axial coordination position of Co2+ and that the ππ* transition of corrin ring is partially mixed with π bond of SO2-. radical anion, giving rise to the S=O stretching rR band in resonance with the γ Abs band. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","cobalamin; corrin; density functional theory; porphyrin; resonance Raman spectroscopy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085584865

Simulations and a representative semianalytical model (which we term the ion emission model) predict effective neutralization in these scenarios as ion current is emitted from the surface of the quasi-neutral contactor plasma according to the space-charge limit. This article focuses on experimental plasma measurements of a hollow cathode biased to several positive voltages with respect to a surrounding vacuum chamber in order to validate the ion emission model. Particular attention is paid to the emitted ions (those reaching the chamber wall) and to the ion-rich sheath region where the ion emission process takes place. Retarding potential analyzer (RPA) measurements were performed to understand ion flow velocity and direction as these parameters relate directly to the current predicted by the ion emission model. Planar probe measurements were performed at the chamber wall to compare local emission currents to model predictions. Evidence of collisions within the plasma (particularly charge exchange collisions) and simple models predicting ion energetics are presented. These experiments suggest that ion emission from the contactor plasma acts according to the ion emission model and adds to the physical understanding of spacecraft neutralization using hollow cathode plasma contactors as it may occur in tenuous space plasmas. © 1973-2012 IEEE.","Hollow cathode; ion emission; plasma contactor; plasma modeling; spacecraft charging; spacecraft neutralization","Cathodes; Charge transfer; Collisional plasmas; Electron sources; Flow velocity; Forecasting; Ion exchange; Charge exchange collision; Ion flow velocity; Local emission currents; Plasma measurement; Probe measurements; Retarding potential analyzer; Semi-analytical model; Space charge limit; Ions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087590359

Then the modified SWAT was used for predicting snow depth, soil temperature at different depths and carbon dioxide emission from peatlands and other land uses at Athabasca river basin, Canada. The results of the study indicated that SWAT model estimated the daily snow depth with R2, NSE, RMSE and PBIAS values of 0.83, 0.76, 0.52 and −2.3 in the calibration period (2006–2007) and 0.79, 0.71, 0.97 and −3.6 for the validation period (2008–2009), respectively. The SWAT model also predicted soil temperature very well at three depths (5 cm, 10 cm and 30 cm).

The integrated assessment community has quantified anthropogenic emissions for the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) scenarios, each of which represents a different future socio-economic projection and political environment. Here, we provide the greenhouse gas concentrations for these SSP scenarios - using the reduced-complexity climate-carbon-cycle model MAGICC7.0.We extend historical, observationally based concentration data with SSP concentration projections from 2015 to 2500 for 43 greenhouse gases with monthly and latitudinal resolution. CO2 concentrations by 2100 range from 393 to 1135 ppm for the lowest (SSP1-1.9) and highest (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios, respectively. We also provide the concentration extensions beyond 2100 based on assumptions regarding the trajectories of fossil fuels and land use change emissions, net negative emissions, and the fraction of non-CO 2 emissions. By 2150, CO2 concentrations in the lowest emission scenario are approximately 350 ppm and approximately plateau at that leveluntil 2500, whereas the highest fossil-fuel-driven scenario projects CO 2 concentrations of 1737 ppm and reaches concentrations beyond 2000 ppm by 2250. We estimate that the share of CO2 in the total radiative forcing contribution of all considered 43 long-lived greenhouse gases increases from 66% for the present day to roughly 68% to 85% by the time of maximum forcing in the 21st century. For this estimation, we updated simple radiative forcing parameterizations that reflect the Oslo Line-By-Line model results. In comparison to the representative concentration pathways (RCPs), the five main SSPs (SSP1-1.9, SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5) are more evenly spaced and extend to lower 2100 radiative forcing and temperatures. Performing two pairs of six-member historical ensembles with CESM1.2.2, we estimate the effect on surface air temperatures of applying latitudinally and seasonally resolved GHG concentrations. We find that the ensemble differences in the March-April-May (MAM) season provide a regional warming in higher northern latitudes of up to 0.4K over the historical period, latitudinally averaged of about 0.1 K, which we estimate to be comparable to the upper bound (5% level) of natural variability. In comparison to the comparatively straight line of the last 2000 years, the greenhouse gas concentrations since the onset of the industrial period and this studies' projections over the next 100 to 500 years unequivocally depict a ""hockey-stick""upwards shape. The SSP concentration time series derived in this study provide a harmonized set of input assumptions for long-term climate science analysis; they also provide an indication of the wide set of futures that societal developments and policy implementations can lead to - ranging from multiple degrees of future warming on the one side to approximately 1.5 °C warming on the other. © Author(s) 2020.",,"air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; fossil fuel; global warming; greenhouse gas; land use change; parameterization; radiative forcing; socioeconomic status; time series analysis; Oslo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092552445

In order to design policy for demand side management, proper knowledge on determinants of electricity demand as well as prediction of future demand is required. However, study on estimation and forecasting of residential demand in developing countries like India has received less attention. This study is the first attempt to estimate and forecast residential electricity demand in the state of Odisha, which is the pioneer of electricity reform in India. It employs ARDL model to estimate residential electricity demand; while ARIMA, VAR and VEC models are employed to forecast future demand. The results show that income and price of electricity are significant determinants of residential electricity demand. The higher price elasticity compared to income elasticity reveals that price could be used as an effective instrument for demand side management. The forecast results show that VAR has the lowest error, which predicts per capita residential electricity demand to be double by 2030–31.

If genomic technologies are to be useful in this scenario, there is a need for the careful definition of phenotypes and routine sample collection, as well as large-scale genotyping of animal populations. Genomic tools will greatly enhance the characterisation of available germplasm and exploration of local genetic resources, while faster and cheaper DNA sequencing is leading to an increased understanding of the underlying genetic basis of traits. The use of genomic tools to increase animal resilience, reduce methane emissions from cattle and sheep, improve disease resistance, decrease environmental impact, reduce competition for land and water and, finally, increase production may be the most feasible path for the future of livestock production. In this review, the authors discuss various genomic strategies in the light of climate change, focusing on the selection of resistant/tolerant animals, landscape genomics, metagenomics and gene editing.L’un des effets anticipés du changement climatique sera la modification de la nature et de la distribution des systèmes d’élevage dans le monde, raison pour laquelle des stratégies seront nécessaires pour adapter et optimiser les systèmes mondiaux de production alimentaire. Si l’on veut que les technologies de la génomique soient utiles dans ce scénario, il faudra procéder avec soin à la définition des phénotypes et à la collecte de routine des échantillons, et réaliser le génotypage à grande échelle des populations animales. Les outils génomiques permettront d’améliorer nettement la caractérisation du germoplasme disponible et d’effectuer une exploration plus approfondie des ressources génétiques locales, tandis que le séquençage ADN devenu plus rapide et meilleur marché se traduira par une meilleure compréhension de la base génétique sousjacente des caractères. Le recours à des outils génomiques pour augmenter la résilience animale, réduire les émissions de méthane du cheptel bovin et ovin, améliorer la résistance aux maladies, diminuer l’impact environnemental, réduire la concurrence pour les terres et les ressources hydrographiques et, enfin, accroître la production pourrait être la voie à suivre la plus réaliste pour l’avenir de la production animale. Les auteurs examinent plusieurs stratégies génomiques à la lumière du changement climatique, en se concentrant sur la sélection des animaux résistants/tolérants, sur la génomique du paysage, sur la métagénomique et sur l’édition génomique.Según apuntan las predicciones, el cambio climático va a modificar la naturaleza y la distribución de los sistemas agropecuarios del mundo y por doquier en el planeta harán falta estrategias destinadas a adaptar y optimizar los sistemas de producción de alimentos. Para que las herramientas de la genómica sean útiles, en caso de que efectivamente se cumplan estos augurios, es indispensable disponer de detalladas caracterizaciones fenotípicas, muestreos sistemáticos y tipificaciones génicas a gran escala de las poblaciones animales. Las herramientas de la genómica mejorarán mucho la caracterización del germoplasma existente y el estudio de los recursos genéticos locales, a la vez que la secuenciación de ADN, cada vez más rápida y barata, nos aporta ya un conocimiento más profundo de la base genética de los rasgos fenotípicos. Quizá el camino más practicable para el porvenir de la producción ganadera sea el que pasa por utilizar las herramientas de la genómica para conferir más resiliencia a los animales, reducir las emisiones de metano del ganado vacuno y ovino, mejorar la resistencia a enfermedades, atenuar el impacto ambiental, reducir la competencia por los suelos y el agua y, por último, incrementar la producción.

In toroidal fluidisation, most of the kinetic energy of the fluidising gas is used to induce swirling of the particle bed meaning higher gas velocities can be used without entrainment. The end-goal of this research is to use this ‘mesoscale-TORBED’ for screening adsorbents for CO2 capture, where the intensified heat/mass transfer rates can potentially minimise the troublesome scalability issues encountered in standard packed beds, a consequence of gradient effects. Here, we have performed a comprehensive parametric study to understand the influence of bed loading, gas volumetric flow rate, gas temperature and gas humidity on the swirling bed formations of activated carbon pellets in order to identify appropriate conditions for sorbent screening. We show that desirable ‘uniform packing’ occurs across a broad range of operating conditions and identify the lower bed loading limit as 1200 mg. Other observed bed formations included collapsed, maldistributed and entrained states that caused gas bypassing of the particle bed. At the lowest air flow rate studied (27 L/min), the bed was either in the collapsed state or not swirling at all, whilst swirling was readily observed at the intermediate and high air flow rates (35.5 L/min and 44 L/min respectively).

This energy can be harnessed by a chemosynthetic biosphere that permeates hydrothermal regions on Earth. Shifts in the abundance of redox-reactive species in diffuse fluids are often interpreted to reflect the direct influence of subseafloor microbial activity on fluid geochemical budgets. Here, we examine hydrothermal fluids venting at 44 to 149 °C at the Piccard hydrothermal field that span the canonical 122 °C limit to life, and thus provide a rare opportunity to study the transition between habitable and uninhabitable environments. In contrast with previous studies, we show that hydrocarbons are contributed by biomass pyrolysis, while abiotic sulfate (SO42-) reduction produces large depletions in H2. The latter process consumes energy that could otherwise support key metabolic strategies employed by the subseafloor biosphere. Available Gibbs free energy is reduced by 71 to 86% across the habitable temperature range for both hydrogenotrophic SO42- reduction to hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction to methane (CH4). The abiotic H2 sink we identify has implications for the productivity of subseafloor microbial ecosystems and is an important process to consider within models of H2 production and consumption in young oceanic crust. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

To identify drivers promoting cultivated plant growth on soil amended with composted aquatic plant, empirical data of pot experiments were incorporated into structural equation models by hypothesizing causal relationships between the application of composted aquatic plants, soil chemistry, soil microbes, and cultivated plant growth. Cultivated plant growth, total carbon content, and bacterial and fungal richness in soil increased on soil applied with composted aquatic plants, and the composition of bacterial and fungal assemblages in soil were significantly different among the application treatments. Structural equation models explicitly demonstrated the relative importance of bacterial assemblages compared to soil chemistry as a promoter of cultivated plant growth in response to the application of composted aquatic plants. The present study is the first to demonstrate that the positive effects of composted aquatic plants on terrestrial plant growth are mediated by soil microbial processes. Our results could provide basic insights into the transfer and cycling of nutrients from aquatic to terrestrial systems through human activities. © 2020, The Japanese Society of Limnology.","Bacteria; Fungi; Japanese mustard spinach; Lake Biwa; Metabarcoding; Structural equation models","aquatic plant; bacterium; community composition; compost; fungus; soil amendment; soil chemistry; soil microorganism; soil nutrient; species richness; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Spinacia oleracea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082951026

It has been associated with increased pulmonary tract and lung infections. It is more common in urban areas, especially megacities due to the confluence of industries and motorized machinery. Considering that most of the world's population lives in urban areas, there is a need to monitor air pollution arising from particulate matter in order to ensure clean and safe air in cities in accordance with goal 11 of the Sustainable Development Goals. One way of doing this is through the use of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), which are suited for time varying data. Particulate matter concentration recorded by a network of low-cost sensors in Stuttgart is trained on three of the most popular RNN variants: Standard LSTM, Peephole LSTM and Gated Recurrent Unit. Two optimizers are used, Stochastic Gradient descent and Adam. Training is done on a single sensor and the optimum weights transferred and used in the prediction of other sensor values. This study concludes that Gated Recurrent Unit with Stochastic Gradient Descent is the most effective of the three variants in predicting particulate matter PM2.5 concentrations. In addition to this, weight transfer between sensors is not affected by temperature, wind direction, wind speed and geographic distance between sensors but rather by atmospheric pressure and the similarity of recorded Particulate matter levels. © 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.","air quality monitoring; gated recurrent unit; long short-term memory; optimizers; Particulate Matter pollution; prediction; Recurrent neural networks; sensor network","Atmospheric pressure; Forecasting; Gradient methods; Long short-term memory; Machinery; Optimization; Stochastic systems; Wind; Concentration prediction; Long-term effects; Low-cost sensors; Particulate Matter; PM2.5 concentration; Recurrent neural network (RNN); Stochastic gradient descent; Time-varying data; Particles (particulate matter)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091063454

Formal models, previous comparative research, and palaeoanthropological evidence suggest that humans evolved higher levels of cooperative childcare in response to increasingly harsh environments. Although this hypothesis remains difficult to test directly, the relative importance of alloparental care varies across human societies, providing an opportunity to assess how local social and ecological factors influence the expression of this behaviour. We therefore, investigated associations between alloparental infant care and socioecology across 141 non-industrialized societies. We predicted increased alloparental care in harsher environments, due to the fitness benefits of cooperation in response to shared ecological challenges. We also predicted that starvation would decrease alloparental care, due to prohibitive energetic costs. Using Bayesian phylogenetic multilevel models, we tested these predictions while accounting for potential confounds as well as for population history. Consistent with our hypotheses, we found increased alloparental infant care in regions characterized by both reduced climate predictability and relatively lower average temperatures and precipitation. We also observed reduced alloparental care under conditions of high starvation. These results provide evidence of plasticity in human alloparenting in response to ecological contexts, comparable to previously observed patterns across avian and mammalian cooperative breeders. This suggests convergent social evolutionary processes may underlie both inter- and intraspecific variation in alloparental care. © 2020 The Author(s).","alloparent; cooperative breeding; ecology; plasticity; social evolution","alloparental care; child care; environmental effect; fitness; human geography; interspecific variation; intraspecific variation; life history trait; starvation; Aves; Mammalia; environment; evolution; human; phylogeny; social behavior; Biological Evolution; Environment; Humans; Phylogeny; Social Behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089649445

Concerned that climate hazards will threaten settlement viability and provoke widespread, unplanned migration, global discourse overwhelmingly characterizes relocation as a voluntary, “last resort” effort to resettle and rebuild communities in safer areas. Over the past decade, scholars have investigated where and why climate-related relocation materializes and how it functions as an adaptation (or otherwise). This article systematically reviews the scientific literature, concluding that climate-related relocation is a more diverse and complex process than recognized within dominant research efforts and policy narratives. While climate-related relocation is sometimes a function of environmental migration pressures and adaptation imperatives, recent critical scholarship shows that climate-related relocation processes are embedded in historical responses to environment and development problems and unfold through political negotiation, discourse, and the social construction of risk and response. In practice, “adaptive relocation” frequently involves population redistribution (villagization and sedentarization) as well as resettlement, is often proactive and involuntary, and risks (re)producing maladaptive outcomes. Based on this analysis, I argue for an expanded research and policy agenda centered around a pluralistic conceptual framework that respects the diversity of relocation efforts undertaken as adaptation. © The Author(s) 2020.","climate adaptation; climate discourse; environmental migration; planned relocation; population redistribution; resettlement; sedentarization; transformational adaptation; villagization",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087676262

The promise of the SIF signal as a proxy for photosynthesis with a strong relationship to GPP has been widely cited in carbon cycling studies. However, chlorophyll fluorescence originates from dynamic energy partitioning at the leaf level and does not exhibit a uniformly linear relationship with photosynthesis at finer scales. We induced stomatal closure in deciduous woody tree branches and measured SIF at a proximal scale, alongside leaf-level gas exchange, pulse amplitude modulated (PAM) fluorescence, and leaf pigment content. We found no change in SIF or steady-state PAM fluorescence, despite clear reductions in stomatal conductance, carbon assimilation, and light-use efficiency in treated leaves. These findings suggest that equating SIF and photosynthesis is an oversimplification that may undermine the utility of SIF as a biophysical parameter in GPP models. © 2020.

Hydrophobic OPs such as higher petroleum hydrocarbons, phthalates, and polycyclic organic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are not exclusively bound to particles, but also present in runoff in colloidal and truly dissolved forms. These hydrophobic compounds can also form nano- and microsized emulsions that may carry pollutants in stormwater. Hence, it is of great importance to develop treatment technologies such as sorption filters that can remove non-particulate OPs from contaminated stormwater. A pilot plant using column bed-filters of sand as a pre-filter, in combination with granulated activated carbon, Sphagnum peat or Pinus sylvestris bark, was used to investigate the removal of non-particulate OPs from urban stormwater. Samples from the filter effluents were collected weekly; during or after rain events; and during stress tests when incoming water was spiked with contaminated sediment and petrol or diesel. All sorption filters showed efficient reduction of aliphatic diesel hydrocarbons C16–C35, benzene, and the PAHs phenanthrene, fluoranthene, and pyrene during most of the operation time, which was 18 months. During the stress test events, all sorption filters showed 100% reduction of PAH-16, petrol and diesel aliphatics C5–C35. All sorption filters released DOC and nanoparticles, which may explain some of the transportation of OPs through the filter beds. The recommendation is to use a combination of sand pre-filtration and all the studied sorption materials in stormwater filters in series, to achieve effective removal of different types of OPs. It is also important to improve the hydraulic conditions to obtain sufficient water flows through the filters. © 2020 The Authors","Bark; Biosorption; Granulated activated carbon; Peat; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Sustainable stormwater management","Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Aliphatic hydrocarbons; Diesel engines; Effluents; Gasoline; Hydrophobicity; Particles (particulate matter); Pilot plants; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Runoff; Sewage; Sorption; Storms; Contaminated sediment; Effective removals; Granulated activated carbons; Hydraulic conditions; Hydrophobic compounds; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Stormwater filter; Treatment technologies; Organic pollutants; benzene; diesel fuel; fluoranthene; gasoline; hydrocarbon; phenanthrene; pyrene; rain; storm water; coniferous tree; diesel; effluent; filtration; hydrophobicity; organic pollutant; particulate organic matter; petroleum hydrocarbon; pollutant removal; sorption; stormwater; wastewater treatment; Article; bark; biosorption; controlled study; environmental stress; filtration; nonhuman; organic pollutant; plant peat; plant structures; pollutant; priority journal; sand; Scots pine; sediment; Sphagnum; waste component removal; water contamination; Pinus sylvestris; Sphagnum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084390954

To this end, the building sector, responsible for important energy consumption rates, requires a significant improvement of its energetic performance, an obtainable increase of its energy efficiency and the use of renewable sources. Within this framework, in this study, we analysed the economic feasibility of a stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) plant, dimensioned in two configurations with decreasing autonomy. Their Net Present Value at the end of their life span was compared with that of the same plant in both grid-connected and storage-on-grid configurations, as well as being compared with a grid connection without PV. The analysis confirms that currently, for short distances from the grid, the most suitable PV configuration is the grid-connected one, but also that the additional use of a battery with a limited capacity (storage on grid configuration) would provide interesting savings to the user, guaranteeing a fairly energetic autonomy. Stand-alone PV systems are only convenient for the analysed site from distances of the order of 5 km, and it is worth noting that such a configuration is neither energetically nor economically sustainable due to the necessary over-dimensioning of both its generators and batteries, which generates a surplus of energy production that cannot be used elsewhere and implies a dramatic cost increase and no corresponding benefits. The results have been tested for different latitudes, confirming what we found. A future drop of both batteries’ and PV generators’ prices would let the economic side of PV stand-alone systems be reconsidered, but not their energetic one, so that their use, allowing energy exchanges, results in being more appropriate for district networks. For all PV systems, avoided emissions of both local and GHG gases (CO2) have been estimated. © 2020 by the authors.","Emission reduction; Energy storage; Net present value; PV systems configurations; Renewable energy sources","Climate change; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric batteries; Emission control; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Solar power generation; Economic comparisons; Economic feasibilities; Emissions reduction; Energy consumption rates; European energy policy; Grid connected PV system; PV stand-alone systems; Stand-alone PV systems; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090971977

Despite high deforestation rates, Chaco is still dominated by native forests, offering a unique opportunity to explore the role of biophysical controls dictated by latitudinal gradients on its hydrological functioning. In this study, we used GRACE-derived satellite data, climatic information and river flow records to analyse the seasonality of total water storage and its relationship with climatic factors and plant activity across the whole latitudinal gradient of the Chaco region. Our results showed a strong reduction in the intensity and duration of the hydrological dry period towards the southern and more temperate portion in despite similar rainfall seasonality. Mean seasonal fluctuation of water storage was three times higher (119.1 ± 46.0 vs. 38.6 ± 12.4 mm year−1) for the northern (&lt;26°S) than for the southern Chaco portion (&gt;26°S), a pattern that matched the river flow seasonality of the main rivers of the region. A higher temporal coupling of rainfall and actual evapotranspiration towards the south appears to drive the observed latitudinal hydrological shift, highlighting the importance of atmospheric water demand and plant activity regulating the water cycle at Chaco regional scale. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","GRACE; Hydrological seasonality; Potential and actual evapotranspiration; South American Chaco; Total water storage","Deforestation; Geodetic satellites; Rain; Rivers; Stream flow; Topography; Vegetation; Water supply; Actual evapotranspiration; Atmospheric water; Climatic informations; Latitudinal gradients; Seasonal fluctuations; Temporal coupling; Vegetation activity; Vegetation structure; Digital storage; deforestation; economic aspects of water; evapotranspiration; hydrological modeling; latitudinal gradient; seasonality; vegetation structure; water demand; water storage; Gran Chaco",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083333418

The constructed climatology can remarkably reduce the variability of satellite data and clearly exhibit the seasonal cycles, demonstrating that the growth and decay of phytoplankton recurs with similarly seasonal cycles year after year. As the shapes of time series of the climatology exhibit strong periodical change, we wonder whether the seasonality of Chl-a can be expressed by a mathematic equation. Our results show that sinusoid functions are suitable to describe cyclical variations of data in time series and patterns of the daily climatology can be matched by sine equations with parameters of mean, amplitude, phase, and frequency. Three types of sine equations were used to match the climatological Chl-a with Mean Relative Differences (MRD) of 7.1%, 4.5%, and 3.3%, respectively. The sine equation with four sinusoids can modulate the shapes of the fitted values to match various patterns of climatology with small MRD values (less than 5%) in about 90% of global oceans. The fitted values can reflect an overall pattern of seasonal cycles of Chl-a which can be taken as a time series of biomass baseline for describing the state of seasonal variations of phytoplankton. The amplitude images, the spatial patterns of seasonal variations of phytoplankton, can be used to identify the transition zone chlorophyll fronts. The timing of phytoplankton blooms is identified by the biggest peak of the fitted values and used to classify oceans as different bloom seasons, indicating that blooms occur in all four seasons with regional features. In global oceans within latitude domains (48°N-48°S), blooms occupy approximately half of the ocean (50.6%) during boreal winter (December-February) in the northern hemisphere and more than half (58.0%) during austral winter (June-August) in the southern hemisphere. Therefore, the sine equation can be used to match the daily Chl-a climatology and the fitted values can reflect the seasonal cycles of phytoplankton, which can be used to investigate the underlying phenological characteristics. © 2020 by the authors.","Chlorophyll-a concentration; Fourier series; Phenological characteristics; Satellite remote sensing; Seasonal cycles; Sine equations","Chlorophyll; Climatology; Phytoplankton; Satellites; Time series; Chlorophyll-a concentration; Climatological datasets; Cyclical variation; Northern Hemispheres; Ocean-color satellites; Phytoplankton bloom; Seasonal variation; Southern Hemisphere; Oceanography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090232525

Compared with the unamended control, application of fertilizers increased average cumulative CO2-C emissions during eight cropping cycles in Ouagadougou by 103% and during seven cropping cycles in Tamale by 42%. Calculated total emissions measured across all cropping cycles reached 14 t C ha−1 in Ouagadougou, accounting for 73% of the C applied as organic fertilizer over a period of two years at this site, and 9 t C ha−1 in Tamale. Compared with unamended control plots, fertilizer application increased N2O-N emissions in Ouagadougou during different cropping cycles, ranging from 37 to 360%, while average NH3-N losses increased by 670%. Fertilizer application had no significant effects on N2O-N losses in Tamale. While wastewater irrigation did not significantly enhance CO2-C emissions in Ouagadougou, average CO2-C emissions in Tamale were 71% (1.6 t C ha−1) higher on wastewater plots compared with those of the control (0.9 t C ha−1). However, no significant effects of wastewater on N2O-N and NH3-N emissions were observed at either location. Although biochar did not affect N2O-N and NH3-N losses, the addition of biochar could contribute to reducing CO2-C emissions from urban garden soils. When related to crop production, CO2-C emissions were higher on control than on fertilized plots, but this was not the case for absolute CO2-C emissions. © 2020 The Authors.

It was found that CW-OSL readout significantly affects the SR-TL response with respect to both total intensity and spectral distribution of the luminescence. The results were dependent on the stimulation time, however even after 45 min of optical bleaching a significant number of traps and recombination centers was still populated. After green stimulation additional short wavelength (UV) band appears. The resulting emission spectrum was deconvoluted to four and five emission bands. In both cases the peak positions were stable irrespective of the stimulation time. Theoretical analysis of the dependence of spectral components on the OSL stimulation time was performed.

This research aims to quantify fuel cost reduction, forest preservation, carbon dioxide emission reduction potential of advanced stoves and influencing factor of their adoption in Werabe University, Ethiopia. To attain its objectives: firstly, Control cooking test on traditional cooking stoves and both single clay and double clay electric stoves was conducted to quantify their fuel use efficiency. Secondly, document analysis was used to investigate forest reservation, fuel cost reduction and carbon dioxide emission reduction. Thirdly, focus group discussion with bakers used to identify the health impact of the traditional cookstove. Fourthly, an interview was also conducted to identify factors determining the adoption of electric cookstoves. The results show, substituting traditional cookstoves by single clay electric stoves or double clay electric stoves can reduce fuel cost by 159% and 148% y−1. Electric cookstoves can preserve 4.76 and 9.77 ha of dense and open forest cover. The finding also reveals that single clay electric stoves and double clay electric stoves reduce CO2 emission by 99.08% and 98.87% y−1. The study also indicates switching traditional cookstove to cleaner stoves avoids IAP; consequently, it improves cooks health. Finally in Werabe University adoption of cleaner stoves is influenced by transmission failure of electricity and lack of attention about the benefit of the clean cookstove.

The gher area is interlinked to both upstream tributaries and adjacent mangroves by rivers, canals, channels and other watercourses. The mangrove-river connectivity (MRC), water salinity and tidal flush have made the system dynamic. The present descriptive study was carried out in the southwest coastal area of Bangladesh to provide a baseline for aquaculture species distribution and occurrence related to water salinity. Salinity and MRC network largely define the aquatic farming in the region with or without integration of rice and dyke crop. Based on the surface water salinity, soil salinity, underground water salinity and indicator species, the agro-ecology of the area is divided into: high saline area (HS; >10 ppt most of the time of a year); medium saline area (MS; 5-10 ppt); low saline area (LS; typically <5 ppt); and freshwater area (FW; <0.5 ppt). In addition, a pocket gher system, which is a low saline gher, in higher saline areas located in elevated land areas are proposed. From 200 randomly selected gher across 4 agro-ecologies, 56 different fish and crustaceans species were sampled both in dry and wet seasons. The species richness was correlated to salinity and MRC network. Proximity of HS to MRC network supported the occurrence of maximum number (34) of on-farm species, although the fragile MRC network evolving due to siltation led to a drop in the number of species by almost 50% (20 in number) in MS areas. The salinity tolerant Tilapia dominated the MS areas. Both LS and FW areas were suitable for dyke crop and rice along with a combination of wild and hatchery sourced fish/crustaceans species. The results showed that a group of species could potentially be used as biological indicators to represent the agro-ecological disparity. The outcome of this study should be useful to understand the role of the MRC network, and it could be a baseline for monitoring climate change impact, adopt sustainable and climate-resilient aquaculture program in the region and wider afield. © 2020, BIOFLUX SRL.

Two major factors affecting these variables are climate change and land use change. Few researches have been done to investigate the combined effect of the land use change and climate change using projections. In this study the hydrological processes in Upper Choctawhatchee RiverWatershed were modeled using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to investigate the impacts of climate and land use change. We integrated land use projection based in the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways with future climate data to study the combined effects on Hydrological response of the watershed. Future rainfall and temperature, for two time periods, were obtained using General Climate Models to provide SWAT with the climatic forcing in order to project water balance variables. The simulation was carried out under two radiative forcing pathways of RCP4.5 and RCP6.0. Land use change focused on urbanization dominated the climate changes. Impacts on water balance variables differed seasonally. Results showed surface runoff experienced major changes under both emissions scenarios in some months up to 5 times increase. Among the water balance variables, evapotranspiration (ET) as the least dominant pathway for water loss showed the modest changes with the largest decrease during fall and summer. Projection indicated more frequent extreme behavior regarding water balance during midcentury. Discharge was estimated to increase through the year and the highest changes were projected during summer and fall with 186.3% increase in November under RCP6.0. Relying on rainfall for farming along with reduced agricultural landuse (11.8%) and increased urban area (47%) and population growth would likely make the water use efficiency critical. The model demonstrated satisfactory performance, capturing the hydrologic parameters. It thus can be used for further modelling of water quality to determine the sustainable conservation practices and extreme weather events such as hurricane and tropical storms. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Evapotranspiration; Forested watershed; Hydrological modeling; Land use change; Localized constructed analogs (LOCA)","Agricultural robots; Atmospheric radiation; Climate models; Economics; Evapotranspiration; Land use; Population statistics; Rain; Urban growth; Water conservation; Water quality; Water supply; Watersheds; Emissions scenarios; Extreme weather events; Hydrologic parameters; Hydrological process; Hydrological response; Soil and water assessment tool; Sustainable conservations; Water use efficiency; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; evapotranspiration; runoff; soil and water assessment tool; urban area; urbanization; water budget; water quality; water use efficiency; Choctawhatchee Basin; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090238830

Several past studies have assessed premature mortalities associated with PM2.5 in China at varying levels of temporal and spatial scales using different methodological approaches. However, recently developed global exposure mortality model [GEMM NCD + LRI and GEMM 5-COD] provides a much more sophisticated methodology in capturing mortality due to PM2.5-exposure than the commonly accepted integrated exposure-response (IER) model, which this study applied to China. This study provides a comparative assessment of the excess long-term PM2.5-attributed nonaccidental deaths as well as cause-specific deaths for 349 cities in mainland China during five years (from 2015 to 2019) and compares the results with the spatial resolution scale of 0.1° × 0.1° across overall China. The results demonstrate that the national annual average PM2.5 concentration declined from 51.9 ± 18.2 μg/m3 in 2015 to 39.0 ± 13.2 μg/m3 in 2019, and the overall annual negative trend was around −3.1 ± 2.2 μg/m3/year [−5.6 ± 3.4%/year] across China. Consequently, the number of PM2.5-related deaths decreased by 383 thousand [95% CI: 331–429] to 1755 thousand [95% Confidence Interval: 1470–2025; GEMM NCD + LRI]; 315 thousand [95% CI: 227–370] to 1380 thousand [95% CI: 948–1740; GEMM 5-COD] and 125 thousand [95% CI: 64–140] to 876 thousand [95% CI: 394–1262; IER] in 2019, derived from the pre-established models (GEMM and IER). The estimate PM2.5-attributed death with a spatial resolution of 0.1° × 0.1° was 2419 thousand [95% CI: 2041–2771; GEMM NCD + LRI], 1918 thousand [95% CI: 1333–2377; GEMM 5-COD] and 1162 thousand [95% CI: 534–1611; IER] in 2015, which is about 11–16% higher value than the city-level health risk assessment study. The estimated deaths by GEMM NCD + LRI and GEMM 5-COD were 104% and 61% higher than the estimated by IER, highlighting that total premature mortalities associated with PM2.5 were substantially left behind based on the pre-existing model. The “other noncommunicable diseases” mortality, which IER method doesn't account for, was 375 thousand in 2019, 68 thousand less than in 2015. Such significant mortality was previously overlooked in estimation methods, which should now be considered for the air pollution-related policy development in China. The high number of premature deaths in central and northern parts of China, calls for the need for the Government to quickly impose even more stringent and effective pollution control measures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","China; Long-term mortality; Methodological uncertainty; PM2.5; Trend; Unaccounted deaths","Health risks; Image resolution; Pollution control; Risk perception; Comparative assessment; Confidence interval; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Methodological approach; Non-communicable disease; PM2.5 concentration; Premature mortality; Temporal and spatial scale; Risk assessment; atmospheric pollution; comparative study; model; mortality; particulate matter; pollution exposure; risk factor; spatial variation; air pollution control; Article; China; cohort analysis; concentration (parameter); controlled study; disease association; disease classification; environmental exposure; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; epidemiological data; geographic distribution; health hazard; health impact assessment; human; mortality rate; newborn; particulate matter; pollution transport; premature mortality; priority journal; rural area; trend study; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; city; particulate matter; premature mortality; prospective study; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Mortality, Premature; Particulate Matter; Prospective Studies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083896341

Cropping is generally restricted to the wet season. The limited cropping contributes to the high incidence of poverty and limited livelihood prospects in the region. Increasing crop production is desirable, and will depend upon management of the water and salt in a polder. We have developed a novel time-series model of water and salt stores and flows in an idealised polder to investigate water and salt management strategies for crop production, including strategies to cope with climate change and sea level rise. We know of no other model that simulates the overall water and salt balance of a polder, and that can assess a wide range of polder water and salt management strategies. The model adequately reproduces the dynamic water and salt behaviour observed in field data, and also agrees with results produced by a more detailed crop model. A sensitivity analysis of the model shows the results are sensitive to the key model parameters. In general, the results are more sensitive to parameters governing the transfers of salt, and less sensitive to those governing the availability of water. The crop evapotranspiration is particularly sensitive to the model parameters. The main practical consideration resulting from this simplified but robust representation of the polder salt and water balance processes is the importance of management (including drainage) to remove salt. Strategies to improve water availability, while useful, are secondary to the management of salt. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Model sensitivity; Polder; Salt balance; Salt drainage; Water balance","Climate change; Crops; Cultivation; Sea level; Sensitivity analysis; Crop evapotranspiration; Crop production; High incidence; Model parameters; Time series modeling; Water and salt managements; Water and salts; Water availability; Climate models; climate change; crop production; dry season; evapotranspiration; livelihood; salinity; sea level change; sensitivity analysis; water budget; Ganges Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089431463

Unfortunately, restoration techniques often alter a site's soil habitat and plant community structure, which affect the activity and composition of microbial communities. Microbial community structure and activity, as a function of soil texture and plant inputs, were studied in soils collected from a restored and a natural tidal freshwater wetland for a period of nine weeks. We expected that increasing the clay content of restored soils from 13% to 20% and 30% would increase soil C retention via sorption and reduce the carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions. To elucidate the role of plant inputs in shaping the microbial community and function, plant litter with contrasting C-to-nitrogen (N) ratios were added to test the hypothesis that a greater portion of plant leaf-C from the nutrient-poor plant, Phragmites australis, would be mineralized to CO2 and CH4 than the nutrient-rich plant, Peltandra virginica. We also expected P. virginica would support a more abundant and diverse microbial community than P. australis. Unexpectedly, we found that increasing the clay content of restored soils caused a marginal reduction in the total amount of C partitioned as CO2 and CH4, while the nutrient-rich plant, P. virginica, emitted more CO2 and CH4 than the nutrient-poor plant, P. australis. Furthermore, clay and plant leaf litter amendments had a greater impact on the size, diversity, and composition of the microbial population in restored than natural wetland soils. Overall, we found that increasing clay content in a restored wetland had a limited effect on soil C retention. We also discovered that plant litter significantly altered the underlying structure of the microbial community in restored wetland soils, suggesting greater plant diversity may lead to a more stable, resilient microbial community. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biogeochemistry; Carbon mineralization; Greenhouse gas; Heterotrophic decomposition; Organic amendments; Soil organic matter","Carbon dioxide; Microorganisms; Nutrients; Restoration; Soils; Textures; Wetlands; Microbial communities; Microbial community structures; Microbial populations; Phragmites australis; Restoration techniques; Restored wetlands; Tidal freshwater wetland; Wetland restoration; Soil pollution; carbon dioxide; clay soil; community structure; grass; microbial activity; microbial community; plant community; soil microorganism; soil texture; species diversity; wetland; Peltandra virginica; Phragmites australis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085652824

Results show that for individual concepts of climate change, interviewees’ perceptions differed across the communities: higher educated communities had more differentiated and diverse conceptions of causes and consequences of climate change and potential countermeasures. Most interviewees, across the communities, stressed that they considered climate change as an important problem, although other social problems seemed more pressing.

The guard cell pair that borders each pore integrates information from environmental and endogenous signals and accordingly swells or deflates, thereby increasing or decreasing the stomatal aperture. Prior research shows that there is a complex cellular network underlying this process. We have previously constructed a signal transduction network and a Boolean dynamic model describing stomatal closure in response to signals including the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA), calcium or reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we improve the Boolean network model such that it captures the biologically expected response of the guard cell in the absence or following the removal of a closure-inducing signal such as ABA or external Ca2+. The expectation from the biological system is reversibility, i.e., the stomata should reopen after the closing signal is removed. We find that the model’s reversibility is obstructed by the previously assumed persistent activity of four nodes. By introducing time-dependent Boolean functions for these nodes, the model recapitulates stomatal reopening following the removal of a signal. The previous version of the model predicts ∼20% closure in the absence of any signal due to uncertainty regarding the initial conditions of multiple network nodes. We systematically test and adjust these initial conditions to find the minimally restrictive combinations that appropriately result in open stomata in the absence of a closure signal. We support these results by an analysis of the successive stabilization of feedback motifs in the network, illuminating the system’s dynamic progression toward the open or closed stomata state. This analysis particularly highlights the role of cytosolic calcium oscillations in causing and maintaining stomatal closure. Overall, we illustrate the strength of the Boolean network modeling framework to efficiently capture cellular phenotypes as emergent outcomes of intracellular biological processes. © Copyright © 2020 Maheshwari, Assmann and Albert.","Boolean model; Boolean network; guard cell; memory; signal transduction; stomatal closure","abscisic acid; calcium ion; Article; Boolean network model; calcium signaling; controlled study; cytosol; feedback system; guard cell; nonbiological model; nonhuman; phenotype; plant stoma; prediction; rest; signal transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089913488

Due to the forced restrictions, pollution level in cities across the country drastically slowed down just within few days which magnetize discussions regarding lockdown to be the effectual alternative measures to be implemented for controlling air pollution. The present article eventually worked on this direction to look upon the air quality scenario amidst the lockdown period scientifically with special reference to the megacity Delhi. With the aid of air quality data of seven pollutant parameters (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and NH3) for 34 monitoring stations spread over the megacity we have employed National Air Quality Index (NAQI) to show the spatial pattern of air quality in pre and during-lockdown phases. The results demonstrated that during lockdown air quality is significantly improved. Among the selected pollutants, concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 have witnessed maximum reduction (&gt;50%) in compare to the pre-lockdown phase. In compare to the last year (i.e. 2019) during the said time period the reduction of PM10 and PM2.5 is as high as about 60% and 39% respectively. Among other pollutants, NO2 (−52.68%) and CO (−30.35%) level have also reduced during-lockdown phase. About 40% to 50% improvement in air quality is identified just after four days of commencing lockdown. About 54%, 49%, 43%, 37% and 31% reduction in NAQI have been observed in Central, Eastern, Southern, Western and Northern parts of the megacity. Overall, the study is thought to be a useful supplement to the regulatory bodies since it showed the pollution source control can attenuate the air quality. Temporary such source control in a suitable time interval may heal the environment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Change of air quality; Covid-19; Lockdown; Megacity Delhi; National Air quality Index","Air pollution control; Air quality; Ammonia; Nitrogen oxides; Air quality data; Air quality indices; Monitoring stations; Pollutant parameters; Pollution level; Pollution sources; Regulatory bodies; Spatial patterns; Quality control; ammonia; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; disease spread; environmental risk; epidemic; particulate matter; population outbreak; respiratory disease; viral disease; air pollutant; air quality; ambient air; Article; communicable disease control; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental parameters; India; industry; lockdown; National Air Quality Index; particulate matter; priority journal; traffic and transport; air pollution; Betacoronavirus; city; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; human; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Delhi; India; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; India; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084056116

The gigantic population growth results in massive waste production, leading to a worrying rise in the level of greenhouse gas emissions, a major global issue. The most common techniques for energy recovery from waste are WTE and landfill gas plants. In this research, four different waste management scenarios have been investigated, and the emitted GHGs are analysed using the IPCC guideline for municipal solid waste (MSW) in Tehran. Furthermore, the total cost of each scenario is calculated. Also, effect of various parameters, such as plant usage, methane recovery factor, and MSW heating value, on the emissions is evaluated. The results depict that among all the investigated alternatives, scenario 3 (in which 50 % of the waste was burned in WTE plant, 30 % landfilled, and 20 % recycled) has the least GHG emissions in the target region. For a more thorough analysis, a cost comparison between the scenarios was performed, indicating that landfilling with recovery is the most economical option. Focusing on various technical, economic, and environmental aspects of waste management, this paper provides a comprehensive framework for a combined plan of action in the waste management sector of Iran. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","GHG emissions; Landfill; Sensitivity analysis; Waste management; WTE plant","Cost benefit analysis; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Population statistics; Recovery; Waste management; Cost comparisons; Economic assessments; Environmental aspects; Management scenarios; Methane recovery; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Population growth; Waste production; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083759610

Due to the thermal potential of industrial wastewater they can be used as a suitable source in heat pumps. This study compares the energy, exergy, economic and environmental aspects of an industrial wastewater heat pump (WSHP) with air source heat pump (ASHP) and geothermal heat pump (GSHP) systems in the city of Mashhad. The results showed that the coefficient of performance (COP) and exergy efficiency of the cycle WSHP were 5.104 and 0.3249, respectively, which were higher than the GSHP and ASHP cycles. Using economic analysis, it was found that the higher initial cycle price and lower power consumption of WSHP than ASHP, WSHP made it more economical after 2 years. According to environmental analysis, the use of WSHP reduced CO2 emissions compared to GSHP and ASHP by 15.67 ton/year and 42.2 ton/year, respectively. Also, a comprehensive study was conducted on casting factories in Iran for the use of the WSHP system.

To date, scant attention has been paid to the mitigation benefits of primary forest protection. We estimated tropical forest ecosystem carbon stocks and flows. The ecosystem carbon stock of primary tropical forests is estimated at 141–159 Pg C (billion tonnes of carbon) which is some 49–53% of all tropical forest carbon, the living biomass component of which alone is 91–103% of the remaining carbon budget to limit global warming to below 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels. Furthermore, tropical forests have ongoing sequestration rates 0.47–1.3 Pg C yr−1, equivalent to 8–13% of annual global anthropogenic CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions. We examined three main forest-based strategies used in the land sector—halting deforestation, increasing forest restoration and improving the sustainable management of production forests. The mitigation benefits of primary forest protection are contingent upon how degradation is defined and accounted for, while those from restoration also depend on how restoration is understood and applied. Through proforestation, reduced carbon stocks in secondary forests can regrow to their natural carbon carrying capacity or primary forest state. We evaluated published data from studies comparing logged and unlogged forests. On average, primary forests store around 35% more carbon. While comparisons are confounded by a range of factors, reported biomass carbon recovery rates were from 40 to 100+ years. There is a substantive portfolio of forest-based mitigation actions and interventions available to policy and decision-makers, depending on national circumstances, in addition to SFM and plantation focused approaches, that can be grouped into four main strategies: protection; proforestation, reforestation and restoration; reform of guidelines, accounting rules and default values; landscape conservation planning. Given the emissions gap, mitigation strategies that merely reduce the rate of emissions against historic or projected reference levels are insufficient. Mitigation strategies are needed that explicitly avoid emissions where possible as well as enabling ongoing sequestration. © 2020, The Author(s).","Carbon stocks; Climate mitigation; Deforestation; Forest degradation; Primary tropical forests; Proforestation","anthropogenic effect; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; carrying capacity; conservation planning; decision making; forest ecosystem; global warming; tropical forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081951601

A popularized assumption in some literature is that youth have little to contribute to discussions on climate change and other aspects of land and resource management; such downplay of youth expertise and engagement may be contributing to climate anxiety (e.g., feelings of hopelessness), particularly in remote communities. Creating opportunities for youth to have a voice in global forums such as the United Nations Conference of Parties (COP24) on Climate Change may offset such anxiety. Building on previous research related to climate action, and the well-being of Indigenous youth, this paper shares the outcomes of research with Indigenous youth (along with family and teachers) from the Mackenzie River Basin who attended COP24 to determine the value of their experience. Key questions guiding these interviews included: How did youth impact others? and How did youth benefit from the experience? Key insights related to the value of a global experience; multiple youth presentations at COP24 were heard by hundreds of people who sought to learn more from youth about their experience of climate change. Additional insights were gathered about the importance of family and community (i.e., webs of support); social networks were seen as key to the success of youth who participated in the event and contributed to youth learning and leadership development. © 2020 by the authors.","Activism; Climate change; Indigenous; Leadership; Learning; Networks; Positive development; Webs of support; Youth","climate change; indigenous population; leadership; resource management; social network; social participation; Canada; Mackenzie Basin [Northwest Territories]; Northwest Territories",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089891893

Nitrogen banlance analysis indicates that 93% of the nitrogen gas produced in DABF was via anammox. Batch tests confirmed that the DABF biofilm reduced nitrite using ammonium as the electron donor, and accumulated nitrite during denitratation, thus providing nitrite for the anammox bacteria.

In this review, we use theoretical and empirical studies of host/parasite interactions to examine these issues, particularly with respect to the threat posed by climate change to fish and parasite communities in intermittent rivers. Intermittent rivers are those that cease to flow at any point in time or space, with isolated pools providing ecological refuges for freshwater biota between streamflow events. Intermittent rivers are the dominant river type in arid, semi-arid and Mediterranean regions; areas of the world that have experienced dramatic decreases in streamflow as a result of climate change. Reduced streamflow decreases the number, size and connectivity of refuge pools in intermittent rivers, with important consequences for free-living aquatic organisms, particularly fishes, and their parasitic fauna. As a result of more frequent and sustained periods of no flow, parasite diversity within refuge pools is expected to decrease, with a concomitant increase in the prevalence and intensity of those parasite species which do survive, particularly host generalists. Decreased connectivity between refuge pool communities should increase the spatial modularity of host/parasite interactions, leading to a greater structuring of host and parasite communities along the river. This increases the probability of species loss (for both hosts and their parasites), as local extinctions cannot be reversed by colonisation from other localities. © 2020","Disease transmission; Freshwater fish; Habitat fragmentation; Intermittent rivers; Refuge pools","water; Antillean; aquatic species; Article; Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis; climate change; crucian carp; disease severity; disease transmission; eutrophication; evapotranspiration; fish; greenhouse effect; habitat structure; Haemoproteus; immunocompetence; metapopulation; nonhuman; parasite; parasitism; prevalence; pygmy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085608964

Here we compared the impacts of CeO2 (nCeO2) and Cr2O3 (nCr2O3) nanoparticles on the taxonomic compositions and functional attributes of bacterial communities under elevated CO2 (eCO2). The stimulated enzyme activities (dehydrogenase, acid phosphatase and urease), increased microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and higher bacterial alpha-diversity were observed under the combined effects of eCO2 and NPs compared to the single NP treatment, indicating eCO2 could mitigate the adverse effect of NPs on soil microorganisms. NPs and eCO2 are important factors influencing the alpha- and beta-diversity (17% and 18% of variations were explained) as well as functional profile (20% and 26% of variations were explained) of bacterial communities. Rising CO2 level promoted the resilience of NP-resistant bacterial populations, primarily the members of Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidia, which are also characterized by the fast carbon use capability. Moreover, the significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher metabolic quotient (qCO2), reduced available carbon and overrepresented carbon metabolism genes at eCO2 vs. ambient CO2 (aCO2) indicate the acceleration of available carbon turnover in NP-exposed soils. Correlation analysis revealed that mitigation of NPs toxicity by eCO2 could be attributed to the remarkable decline of bioavailable metals disassociated from NPs and available carbon level, as well as promotion of the rapid carbon-metabolizing microbes. Our study pointed out the positive role of eCO2 in alleviating the adverse effect of NPs on microbiological soil environment, and results can serve as important basis in establishing guidelines for lowering the ecotoxicity of NPs. © 2020 Elsevier LtdMain finding of the work: Elevated CO2 alleviated the adverse impact of NPs on microbiological soil environment by reducing their solubilization and promoting the rapid carbon-metabolizing microbes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"Atmospheric structure; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cerium oxide; Chromium compounds; Metabolism; Nanoparticles; Phosphatases; Soils; Alpha and beta diversities; Bacterial population; Correlation analysis; Functional attribute; Microbial biomass carbon; Soil bacterial community; Soil micro-organisms; Taxonomic composition; Bacteria; acid phosphatase; carbon; carbon dioxide; cerium oxide nanoparticle; chromium oxide nanoparticle; nanoparticle; oxidoreductase; unclassified drug; urease; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; microbial community; mitigation; nanoparticle; soil microorganism; soil pollution; soil quality; toxicity; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; Bacteroidales; Bacteroidia; bioavailability; carbon metabolism; community structure; controlled study; ecotoxicity; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; Gammaproteobacteria; metabolic parameters; metabolic quotient; microbial biomass; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbial metabolism; nonhuman; soil microflora; soil property; Alphaproteobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Gammaproteobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083500216

The results show that the crop yield deviation are more susceptible to change in temperature than that in sunlight and precipitation. The crop-specific risk level amounts to 1.3–5.3% of the average yields. The risk leads to reducing the cultivated areas by 6% and also causes a significant change in cropland use. As an effective adaptation strategy of mitigating the climate change induced risk, the farms should reduce the total cultivated area by about 15% in comparison with the observed situation while the cropland use structure should be adjusted accordingly. More cropland should be allocated to wheat, peanut and cotton but the other crop areas should be reduced or maintained. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change induced risk; Crop yield deviation; Cropland use; MOTAD model","Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Land use; Risk assessment; Adaptation strategies; Average yield; Crop areas; Crop yield; Jiangsu province; Panel data; Risk levels; Survey data; Climate change; adaptive management; agricultural land; climate change; crop plant; crop yield; cultivation; land use; precipitation (climatology); risk assessment; solar radiation; strategic approach; China; Arachis hypogaea; Gossypium hirsutum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083582695

Renewables have lower external health costs due to the lower life cycle emission of typical air pollutants linked to electricity generation, such as SO2, NOx, particulate matter, NH3, or NMVOC (Non-methane volatile organic compounds), which all appear to have serious negative effects on human health. Our case study performed in the Baltic States analyzed the dynamics of external health costs in parallel with the dynamics of the main health indicators in these countries: life expectancy at birth, mortality rates, healthy life years, self-perceived health, and illness indicators. We employed the data for external health costs retrieved from the CASES database, as well as the health statistics data compiled from the EUROSTAT database. The time range of the study was 2010–2018 due to the availability of consistent health indicators for the EU Member States. Our results show that the decrease of external health costs had a positive impact on the increase of the self-perceived good health and reduction of long-standing illness as well as the decrease of infant death rate. Our conclusions might be useful for other countries as well as for understanding the additional benefits of climate change mitigation policies and tracking their positive health impacts. The cooperation initiatives on clean energy and climate change mitigation between countries like One Belt One Road initiative by the Chinese government can also yield additional benefits linked to the public health improvements. © 2020 by the authors.

The emission reduction effect of controlling the size of the city and improving the quality of the population is remarkable. (2) Policy is another key factor. Comprehensive and appropriate policies are more effective than introducing and applying advanced technologies. Including urban land management, waste separation and metering and charging can be used for it.

In this review, we assess the potential impacts of climate change on blue carbon. Despite uncertainties, carbon sequestration in coastal ecosystems is enhanced by landward migration of blue carbon habitats, maintenance of sediment supply, restoration, and improved water quality. As an example, landward migration of mangroves could result in carbon sequestration of 1.5 Pg by 2100. Mudflats, seaweed beds, and coastal swamp forests could also contribute to climate change mitigation, although there are large data gaps. Achieving the full potential of blue carbon requires protection and restoration of ecosystems and facilitation of changes in ecosystem distributions with climate change, actions that will also deliver adaptation benefits. Conversely, in the worst-case coastal squeeze scenario, losses of 3.4 Pg of sequestered carbon by 2100 could occur. © 2020 The AuthorsBlue carbon is a component of nature-based climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, yet it is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Large data gaps for some blue carbon ecosystems limit projections of the impacts of climate change, but both increases and decreases in blue carbon stocks are likely outcomes. The magnitude of change in blue carbon is dependent on ecosystem type, environmental settings, and human development on coasts. Avoiding coastal squeeze is essential to maintaining blue carbon. © 2020 The Authors","climate change vulnerability; extreme events; mangrove; mudflats; rainfall variation; sabkha; saltmarsh; sea level rise; seagrass; seaweed; sediment organic carbon; tidal marsh","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; mangrove; mudflat; rainfall; saltmarsh",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095437732

Contemporary planning interventions promise salvation via spatial fixes that might reduce carbon emissions, boost metropolitan economies, and allow urban society to thrive in spite of rising seas and climate disasters. New wetlands, floodgates, and other adaptive infrastructures allow water to coexist with urban space; new parks, such as New York’s High Line and Chicago’s 606, celebrate the interweaving of built and natural environments and suggest how outmoded infrastructure can be repurposed for civic benefit. While the climate dilemmas at hand are historically new, the use of landscaped environments in the service of solving social problems is not. Dating to the first generation of urban park development in the 19th century, planners have deployed green spaces as solutions to various cultural, political, and economic conundrums of the city. Offering an historical parallel and counterweight to investigations of contemporary urban–environmental dynamics, this paper investigates the period of park development that occurred in the 19th century in North America and Europe, using Chicago’s Olmsted-designed South Park (the contemporary Washington and Jackson Parks) as a case study. I argue that green spaces’ distinct nexus of (1) normative cultural meanings around nature, (2) power relations bound up in dominant landscape aesthetics, and (3) direct link to the economic realm via the structuring of land values have made green space development a powerful ‘cultural fix’: a means of using social space to mitigate perceived social crises. Understanding the historical foundations of green spaces’ use as cultural fixes can inform contemporary analyses, particularly as new landscape ideologies emerge as part of broader green urbanism development and climate change adaptation strategies. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2018.","built environment; environment/sustainability; green space; nature; planning; public space; theory","climate change; greenspace; historical perspective; ideology; park design; power relations; urban area; urban development; urban society; Europe; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047833402

While subsequent regulations may have resulted in the decrease of some PM matrices, the simultaneous changes in climate affecting local meteorological conditions could also have played a role. To gain an insight into this complex matter, this study investigated the long-term trends of two important matrices, the particle mass (PM2.5) and particle number concentrations (PNC), and the factors that influenced the trends. Mann-Kendall test, Sen's slope estimator, the generalised additive model, seasonal decomposition of time series by LOESS (locally estimated scatterplot smoothing) and the Buishand range test were applied. Both PM2.5 and PNC showed significant negative monotonic trends (0.03–0.6 μg m−3. yr−1 and 0.40–3.8 × 103 particles. cm−3. yr−1, respectively) except Brisbane (+0.1 μg m−3. yr−1 and +53 particles. cm−3. yr−1, respectively). For the period covered in this study, temperature increased (0.03–0.07 °C.yr−1) in all cities except London; precipitation decreased (0.02–1.4 mm. yr−1) except in Helsinki; and wind speed was reduced in Brisbane and Rochester but increased in Helsinki, London and Augsburg. At the change-points, temperature increase in cold cities influenced PNC while shifts in precipitation and wind speed affected PM2.5. Based on the LOESS trend, extreme events such as dust storms and wildfires resulting from changing climates caused a positive step-change in concentrations, particularly for PM2.5. In contrast, among the mitigation measures, controlling sulphur in fuels caused a negative step-change, especially for PNC. Policies regarding traffic and fleet management (e.g. low emission zones) that were implemented only in certain areas or in a progressive uptake (e.g. Euro emission standards), resulted to gradual reductions in concentrations. Therefore, as this study has clearly shown that PM2.5 and PNC were influenced differently by the impacts of the changing climate and by the mitigation measures, both metrics must be considered in urban air quality management. © 2020","Climate variabilities; Mitigation; Particle number concentration; PM2.5; Ultrafine particles","Air quality; Fleet operations; Matrix algebra; Particulate emissions; Quality management; Sediments; Storms; Wind; Climate variability; Mitigation; Particle number concentration; PM2.5; Ultrafine particle; Climate change; fuel; sulfur; climate change; concentration (composition); dust storm; extreme event; particle size; particulate matter; trend analysis; urban atmosphere; wildfire; wind velocity; air quality; Article; Australia; climate change; concentration (parameter); dust storm; England; environmental factor; environmental impact; environmental temperature; Finland; Germany; particulate matter; precipitation; seasonal variation; trend study; urban area; wildfire; wind speed; air pollutant; air pollution; city; climate change; environmental monitoring; particle size; particulate matter; Augsburg; Australia; Bavaria; Brisbane; England; Finland; Germany; Helsinki; London [England]; New York [United States]; Queensland; Rochester; United Kingdom; United States; Varsinais-Suomi; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; London; Particle Size; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082708504

Methane concentrations (MeC) were measured using a nondispersive infrared methane detector installed within the feed bin of the automatic milking system during 14- to 21-d periods. Rumination time (RT; min/d) was collected using collars with a tag that registered time (minutes) spent eating and ruminating. The means of MeC and methane production (MeP) were 1,254.28 ppm and 182.49 g/d, respectively; mean RT was 473.38 min/d. Variance components for MeC, MeP, and RT were estimated with REML using pedigree and genomic information in a single-step model. Heritabilities for MeC and MeP were 0.11 and 0.12, respectively. Rumination time showed a slightly larger heritability estimate (0.17). The genetic correlation between MeP and MeC was high (&gt;0.95), suggesting that selection on either trait would lead to a positive correlated response on the other. Negative correlations were estimated between RT and MeC (−0.24 ± 0.38) and MeP (−0.43 ± 0.35). Methane concentration and MeP had slightly positive correlations with milk yield (0.17 ± 0.39 and 0.21 ± 0.36), protein percentage (0.08 ± 0.32 and 0.30 ± 0.45), protein yield (0.22 ± 0.41 and 0.31 ± 0.35), fat percentage (0.02 ± 0.40 and 0.27 ± 0.36), and fat yield (0.27 ± 0.28 and 0.29 ± 0.28) from bivariate analyses. Rumination time had positive correlations with milk yield (0.41 ± 0.75) and protein yield (0.26 ± 0.57) and negative correlations with fat yield (−0.45 ± 0.32), protein percentage (−0.15 ± 0.38), and fat percentage (−0.40 ± 0.47). A positive approximated genetic correlation was estimated between fertility and MeC (0.10 ± 0.05) and MeP (0.18 ± 0.05), resulting in slightly higher CH4 production when selecting for better fertility [days open estimated breeding values (EBV) are expressed with mean 100 and SD 10, inversely related to days from calving to conception; that is, greater days open EBV implies better fertility]. Positive correlations were also estimated for stature with MeC and MeP (0.30 ± 0.04 and 0.43 ± 0.04, respectively). Other type traits (chest width, udder depth, angularity, and capacity) were positively correlated with methane traits, possibly because of higher milk yield and higher feed intake from these animals. Rumination time showed positive EBV correlations with production traits and type traits, and negative correlations with somatic cell count and body condition score. Based on the genetic correlations and heritabilities estimated in this study, methane is measurable and heritable, and estimates of genetic correlations suggest no strong opposition to current breeding objectives in Spanish Holsteins. © 2020 American Dairy Science Association","genetic parameter; Holstein; methane; proxies; rumination time","methane; air pollutant; animal; bovine; breeding; cell count; dairying; eating; female; fertility; genetic selection; genetics; genomics; greenhouse gas; lactation; metabolism; milk; pedigree; phenotype; physiology; Spain; udder; veterinary medicine; Air Pollutants; Animals; Breeding; Cattle; Cell Count; Dairying; Eating; Female; Fertility; Genomics; Greenhouse Gases; Lactation; Mammary Glands, Animal; Methane; Milk; Pedigree; Phenotype; Selection, Genetic; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085558855

A novel theoretical framework was recently proposed to expand the RAH among populations within species (RAHintra), but unresolved conceptual issues and considerable gaps surrounding the new hypothesis still need to be addressed. Here we tested the RAHintra predictions in a pine tree species using population-level correlations among plant traits and climate as a proxy of resource availability. We analysed genetic variation among 10 maritime pine populations in growth, constitutive and induced chemical defences and resistance to herbivory in a glasshouse experiment. We used a clonally replicated collection with family structure and accounted for the neutral genetic differentiation with Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) data. Most of our results agree with the predictions of the RAHintra. As postulated, growth showed a positive relation with resource availability at population origin. Constitutive investment in phenolics (but not in terpenes) and antiherbivore resistance was also positively related to resource availability at population origin, as theory predicts. Conversely, we did not detect relationships between resource availability and the inducibility of any of the traits. A trade-off between constitutive investment and inducibility of chemical defences was observed for phenolics, as expected, but not for terpenes. A positive relationship between growth and constitutive resistance was also found likely due to reduced physiological constraints under suitable conditions in the glasshouse experiment. Our study provides evidence and support for the RAHintra, highlighting the strong influence of resource availability in shaping genetically based patterns of local adaptive variation among populations. We detected clinal patterns in phenolic investment along a resource availability gradient, suggesting that population local adaptation to resource availability has more implications for investment in phenolics than for terpenes.

In central São Paulo, Brazil, air quality monitoring stations and tree-ring analyses revealed a decreasing trend in the concentrations of particulate matter and metals. Such trends, however, may not be observed in industrial districts located in the urban periphery, where the usual mobile sources may be combined with local stationary sources. To evaluate environmental pollution in an industrial district in southeastern São Paulo, we assessed its spatial variability, by measuring magnetic properties and concentrations of Al, Ba, Ca, Cl, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, P, S, Sr, Zn in the bark of 62 trees, and its temporal trends, by measuring Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, V, Zn in tree rings of three trees. Source apportionment analysis based on tree barks revealed two clusters with high concentrations of metals, one related to vehicular and industrial emissions (Al, Ba, Cu, Fe, Zn) in the east side of the industrial cluster, and the other related to soil resuspension (Cu, Zn, Mn) in its west side. These patterns are also supported by the magnetic properties of bark associated with iron oxides and titanium-iron alloy concentrations. Dendrochemical analyses revealed that only the concentrations of Pb consistently decreased over the last four decades. The concentrations of Cd, Cu, Ni, V, and Zn did not significantly decrease over time, in contrast with their negative trends previously reported in central São Paulo. This combined biomonitoring approach revealed spatial clusters of metal concentration in the vicinity of this industrial cluster and showed that the local population has not benefited from the decreasing polluting metal concentrations in the last decades. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Biomonitoring; Dendrochemistry; Megacities; Tree bark; Tree ring","Air quality; Forestry; Iron alloys; Iron oxides; Magnetic properties; Metals; Soil pollution; Titanium alloys; Titanium oxides; Zinc; Air quality monitoring stations; Alloy concentration; Environmental pollutions; Industrial districts; Metal concentrations; Source apportionment; Spatial variability; Stationary sources; Industrial emissions; aluminum; barium; cadmium; calcium; chloride; copper; iron; iron oxide; lead; magnesium; nickel; phosphorus; potassium; strontium; sulfur; titanium; vanadium; zinc; heavy metal; metal; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biomonitoring; concentration (composition); industrial district; metal; particulate matter; spatial variation; temporal variation; air pollution; air quality; Article; bark; Brazil; chemical composition; concentration (parameter); environmental factor; environmental monitoring; Fabaceae; industrial area; Kuntze; nonhuman; particle resuspension; particulate matter; Poicianella pluviosa; population structure; spatiotemporal analysis; Tipuana tipu; tree; city; environmental monitoring; pollution; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Sao Paulo [Sao Paulo (STT)]; Brazil; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Metals; Metals, Heavy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083481939

After controlling for population, household income, age structures, household size, and different urban forms (urbanization, urban density, housing type, building density), the paper reveals that the age group responsible for the highest CO2 emissions is 50–69, followed by 20–34 and 35–49. Moreover, compared with other groups, the road transport activities of age group 35–49 are highly constrained by household income. The paper also shows that there is an inverted U-shape relationship between household CO2 road-related emissions and building densities. However, it indicates certain limitations on city planners when it comes to reducing household CO2 road-related emissions by bringing the downtown area closer. Moreover, the paper also identifies a so-called compensatory mechanism supporting the hypothesis that building densities have positive effects. Furthermore, the coefficient of low-density housing is positive and significant, implying that the private gardens of low-density housing might not be the reason for the hypothesized compensatory mechanism.

The ES hypothesis was first proposed in a study conducted in the Mediterranean climate region, based on the stable isotope method in 2010. To date, the ES hypothesis has proven to be widespread around the world. The ES hypothesis is a new understanding of the soil water movement process, which is different from the assumption that only one soil reservoir in the traditional hydrology. It is helpful to clear the water sources of plants and establish a new model of the ecohydrological process. However, the theoretical basis and mechanism of the ES hypothesis are still unclear. Therefore, we analyzed the characteristics of ES phenomenon in different climatic regions, summarized the research methods used for the ES hypothesis, concluded the definitions of tightly bound water and mobile water, discussed the mechanism of isotopic differences of different reservoirs and their impacts on ES evaluation and pointed out the existing problems of the ES hypothesis.

As a foundational work for VOCs control, previous VOCs inventories usually treated the petroleum refining industry as an integrated part resulting the unknown of VOCs emission characteristic among different units. Refined management has becoming an inevitability with the increasing strictness of environment standards. This study aims to develop a holistic method for VOCs emission inventory of the petroleum refining industry toward specificity, accuracy and economization, in which a source categorization was proposed from unit angle, and a systematic estimation method was developed from the material flow point of view. This method provides a more specific and accurate quantification method, especially for fugitive emission sources which is a pivotal but difficult problem in VOCs inventory establishment. Through application to a typical medium-scale refinery located in northern China, a unit-specific VOCs emission inventory with 48 emission sources and respective local VOCs emission factors (EFs) was established. Estimation results and economic cost of the developed method were compared with those of other methods. In this study, the integrated EF was 0.77 kg-VOCs/t-crude oil refined, which was in the same order with most previous studies. Inventory results implied that increasing hydrotreating unit, reducing chemical device and solvent-used unit (e.g., polypropylene production, furfural refining unit), upgrading catalytic reforming unit were beneficial to control VOCs emissions in this study. Using floating-roof tanks rather than fixed-roof tanks is an effective way to reduce VOCs emissions from storage tanks, which decrease 72%–86% of diesel storage emissions. Economic cost analysis showed that the advantage of this method lied in lower labor cost, and no subsequent monitoring cost. Suggestions proposed from this study provide feasible measures for local policy makers to control VOCs emission and determine abatement strategies of the petroleum chemical industry. Meanwhile, this study greatly helps enterprises promote the fine management of VOCs-containing materials from the overall processes to identify VOCs control emphasis. © 2020","Material flow; Petroleum refining industry; VOCs control Suggestions; VOCs emission Inventory","Catalytic reforming; Chemical industry; Cost accounting; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Gasoline; Industrial emissions; Petroleum industry; Polypropylenes; Process control; Roofs; Tanks (containers); Volatile organic compounds; Wages; Accurate quantifications; Emission characteristics; Emission inventories; Environment standards; Estimation results; Hydrotreating unit; Source categorization; Volatile organic compound emission; Petroleum refining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083324601

China has been the largest emitter of carbon dioxide worldwide since 2008, and its current energy structure is still coal-dominated, which further increases carbon emissions. The reduction in these carbon emissions is a focus of attention in China, and the carbon reduction potential is particularly studied with the aim to issue appropriate mitigation policies. This study calculates the total embodied carbon emissions from a multi-sector perspective, using the economic input–output life cycle assessment model and analyzing the carbon reduction potential of Liaoning province, China. The level of export and provincial outflow consumption is the primary cause that leads to embodied carbon emissions from the consumption demand perspective. The carbon reduction potential is divided into three grades (weak, medium, and strong). Energy-intensive industries were classified as high carbon emission industries with the strongest potential for carbon emission reduction. This study provides policy insights that will aid the preparation of emissions reduction strategies. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon emissions reduction potential; Economic input–output life cycle assessment model; Embodied carbon emissions; Liaoning province","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; coal mining; economic analysis; electrical power; emission control; life cycle analysis; mitigation; strategic approach; thermal power; China; Liaoning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070276373

The developed model can tackle multiple uncertain parameters expressed as interval values, random variables presented as probability distributions in constraints, and provide optimized solutions under different fractional objectives. The proposed method is then applied for renewable energy system and air pollutant management in Guang-Fo-Zhao region. Two objectives are embedded in this strategic planning. One is to maximize renewable power generation per unit system cost, and the other one is to maximize gas air pollutant reduction per unit system cost. The result shows that, in the first objective, the increased rate of generating capacity from renewable energy per unit cost in Guang-Fo-Zhao region is much higher than that of a cost-efficient energy planning. In the second objective, the pollutant emission reduction per unit cost will be greatly improved in Guang-Fo-Zhao region.

The LCA is used by the California Air Resources Board's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) program to calculate CI and monetary credits are issued based on the difference between a given fuel's CI and a reference fuel's CI. Through the Tier 2 certification program under which individual fuel production facilities can submit their own CIs with their facility input data, the LCFS has driven innovative technologies to biofuel conversion facilities, resulting in substantial reductions in GHG emissions as compared to the baseline gasoline or diesel. A similar approach can be taken to allow feedstock petition in the LCFS so that lower-CI feedstock can be rewarded. Here we examined the potential for various agronomic practices to improve the GHG profiles of corn ethanol by performing feedstock-level CI analysis for the Midwestern United States. Our system boundary covers GHG emissions from the cradle-to-farm-gate activities (i.e. farm input manufacturing and feedstock production), along with the potential impacts of soil organic carbon change during feedstock production. We conducted scenario-based CI analysis of ethanol, coupled with regionalized inventory data, for various farming practices to manage corn fields, and identified key parameters affecting cradle-to-farm-gate GHG emissions. The results demonstrate large spatial variations in CI of ethanol due to farm input use and land management practices. In particular, adopting conservation tillage, reducing nitrogen fertilizer use, and implementing cover crops has the potential to reduce GHG emissions per unit corn produced when compared to a baseline scenario of corn-soybean rotation. This work shows a large potential emission offset opportunity by allowing feedstock producers a path to Tier 2 petitions that reward low-CI feedstocks and further reduce biofuels' CI. The prevalence of significant acreage that has not been optimized for CI suggests that policy changes that incentivize optimization of this parameter could provide significant additionality over current trends in farm efficiency and adoption of conservation practice. © UChicago Argonne, LLC.

To construct our modeling scenario, we first convert the Agreement's disparate Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) pledges into equivalent reductions in CO2 emissions relative to a baseline scenario without the Agreement. We then model the Agreement by solving for a CO2 price path in each region that would gradually fulfill the region's NDC pledge by its target date. The resulting paths are quite different across regions, indicating significant differences in marginal abatement costs. We also find that if all regions achieve their NDCs, the Agreement significantly reduces CO2 emissions relative to baseline. However, global emissions would not decline in absolute terms relative to 2015 levels, let alone follow a path consistent with a 2 °C stabilization scenario. We then construct additional scenarios to explore how the outcomes of the Agreement would change if particular countries (the United States, China, and Australia) were to unilaterally withdraw from it without undertaking alternative climate policies. We find that leaving the Agreement raises GDP for the country that leaves, but it also sharply reduces the domestic co-benefits the country receives as a side effect of controlling CO2. For each country we consider, the net effect of withdrawing is negative: the loss of co-benefits exceeds the gain in GDP. That is, we show that when co-benefits are considered, it is in each country's self-interest to remain in the Agreement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon pricing; Carbon taxes; Climate change; G-cubed; Global macroeconomic modeling; Paris Agreement","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate agreement; Climate policy; CO2 emissions; Environmental outcome; Global economics; Global emissions; Marginal abatement costs; World economy; Climate models; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy efficiency; energy policy; Gross Domestic Product; international agreement; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087655344

To date, much research has been conducted on the ingenious design and rational construction of GQDs-based nanomaterials used as electrode materials and/or electrocatalysts. Despite these efforts, research on the efficient synthesis and application of GQDs-based nanomaterials is still in the early stages of development and timely updates of recent research progress on new design concepts, synthetic strategies, and significant breakthroughs in GQDs-based nanomaterials are highly desired. In light of the above, the effect of synthetic methods on the final product of the GQDs, the GQDs synthesis mechanism, and specific perspectives regarding the effect of the unique surface and structural properties of GQDs (e.g., defects, heteroatom doping, surface/edge state, size, conductivity) on the electrochemical energy-related systems are discussed in-depth in this review. Additionally, this review also focuses on the design of GQDs-based composites and their applications in the fields of electrochemical energy storage (e.g., supercapacitors and batteries) and electrocatalysis (e.g., fuel cell, water splitting, CO2 reduction), along with constructive suggestions for addressing the remaining challenges in the field. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, it has led to spatial shifts of negative environmental impacts induced by electricity generations, including water consumption and carbon emissions. This study calculates that, from 2010 to 2016, carbon emissions and water consumption to produce the transmitted electricity have grown from 507 Mt and 2.7 km3 respectively to 642 Mt and 6.5 km3. Applying a structural decomposition model coupled with a Quasi-Input-Output model to quantify the driving factors of such increases, we find that GDP increase has played the dominant role in driving the increase of both factors. Our results also highlight the potential conflicts between carbon reduction and water conservation in developing future electricity transmission infrastructure systems. Changing the electric power sector's energy portfolio and the transmission structure by increasingly utilizing hydropower productions have both contributed to national total carbon emissions reductions, but at the expenses of increased national water consumption. As a result, on a national level, in 2016, due to the inter-provincial differences in energy portfolios and technologies, electricity transmissions have led to 155.27 Mt of net carbon reduction and 3.4 km³ of additional net water consumption compared to the counterfactual scenario where no electricity transmission were facilitated. The future expansion of electricity transmission network needs to consider such trade-offs, particularly within the contexts of global climate change mitigation and emergent challenges posed by water stresses. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Electricity transmission; Quasi-input-output model; Structural decomposition analysis; Water consumption","carbon; water; carbon dioxide; carbon balance; carbon emission; climate change; decomposition analysis; electricity supply; environmental impact assessment; global climate; Gross Domestic Product; hydroelectric power plant; water use efficiency; Article; China; climate change; electricity; environmental impact; global climate; natural resource; power supply; water conservation; water stress; water supply; China; electricity; China; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Electricity; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084518272

Therefore, more effective policies should be implemented for the management of demolition waste. This study combines life cycle assessment (LCA) with life cycle costing (LCC) to analyze the environmental and economic drivers of three different waste disposal scenarios in Guangzhou, China, in the context of carbon trading: S1 (landfilling), S2 (recycled aggregate), and S3 (recycled powder). In this study, the carbon emissions of demolition waste were obtained by LCA, and the carbon emission cost was calculated based on the carbon price in the carbon trading market of Guangdong Province. The LCA results showed that waste recycling can greatly reduce carbon emissions. The results showed that compared to S1, S2 reduced 6.790 x 108 kg CO2 eq. Additionally, S3 reduced 4.172 x 108 kg CO2 eq. compared to S2. The LCC results show that waste recycling can greatly reduce the total costs of the demolition sector, while the production of recycled powder can generate 57.35% of the revenue from recycled aggregate to the recycling plant. This study combines LCA and LCC, and considers environmental factors to assess the economic results using carbon emissions cost, thereby forging a new exploration method in the field of life cycle theory. The findings of this study could provide a basis for the formulation of a new demolition waste management policy. In the case of the gradual implementation of carbon trading, it could also provide new ideas for current demolition waste treatment from economic and environmental perspectives. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; Demolition waste; Environmental assessment; LCA; Recycling","carbon emission; cost analysis; demolition; economic analysis; emissions trading; environmental assessment; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; recycling; waste disposal; waste treatment; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089818805

This paper extends the current analytical structure by integrating the population migration process from rural to urban areas with the energy system into a systematic framework, within which a link between urbanization and energy service demands through direct and indirect effects is built. Taking China as a study case, the results show that approximately 333 million people from rural areas are expected to migrate to urban areas toward 2050, resulting in the expansion of large-sized cities and the rapid growth of future energy service demands. Without significant technological improvements, urbanization will lead to more than double and triple the current energy consumption levels by 2050 in the building and transport sectors, respectively, while energy consumption growth in the industry sector will be the largest due to the rising demand for materials through the indirect effect. As a result, urbanization in China will cause more than double the total primary energy demand and an 82% increase in the carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, compared with 2013. In response, major mitigation measures and the role of each sector in the low carbon urbanization transition have been identified. Non-fossil fuel power generation is the top mitigation strategy, which can contribute 40% to the total mitigation potential, while power sector and industrial sector play a key role in realizing an earlier peak for the whole country. The total capital investment needed in each period will cost less than 2.5% of the total gross domestic product (GDP). Therefore, this work highlights the importance of understanding urbanization impact on energy system through applying an integrated population-energy-environment analytical framework and synthesizing the urbanization and long-term low carbon strategies in developing countries which are under rapid urbanization process. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Energy service demand; Energy system model; Low carbon transition; Population migration; Urbanization","carbon emission; demand analysis; developing world; economic growth; Gross Domestic Product; investment; population migration; power generation; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087053387

Coal stove replacement started in the “Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH)” region and is expanding throughout northern China. Removing coal stoves reduces air pollutant emissions and hence is beneficial for both air quality and public health, as well as offering greenhouse gas mitigation co-benefits. However, there is little discussion of the economic costs of various clean heating technologies. In this study, we estimate total annual costs (TAC, annualized capital costs plus annual operating costs) for rural households, across cities/counties in the BTH region, to replace their coal stoves with several prevalent clean options—air-source heat pumps with fan coils (ASHPwF), electric resistance heaters with thermal storage (RHwTS), natural gas heaters (NGH), and clean coal briquettes with improved stoves (CCIS). We find: 1) Without subsidies, CCIS have the lowest TAC of all clean options. TAC of unsubsidized CCIS approximately doubles TAC of raw coal with improved stoves (RCIS), while unsubsidized electric/gas heaters cost 3–5 times more than RCIS. Thus, it is important for governments to financially support households' replacement of their coal stoves with clean heaters to facilitate widespread adoption. 2) With subsidies, CCIS have the lowest TAC in all regions except Beijing. In Beijing, generous subsides make ASHPwF—the most energy-efficient option—have the lowest TAC. In Tianjin, TAC of subsidized ASHPwF are slightly higher than CCIS and NGH. Throughout Hebei, except for a few severely cold northern counties where gas prices are high, subsidized NGH have lower TAC than ASHPwF and RHwTS. 3) Cost competitiveness of ASHPwF increases as heat demand increases, (e.g., higher desired indoor temperatures, larger home sizes, etc.) indicating that ASHP are good options for households with larger home sizes and commercial buildings. 4) Substantial potential exists to reduce heating expenses by improving building energy efficiency particularly in severely cold regions. 5) Cost advantages of NGH vary sharply with gas prices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Clean coal; Clean heating; Gas heaters; Heat pumps; Resistance heaters","Air quality; Air source heat pumps; Briquets; Coal; Coal storage; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heat resistance; Heat storage; Office buildings; Operating costs; Stoves; Air pollutant emission; Annual operating costs; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Building energy efficiency; Commercial building; Cost competitiveness; Electric resistance heaters; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Heating; cold region; competitiveness; cooking appliance; cost-benefit analysis; energy efficiency; energy market; energy resource; governance approach; heat production; heating; household energy; rural area; China; Jingjinji",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088826442

This study presents continuous and simultaneous measurements at surface and on a mountain site above the wintertime planetary boundary layer influenced by uplifted surface anthropogenic emissions. BC was observed efficiently transported upwards by daytime convective mixing. However, this vertical transport was less for other particulate masses. An about twofold higher BC mass fraction was thus present at mountain than surface, hereby a lowered single-scattering albedo (SSA) by 0.06. This may be caused by the evaporative loss of condensed semivolatile materials, prevailing the secondary particulate formation, in a cleaner environment containing less precursors. The elevated BC mass corresponded with the most intensive solar radiation at midday, wielding more heating impacts over the planetary boundary layer (PBL). This phenomenon may apply to other remote regions where a reduced SSA will introduce more positive radiative effects. © 2020. American Geophysical Union.

However, the CO2 reduction efficiency in these bioelectrical systems is always relatively low and limits their application in real projects. In this study, biogas upgrading performance was compared in two different microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) constructed with different biocathode materials: carbon brush or a graphite plate. Both CH4 content and CH4 yield were higher in the carbon brush reactor than in the graphite plate reactor (91.2% vs 89.8%, 5.2 mmol/day vs 4.3 mmol/day). A higher proportion of CO2 was reduced to CH4 in the carbon brush reactor (22.7%) than of the graphite plate reactor (6.5%). In addition, the bioelectrochemical CO2 reduction efficiency of the carbon brush reactor reached as high as 602 mol/day/m3. Microbial community analysis revealed that Methanothrix, a genus of acetoclastic methanogens that can directly accept electrons for CO2 reduction, dominated the archaeal community in both reactors. Transcriptomic studies also revealed that Methanothrix species colonizing the carbon brush surface were actively expressing genes that code for enzymes required for electromethanogenesis but not for acetoclastic methanogenesis. These results suggest that Methanothrix species were participating in direct electron transfer (DET) in the carbon brush reactor and that carbon brush is a better biocathode material in bioelectrochemical biogas upgrading systems.

The article therefore examines how planning and implementing authorities address environmental uncertainty and what implications this may have for relocation outcomes. In the case of coastal erosion and related relocation schemes in Central Vietnam, linked to climate change, the article focuses on responsible government institutions. It looks at the governmental practices they employ to manage environmental change and related relocation. Based on field study, in-depth interviews, and document and policy review, the article finds that the sub-national institutions responsible for relocation attempted to make environmental change legible through quantifying and standardizing fluctuations in coastal erosion. These technical approaches carried through planning and implementation. They contributed to rigid relocation programmes in which households’ input and adaptive outcomes were limited and other political goals were realized through territorialization. The findings support literature on the highly political nature of adaptation and challenge the prominence of technical approaches to adaptation. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change adaptation; governance; relocation; resettlement; Vietnam","adaptive management; climate change; coastal erosion; environmental change; environmental planning; strategic approach; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073833786

In the urban heating sector, quick-win plans use to be popular that focus on the NOx reduction by replacing untreated scattered coal fired boilers to natural gas or combined heat and power generators (CHPs). Meanwhile, in the electrical sector, all these fossil fuel generators should be cut down in the long-term decarbonization process. There should be a need for coordination of short- and long-term targets, because two energy supply sectors are believed to work in a coupled way in the future. A three-layered collaborative planning model is proposed in this paper: the top layer focuses roadmap economic evaluation; the middle layer applies coupled production simulation aiming at verifying energy balance; and the bottom one checks real-time operational feasibility. Pathways are made from 2020 to 2040 based on Hebei, China. Results indicate that the pathway with quick win will have delayed construction of renewable power, resulting the slow process in emission control. The long-term strategy scheme greatly promotes the renewables for supply in both sectors, but the close operational link forces the decoupling, leading to rebound on emission and operation cost on decentralized heating for the long-term future. In conclusion, the tradeoff pathway, reducing CO2 emission as much as possible with NOx emission controlled to acceptable level, is recommended with good performance on emission control and economy. © 2020 IEEE.","Clean roadmap; Long-term strategy; Power supply; Quick win; Urban heating","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Coal fired boilers; Coal industry; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Gas fired boilers; Nitrogen oxides; Collaborative planning; Combined heat and power; Decentralized heating; Economic evaluations; Fossil fuel generators; Long-term strategy; Operational feasibility; Production simulation; Process control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099146969

We used these features to investigate the peculiar emission behavior of the as-grown and rapid thermal annealing (RTA)-treated a-plane MgZnO epi-films, from which an anomalous emission was observed at ∼325 nm, along with a rapid increase in near-band edge (NBE) emission with increasing x-ray irradiation time. This peculiar emission behavior was also observed in the cathodoluminescence spectra obtained under electron beam excitation. Increases in the NBE emission intensity of the RTA-treated a-plane MgZnO epi-film were observed in terms of both photoluminescence and small anomalous emissions of XEOL. This can be explained by the effective transfer of Mg atoms from interstitial sites to suitable sites as a result of RTA treatment. Based on comparison with an a-plane ZnO epi-film without Mg, we conclude that the anomalous emission peak is caused by Mg-related energy states created by the high-dose x-ray or electron beam irradiation. Furthermore, the rapid increase in NBE emission and the reduction in the long decay lifetime can be attributed to charge transfer from the Mg clusters, which are thus responsible for the anomalous emissions. © 2020 Author(s).",,"Charge transfer; Electron beams; Hybrid materials; II-VI semiconductors; Irradiation; Luminescence; Oxide minerals; Rapid thermal annealing; Semiconductor alloys; X rays; Zinc oxide; Anomalous emissions; Cathodoluminescence spectra; Electron beam excitation; Electron beam irradiation; Luminescence dynamics; Near band edge emissions; Rapid thermal annealing (RTA); X-ray excited optical luminescence; Magnesium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089937488

The discovery inspires us to explore the mid-infrared interband cascade laser (ICL) in SiGeSn system. Based on the eight-band k ⋅ p model, we theoretically design three schemes of ICL, in which the active region and the carrier injectors are optimized simultaneously. Afterward, the properties of TE-mode optical gain spectrums and differential gain are investigated individually for each scheme. Furthermore, the spontaneous emission spectrums and radiative current density are also calculated. Our theoretical results indicate that the active region composed of double-electron and triple-hole quantum wells has the best gain performance, reaching 660 cm-1 for a single period of the ICL under 7.8 1018 cm-3 injected electron density.

In this study, a long-term multi-regional power system planning model is proposed with monthly, regional and sectorial demand forecast, describing fluctuation of renewable power, and optimization of installed capacity, power grids and storage facilities. The most cost-effective renewable power deployment of Southwest China is presented as a case study due to abundant renewable resources, significant monthly fluctuation and insufficient infrastructure. Scenario analysis is conducted to address policy uncertainties of carbon tax and power substitution. Results show that albeit limiting and reducing coal power is necessary, de-capacity policies cannot be implemented equally in all regions considering its ability to handle renewable power volatility. To enhance system flexibility, storage facilities are required in Sichuan and Yunnan whilst fossil power plants are required in Chongqing and Guizhou. For cross-region integrating of renewable power, two separate grids in China should be connected between Chongqing and Guizhou. Hydropower could be delivered to eastern regions to meet peak loads of summer cooling. The Southeast power exported to South regions would gradually decrease since its demand increase rapidly. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Modelling and optimization; Power system planning; Renewable; Scenario analysis; Southwest China","Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Fossil fuel power plants; Uncertainty analysis; Fossil power plants; Installed capacity; Regional power systems; Renewable resource; Scenario analysis; Scenarios analysis; Storage facilities; System flexibility; Electric power transmission networks; alternative energy; cost analysis; energy planning; energy policy; numerical model; optimization; scenario analysis; China; Chongqing; Guizhou; Sichuan; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084208670

Demonstrated here is the self-assembly and CO2 photoreduction performance of two thermodynamically reversibly converted polyoxo-titanium clusters (PTCs), Ti4-C8A and Ti7-C8A, using calix[8]arene with high molecular degrees of freedom and variable conformations as an organic ""functional armor"". Because of the rich coordination sites and bridging modes of calix[8]arene, the obvious electron transfer effect generated between the titanium-oxo core and calix[8]arene ligand extended the light absorption of the two PTCs from the traditional ultraviolet to the visible region. Moreover, the hydrophobic benzene groups in calix[8]arene endowed the two clusters with high structural and chemical stability in aqueous solutions with different pH values. On this foundation, these two stable and photosensitive clusters were used as heterogeneous molecular photocatalysts for efficient CO2 reduction in water (with triethanolamine as a sacrificial agent) and they exhibited very high CO2-to-HCOO- conversion activity and selectivity. Most importantly, this is the first report of molecular coordination complexes in water containing a sacrificial agent to perform heterogeneous CO2 reduction reaction.

Two plausible emissions distribution principles are considered. Under neither the inertia principle nor the equity principle, can continuing economic growth be made compatible with requirements of climate stabilization in all three regions. This conclusion does not change significantly when plausible acceleration of emissions intensity reduction in the future is taken into account. To limit global warming to not more than 2 degrees Celsius by the end of this century, at least two of the three large regions need to reorganize their economies to operate with zero or negative growth. Such a reorganization cannot be achieved under a capitalist economic system given the inherent tendency of capitalism towards endless accumulation. Neither is it likely to be achieved under any conceivable economic system dominated by market relations. © 2020, University Library System, University of Pittsburgh.

We used data on PM2.5 concentration, industrial energy consumption structure, economic development and transportation in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding cities from 2000 to 2017, and analyzed the spatial effect of industrial energy consumption structure and traffic factors on haze pollution by using spatial autoregressive model (SAR) and spatial error model (SEM). The results indicated that: (1) The global spatial correlation analysis showed that haze pollution had a significant positive spatial correlation, and the local spatial correlation analysis showed that the high-high clusters of PM2.5 were located in the south and middle of the region; (2) The change of industrial energy consumption structure was highly correlated with haze pollution, namely, the increase of industrial energy consumption led to the deterioration of environmental quality; (3) The change of economic development was highly correlated with haze pollution. There was no clear EKC relationship between haze pollution and economic development in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and surrounding cities. However, the relationship was similar to inverted U-shaped curve; (4) The change of traffic jam was highly correlated with haze pollution, namely, the increase of fuel consumption per unit road area led to the deterioration of environmental quality. Based on the above results, from the perspective of space, the long-term measures for haze control in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding cities can be explored from the aspects of energy conservation and emission reduction, industrial transfer, vehicle emission control, traffic restrictions and purchase restrictions. © 2020 by the authors.

To control the rapid dispersion of the virus, China has imposed national lockdown policies to practise social distancing. This has led to reduced human activities and hence primary air pollutant emissions, which caused improvement of air quality as a side-product. To investigate the air quality changes during the COVID-19 lockdown over the YRD Region, we apply the WRF-CAMx modelling system together with monitoring data to investigate the impact of human activity pattern changes on air quality. Results show that human activities were lowered significantly during the period: industrial operations, VKT, constructions in operation, etc. were significantly reduced, leading to lowered SO2, NOx, PM2.5 and VOCs emissions by approximately 16–26%, 29–47%, 27–46% and 37–57% during the Level I and Level II response periods respectively. These emission reduction has played a significant role in the improvement of air quality. Concentrations of PM2.5, NO2 and SO2 decreased by 31.8%, 45.1% and 20.4% during the Level I period; and 33.2%, 27.2% and 7.6% during the Level II period compared with 2019. However, ozone did not show any reduction and increased greatly. Our results also show that even during the lockdown, with primary emissions reduction of 15%–61%, the daily average PM2.5 concentrations range between 15 and 79 μg m−3, which shows that background and residual pollutions are still high. Source apportionment results indicate that the residual pollution of PM2.5 comes from industry (32.2–61.1%), mobile (3.9–8.1%), dust (2.6–7.7%), residential sources (2.1–28.5%) in YRD and 14.0–28.6% contribution from long-range transport coming from northern China. This indicates that in spite of the extreme reductions in primary emissions, it cannot fully tackle the current air pollution. Re-organisation of the energy and industrial strategy together with trans-regional joint-control for a full long-term air pollution plan need to be further taken into account. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; COVID-19; Yangtze River Delta","Air quality; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Viruses; Emission reduction; Human activity patterns; Industrial operations; Industrial strategies; Long range transport; PM2.5 concentration; Source apportionment; Yangtze river delta; River pollution; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; human activity; modeling; pollution monitoring; viral disease; weather forecasting; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; China; cluster analysis; coronavirus disease 2019; dust; human; human impact (environment); particulate matter; pollution transport; priority journal; quarantine; air pollutant; Betacoronavirus; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; human activities; pandemic; virus pneumonia; China; Yangtze Delta; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; China; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Human Activities; Humans; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084512252

Box 52, North Ryde, NSW  1670, Australia","Amines are considered as an emerging class of atmospheric pollutants that are of great importance to atmospheric chemistry and new particle formation. As a typical amine, 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) is one of the proposed solvents for capturing CO2 from flue gas streams in amine-based post-combustion CO2 capture plants, and it is expected to result in AMP emission and secondary product formation in the atmosphere. However, the current knowledge of its atmospheric chemistry and kinetics is poorly understood, particularly in a reactive environment. In this work, we used the CSIRO smog chamber to study the photo-oxidation of AMP in the presence of volatile organic compound (VOC)-NOx surrogate mixtures over a range of initial amine concentrations. O3 formation was significantly inhibited when AMP was added to the surrogate VOC-NOx mixtures, implying that AMP could alter known atmospheric chemical reaction pathways and the prevailing reactivity. Simultaneously, a large amount of AMP-derived secondary aerosol was formed, with a considerably high aerosol mass yield (i.e., ratio of aerosol formed to reacted AMP) of 1.06 ± 0.20. Based on updated knowledge of its kinetics, oxidation pathways, and product yields, we have developed a new mechanism (designated as CSIAMP-19), integrated it into the Carbon Bond 6 (CB6) chemical mechanism, and evaluated it against available smog chamber data. Compared with the existing AMP mechanism (designated as CarterAMP-08), the modified CB6 with CSIAMP-19 mechanism improves prediction against AMP-VOC-NOx experiments across a range of initial AMP concentrations, within ±10% model error for gross ozone production. Our results contribute to scientific understanding of AMP photochemistry and to the development of the chemical mechanism of other amines. Once some potential limitations are considered, the updated AMP reaction scheme can be further embedded into the chemical transport model for regional modeling scenarios where AMP-related emissions are of concern. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Aerosols; Air pollution; Amines; Carbon dioxide; Chemical reactions; Mixtures; Nitrogen oxides; Volatile organic compounds; 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol; Atmospheric chemical reaction; Atmospheric pollutants; Chemical mechanism; Chemical transport models; New particle formation; Secondary aerosols; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Atmospheric chemistry; amine; methyl group; propanol; volatile organic compound; 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol; propanolamine derivative; atmospheric chemistry; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; chemical composition; chemical reaction; combustion; flux chamber; oxidation; photochemistry; smog; volatile organic compound; aerosol; Article; chemical reaction; controlled study; equilibrium constant; oxidation; photochemistry; photooxidation; prediction; rate constant; ultraviolet radiation; vapor pressure; air pollutant; smog; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Propanolamines; Smog",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089710528

Interfacial adhesion strength and stability have been examined, Al2MgC2(0001) termination of C over Mg and hollow-site stacking style are identified for the most stable configuration, in which Al(111) is epitaxially connecting with Al2MgC2(0001). So, the heterogeneous nucleation of α-Al on Al2MgC2 substrate is thermodynamically evidenced, and Al(111) is confirmed as dominant orientation of α-Al nucleus on the Al2MgC2(0001) substrate. Interfacial charge transfer (roughly 2.1 e) and formation of Al-C covalent bonds (overlap population 2.50) are demonstrated with electron density difference and Mulliken charge populations. PDOS (partial density of states) and valence orbital composition indicate that interfacial Al-C bonding is mainly contributed from the orbital interactions of Al3p1-C2p2, Al3s23p1-C2p2, Al 3p1-C2s2 and Al3s2-C2s2 at −1.1 ​eV, −5.3 ​eV, −9.9 ​eV and −11.8 ​eV, respectively. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Al(111)/ Al2MgC2(0001); Bonding mechanism; DFT calculations; Heterogeneous nucleation","Binary alloys; Charge transfer; Chemical bonds; Crystallization; Density functional theory; Grain refinement; Magnesium alloys; Nucleation; Dominant orientation; First-principles study; Heterogeneous nucleation; Interfacial adhesion strength; Interfacial charge transfer; Interfacial compounds; Partial density of state; Stable Configuration; Aluminum alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085063692

However, the ELT's characteristics of low gas emissions and zero pollution should be further investigated. An electric light truck emissions index (ELTEI) is established to explore the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of ELT. The ELTEI considers electricity carbon intensity and vehicle technical performance that includes temperature-capacity compensation coefficient, battery attenuation coefficient, energy consumption per unit load and battery system energy density. Results of a case study in China show that sub-zero temperature leads to significant fluctuations in the temperature-capacity compensation coefficient, which can increase the GHG emissions of ELT in the northern provinces. In the southern and central provinces, ELT can replace diesel light truck to reduce GHG emissions after improving the battery attenuation coefficient by 15% when ELT is utilized for 4 years. Compared with increasing the battery weight to decrease the value of energy consumption per unit load, increasing the battery system energy density to reduce the vehicle weight can fundamentally lower GHG emissions. The reduction ratio is inversely proportional to the minimum average temperature in the first quarter by reducing the electricity carbon intensity to minimize the GHG emissions of ELT. Insights derived from this study can provide available suggestions for research on the GHG emissions of ELT. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Electric light truck; Electric light truck emissions index; Electricity carbon intensity; Greenhouse gas emissions; Vehicle technical performance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084473071

However, the prediction accuracy of the calibration model may be greatly reduced if the soil characteristics of some new target areas are different from the existing soil spectral library (SSL), which greatly limits the application potential of the technology. We attempted to solve the problem by building a large-scale SSL or using the spiking method. A total of 983 soil samples were collected from Zhejiang Province, and three SSLs were built according to geographic scope, representing the provincial, municipal, and district scales. The partial least squares (PLS) algorithm was applied to establish the calibration models based on the three SSLs, and the models were used to predict the SOC of two target areas in Zhejiang Province. The results show that the prediction accuracy of each model was relatively poor regardless of the scale of the SSL (residual predictive deviation (RPD) < 2.5). Then, the Kennard-Stone (KS) algorithm was applied to select 5 or 10 spiking samples from each target area. According to different SSLs and numbers of spiking samples, different spiked models were established by the PLS. The results show that the predictive ability of each model was improved by the spiking method, and the improvement effect was inversely proportional to the scale of the SSL. The spiked models built by combining the district scale SSL and a few spiking samples achieved good prediction of the SOC of two target areas (RPD = 2.72 and 3.13). Therefore, it is possible to accurately measure the SOC of new target areas by building a small-scale SSL with a few spiking samples. © 2020 by the authors.

To realize the national abatement commitment, a rational allocation into its subunits (i.e. industries, provinces) is eagerly needed. Centralized allocation models can maximize the overall interests, but might cause implementation difficulty and fierce resistance from individual subunits. Based on this observation, this article will address the carbon emission abatement quota allocation problem from decentralized perspective, taking the competitive and cooperative relationships simultaneously into account. To this end, this article develops an integrated cooperative game data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach. We first investigate the relative efficiency evaluation by taking flexible carbon emission abatement allocation plans into account, and then define a super-additive characteristic function for developing a cooperative game among units. To calculate the nucleolus-based allocation plan, a practical computation procedure is developed based on the constraint generation mechanism. Further, we present a two-layer way to allocate the CO2 abatement quota into different sub-industries and further different provinces in Chinese manufacturing industries. The empirical results show that five sub-industries (Processing of petroleum, coking and processing of nuclear fuel; Smelting and pressing of ferrous metals; Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products; Manufacture of raw chemical materials and chemical product; Smelting and pressing of non-ferrous metals) and two provinces (Guangdong and Shandong) will be allocated more than 10% of the total national carbon emission abatement quota. © 2019.

However, researches that quantitatively estimated the comprehensive impacts of such structural adjustment policy remain scant. For this purpose, this study expands and soft-links between GAINS and IMED models to characterize the impacts of climate change and PM2.5-attributed health co-benefits. Results showed the PCPP based on scale limitation to eliminate backward capacities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region yields total benefits of 34.9 billion Yuan (4.2 billion USD), 89% of total coming from energy saving and carbon mitigation, more than policy costs (20.0 billion Yuan) in 2020, but the gap between benefit-cost will keep narrowing to -2.8 billion Yuan (-0.3 billion USD) in 2020-2030, indicating that policy improvement is needed in the long run. To further increase policy co-benefits and achieve multiple policy targets, the policymaker should readjust the PCPP by switching scale limitation to energy efficiency constraint. If doing that, the difference of benefit-cost will achieve 42.5 billion Yuan (5.1 billion USD). The regional disparity also exits due to the diverse ratio of benefit-cost in the selected provinces, calling for necessary fiscal incentives to the less developed area, e.g., Hebei, to promote closer integration. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in China; co-benefits analysis; health impact assessment; IMED model; iron and steel industry; Production capacity phase-out policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091280905

It promoted technological innovation to provide low-carbon renewable energy, especially by treating waste as a resource. This framework discursively accommodated rival sociotechnical imaginaries, understood as visions of feasible and desirable futures available through technoscientific development. According to the dominant imaginary, techno-market fixes stimulate low-carbon technologies by making current centralized systems more resource-efficient (as promoted by industry incumbents). According to the alternative eco-localization imaginary, a shift to low-carbon systems should instead localize resource flows, output uses and institutional responsibility (as promoted by civil society groups). The UK government policy framework gained political authority by accommodating both imaginaries. As we show by drawing on three case studies, the realization of both imaginaries depended on institutional changes and material-economic resources of distinctive kinds. In practice, financial incentives drove technological design towards trajectories that favour the dominant sociotechnical imaginary, while marginalizing the eco-localization imaginary and its environmental benefits. The ecomodernist policy framework relegates responsibility to anonymous markets, thus displacing public accountability of the state and industry. These dynamics indicate the need for STS research on how alternative sociotechnical imaginaries mobilize support for their realization, rather than be absorbed into the dominant imaginary. © The Author(s) 2020.","anaerobic digestion; bioenergy; mechanical and biological treatment; sociotechnical imaginaries; techno-fixes; UK low-carbon strategy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081551136

Therefore, cost-efficient end-of-pipe treatment technologies to reduce nitrogen (N) discharge are required for the sustainable growth of marine land-based RAS. The following study examined the potential of fed batch reactors (FBR) in treating saline RAS effluents, aiming to define optimal operational conditions and evaluate the activated sludge denitrification capacity using external (acetate, propionate and ethanol) and internal carbon sources (RAS fish organic waste (FOW) and RAS fermented fish organic waste (FFOW)). The results show that between the evaluated operation cycle times (2, 4, and 6 h), the highest nitrate/nitrite removal rate was achieved at an operation cycle time of 2 h (corresponding to a hydraulic retention time of 2.5 h) when acetate was used as a carbon source. The specific denitrification rates were 98.7 ± 3.4 mg NO3 −-N/(h g biomass) and 93.2 ± 13.6 mg NOx −-N/(h g biomass), with a resulting volumetric denitrification capacity of 1.20 kg NO3 −-N/(m3 reactor d). The usage of external and internal carbon sources at an operation cycle time of 4 h demonstrated that acetate had the highest nitrate removal rate (57.6 ± 6.6 mg N/(h g biomass)), followed by propionate (37.5 ± 6.3 mg NO3 −-N/(h g biomass)), ethanol (25.5 ± 6.0 mg NO3 −-N/(h g biomass)) and internal carbon sources (7.7 ± 1.6–14.1 ± 2.2 mg NO3 −-N/(h g biomass)). No TAN (Total Ammonia Nitrogen) or PO4 3- accumulation was observed in the effluent when using the external carbon sources, while 0.9 ± 0.5 mg TAN/L and 3.9 ± 1.5 mg PO4 3--P/L was found in the effluent when using the FOW, and 8.1±0.7 mg TAN/L and 7.3 ± 0.9 mg PO4 3--P/L when using FFOW. Average sulfide concentrations varied between 0.002 and 0.008 mg S2-/L when using the acetate, propionate and FOW, while using ethanol resulted in the accumulation of sulfide (0.26 ± 0.17 mg S2-/L). Altogether, it was demonstrated that FBR has a great potential for end-of-pipe denitrification in marine land-based RAS, with a reliable operation and a reduced reactor volume as compared to the other available technologies. Using acetate, the required reactor volume is less than half of what is needed for other evaluated carbon sources, due to the higher denitrification rate achieved. Additionally, combined use of both internal and external carbon sources would further reduce the operational carbon cost. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon source; Denitrification; End-of-Pipe; Fed batch reactor (FBR); Marine land-based; Recirculating aquaculture system (RAS)","Ammonia; Aquaculture; Batch reactors; Bioethanol; Biomass; Cost reduction; Denitrification; Effluents; Ethanol; Fish; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Sulfur compounds; Sustainable development; Volatile fatty acids; Denitrification capacity; Environmental legislations; Hydraulic retention time; Operational conditions; Recirculating aquaculture system; Sulfide concentration; Total ammonia nitrogens; Treatment technologies; Carbon; activated sludge; carbon; denitrification; marine environment; recirculating system",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085243325

To study the distribution patterns of benthic diatom traits, lakes were sampled during the summer and early autumn. Niche breadth, niche position (NP), regional occupancy and local abundances (LAs) of benthic diatom traits and their combinations were determined along different environmental gradients. Benthic diatom traits were identified in all possible niche types (14% non-marginal–narrow, 37% non-marginal–broad, 8% marginal–narrow and 41% marginal–broad niche). On the basis of increased niche differentiation, it is possible to achieve an improved and more effective utilization of the eco-morphological concept of diatom traits. The relationships between the occupancy, abundance and niche characteristics suggest that the broader the niche, the wider the distribution and the greater the LA; the more marginal the NP, the more restricted spatially the distribution and the lower the LA.

Furthermore, our research advances current methodologies by applying a spatially explicit and indicator-based approach, which allows the targeted and place-specific identification of intervention options-independent from the spatial bias of administrative units. The flooding CRVA is based on a comprehensive list of 14 primary indicators and 35 socio-economic sub-indicators. Our results indicate that high levels of socio-economic vulnerability related to flooding are concentrated in the northern and eastern regions of Austria. When integrating a climate hazard proxy, statistically significant risk hotspots (>90% confidence) can be identified in central-northern Austria and towards the east.

To be effective, such management must account for processes influencing carbon storage and re-emission at different space and time scales. Achieving this requires a conceptual advance in our understanding to link carbon dynamics from the scales at which processes occur to the scales at which decisions are made. Here, we propose that soil carbon persistence can be understood through the lens of decomposers as a result of functional complexity derived from the interplay between spatial and temporal variation of molecular diversity and composition. For example, co-location alone can determine whether a molecule is decomposed, with rapid changes in moisture leading to transport of organic matter and constraining the fitness of the microbial community, while greater molecular diversity may increase the metabolic demand of, and thus potentially limit, decomposition. This conceptual shift accounts for emergent behaviour of the microbial community and would enable soil carbon changes to be predicted without invoking recalcitrant carbon forms that have not been observed experimentally. Functional complexity as a driver of soil carbon persistence suggests soil management should be based on constant care rather than one-time action to lock away carbon in soils. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",,"atmospheric gas; carbon dioxide; carbon storage; climate change; complexity; conceptual framework; drawdown; functional role; microbial community; persistence; soil carbon; soil management; soil organic matter; temporal variation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088643960

Here, we identify the existence of a performance indicator for gas-evolving electrochemical energy conversion devices: the critical current density. The critical current density pinpoints a performance inflection point whereby both the gas saturations and mass transport overpotentials suddenly dominate cell performance and exacerbate failure. We elucidate the mass transport behavior of a polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) water electrolyzer using in operando neutron imaging at operating current densities as high as 9 A ⋅ cm−2. Product gases become heterogeneously distributed in the porous transport layer adjacent to the catalyst layer and promote disastrous local hotspots.

The result shows the complexity of vulnerabilities that are not only climate change impacts, but more importantly, the socio-economic sensitivity, the insufficient infrastructure system, and limited adaptive capacity. Adaptation responses, correspondingly, address primarily current vulnerabilities rather than future climate change impacts.

The result of this approach is the refusal to find one model that describes the general regularity of changes in the physiological processes of plants due to climatic changes. The productivity of phytocenoses is the result of the ""soil-plant-climate"" relationship. In the previous studies, the author presented a thermodynamic approach to climate analysis; a methodology has been developed for determining the volumetric heat content of soils, and the thermodynamic approach to assessing plant productivity is proved in the current study. For this purpose, the concepts of the heat content of phytomass and the heat content of the aerotope (unit of measure - kJ / kg of dry air) were introduced, and from this point of view the dependence of physiological parameters is based not on various combinations of external meteorological parameters, but on the corresponding integral indicators of the heat content of the leaf and aerotope for conditions of different density and plant height. The heat content of the phytomass was taken as the heat content of the air space bordering the lamina. Introduction of these concepts simplified the analysis of the multifactorial effect of meteorological elements on plant productivity. The capability of a thermodynamic approach to assess the productivity of phytocenoses as a result of the relationship of plants with the environment is demonstrated, as evidenced by the high degree of correlation dependence of the studied parameters. The possibility for describing the ""soil-plant-climate"" system in a single energy system is substantiated, provided that an assessment of the productivity of phytocenoses is introduced from the point of view of net primary productivity, measured in energy units (Joule). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Ecosystems; Enthalpy; Physiology; Soils; Degree of correlations; Meteorological elements; Meteorological parameters; Net primary productivity; Physiological parameters; Physiological process; Scientific literature; Thermodynamic approaches; Physiological models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090778452

A large variety of plants containing secondary metabolites [essential oils (terpenoids), tannins, saponins, and flavonoids] have been evaluated as cattle feedstuffs and changes in volatile fatty acid proportions and methane synthesis in the rumen have been assessed. Alterations to the rumen microbiome may lead to changes in diversity, composition, and structure of the methanogen community. Legumes containing condensed tannins such as Leucaena leucocephala have shown a good methane mitigating effect when fed at levels of up to 30–35% of ration dry matter in cattle as a result of the effect of condensed tannins on rumen bacteria and methanogens. It has been shown that saponins disrupt the membrane of rumen protozoa, thus decreasing the numbers of both protozoa and methanogenic archaea. Trials carried out with cattle housed in respiration chambers have demonstrated the enteric methane mitigation effect in cattle and sheep of tropical legumes such as Enterolobium cyclocarpum and Samanea saman which contain saponins. Essential oils are volatile constituents of terpenoid or non-terpenoid origin which impair energy metabolism of archaea and have shown reductions of up to 26% in enteric methane emissions in ruminants. There is emerging evidence showing the potential of flavonoids as methane mitigating compounds, but more work is required in vivo to confirm preliminary findings. From the information hereby presented, it is clear that plant secondary metabolites can be a rational approach to modulate the rumen microbiome and modify its function, some species of rumen microbes improve protein and fiber degradation and reduce feed energy loss as methane in ruminants fed tropical plant species. © Copyright © 2020 Ku-Vera, Jiménez-Ocampo, Valencia-Salazar, Montoya-Flores, Molina-Botero, Arango, Gómez-Bravo, Aguilar-Pérez and Solorio-Sánchez.","essential oils; flavonoids; methane; ruminants; saponins; tannins","amide; essential oil; flavonoid; methane; saponin derivative; tannin derivative; terpenoid; bovine; fermentation; legume; Leucaena leucocephala; metabolism; metabolite; methanogen; methanogenic archaeon; microbiome; nonhuman; plant; Review; rumen microorganism; ruminant stomach; sheep; synthesis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090766841

For forests, management can greatly alter these attributes with resulting consequences for the surface albedo, surface roughness, and evapotranspiration. The sensitivity of surface energy and water budgets to alterations in forest structure is relatively unknown in boreal regions, particularly in Nordic Fennoscandia (Norway, Sweden, and Finland), where the forest management footprint is large. Here we perform offline simulations to quantify the sensitivity of surface heat and moisture fluxes to changes in forest composition and structure across daily, seasonal, and annual time scales. For the region on average, it is found that broadleaved deciduous forests cool the surface by 0.16 K annually and 0.3 K in the growing season owed to higher year-round albedo and lower Bowen ratio, yet in some locations the local cooling can be as much as 2.4 K and 3.0 K, respectively. Moreover, fully developed forests cool the surface by 0.04 K annually in our domain owed to higher evapotranspiration, reaching up to 0.4 K locally in some locations, whereas undeveloped forests warm annually by 0.14 K owed to much lower evapotranspiration reaching up to 0.8 K for some locations. If regional forests are ever to be managed for the local climate regulation services that they provide, our results are an important first step illuminating the potential adverse impacts or benefits across space and time. ©2020.

The value of this evaluation is in the employment of a large-scale, bottom-up, national energy modeling system that encompasses the complex relationships of producing, transforming, transmitting and supplying energy to meet the useful demand characteristics with great technological detail. One of such models employed in this analysis is the BUEMS model. The BUEMS model provides evidence of win-win policy options that lead to profitable decarbonization using Turkey's data in BUEMS. Specifically, the result shows that a ban on diesel fueled vehicles reduces lifetime emissions as well as lifetime costs. Furthermore, model results highlight the cost-effective emission reduction potential of e-buses in urban transportation. More insights from the results indicate that the marginal cost of emission reduction through e-bus transportation is much lower than that through other policy measures such as carbon taxation in transport.

Here we examine the direct and indirect effects of reduced PM concentrations under a low-carbon energy (GHG-Step) scenario on radiative forcing in California. Simulations were carried out using the source-oriented WRF/Chem (SOWC) model with 12 km spatial resolution for the year 2054. The avoided aerosol emissions due to technology advances in the GHG-Step scenario reduce ground level PM concentrations by ~8.85% over land compared to the Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario, but changes to meteorological parameters are more modest. Top-of-atmospheric forcing predicted by the SOWC model increased by 0.15 W m−2, surface temperature warmed by 0.001 K, and planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) increased by 2.20 cm in the GHG-Step scenario compared to the BAU scenario. PM climate feedbacks are small because the significant changes in ground level PM concentrations associated with the GHG-Step scenario are limited to the first few hundred meters of the atmosphere, with little change for the majority of the vertical column above that level. As an order-of-magnitude comparison, the long-term effects of global reductions in GHG emissions (RCP8.5–RCP4.5) lowered average surface temperature over the California study domain by approximately 0.76 K. The effects of long-lived climate pollutants such as CO2 are much stronger than the effects of short-lived climate pollutants such as PM soot over California in the year 2054. ©2020.

The purpose of present experimental work is to find an energy proficient solution for the disposal of floral waste. The method used in the present work includes anaerobic digestion of floral waste for biogas generation. The proposed method aims to follow waste-to-energy approach, for meeting the local energy demands. The techniques for getting enhanced biogas production from floral waste include novel alkaline chemical pretreatment of floral waste, and co-digestion of floral waste along with food waste. Alkaline chemical pretreatment of floral waste using sodium carbonate showed improved biogas production up to 106%, as compared to the traditional sodium hydroxide chemical pretreatment. Also, a reduction in the cost of chemical pretreatment up to 90% was possible. Co-digestion of floral waste along with food waste was also found effective for getting enhanced biogas output. A feedstock mixture of 70% of floral waste and 30% food waste could produce 32.6% more biogas than the singular feedstock in the form of floral waste. Alkaline pretreatment of floral waste using sodium carbonate and co-digestion with food waste seem to be the novelty of the work. Application of chemical absorption technique for biogas quality improvement could enrich the methane content of biogas up to 96%. Large-scale application of the proposed techniques of solid waste management can meet the energy demands at potential locations. The biogas with enriched methane content can suitable for widespread applications, such as vehicular applications and electricity generation for the benefit of the end users. © 2020 Widener University School of Civil Engineering.

The model can be used to assess the impacts of various alternative air quality abatement measures, policies and strategies. The model has been applied to evaluate the costs of the domestic emissions that influence the concentrations of PM2.5 in Finland in 2015. The model includes the impacts on human health; however, it does not address the impacts on climate change or the state of the environment. First, the national Finnish emissions were evaluated using the Finnish Regional Emission Scenarios (FRESs) model on a resolution of 250 × 250m2 for the whole of Finland. Second, the atmospheric dispersion was analysed by using the chemical transport model, namely the System for Integrated modeLling of Atmospheric coMposition (SILAM) model, and the source receptor matrices contained in the FRES model. Third, the health impacts were assessed by combining the spatially resolved concentration and population data sets and by analysing the impacts for various health outcomes. Fourth, the economic impacts of the health outcomes were evaluated. The model can be used to evaluate the costs of the health damages for various emission source categories and for a unit of emissions of PM2.5. It was found that the economic benefits, in terms of avoided public health costs, were largest for measures that will reduce the emissions of (i) road transport, (ii) non-road vehicles and machinery, and (iii) residential wood combustion. The reduction in the precursor emissions of PM2.5 resulted in clearly lower benefits when compared with directly reducing the emissions of PM2.5.

The combination of the advanced oil production method involving the injection of carbon dioxide into the reservoir (CO2-EOR) with its geological sequestration (CCS) is the CCS-EOR process. To achieve the best ecological effect, it is important to maximize the storage capacity for CO2 injected in the CCS phase. To achieve this state, it is necessary to maximize recovery factor of the reservoir during the CO2-EOR phase. For this purpose, it is important to choose the best location of CO2 injection wells. In this work, a new algorithm to optimize the location of carbon dioxide injection wells is developed. It is based on two key reservoir properties, i.e., porosity and permeability. The developed optimization procedure was tested on an exemplary oil field simulation model. The obtained results were compared with the option of arbitrary selection of injection well locations, which confirmed both the legitimacy of using well location optimization and the effectiveness of the developed optimization method. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon capture and storage (CCS); CCS-EOR; CO2enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR); Well placement optimization","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Enhanced recovery; Geology; Global warming; Location; Offshore oil well production; Oil fields; Petroleum industry; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Petroleum transportation; Wells; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon dioxide injection; Field simulation models; Geological sequestration; Geological structures; Injection well locations; Mature oil reservoirs; Optimization procedures; Injection (oil wells)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090221901

The crosscutting impacts of the virus, individual country responses to the virus, and the state of preparedness of local public health systems greatly vary across the world. The ostensibly late arrival of the virus in Africa has allowed learning, innovation, and adaptation of methods that have been successful in the early-hit countries. This article analyzes how Singapore has responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and proposes that adaptations of the Singapore pandemic response model would bode well for Africa's response to the COVID-19 pandemic in ways that also take into account regional differences in health care infrastructures, socioeconomic resilience, poverty, and the vast population diversity in the African continent. As the pandemic evolves, the lessons learned in Asia, in particular, and the emerging new experiences in African countries should inform, ideally in real time, how best to steer the world populations into safety, including those in low-resource health care settings. Finally, we note that the current COVID-19 pandemic is also a test for our collective ability to scale and surge public health in response to future and likely equally challenging zoonosis infections that jump from animals to humans, not to mention climate change-related planetary health calamities in the 21st century.

The future needs and key benefits of aircraft electrification has made it a highly persuaded common technology trend across the aerospace industry ranging from very large airplanes to small aircrafts, all alike. For very high power (20MW) propulsion system, with the inadequacies of current and near future state-of-the art of electric energy storage technologies, all electric aircraft solution faces enormous technology gaps that needs to be bridged. Advanced turbo-electric technology offers potential solutions towards successful realization of the benefits of electrification of aircrafts. However, this represent a grand challenge in many fronts to realize electric drivetrain (EDT) designs that would significantly improve fuel burn reduction, design flexibility, and operational improvements in next generation of aircrafts. This work focuses on the underlying technological elements to enable such high power turbo-electric aircraft. A preliminary study is carried out to find that to achieve the key benefits of electrifications, the ETD system efficiency has to be > 93% and the specific power density of the system is required to be > 7.5 kW/kg. Furthermore, it is found that that to achieve such system level performances, the EDT components is required to be ≥ 99% and with specific power densities > 40 kW/kg to achieve the 7.5 kW/kg target. These necessitates orders of magnitude of improvements at all technological fronts and requires radical improvement in design and integration methodologies.

Certain classes of white dwarfs pulsate4,5, leading to observable brightness variations, and analysis of these variations with theoretical stellar models probes their internal structure. Modelling of these pulsating stars provides stringent tests of white dwarf models and a detailed picture of the outcome of the late stages of stellar evolution6. However, the high-energy-density states that exist in white dwarfs are extremely difficult to reach and to measure in the laboratory, so theoretical predictions are largely untested at these conditions. Here we report measurements of the relationship between pressure and density along the principal shock Hugoniot (equations describing the state of the sample material before and after the passage of the shock derived from conservation laws) of hydrocarbon to within five per cent. The observed maximum compressibility is consistent with theoretical models that include detailed electronic structure. This is relevant for the equation of state of matter at pressures ranging from 100 million to 450 million atmospheres, where the understanding of white dwarf physics is sensitive to the equation of state and where models differ considerably. The measurements test these equation-of-state relations that are used in the modelling of white dwarfs and inertial confinement fusion experiments7,8, and we predict an increase in compressibility due to ionization of the inner-core orbitals of carbon. We also find that a detailed treatment of the electronic structure and the electron degeneracy pressure is required to capture the measured shape of the pressure–density evolution for hydrocarbon before peak compression. Our results illuminate the equation of state of the white dwarf envelope (the region surrounding the stellar core that contains partially ionized and partially degenerate non-ideal plasmas), which is a weak link in the constitutive physics informing the structure and evolution of white dwarf stars9. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon; hydrocarbon; compressibility; cosmology; electron; equation of state; high energy environment; hydrocarbon; ionization; Article; astronomy; chemical structure; compression; density; ionization; law; prediction; pressure; priority journal; theoretical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089030780

The four pillars of this system include (i) forecasting wildfire danger, (ii) detecting wildfires with remote sensing techniques, (iii) forecasting wildfire spread with a coupled weather-fire modeling system, and (iv) assessing the wildfire risk in the frame of climate change. Special emphasis is given to the innovative and replicable parts of the system. It is shown that for the effective use of fire weather forecasting in different geographical areas and in order to account for the local climate conditions, a proper adjustment of the wildfire danger classification is necessary. Additionally, the consideration of vegetation dryness may provide better estimates of wildfire danger. Our study also highlights some deficiencies of both EUMETSAT (Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) and LSA-SAF (Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis) algorithms in their skill to detect wildfires over islands and near the coastline. To tackle this issue, a relevant modification is proposed. Furthermore, it is shown that IRIS, the coupled atmosphere-fire modeling system developed in the frame of DISARM, has proven to be a valuable supporting tool in fire suppression actions. Finally, assessment of the wildfire danger in the future climate provides the necessary context for the development of regional adaptation strategies to climate change. © 2020 by the authors.","Early warning systems; Fire danger; Fire spread forecasting; Remote sensing of wildfire activity; Wildfires","adaptive management; climate change; climate conditions; early warning system; remote sensing; risk assessment; strategic approach; weather forecasting; wildfire; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089798650

Arctic mineral, fuel and energy resources play a key role in satisfying the demands of the Russian national economy for strategically important types of raw materials. The nature of work activities in the Russian Arctic is distinctive so that labour as a production factor requires a special approach due to stressful climate, which makes living conditions uncomfortable. Dispersion dynamics, distance barriers, small population size in remote settlements, and transport accessibility level contribute to increased resource intensity and energy consumption for life-sustaining activity. Furthermore, the local population is adapted to the harsh Arctic climate and natural environment so that a special Arctic policy of keeping people in the region comes to the forefront. Nevertheless, Russian Arctic is currently remaining a challenging zone due to its complex and non-uniform territorial social and economic development, lack of scientific-based territory management and ineffective social and economic policies implemented there. Nowadays, we need new approaches to elaborate a research and practical agenda for the development of the Russian Arctic. A scientific research methodology must be formulated to transform the system of government control of Arctic region development. An important aspect is to analyse long-term dynamics of the social space in the Russian Arctic of the social space of the Russian Arctic. The article addresses the study results for the dynamics of the social space in the Russian Arctic regions between 1950 and 2018. Transformations in the long-term consistent dynamics of the Russian Arctic were identified to have been determined by the intensity of the region's industrial development, the scale of government support, and long-term interests of the national economy. Researchers identified stages of the long-term consistent dynamics of the social space in the Russian Arctic region as follows: 1950 to 1990, 1990 to 2000, 2000 to 2008 and 2008 to 2017.

So far, these parties have been hindered by the abundance of contrasting urban heat maps produced with different metrics and methods by different agencies. To unify the stress tests, we present a methodology for a standardized urban heat map at 1-m spatial resolution by selecting the Physical Equivalent Temperature (PET) as metric for heat stress. First we present an empirical regression model for PET, based on a variety of weather data and street configurations in the human thermal energy balance model Rayman. Thereafter, this empirical PET-model is evaluated for the midsized town Wageningen (the Netherlands). Meteorological observations taken at a nearby reference site and straightforward geographical data have been used as model input. Also, established methods were applied and elaborated to account for the urban heat island effect and wind speed reduction in the city. The presented method is validated against bike traverse observations of PET. Wind speed is the most challenging feature to map, due to its unsteady and local behaviour in cities. As a result, an afternoon averaged PET heat map is demonstrated as standard for an extreme heat day (1:1000 summer half year days), and a cumulative exceedance PET heat map for a representative year. Furthermore, a heat map is projected for 2050 according a warm climate change scenario. © 2020 The Authors","Climate scenario; GIS; Heat map; Physiological equivalent temperature; The Netherlands; Urban climate; Urban heat island; Urban planning","Climate change; Image resolution; Regression analysis; Wind; Empirical regression model; Equivalent temperature; Geographical data; Meteorological observation; National governments; Societal impacts; Spatial resolution; Urban Heat Island Effects; Atmospheric temperature; climate change; heat island; numerical model; regression analysis; spatial resolution; standardization; urban climate; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088221784

This paper deals with impacts on emissions production from the operation of the urban public transport fleet after its renewal. To what extent can the renewal of the urban public transport fleet in the city of Žilina contribute to increasing environmental sustainability in the way of reducing air pollution? The vehicle fleet change has partially consisted of vehicle traction system transition-diesel buses were substituted by hybrid driven (HEV) and electric driven buses (BEV). How can the direct and indirect emissions from the operation of vehicles be calculated? These were the posed research questions. The research aimed to propose a methodology for the calculation of direct and indirect emissions. Indirect emissions values (WtT-Well-to-Tank) for different types of fuels and tractions were obtained based on regression functions. These WtT emission factors together with the existing TtW (Tank-to-Wheels) emission factors (direct emissions) can be used for the assessment of environmental impacts of specific types of vehicles concerning energy source, fuel, or powertrain and type of operation. Direct pollutants such as CO, NOx and PM were calculated with the use of simulation methodology of HBEFA (Handbook of Emission Factors for Road Transport) software. The calculated CO2 savings for the period 2019-2023 about fleet renewal in absolute terms are EUR 1.3 million tons compared to the operation of the original fleet while maintaining the same driving performance. The renewal of the vehicle fleet secured by vehicle traction transition can be a way to reduce the energy intensity and environmental impacts of public transport in Žilina. © 2020 by the authors.

In particular air and water quality should be kept at as high levels as possible. Energy conversion systems and devices which are applied for converting the chemical energy contained in different fuels into heat, electricity and cold in the industry and housing are sources of different gases and solid particle emissions. Medical data show PM2.5 dust in particular is highly dangerous for human health. Therefore, limiting the number of low-quality fuel combustion processes is a key issue of modern energy policy. Statistical data show that domestic heating systems account for a large share of the total emissions of PM2.5 and PM10 dust. For example in Poland in 2017, the share of households in the total annual emissions of PM2.5 dust was equal to ca. 35.8%, while the share of PM2.5 emission in industry (i.e., power generating plants, industrial power plants and technologies) was equal to only 23.6%. A possible way of solving this problem is by the successful replacement of old domestic furnaces by combined heat and power (CHP) or multigeneration boilers which can be used for heating the rooms and sanitary water and generating electricity and cold. Such systems can possibly contribute in the future to significant reductions of dust emissions and air pollution in urban and rural areas by limiting the number of low-quality fuel combustion processes. This article presents design considerations and experimental results related to a domestic micro-CHP unit which is based on organic Rankine cycle (ORC) technology. The main aim of the design works and experiments was therefore the analysis of the possibility of integrating the ORC system with a standard domestic central heating gas-fired boiler. The specially designed micro-ORC system was implemented in the laboratory and experiments were performed using this test stand. The main design aims of the test-stand were: low operating pressure, small working fluid flow, low price and compact dimensions. To meet these aims, volumetric machines were chosen as the expander and working fluid pump. The experimental results were positive and show that it is possible to integrate an ORC system with a standard domestic central heating gas boiler. For different heat source temperatures, the obtained expander power ranged from 109 W to 241 W and the thermodynamic cycle efficiency ranged from 4.3% to 8.8%. These positive research results were achieved partly thanks to the positive features of the different system subassemblies. © 2020 by the author.","Air pollution; ORC; PM2.5 dust; Selection method; Thermodynamic analysis; Volumetric expander; Working fluid","Boilers; Combustion; Dust; Energy conversion; Flow of fluids; Fuels; Heating; Industrial emissions; Power plants; Rankine cycle; Thermodynamic properties; Water quality; Working fluids; Combined heat and power; Domestic heating systems; Energy conversion systems; Heat source temperatures; Industrial power plants; Organic Rankine Cycle(ORC); Organic Rankine cycles; Solid particle emission; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090927508

Consequently, heating network operators must adapt to growing requirements for carbon neutrality. Energy system modeling allows the simulation of individual network compositions and regulations, while considering electricity market signals for a more efficient plant operation. The district heating model, programmed for this work, covers a measured heat demand with peak load boiler, biomass-fired combined heat and power (CHP) plant, and biomass heating plant supply. The CHP plant reacts to electricity prices of the European Power Exchange market and uses a long-term heat storage to decouple heat and electricity production. This paper presents the results of three annual simulation scenarios aimed at carbon neutrality for the analyzed heating network. Two scenarios achieve a climate-neutral system by replacing the peak load boiler generation. The exclusive storage capacity expansion in the first scenario does not lead to the intended decarbonization. The second scenario increases the output of the CHP plant, while the third simulation uses the biomass heating plant supply.

To counteract this, the magnetic resonance (MR) neuroimaging community has promoted acquisition standards and created data sharing platforms, based on a consensus on how to organize and share MR neuroimaging data. Here, we take a similar approach to positron emission tomography (PET) data. To facilitate comparison of findings across studies, we first recommend publication standards for tracer characteristics, image acquisition, image preprocessing, and outcome estimation for PET neuroimaging data. The co-authors of this paper, representing more than 25 PET centers worldwide, voted to classify information as mandatory, recommended, or optional. Second, we describe a framework to facilitate data archiving and data sharing within and across centers. Because of the high cost of PET neuroimaging studies, sample sizes tend to be small and relatively few sites worldwide have the required multidisciplinary expertise to properly conduct and analyze PET studies. Data sharing will make it easier to combine datasets from different centers to achieve larger sample sizes and stronger statistical power to test hypotheses. The combining of datasets from different centers may be enhanced by adoption of a common set of best practices in data acquisition and analysis. © The Author(s) 2020.","Consensus guidelines; data sharing; data structure; open source; positron emission tomography","tracer; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; radiopharmaceutical agent; algorithm; Article; blood sampling; diagnostic accuracy; head movement; human; image analysis; image processing; image quality; image reconstruction; information center; medical research; Mini Mental State Examination; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; practice guideline; priority journal; radiochemistry; ultracentrifugation; workflow; brain; consensus; diagnostic imaging; positron emission tomography; procedures; reproducibility; Brain; Consensus; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Neuroimaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Radiopharmaceuticals; Reproducibility of Results",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081976410

Powder metal (PM) technology offers great opportunities for the reduction of the carbon footprint and improvement of the cost efficiency of gear production. PM gears can achieve flank load-carrying capacities comparable to wrought steel gears if the loaded volume is fully densified. Still, the tooth root strength is of particular importance. Design/methodology/approach: The tooth root stresses can be minimized by optimizing the tooth root geometry. This usually leads to a target conflict, as fully optimized tooth root geometries cannot be manufactured by generating processes such as hobbing, generating-grinding or rolling. To use the increase in tooth root load-carrying capacity of fully optimized root geometry on PM gears, a non-generating method for surface densifying is needed. The shot-peening process is used as an alternative densification process for PM gears. The properties of both shot peened and cold-rolled PM gears are analyzed and compared. To quantify the effect of both manufacturing processes, the tooth root bending fatigue strength will be evaluated and compared to wrought gears. Findings: From the fatigue strength perspective, a material model is developed, which is able to predict local endurable stress amplitudes. The model is gained through regression varying carbon content, density and size effect on bending specimens. Originality/value: It is transferable to PM gears of the same material using a load transfer coefficient. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Fatigue life; Gears; Highly loaded volume; Powder metallurgy; Shot peening","Bending strength; Carbon footprint; Cold rolling; Fatigue of materials; Gear manufacture; Gears; Geometry; Load limits; Loads (forces); Metal cladding; Metals; Plants (botany); Powder metallurgy; Powder metals; Shot peening; Densification process; Design/methodology/approach; Generating methods; Highly loaded; Load transfer coefficients; Manufacturing process; Powder metallurgical; Tooth root bending; Gear teeth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078049545

Since almost all production processes use grid electricity, the environmental impact of power generation plays a key role in LCA. There is high potential both on a local and a regional scale for improving electricity generation to achieve decarbonisation goals in the near future. The environmental impact of electricity supply from the grid varies both in the short (intra-annual) and in the long term (over several years). This variation is usually highly simplified in current LCA practice, to yearly average or a specific year's impact. In this paper, a method is presented for linking a detailed economic model and life cycle assessment to evaluate both intra-annual and long-term variation in the environmental impact of grid electricity. The model is applied for the case study of Hungary for three future scenarios. The “Decarbon” and “Delayed” scenarios include an emission reduction target of 94% for 2050 compared to 1990 for the EU with a less intensive support of renewables until 2035 in the “Delayed” scenario. The “No target” scenario sets no long-term goal for carbon-dioxide emission reduction. Our results show that in the next 30 years, 87% reduction is expected in the Global Warming Potential compared to 2018 in the Hungarian electricity mix if the decarbonisation of the grid is fulfilled. However, without support for renewable energy, only 30% reduction is foreseen. While the effect of intra-annual variation is relatively low in the current fossil-based electricity market and in the “No target” scenario, its significance is expected to increase in the future with a change in the coefficient of variation to 77% from 10% by 2050. The results indicate that dynamic modelling of electricity taking into account variation due to cross-border trading and renewable penetration will influence the LCA results for products depending on their lifetime and pattern of electricity use. © 2020 The Authors","Decarbonisation; Electricity market model; Electricity mix; Intra-annual variation; Life cycle assessment","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Decarbonization; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Energy policy; Global warming; Carbon dioxide emissions; Coefficient of variation; Electricity generation; Emission reduction targets; Environmental accountings; Environmental assessment; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083486595

The wavelet coherence technique allows us to investigate both the long-run and short-term causal relationships between urbanization and environmental sustainability within the global framework. The findings reveal that (i) wavelet correlation from the global perspectives indicates a significant wavelet relationship between urbanization and environmental sustainability for medium- and long-term horizons; however, the correlations are not significant for the short-term horizons; (ii) significant vulnerabilities in urbanization and environmental sustainability are observed at different periods and different frequency levels; (iii) urbanization has reliable power for explaining environmental sustainability at different periods between 1970 and 2000.

Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY  14853, United States","Pulsing the potential during the electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2R) reaction using copper has been shown to influence product selectivity (i.e., to suppress the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)) and to improve electrocatalyst stability compared to the constant applied potential. However, the underlying mechanism and contribution of interfacial/surface phenomena behind the pulsed potential application remain largely unknown. We investigated the state of the copper surface during the pulsed potential electrochemical CO2R using in situ X-ray adsorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES). We probed the surface valence of the metallic electrode and found that the Cu electrode remains metallic over a broad pulsed potential range and only oxidizes to form Cu(OH)2 in the bulk when the pulsed potential reaches the highly oxidative limit (greater than 0.6 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)). Our results suggest that the pulsed anodic potential influences the interfacial species on the electrode surface, i.e., the dynamic competition between protons and hydroxide adsorbates instead of bulk copper oxidation. We attribute the suppressed HER to the electroadsorption of hydroxides, which outcompetes protons for surface sites. As shown in a recent in situ infrared study [Iijima, G. et al.; ACS Catalysis 2019, 9, 6305], adsorbed hydroxides promote CO adsorption, a crucial CO2 reduction intermediate, by preventing CO from becoming inert through a near-neighbor effect. We corroborate this interpretation by demonstrating that the pulsed potential application can suppress the HER during the CO reduction just as the CO2R. Our results suggest that the pulsed potential mechanism favors CO2R over the HER due to two effects: (1) proton desorption/displacement during the anodic potential and (2) the accumulation of OHads creating a higher pH-surface environment, promoting CO adsorption. We can describe this pulsed potential dynamic interfacial mechanism in a competing quaternary Langmuir isotherm model. The insights from this investigation have wide-ranging implications for applying pulsed potential profiles to improve other electrochemical reactions.

The research framework consists of three modules: the development of a drivers’ behavior model; implementation of vehicle idling control; and the estimation of GHG emissions. This framework has been materialized in Haeundae-gu in Busan, Korea as a case study.

We estimated the association between short-term PM2.5 exposure and acute respiratory infection among children aged 0–4 years using a difference-in-differences approach. Methods: We used data on the daily PM2.5 concentrations, hospital admissions for acute respiratory infection, and meteorological factors of the 15 regions in the Republic of Korea (2013–2015). To estimate the cumulative effects, we used a difference-in-differences approach generalized to multiple spatial units (regions) and time periods (day) with distributed lag non-linear models. Results: With PM2.5 levels of 20.0 μg/m3 as a reference, PM2.5 levels of 30.0 μg/m3 were positively associated with the risk of acute upper respiratory infection (relative risk (RR) = 1.048, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.028, 1.069) and bronchitis or bronchiolitis (RR = 1.060, 95% CI: 1.038, 1.082) but not with the risk of acute lower respiratory infection and pneumonia. PM2.5 levels of 40.0 μg/m3 were also positively associated with the risk of acute upper respiratory infection (RR = 1.083, 95% CI: 1.046, 1.122) and bronchitis or bronchiolitis (RR = 1.094, 95% CI: 1.054, 1.136). Conclusions: We found the associations of short-term PM2.5 exposure with acute upper respiratory infection and bronchitis or bronchiolitis among children aged 0–4 years. As causal inference methods can provide more convincing evidence of the effects of PM2.5 levels on respiratory infections, public health policies and guidelines regarding PM2.5 need to be strengthened accordingly. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH","Bronchiolitis; Bronchitis; Causal inference method; Difference-in-differences; Fine particulate matter; Upper respiratory infection","acute disease; air pollutant; exposure; female; human; infant; male; newborn; particulate matter; preschool child; respiratory tract infection; South Korea; Acute Disease; Air Pollutants; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Inhalation Exposure; Male; Particulate Matter; Republic of Korea; Respiratory Tract Infections",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086362027

The agreement was adopted at the 21st Conference of Parties to the UNFCCC (COP21), which was held in Paris, France, in December 2015, and it revealed that reducing CO2 is the most efficient method of greenhouse gas reduction. Accordingly, carbon capture/utilization/storage (CCUS) technology has been noted as a means of making practical contributions to CO2 reduction, and research and development (R&amp;D) activities in many countries are active in the field of CCUS technology. Therefore, this study aims to provide a basis for CCUS R&amp;D and strategic support measures by analyzing patent trends in technologies related to CCUS. The patent analysis collected a total of 10,137 patents in the United States, Korea, Japan, Europe, and China; the number of patents in the United States was the highest according to patent analysis by country. According to an analysis by technology, capture-related technology was high at 60%, but given the recent increase in technology related to utilization, technology demonstration, R&amp;D, and policy support should be continued. © This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided original work is properly cited.","Capture; Carbon dioxide; Patent trend analysis; Storage; Utilization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095795817

Currently, South Korea is also focusing on increasing the penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) and EV by 2030 to reduce GHGs. However, indiscriminate DER development can give a negative impact on the operation of existing power systems. The existing power system operation is optimized for the hourly net load pattern, but the integration of DERs changes it. In addition, since ToU (Time-of-Use) tariff and Demand Response (DR) programs are very sensitive to changes in the net load curve, it is essential to predict the hourly net load pattern accurately for the modification of pricing and demand response programs in the future. However, a long-term demand forecast in South Korea provides only the total amount of annual load (TWh) and the expected peak load level (GW) in summer and winter seasons until 2030. In this study, we use the annual photovoltaic (PV) installed capacity, PV generation, and the number of EV based on the target values for 2030 in South Korea to predict the change in hourly net load curve by year and season. In addition, to predict the EV charging load curve based on Monte Carlo simulation, the EV users’ charging method, charging start time, and State-of-Charge (SoC) were considered. Finally, we analyze the change in hourly net load curve due to the integration of PV and EV to determine the amplification of the duck curve and peak load time by year and season, and present the risks caused by indiscriminate DERs development. © 2020 by the authors.

While it also leads to the crisis of energy consumption, the main reason is still debatable among the researchers. However, the released of carbon emission in construction field is generally believed has triggered the phenomena and become the primary cause of global warming. It is proven that the building sector contributes to the biggest causes of overheating in the environment. Based on previous research, residential and commercial has reached 20% to 40% of the total energy consumption and this growing trend is still happening. Moreover, the electricity consumption in the building and construction process is the main reason for the growth of carbon emission. Therefore, the stakeholder particularly architects and designer should take an early initiative to overcome the problems. One of the approaches is to predict building performance through simulation in the initial design phase. In line with this, rapid technology development has brought to an alarming situation concerning energy consumption. Passive design is considered as one of the strategies to moderate indoor temperature in a tropical climate. Some studies suggest that the use of natural ventilation is potentially reducing operating costs and produce better thermal and indoor air quality. This study will investigate the optimization process of daylight performace condition that driven by faade components such as balcony size, orientation, openings, layout and louver windows using generative and parametric tools through multi-objectives optimization and generative simulation.

The rational design of photocatalysts considering both aspects has established significant importance due to the fascinating advantages of superior charge carrier transport/transfer and photocatalytic performances. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), a captivating metal-free and visible light-active photocatalyst, has drawn interdisciplinary attention in the field of solar energy conversion and pollutant degradation because of its appropriate electronic band structure, excellent physicochemical stability, facile synthesis, and unique layered structure. The g-C3N4-based low-dimensional heterostructures demonstrate various mechanisms for photogenerated charge carrier transfer including type I heterojunction, type II heterojunction, p–n heterojunction, Z-scheme heterojunction, Schottky junction, and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect. Herein, the state-of-the-art g-C3N4-based low-dimensional heterostructure photocatalysts are analyzed to provide an insightful outlook with respect to doping and defect engineering, band structures tuning, and charged carrier dynamics to realize enhanced visible light absorption, improved photoinduced charge carrier transport/transfer, and spatially separated electron–hole pairs for improved photocatalytic performances.

Out of 110 households studied, male household members were absent in 66 cases because they had migrated to nearby towns and regional centres for alternative livelihood options. Male members’ absence created opportunities for Gabura women to develop a range of novel adaptation strategies through engagement with aid agencies, changed gender roles, leveraging social capital and utilizing local knowledge. For example, women are increasingly contributing to income through works within and outside of the house in agricultural innovations and handmade productions. These adaptations are built on social capital and trust between community women and the NGOs through mobilization and sharing of local knowledge. Based on the findings, a framework for informed autonomous adaptation is proposed.

The scarcity of suitable clay and because of the CO2 emitted during the production of Portland cement as well as drying shrinkage, flow rate due to consolidation, limited attenuation capacity, and chemical instability may mean that these are not the best choices of materials to use for this purpose. An environmentally friendly method to improve the properties of local clay and provision for a long-term physical and chemical containment are essential. Geopolymers can be environmentally friendly substitutes for Portland cement to improve soil properties, not just because of the reduced carbon dioxide emission, but also because of its superior physical and chemical properties, as well as significant early strength, reduced shrinkage, freeze-thaw resistance, long-term durability, and attenuation capacity. According to previous studies, class-F fly ash-based geopolymers activated with NaOH exhibit superior attenuation capacity and long-term durability. The presence of silica, alumina, and iron oxides and the lack of calcium oxide play pivotal roles in the acceptable attenuation capacity and chemical stability of class-F fly ash. Accordingly, a clay-fly ash geopolymer may also work as a sustainable liner with appropriate physical and chemical performance. Clay can also participate in the geopolymerization process as an alumino-silicate precursor. All components of clay-fly ash geopolymers possess acceptable adsorption capacity. The type and percentage of the constituent raw materials control the attenuation capacity and physical properties of final products, however. The porosity and conductivity of typical geopolymers are related to the activator type and concentration, water content, and curing condition. Furthermore, the properties of liner materials can be adjusted with respect to the target contaminants.

A first step in restoring these functions and services is to reestablish the native vegetation structure and composition through strategic seed-based approaches. These approaches should be driven by ecological, genetic, and evolutionary principles, along with consideration for economics, logistics, and other social constraints. Effective seed-based approaches must consider the chosen species, seed sourcing, dormancy break and germination requirements, seed enhancement technologies, potential invaders, seeding densities, and long-term monitoring. Choice of species should reflect historical plant communities and future environmental conditions, species that support functional goals including invasion resistance, and seed availability constraints. Furthermore, seeds should be sourced to ensure ample genetic diversity to support multifunctionality and evolutionary capacity while also considering the broad natural dispersal of many wetland species. The decision to collect wild seeds or purchase seeds will also impact species choice and genetic diversity, which can have cascading effects for functional goals. To ensure seedling establishment, seed dormancy should be addressed through dormancy breaking treatments and the potentially narrow germination requirements of some species will require targeted sowing timing and location to align with safe sites. Other seed enhancements such as priming and coatings are poorly developed for wetland restoration and their potential for improving establishment is unknown. Because wetlands are highly invasion prone, potential invaders and their legacies should be addressed. Seeding densities should strike a balance between outcompeting invaders and preserving valuable seed resources. Invader control and long-term monitoring is key to improving revegetation and restoration. Here, we review scientific advances to improve revegetation outcomes, and provide methods and recommendations to help achieve the desired goals. Gaps in knowledge about seed-based wetland restoration currently exist, however, and untested practices will certainly increase risks in future efforts. These efforts can be used to better understand the ecological, genetic, and evolutionary processes related to wetland seeds, which will bring us one step closer to seed-based restoration of functions and services needed for human and ecological communities. © Copyright © 2020 Kettenring and Tarsa.","genetic and species diversity; revegetation; seed dormancy; seed germination; seed provenance; seed sourcing; seed sowing; seed technology",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090028097

There is, however, still some unexplained variability in outcomes with a number of cochlear-implant (CI) users, showing major limitations in speech comprehension. The current study used a multimodal diagnostic approach combining single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the mechanisms underlying speech processing in postlingually deafened CI users (N = 21). In one session, the participants performed a speech discrimination task, during which a 96-channel EEG was recorded and the perfusions marker 99mTc-HMPAO was injected intravenously. The SPECT scan was acquired 1.5 h after injection to measure the cortical activity during the speech task. The second session included a SPECT scan after injection without stimulation at rest. Analysis of EEG and SPECT data showed N400 and P600 event-related potentials (ERPs) particularly evoked by semantic violations in the sentences, and enhanced perfusion in a temporo-frontal network during task compared to rest, involving the auditory cortex bilaterally and Broca’s area. Moreover, higher performance in testing for word recognition and verbal intelligence strongly correlated to the activation in this network during the speech task. However, comparing CI users with lower and higher speech intelligibility [median split with cutoff + 7.6 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the Göttinger sentence test] revealed for CI users with higher performance additional activations of parietal and occipital regions and for those with lower performance stronger activation of superior frontal areas. Furthermore, SPECT activity was tightly coupled with EEG and cognitive abilities, as indicated by correlations between (1) cortical activation and the amplitudes in EEG, N400 (temporal and occipital areas)/P600 (parietal and occipital areas) and (2) between cortical activation in left-sided temporal and bilateral occipital/parietal areas and working memory capacity. These results suggest the recruitment of a temporo-frontal network in CI users during speech processing and a close connection between ERP effects and cortical activation in CI users. The observed differences in speech-evoked cortical activation patterns for CI users with higher and lower speech intelligibility suggest distinct processing strategies during speech rehabilitation with CI. © Copyright © 2020 Kessler, Schierholz, Mamach, Wilke, Hahne, Büchner, Geworski, Bengel, Sandmann and Berding.","cochlear-implant; electroencephalography; memory; N400; single-photon emission computed tomography; speech processing","hexamethylpropylene amine oxime technetium tc 99m; action potential amplitude; adult; aged; Article; audiometry; auditory cortex; brain perfusion; Broca area; clinical article; cochlear implantation; cognition; controlled study; correlational study; electroencephalography; event related potential; female; human; intelligence; male; multimodal imaging; neuroimaging; sensory evoked potential; signal noise ratio; single photon emission computed tomography; speech analysis; speech discrimination; speech intelligibility; speech test; task performance; temporoparietal junction; word recognition; working memory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089885992

In Almaty, a city-scale quarantine came into force on March 19, 2020, which was a week after the first COVID-19 case was registered in Kazakhstan. This study aims to analyze the effect of the lockdown from March 19 to April 14, 2020 (27 days), on the concentrations of air pollutants in Almaty. Daily concentrations of PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, and BTEX were compared between the periods before and during the lockdown. During the lockdown, the PM2.5 concentration was reduced by 21% with spatial variations of 6–34% compared to the average on the same days in 2018–2019, and still, it exceeded WHO daily limit values for 18 days. There were also substantial reductions in CO and NO2 concentrations by 49% and 35%, respectively, but an increase in O3 levels by 15% compared to the prior 17 days before the lockdown. The concentrations of benzene and toluene were 2–3 times higher than those during in the same seasons of 2015–2019. The temporal reductions may not be directly attributed to the lockdown due to favorable meteorological variations during the period, but the spatial effects of the quarantine on the pollution levels are evidenced. The results demonstrate the impact of traffic on the complex nature of air pollution in Almaty, which is substantially contributed by various nontraffic related sources, mainly coal-fired combined heat and power plants and household heating systems, as well as possible small irregular sources such as garbage burning and bathhouses. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; Almaty; Lockdown; Pollution; SARS-CoV-2","Air pollution control; Air quality; Cogeneration plants; Nitrogen oxides; Small power plants; Air quality improvement; Benzene and Toluene; Meteorological variation; PM2.5 concentration; Pollution level; Spatial variations; Substantial reduction; Urban conditions; Heating; benzene; carbon dioxide; coal; ethylbenzene; nitrogen dioxide; ortho xylene; oxygen; toluene; air quality; concentration (composition); COVID-19; disease control; emission inventory; environmental assessment; exhaust emission; pollutant source; quarantine; urban atmosphere; viral disease; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; electric power plant; heat wave; household; incineration; Kazakhstan; meteorological phenomena; particulate matter; priority journal; quarantine; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; traffic and transport; urban area; Betacoronavirus; city; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; pandemic; virus pneumonia; Almaty; Kazakhstan; SARS coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Kazakhstan; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084190037

In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, high asthma prevalence rates and poor asthma control is attributed to urban air pollution and substandard housing, both of which will be made worse by climate change in the Mid-Atlantic region. Climate change will increase air pollution, worsen indoor environmental conditions, and bring more unpredictable weather, all of which will make asthma more difficult to manage. This article describes a public education project designed to teach vulnerable local communities about climate change and its impact on asthma management. The Climate Ready Philly project provided basic information on the mechanisms of global climate change, presented research on how climate change would impact the city of Philadelphia, and facilitated hands-on activities to help workshop participants learn what they could do to address climate change at home. Our workshops paired healthy homes and energy efficiency strategies, for example, to explore relationships between outdoor and indoor environments, as well as impacts on occupant health. By utilizing climate learning science, our workshops allowed participants to explore relationships between existing health and environmental conditions-such as asthma- A nd the anticipated impacts of climate change. Using surveys, interviews, and ethnographic data collection, we found that more resources are needed to repair housing infrastructure and help low-income community members access resources that can improve indoor air quality. We conclude by highlighting the need for climate adaptation programs that provide support for housing, in addition to other public infrastructures, which will be needed to reduce the burden of asthma in Philadelphia. © 2020 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","air quality; asthma; climate change; community education; housing","asthma; climate change; disease control; teaching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092660871

A smoking laminar diffusion flame of methane with flame length of ~100 mm was used, with and without NaCl particles introduced into the fuel stream. Extractive probe sampling with high dilution was used to sample particles and characterize their size and mixing state. Particle size distribution results showed that for the methane-only flame, the soot particles underwent typical processes of formation and coagulation in the flame, partial oxidation near the flame tip, and further coagulation in the post-flame region. In the case of the methane–NaCl flame, the coagulation rate between soot particles decreased in the agglomeration region of the flame, resulting in smaller soot particles with higher number concentration. Near the open tip of the flame, the NaCl inhibited soot oxidation, leading to larger particles compared to the methane-only flame due to continued coagulation and reduced oxidation of soot particles. In the post-flame region, where the temperature was sufficiently low, NaCl particles nucleated from its vapour phase, which was a distinct mode from that of soot in the particle size distributions. Electron microscopy images showed that these nucleated NaCl particles were mostly externally mixed and occasionally internally mixed with soot particles. Thermal-optical analysis of emissions sampled from post-flame region showed that the mass concentration of elemental carbon increased by a factor of ~3 when NaCl was added to the flame. However, addition of NaCl did not affect the mass-specific absorption coefficient of particle emissions, which was within previously reported values in the literature. © 2020 The Combustion Institute","Alkali metal additive; Particle size distribution; Probe sampling; Soot mixing state; Soot optical properties; Soot oxidation","Coagulation; Dust; Light absorption; Methane; Mixing; Optical properties; Oxidation; Particle size; Size distribution; Sodium chloride; Soot; Electron microscopy images; Laminar diffusion flames; Number concentration; Partial oxidations; Particle emissions; Sodium chloride (NaCl); Specific absorption coefficients; Thermal-optical analysis; Particle size analysis; carbon; fuel; methane; sodium chloride; air pollution; Article; electron microscopy; flame; light absorption; oxidation; particle size; polarimetry; priority journal; sample; smoking; soot; temperature; thermal analysis; vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085353777

There is, however, often a temporal mismatch between the waste heat availability and the heating demand, and typically fossil-based peak boilers are used to cover the remaining heat demand. This study investigates the potential of applying a thermal energy storage tank at the district heating supply system at Mo Industrial Park in Norway, where waste heat from the off-gas of a ferrosilicon production plant is the main heating source. To cover peak heating demands, boilers based on CO gas, electricity, and oil are applied. The reduction in peak heating costs and emissions is evaluated as a function of tank size for two different scenarios: (1) a scenario where CO gas, which is a byproduct from another nearby industry, is the main peak heating source; and (2) a scenario where no CO gas is available, and electricity is the main peak heating source. The highest economic viability is obtained with the smallest storage tank with a volume of 1000 m3, yielding a payback period of 7.1/16.2 years and a reduction in total heat production costs of 14.6/10.0% for Scenarios 1/2, respectively. The reduction in CO2 emissions is 19.4/14.8%, equal to 820/32 ton CO2 for the analyzed period. Sensitivity analysis shows a significant reduction in payback period for Scenario 2 with increasing electricity prices, while the payback period in Scenario 1 is most sensitive to the emission factors. © 2019 by the authors.

Part of this analysis is built upon the review of two climate change cases brought before national courts, since they have different outcomes even though both use the fundamental human rights of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) as their legal bases. The cases are the Urgenda Foundation v. Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Union of Swiss Senior Women for Climate Protection v. Swiss Federal Council and Others. The Urgenda case establishes a link between the rights in article 2 and 8 ECHR, and climate change, which creates a positive obligation for a state to protect these rights by acting to combat climate change. The Swiss Climate Protection case, however, is dismissed. Both cases highlight some of the challenges regarding climate change in relation to the fundamental human rights of the ECHR. Judgments by the ECtHR are final, and the formally and informally binding nature of case law from the court is argued to indicate the possibility of a powerful tool in relation to climate change action since 47 states will be affected by the court's decisions. However, if a case brought before the ECtHR has an unfavourable outcome in relation to forcing greater governmental action in combating climate change, this may also have greater consequences than such an outcome of a domestic challenge, since it will set a minimum standard of care, or completely exclude climate change in relation to human rights. The article argues that it should be considered worth the identified risks to bring a claim before the ECtHR even though it is uncertain if the evolving nature of the charter is ready to establish obligations in relation to climate change, due to the unprecedented and severe threat that climate change constitutes. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Measuring the doubly isotopically substituted molecules (isotopocules) of N2O can add new opportunities to fingerprint and constrain its cycle. Methods: We present a laser spectroscopic technique to selectively and simultaneously measure the eight most abundant isotopocules of N2O, including three doubly substituted species – so called “clumped isotopes”. For the absolute quantification of individual isotopocule abundances, we propose a new calibration scheme that combines thermal equilibration of a working standard gas with a direct mole fraction-based approach. Results: The method is validated for a large range of isotopic composition values by comparison with other established methods (laser spectroscopy using conventional isotopic scale and isotope ratio mass spectrometry). Direct intercomparison with recently developed ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry shows clearly the advantages of the new laser technique, especially with respect to site specificity of isotopic substitution in the N2O molecule. Conclusions: Our study represents a new methodological basis for the measurements of both singly substituted and clumped N2O isotopes. It has a high potential to stimulate future research in the N2O community by establishing a new class of reservoir-insensitive tracers and molecular-scale insights. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088304200

The study explores the surface morphology of the inclined holes (30 ͦ, 60 ͦ, and 90 ͦ) drilled in CFRP under cryogenic cooling using coated carbide tools. Inclined hole drilling performance was measured using machining forces, surface finish, and bore integrity. It has been shown that cryogenic machining of acutely inclined small diameter holes generated at least 40% higher thrust forces compared to dry cutting. Surface quality under cryogenic was enhanced than dry cutting with reduced matrix transverse cracking that helped suppress the fiber debonding and pull out. This mechanism also aids to minimize stress concentration regions along matrix/fiber interfaces due to promotion of fracture mode II in-plane sliding shear of carbon fibers and reduction of fracture mode III out of plane peel-up and push-down interlaminar delamination. Effect of tool coating on bore surface integrity showed that double coat TiN tool with a point angle of 140 ͦ generated at least 40% lower thrust forces than Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD)-coated multilayer TiAlN flat bottom drill during cryogenic-assisted drilling. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis.","CFRP; Cryogenic; drilling; integrity; machining; roughness","Aluminum compounds; Boreholes; Carbide tools; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Cryogenics; Infill drilling; Physical vapor deposition; Rivets; Surface morphology; Titanium nitride; Aircraft components; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer; Coated carbide tools; Concentration region; Cryogenic environment; Cryogenic machining; Interlaminar delamination; Small-diameter holes; Morphology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088403807

This is salient in emerging economies, where impending socio-economic and infrastructural transitions hold immense potential for locking-in low-carbon development pathways. Yet, little is understood about how developing countries can scale appropriate technology transitions, given their often underdeveloped technological innovation capabilities and supporting infrastructures and finances. This paper examines a recent, rapid, and ongoing transition of India's lighting market to light emitting diode (LED) technology, from a negligible market share to LEDs becoming the dominant lighting products within five years, despite the country's otherwise limited visibility in the global solid-state lighting industry. Annual sales of LED bulbs grew more than 130 times to over 650 million bulbs between 2014–2018, with over 30 billion kWh of estimated annual energy savings. Focusing on this striking story of technology transition, this paper analyzes India's LED uptake using semi-structured interviews and drawing on the technology innovation systems literature. The results show that the success of transition coexists with its share of shortfalls, and that there is an important tension between the lowering of upfront costs of low-carbon technologies and the efforts to enhance domestic technological capabilities. The paper discusses the results for the Indian LED case and emphasizes the importance of consistent strategic action taking into account all (and not limited) parts of the technology innovation system, while also providing insights on how mitigation technologies can be developed and deployed in developing countries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Developing countries; Energy efficiency; India; Light emitting diode (LED); Solid state lighting; Technology innovation systems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082194932

It sets out to gain a better understanding of whether and for whom green electricity defaults work. The present study is one of the first to use a large-scale data set to investigate this question. We combine micro-level data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) covering private households (including a wealth of individual information) with macro-level information such as population density of a region and proportion of energy suppliers in a given region that use a green opt-out tariff within their basic supply. We show that in Germany, green defaults, automatically enrolling customers in renewable energy sources, tend to stick, especially but not only among those who are concerned about the problem of climate change. This finding, based on real-world rather than experimental evidence, attests to the power of automatic enrollment in addressing environmental problems in Germany and potentially beyond, including climate change, and also adds to the growing literature on the substantial effects of shifting from opt-in to opt-out strategies. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change policy; Defaults; Green energy demand; Opt-out tariffs; Renewable energy","alternative energy; demand analysis; electricity industry; electricity supply; energy policy; energy resource; environmental economics; green economy; population density; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083846546

Knowledge of the relative contribution of gasoline- versus diesel-powered vehicles is highly relevant for policymaking, and yet there is a lack of an effective observation-based method to determine this quantity, especially for its robust tracking over a period of years. In this work, we present an approach to track separate contributions of gasoline and diesel vehicles through the positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis of online monitoring data measurable by relatively inexpensive analytical instruments. They are PM2.5 organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC), C2-C9 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (e.g., pentanes, benzene, xylenes, etc.), and nitrogen oxide concentrations. The method was applied to monitoring data spanning more than 6 years between 2011 and 2017 in a roadside environment in Hong Kong. We found that diesel vehicles accounted for ∼70 %-90 % of the vehicular PM2.5 (PMvehicle) over the years and the remainder from gasoline vehicles. The diesel PMvehicle during truck- and bus-dominated periods showed declining trends simultaneous with control efforts targeted at diesel commercial vehicles and franchised buses in the intervening period. The combined PMvehicle from diesel and gasoline vehicles by PMF agrees well with an independent estimate by the EC-tracer method, both confirming PMvehicle contributed significantly to the PM2.5 in this urban environment (∼4-8 μg m-3, representing 30 %-60 % in summer and 10 %-20 % in winter). Our work shows that the long-term monitoring of roadside VOCs and PM2.5 OC and EC is effective for tracking gaseous and PM pollutants from different vehicle categories. This work also demonstrates the value of an evidence-based approach in support of effective control policy formulation. © Author(s) 2020.",,"air quality; carbon emission; concentration (composition); diesel; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; traffic emission; volatile organic compound; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092192816

Therefore, measuring indoor PM2.5 concentrations is important for assessing their health risks and further investigating the sources and influential factors. However, installing monitoring instruments to collect indoor PM2.5 data is difficult and expensive. Therefore, several indoor PM2.5 concentration prediction models have been developed. However, these prediction models only assess the daily average PM2.5 concentrations in cold or temperate regions. The factors that influence PM2.5 concentration differ according to climatic conditions. In this study, we developed a prediction model for hourly indoor PM2.5 concentrations in Taiwan (tropical and subtropical region) by using a multiple linear regression model and investigated the impact factor. The sample comprised 93 study cases (1979 measurements) and 25 potential predictor variables. Cross-validation was performed to assess performance. The prediction model explained 74% of the variation, and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations, the difference between indoor and outdoor CO2 levels, building type, building floor level, bed sheet cleaning, bed sheet replacement, and mosquito coil burning were included in the prediction model. Cross-validation explained 75% of variation on average. The results also confirm that the prediction model can be used to estimate indoor PM2.5 concentrations across seasons and areas. In summary, we developed a prediction model of hourly indoor PM2.5 concentrations and suggested that outdoor PM2.5 concentrations, ventilation, building characteristics, and human activities should be considered. Moreover, it is important to consider outdoor air quality while occupants open or close windows or doors for regulating ventilation rate and human activities changing also can reduce indoor PM2.5 concentrations. © MDPI AG.

The central heating system is a complex multi-variable nonlinear strong coupling system. So far, there is no precise model to get each parameter. The empirical parameters have proven to be effective and reliable in practice, but they are not necessarily optimal and comprehensive, and they cannot be directly used by computer control systems. In recent years, many new algorithms for fitting nonlinear systems have emerged, among which artificial neural network algorithm is one of the most successful algorithms. One of the essences of neural network algorithms is machine learning - the network is trained through continuous and extensive use of historical observation data and even empirical data to make the model optimally approximate the real model. Therefore, this paper analyzes the principles and objectives of heat exchange station regulation, clarifies the control parameters, and focuses on the control model based on neural network to identify the heat output of the heat exchange station and the outdoor atmospheric temperature changes. The advantages and disadvantages of the BP neural network (BPNN), general regression neural network (GRNN) and radial basis neural network (RBF) models were compared.

The Indo-Pacific region has the highest seagrass biodiversity, yet little focus has been made to compare seagrass habitat extent and carbon dynamics with their temperate counterparts. The present study assessed habitat characteristics and seagrass species distribution, diversity, and carbon storage in Eastern (marine) and Western (estuarine) mangrove-fringed creeks of Gazi Bay, Kenya. Data on species composition, canopy cover, biomass, and sediment organic carbon were collected in 80 plots of 0.25 × 0.25 m laid along transects established perpendicular to the waterline. Five species formation, viz., Thalassia hemprichii, Cymodocea rotundata, Cymodocea serrulata, Enhalus acoroides, and Thalassidendron ciliatum, were encountered as either single or mixed stands. There was a significant difference in total seagrass biomass between creeks (p &lt; 0.01), with the Eastern creek recording a mean of 10.2 ± 0.6 Mg C ha–1 while the Western creek recording 4.3 ± 0.3 Mg C ha–1. In addition, sediment carbon to 1-m depth varied significantly (p &lt; 0.01) between species in the two creeks and ranged from 98 to 302 Mg C ha–1, with the Eastern and Western creeks recording means of 258 ± 90 and 107 ± 21 Mg C ha–1, respectively. The total carbon stock from 50 ha of seagrasses in the Eastern creek was 13,420 Mg C, whereas in the 70 ha of the Western creek it was 7,769 Mg C. The study shows that seagrass community attributes such as species composition and productivity can vary dramatically over a small spatial extent due to differences in biophysical conditions and caution estimations of site-specific carbon stocks using generalized global values. © Copyright © 2020 Juma, Magana, Michael and Kairo.","above- and belowground biomass; carbon stocks; Gazi Bay; Kenya; seagrass; sediment carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090765165

Doped carbon-based materials offer a viable means for replacing Pt, but their activity improvement still remains a great challenge. Here, configurations of N-doped carbons are first analyzed using ab initio simulations toward ORR. The results show that a certain short-range ordered structure labeled as C-N2, which comprises of two nitrogen atoms flanking carbon, is the optimal choice. The predicted configuration of C-N2 is experimentally realized by triazine-doped carbon (triNC). The triNC with C-N2 sites demonstrates high ORR activity (onset potential 0.98 V, halfwave potential 0.89 V) comparable to commercial 20% Pt/C. The highly localized and positive-charged carbon atom in the C-N2 structure facilitates the dissociation of O2 to increase the ORR kinetics, proved by theoretical calculation. A Zn-air cathode is fabricated using the triNC ORR electrocatalyst and outperforms the cathode using Pt/C in terms of specific capacity, energy density and long-term durability. The atomic-scale approach reported here provides a good strategy to achieve active carbon-based electrocatalysts for potential and scalable use in energy conversion and storage.

In those places slow to respond, climate litigation has emerged as a method that activists are using to force action. Of the 700 or so pending cases, the climate litigation presently garnering the most attention is Juliana v. United States where 21 youth have challenged the actions of the federal government for knowingly creating and exacerbating climate change. Others have taken to the streets to challenge government inaction on climate change. In both instances, courts are often left as de facto policy makers. This paper seeks to document the precedent-setting Juliana v. United States case and understand the implication of the actions of young climate advocates as they seek to defend their rights to a sustainable future. The paper also explores such youth and civic activism and inaction in relation to “sustainable” tourism. It calls for better consideration of the needs of children and young people in discussions of climate justice and tourism, particularly the future generations of children and youth who stand to bear the brunt of climate change impacts in the Global North and South. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate action; climate justice; litigation; sustainable tourism; US v.

Unfortunately, this positive or ‘bright’ role of termites is often overshadowed by their ‘dark’ side, that is, their status as pests threatening agriculture and constructions. This article assesses advances in our knowledge of the impact of termites on several sustainable development goals (SDGs 1 ‘no poverty’, 2 ‘zero hunger’, 3 ‘good health’, 9 ‘innovation’, 11 ‘sustainable cities’, 13 ‘climate action’ and 15 ‘life on land’).

It also examines whether action taken thus far to implement Annex 9 indicate a marked improvement in adaptive capacity in addressing climate problems in the Great Lakes Basin. The author argues that the effectiveness of climate action in the Great Lakes Basin depends not only on the domestic efforts of the U.S. and Canadian governments, the responsible parties in implementing binational water agreements. It also hinges on whether they have the institutional capacity and the political will required to help fund and coordinate the actions of the several heterogeneous networks. Between 2012 and 2019, significant progress was made in the areas of information-sharing, network-building, and capacity-building for more effective measurement, monitoring, and analysis of climate change impacts in the Great Lakes Basin. However, the Parties have not yet developed a long-term binational framework for action supporting climate change adaptation and resilience. In the meantime, First Nations and municipal and other networks are implementing their own community-level resilience plans, but these actors cannot fully compensate for weak federal leadership and inadequate human and financial resources. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Canada-U.S. relations; Climate change; Great Lakes (North America); Transboundary water governance","Heterogeneous networks; Lakes; Quality control; Water quality; Binational cooperation; Canada-U.S. relations; Climate change adaptation; Climate change impact; Great lakes; Great lakes water quality agreements; Institutional capacities; Transboundary water; Climate change; climate change; governance approach; international agreement; leadership; local government; nongovernmental organization; resilience; water management; water planning; Canada; Great Lakes Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079713283

When sMMOH forms a complex with MMOB, the rate constants are greatly increased for the sequential access of O2, protons, and CH4 to an oxygen-bridged diferrous metal cluster located in the buried active site. Here, we report high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of the diferric and diferrous states of both sMMOH and the sMMOH:MMOB complex using the components from Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. These structures are analyzed for O2 access routes enhanced when the complex forms. Previously reported, lower-resolution structures of the sMMOH:MMOB complex from the sMMO of Methylococcus capsulatus Bath revealed a series of cavities through sMMOH postulated to serve as the O2 conduit. This potential role is evaluated in greater detail using the current structures. Additionally, a search for other potential O2 conduits in the M. trichosporium OB3b sMMOH:MMOB complex revealed a narrow molecular tunnel, termed the W308-tunnel. This tunnel is sized appropriately for O2 and traverses the sMMOH-MMOB interface before accessing the active site. The kinetics of reaction of O2 with the diferrous sMMOH:MMOB complex in solution show that use of the MMOB V41R variant decreases the rate constant for O2 binding >25000-fold without altering the component affinity. The location of Val41 near the entrance to the W308-tunnel is consistent with the tunnel serving as the primary route for the transfer of O2 into the active site. Accordingly, the crystal structures show that formation of the diferrous sMMOH:MMOB complex restricts access through the chain of cavities while opening the W308-tunnel. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Crystals; Methane; Current structure; Lower resolution; Methylosinus trichosporium; Sequential access; Soluble methane monooxygenase; Soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO); Structural studies; X ray crystal structures; Rate constants; methane monooxygenase; oxygen; oxygenase; methane monooxygenase; oxygenase; Article; crystal structure; enzyme active site; Methylococcus capsulatus; Methylosinus trichosporium; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein interaction; protein structure; X ray crystallography; chemistry; kinetics; metabolism; molecular model; solubility; Catalytic Domain; Kinetics; Models, Molecular; Oxygenases; Solubility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089708463

In 2014, New York City (NYC) committed to reduce GHG emissions by 80% by 2050 (80 × 50). In this analysis we quantified the air quality-related public health benefits of the policies outlined in the 80 × 50 strategy, compared sector-specific (buildings, energy, transportation) policy impacts, and assessed variations in benefits across NYC neighborhoods. We applied air quality modeling and health impact assessment tools to estimate expected changes in ambient PM2.5 and related health outcomes by Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA). Full implementation of 80 × 50 strategies would reduce PM2.5 (fine particulates) concentrations across NYC ZCTAs by 7% (3%, 10%) (ZCTA median, 10th, 90th percentile), avoiding between 160 and 390 premature deaths and 460 hospitalizations and emergency department visits for respiratory and cardiovascular disease each year, valued at $3.4 billion annually. Across all the policy scenarios we estimated 10 times more avoided asthma emergency department visits in low-income neighborhoods as compared to the wealthiest neighborhoods even though median declines in ambient PM2.5 were similar.

In this study, both WRF-Chem simulation and on-site measurements were utilized for the Baengnyeong (island) supersite, one of the representative regional background sites located in the Yellow Sea, the entrance area of the long-range transport process in Korea. The changes in the chemical compositions of inorganic aerosols were examined for spring-time during the Chinese emission mitigation period from 2014 to 2016. The measured ratio of ionic species to PM2.5 at the Baengnyeong supersite showed changes in aerosol inorganic chemical compositions from sulfate in 2014 to nitrate in 2015–2016. The modeling results also showed that nitrate was low in 2014 and significantly increased in 2015 and 2016, and the acidic aerosol condition had also changed toward a more neutralized status in both the simulation and the observations. The WRF-Chem modeling study further indicated that the sulfur was not neutralized in 2014. However, in 2015 and 2016, SO2 was more sufficiently neutralized as sulfur emissions were substantially reduced in China, while at the same time nitrate had begun to increase in such a ‘SO2–poor’ condition in Beijing area in China, and thus approaching more enhanced neutralization over the Yellow Sea area. The causes of the higher nitrate based on the modeled characteristics of the ammonia-sulfate-nitrate aerosol formation in response to the SO2 emissions reduction in China are also discussed in this paper. © 2020 The Authors","Baengnyeong supersite; Chinese emissions mitigation; Inorganic aerosol; Yellow Sea","Aerosols; Ammonia; Emission control; Inorganic chemicals; Nitrates; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Baengnyeong supersite; Chemical compositions; Emission mitigation; Emissions mitigation; Inorganic aerosol; Long range transport; On-site measurement; Yellow sea; Air pollution; aerosol composition; ammonia; atmospheric modeling; chemical composition; inorganic matter; long range transport; neutralization; nitrate; sulfate; sulfur emission; Baengnyeong Island; Beijing [China]; China; Incheon [South Korea]; Pacific Ocean; South Korea; Yellow Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081675154

However, regulation of the emission colors in CDs for lighting device still remains a challenge. In this work, we developed a green hydrothermal method to obtain three emission colors of CDs using L-tyrosine (for blue CDs), o-phenylendiamine (for green CDs) and L-tyrosine/o-phenylendiamine mixture (for orange-red CDs). These CDs possess good water dispersibility, strong emission with high quantum yields, and excellent photostability. Furthermore, the resulting CDs were dispersed in polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix to yield solid state films, where the self-quenching effect in solid state was effectively avoided. A full-color light-emitting diode was fabricated by packing the CDs-PVA composites on the top of a UV-chip, which have superior potential applications in CDs-based solid-state lighting system. © 2020","Carbon dots; Fluorescence; Light-emitting diode; Photoluminescene; Self-quenching effect","Amino acids; Carbon; Citrus fruits; Color; Diodes; Fluorescence; Quenching; Carbon dots; Hydrothermal methods; Photoluminescene; Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA); Self-quenching effect; Solid state lighting systems; Water dispersibility; White light emitting diodes; Light emitting diodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082525928

However, there is still a debate on the ecological effects of spring greening on seasonal carbon and water budgets. This study jointly investigated the concurrent and lagged effects of spring greening on carbon gain (gross primary productivity, GPP) and water loss (evapotranspiration, ET) in the summer-active ecosystems at mid and high latitudes of NH using remote sensing and multimodel ensemble data during 1982–2013. The results showed that the collective promotion of spring greening to concurrent GPP and ET is widespread despite variations in magnitude and significance. Both beneficial and adverse lagged effects of spring greening on summer GPP commonly appear with an obvious spatial heterogeneity and difference among climate-plant types. However, the expected significant suppression of spring greening to summer GPP was rarely observed even in the areas where spring ET was significantly promoted by spring greening. Nevertheless, when drought was taken into account, the response patterns of spring water use to spring greening varied to some extent, and the adverse lagged effect of spring greening to summer GPP appeared or strengthened in some regions, especially during the years with dry summer. Given the predicted warming of the climate and more frequent climatic extremes, the adverse effect of spring greening should be given more attention. © 2020, ISB.","Carbon gain; Lagged effect; Northern hemisphere; Remote sensing; Spring greening; Water loss","carbon; water; carbon cycle; ecosystem; season; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Ecosystem; Seasons; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083853411

Nevertheless, approximately 50 % of the feed used for industrial production of orange juice is wasted, primarily as peels, a promising raw material for being used in the different biotechnological processes. This study evaluated the potential of two-stage anaerobic digestion (reactor of 4.3 L total volume) to valorize orange juice residues. The system replaced the use of other pretreatments and increased methane concentration (approximately 60 % compared with about 50 %) and volume (by 13 %) relative to one-stage anaerobic digestion. The accumulated biogas yield was 0.79 L/g SVT and 0.49 L/g SVT for the methanogenic and control reactors, respectively. Also, the anaerobic reactors were able to start-up with high solids feed, which could be applied to the Upflow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket (UASB) reactors currently in operation in the citrus juice industry. The potential electric power generated was estimated as 97.5 × 103 MWh/year, which might be used on-site or sold back to the energy grid where it represents 0.2 % of the total energy used by São Paulo State. The potential greenhouse gas mitigation from the substitution of electric energy from the Brazilian energy grid to a more renewable one from biogas burning was estimated to be 9.05 × 103 tCO2eq/year.

The amount of carbon emissions caused by urban activities has also been increasing. Especially, the contribution of urban household waste to carbon emissions is very high. It is the second largest global greenhouse gas. Adults are sources of emissions. The research object of this article is Shanghai Municipal Solid Waste, which simplifies the life cycle of domestic waste into two parts: transportation part and treatment part. It uses the provincial GHG inventory production method recommended by IPCC (2006) for the life of Shanghai from 2005 to 2015. Rubbish carries out carbon emission accounting and observes the changing trend of carbon emissions year by year. The results show that the production of domestic garbage in Shanghai has basically stabilized, and the proportion of household garbage disposed by sanitary landfills accounts for the most. The main carbon emissions in the transportation process are automobile vehicle tail gas emissions. The main carbon emissions in the waste treatment process are carbon emissions from sanitary landfills. The carbon emissions from landfill disposal are at a minimum, and the generation of household waste when incinerated and generated can be reduced. For Shanghai, the optimization of transportation routes and the reduction of sanitary landfill disposal of the amount of domestic waste is the most important emission reduction measure. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Life cycle; Planning; Sanitation; Sustainable development; Transportation routes; Waste treatment; Carbon emissions; Domestic garbage; Emission reduction; Household waste; Inventory productions; Landfill disposal; Transportation process; Waste treatment process; Municipal solid waste",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091222119

We designed this time-series analysis in a Chinese city Yancheng, to explore the relationship of PM2.5-10 with outpatient visits for cardiopulmonary diseases. The study period was from 2013 to 2015. A typical generalized additive model was used. We explored the lag patterns by building a series of lag of exposure. We also built two-pollutant models to ascertain the independence of PM2.5-10. Stratified analyses were applied to compare the season-specific associations. Finally, we pooled the concentration-response (C-R) curves for PM2.5-10 and outpatient visits. We recorded a daily average of 85 and 43 outpatient visits for cardiovascular and respiratory causes, respectively. PM2.5-10 exposures of lag 05 day yielded the best estimates for both outcomes. Per 10-μg/m3 increase in PM2.5-10, there was a 1.69% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68%–2.72%) increase in outpatient visits for respiratory causes, and a 0.85% (95% CI: 0.13%–1.57%) increase for cardiovascular causes. The association kept robust after adjusting for PM2.5 and O3, and there were larger associations in warm seasons. The C-R curves had a larger slope for respiratory diseases in relatively lower concentrations (&lt;30 μg/m3), and PM2.5-10 was positively associated with cardiovascular diseases in higher concentrations (&gt;30 μg/m3). This study indicated significant associations of PM2.5-10 with cardiopulmonary outpatient visit.

The paper's outcomes demonstrate that, to inspire shipping companies to comply with ECA regulations, the government should apply a strategy, which is following dynamic penalty, to make shipping companies more willing to execute the ECA regulation within less time.

Black locust has been widely planted in China as a promising species for afforestation programs, farmland shelterbelt projects, and soil restoration in mined areas because of its rapid growth and adaptability to environmental stressors. Here, we examined soil bacterial community structure and predicted bacterial metabolic function in the rhizosphere of black locust exposed to elevated temperature (+1.99 °C) and Pb for 4 years. Elevated temperature significantly (p < 0.05) reduced total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), and total sulfur (TS) contents in above-ground parts but increased TC and TN contents in roots and seedling height under Pb exposure. Elevated temperature significantly (p < 0.05) increased Pb availability and raised pH, TC, TN, TS and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) contents, and the C:H ratio in rhizosphere soils under Pb exposure. The interactive effects between Pb and temperature on pH, TC, TH, TS, WSOC, and the C:H ratio were significant (p < 0.05). Elevated temperature significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the diversity and the richness of bacterial community, altered genus-level bacterial community composition, and improved (p < 0.05) the relative abundances of some bacteria involving in terpenoids and polyketides and xenobiotics biodegradation metabolism under Pb exposure. Canonical correspondence analysis indicated that pH, WSOC, C:N ratio, and soluble Pb were significant (p < 0.05) factors on the relative abundance of bacterial genera, such as Ochrobactrum and Sphingomnas. Overall, long-term elevated temperature resulted in changes in rhizosphere soil characteristics and Pb availability, thus affecting the bacterial community structure and metabolic functional groups. The conclusion helps us understand the response mechanism of soil bacteria in the rhizosphere to heavy metals under global warming scenarios. © 2020","Bacterial community; Black locust; Elevated temperature; Metabolic function; Pb availability; Rhizosphere soil characteristics","Bacteria; Biochemistry; Biodegradation; Global warming; Lead; Metabolism; Organic carbon; Reforestation; Soil pollution; Bacterial community composition; Bacterial community structure; Canonical Correspondence Analysis; Environmental stressors; Farmland shelterbelts; Microbial characteristics; Soil bacterial community; Water-soluble organic carbon; Soils; carbon; hydrogen; lead; nitrogen; organic carbon; sulfur; unclassified drug; water soluble organic carbon; air temperature; community structure; environmental stress; lead; metabolism; microbial community; rhizosphere; seedling; soil biota; soil pollution; soil quality; air temperature; Anaeromyxobacter; Article; Bacillus; bioavailability; biodegradation; biosynthesis; community structure; controlled study; genus; Geobacter; metabolism; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; Ochrobactrum; plant root; pollution; population abundance; priority journal; rhizosphere; Robinia pseudoacacia; Roseiflexus; seedling; soil acidity; soil microflora; species composition; species richness; Sphingomonas; Streptomyces; China; microbiology; rhizosphere; Robinia; soil; soil pollutant; temperature; China; Bacteria (microorganisms); Ochrobactrum; China; Rhizosphere; Robinia; Seedlings; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084592643

However, despite many studies in relation to the technology have been reported so far, there are few investigations focusing on its use in cold regions. In this study, experimental measurement data for a DS-STPV window in terms of power generation and surface temperature were compared with those obtained from EnergyPlus simulations. The measured and simulated results agreed well, which confirmed the reliability of the simulation methodology adopted. On this basis, the energy performance of DS-STPV windows with non-ventilated, inner loop, and air supply ventilation modes was analyzed by simulations performed for winter conditions in cold regions. The results showed that as compared with the other two ventilation modes, the use of air supply DS-STPV windows is capable of reducing the building net electricity use by 18.5% and 20.2%, respectively. Further, an optimal control strategy for DS-STPV windows employed in cold regions was also proposed. It was found that with the use of the proposed strategy, the building net electricity use can be effectively reduced by 3.5% and 12.3%, respectively. Relevant findings of the present study provide an insight into optimal design and control of the DS-STPV windows employed in cold regions. Further, the results presented and the simulation methodology established will also be useful for further development of the technology for energy savings and emission reductions. © 2020 International Solar Energy Society","DS-STPV; Energy saving potential; Net electricity use; Thermoelectric performance; Ventilation modes","Emission control; Optimal control systems; Thermoelectricity; Ventilation; Building energy performance; Comparative studies; Effective approaches; Optimal control strategy; Semi-transparent photovoltaic; Simulation methodology; Surface temperatures; Thermoelectric performance; Energy efficiency; comparative study; electrical power; electricity; numerical model; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; simulation; surface temperature; thermal power; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086446151

This study reports on the results of an experimental evaluation of a carbon finance-enabled program conducted in rural villages in Rajasthan, India. Half (or 20) of 40 purposively-selected treatment villages were randomly assigned to an ‘early’ intervention group that was offered a package of two biomass fuel ICS one year prior to the other half (the ‘late’ group). Analysis of data collected prior to the second phase of the intervention shows that adoption of ICS reached nearly 46% in the group exposed to the intervention, and that households largely held positive short-term views of the effects of these technologies. Moreover, we found evidence of both time savings and reductions in fuel use among intervention households. Consistent with the wider literature on the limitations of biomass-burning ICS, however, we failed to detect consistent effects on self-reported respiratory health. Findings were generally consistent across simple and difference-in-difference estimates of impacts, and suggest that biomass-burning ICS can deliver benefits even when they offer few improvements in health. © 2020 International Energy Initiative","Biomass; Household air pollution; Improved cookstoves; Rural India; Traditional cookstoves","Rural areas; Analysis of data; Biomass fuels; Biomass-burning; Difference-in-differences; Experimental evaluation; Rajasthan , India; Rural villages; Technology solutions; Biomass; biomass burning; cooking appliance; fuel consumption; rural area; technology adoption; India; Rajasthan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087198720

During the oxidative dehydrogenation of chemical looping (CL-ODH), the Fe nanoparticles (Fe2O3) on the rutile TiO2 were partially transformed to the thermally stable FeTiO3 phases with its lower oxidation state (Fe2+) below 700 °C. However, the formations of Fe2TiO5 phases were found to be less active than the smaller sizes of iron oxides (Fe3+). The thermally stable iron phases with their reversible redox natures between FeTiO3 and Fe2O3 phases were responsible for a stable reduction-oxidation activity.

Eleven source factors were identified: coal combustion characterized by secondary sulphate, secondary nitrate, summertime organic carbon (OC), regional elemental carbon (EC), biomass burning, oil combustion, primary tailpipe emissions, non-tailpipe emissions related to road dust, non-tailpipe emissions related to brake wear, metal production, and road salt. Overall, coal combustion, secondary nitrate, regional EC, and oil combustion underwent marked decreases in concentrations with large reduction rates ranging from −8% yr−1 to −18% yr−1, contributing to an overall 34% decrease in annual PM2.5 over the past 14 years. Decreases in local tailpipe emissions (−3% yr−1) were consistent with the reduction of traffic-related air pollutants. In contrast, non-tailpipe emissions remained constant until 2010–2011 and then increased with a range of rates of 21% yr−1 to 27% yr−1 from 2011 to 2016. The contribution of summertime OC increased to approximately 27% in the summer of 2013–2016, rising to become the largest PM2.5 source driven by the reduction of regional sources. The chemical composition of PM2.5 in the urban area drastically changed from inorganic-rich to organic- and metal-rich particles during 2013–2016. The depletion of ascorbic acid was measured using filter samples collected over one year to identify PM2.5 components and sources contributing to the oxidative potential (OP) of PM2.5. The OP was clearly associated with trace elements (e.g., Ba, Cu, Fe). Non-tailpipe emissions related to road dust and brake wear presented high redox activity per mass of PM2.5. This work suggests that summertime OC and non-tailpipe emissions in recent years have become increasingly important. As such, policies targeting traffic-related PM2.5 should focus on these sources for maximum impact. © 2020 Elsevier LtdNon-tailpipe emissions (brake wear and resuspension of road dust) are rising, while PM2.5 has markedly decreased mainly due to reduced emissions from fossil fuels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Non-tailpipe emissions; Oxidative potential; Source apportionment; Tailpipe emissions; Trace metals","Air pollution; Ascorbic acid; Brakes; Chemical speciation; Coal dust; Coal industry; Fossil fuels; Nitrates; Organic carbon; Petroleum industry; Redox reactions; Roads and streets; Sulfur compounds; Trace elements; Wear of materials; Air pollution measurements; Chemical compositions; Long term analysis; Metropolitan area; Oxidative potential; Particulate Matter; Secondary nitrates; Tailpipe emission; Coal combustion; barium; coal; copper; iron; nitrate; oil; organic carbon; sodium chloride; sulfate; trace element; atmospheric pollution; chemical composition; coal combustion; concentration (composition); emission inventory; oxidative stress; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution policy; trace element; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; biomass; Canada; carbon footprint; chemical composition; combustion; controlled study; oxidation reduction potential; particulate matter; reduction (chemistry); Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084044281

The interannual variability of environmental factors on presettlement fish assemblages (PFAs) has been so far under investigated, especially in Madagascar. Numerous explanatory variables including local hydro-dynamic conditions recorded during the sampling night, characteristics of the benthic substrate and remotely sensed oceanic conditions (RSOC) were used to explain the spatio-temporal variability of PFAs in southwestern Madagascar. Gradient forest analyses were used to hierarchically classify the effect of these explanatory variables on the PFAs for two sites and during two different recruitment seasons. RSOC variables appeared to better explain the PFAs than the local variable and the characteristics of the benthic substrate. The PFAs caught in water masses with coastal characteristics were better explained than those with open water characteristics. This spatial variability is hypothesised to be linked to differences in feeding conditions among water masses. The gradient forest analyses also highlighted the complexity of predicting PFAs as the species for which abundances were better explained by RSOC variables varied between years. This interannual variability was mainly explained by the interannual variation of chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration, wind and surface current, with better prediction obtained during the year with high Chl a values associated with high averaged sea surface temperature. These findings suggest the importance of forecasting Chl a concentrations, taking into account the impact of tropical storms and climate variability in order to predict PFAs in the future. © 2020, Senckenberg Gesellschaft für Naturforschung.","DNA barcoding; Environmental conditions; Fish post-larvae; Gradient forest; Hierarchical classification; Structure","annual variation; assembly rule; biodiversity; biomonitoring; climate conditions; climate variation; environmental factor; fish; remote sensing; sea surface temperature; spatial variation; spatiotemporal analysis; storm; tropical environment; water mass; Madagascar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087382898

We show that the observed change in liquid and solid Arctic FW storage is likely already driven by the changing climate, based on ensemble simulations from a state-of-the-art climate model. Generally, the emergence of forced changes in Arctic FW fluxes occurs earlier for oceanic fluxes than for atmospheric or land fluxes. Nares Strait liquid FW flux is the first flux to show emergence outside the range of background variability, with this change potentially already occurring. Other FW fluxes have likely started to shift but have not yet emerged into a completely different regime.

The analysis of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) allows measuring the performance of a classification model using the confusion matrix. This study intends to investigate the sensitivity of AT and PS on the transmission rate of the novel coronavirus in different provinces of Iran. For this purpose, the information of each province of Iran including the annual average of AT and the number of healthy and diseased cases are categorized. Subsequently, the sensitivity and specificity analyses of both AT and PS factors are performed. The obtained results confirm that AT and PS have low sensibility and high sensitivity, respectively.

For this purpose, the carbon footprint has been evaluated using Life-Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) approach at different stages concrete structures’ life-cycle, which are production, construction, operation, and demolition stages, where the CO2 footprint of two residential buildings in Malaysia have been analysed as case studies. The findings indicated that the energy consumption, and the production phase in the life-cycle of a concrete structure are the main contributors of CO2 emission. In addition, detailed analysis of the carbon cycle in structures and their interaction with other components involved in the regional eco-system can lead to a significant reduction in CO2 emission, and thus to the improvement in reducing environmental deterioration and its consequences.

Collins, W., Department of Meteorology, University of Reading, Reading, United Kingdom","It is important to understand how future environmental policies will impact both climate change and air pollution. Although targeting near-term climate forcers (NTCFs), defined here as aerosols, tropospheric ozone, and precursor gases, should improve air quality, NTCF reductions will also impact climate. Prior assessments of the impact of NTCF mitigation on air quality and climate have been limited. This is related to the idealized nature of some prior studies, simplified treatment of aerosols and chemically reactive gases, as well as a lack of a sufficiently large number of models to quantify model diversity and robust responses. Here, we quantify the 2015-2055 climate and air quality effects of non-methane NTCFs using nine state-of-the-art chemistry-climate model simulations conducted for the Aerosol and Chemistry Model Intercomparison Project (AerChemMIP). Simulations are driven by two future scenarios featuring similar increases in greenhouse gases (GHGs) but with weak (SSP3-7.0) versus strong (SSP3-7.0-lowNTCF) levels of air quality control measures. As SSP3-7.0 lacks climate policy and has the highest levels of NTCFs, our results (e.g., surface warming) represent an upper bound. Unsurprisingly, we find significant improvements in air quality under NTCF mitigation (strong versus weak air quality controls). Surface fine particulate matter (PM2:5) and ozone (O3) decrease by 2:20:32 ugm3 and 4:60:88 ppb, respectively (changes quoted here are for the entire 2015-2055 time period; uncertainty represents the 95% confidence interval), over global land surfaces, with larger reductions in some regions including south and southeast Asia. Non-methane NTCF mitigation, however, leads to additional climate change due to the removal of aerosol which causes a net warming effect, including global mean surface temperature and precipitation increases of 0:250:12K and 0:030:012mmd1, respectively. Similarly, increases in extreme weather indices, including the hottest and wettest days, also occur. Regionally, the largest warming and wetting occurs over Asia, including central and north Asia (0:660:20K and 0:030:02mmd1), south Asia (0:470:16K and 0:170:09mmd1), and east Asia (0:460:20K and 0:150:06mmd1). Relatively large warming and wetting of the Arctic also occur at 0:590:36K and 0:040:02mmd1, respectively. Similar surface warming occurs in model simulations with aerosol-only mitigation, implying weak cooling due to ozone reductions. Our findings suggest that future policies that aggressively target non-methane NTCF reductions will improve air quality but will lead to additional surface warming, particularly in Asia and the Arctic. Policies that address other NTCFs including methane, as well as carbon dioxide emissions, must also be adopted to meet climate mitigation goals. © Author(s) 2020.

To apply the anaerobic digestion (AD) treatment to aquatic plants, the simultaneous achievement of high methane (CH4) recovery per biomass volume and high biodegradability have been a challenge owing to these characteristics. Herein, we propose a novel two-stage serial wet- and solid-state AD (SS-AD) system that quickly digests the labile cytoplasm fraction in the first wet AD reactor in a short retention time while slowly digesting the lignocellulosic fraction in the later SS-AD with long retention time. In this study, the effect of this serial AD on CH4 recovery and chemical oxygen demand (COD) balance from aquatic plant biomass was examined in a semi-continuous operation. Elodea nuttallii, which grows excessively in the southern basin of Lake Biwa, Japan, was used as the substrate. For comparison, single-stage AD with different hydraulic retention times (HRTs) (30 d and 15 d) was performed. The CH4 conversion efficiency in single-stage AD deteriorated from 47.6 to 33.1% COD with shortened HRT, probably owing to the low degradability of slowly degrading fraction (i.e. lignocellulose) in the short retention time. In contrast, the serial AD under the same HRT (15 d) as a single-stage AD exhibited higher CH4 conversion efficiency of 65.1% COD, mainly owing to the enhanced degradation of slowly degrading fraction because of the prolonged solid retention time (52.2 d) of the entire system. The CH4 recovery from the wet AD alone in the serial AD system surpassed that from the 30 d-HRT of the single-stage AD, possibly due to the appropriate HRT for labile fraction and/or the microbial recirculation. The serial wet and SS-AD was suggested as a suitable technology for the treatment of aquatic plant biomass with recalcitrant cell walls and a labile cytoplasm. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic plant biomass; COD mass balance; Microbes recirculation; Serial wet- and SS-AD; Single-stage wet AD; Submerged macrophytes","Biodegradability; Biomass; Cells; Cellulose; Chemical oxygen demand; Conversion efficiency; Cytology; Efficiency; Lignin; Methane; Recovery; Anaerobic digestion process; High moisture contents; Hydraulic retention time; Labile fractions; Lake Biwa , Japan; Semicontinuous operation; Simultaneous achievement; Solid retention time; Anaerobic digestion; lignocellulose; methane; methane; anaerobic digestion; aquatic plant; biodegradation; biomass; cellulose; chemical oxygen demand; lignin; methane; recovery; anaerobic digestion; analytical parameters; aquatic plant; aquatic plant biomass; Article; biomass; cell wall; chemical oxygen demand; chemical parameters; controlled study; cytoplasm; Elodea; Elodea nuttallii; intermethod comparison; Japan; material state; microorganism; nonhuman; plant; priority journal; retention time; solid state; technology; wet stage; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; Elodea nuttallii; Anaerobiosis; Biomass; Bioreactors; Japan; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084340197

Although the government has implemented various regulations and introduced strong enforcement to reduce toxic emissions and encourage recycling, little is known about how parents in China socialise their children into environmentally responsible individuals. This article reports on what 267 Chinese parents do, as agents of environmental protection, to raise their children's awareness of environmental issues, and how their environmental literacy affects these children's attitudes and behaviours. A survey was developed to measure how parents engage their children in environmental literacy, how confident parents feel in their own environmental awareness, and whether this has an effect on their engagement with children. The participants were found to play an agentive socialisation role in their engagement with children on pro-environmentalism in terms of shaping their behaviours and attitudes and developing their knowledge and skills. Furthermore, the correlational analysis results reveal that engagement in some aspects of environmental literacy is related to parents' socio-economic status (SES) and their age; namely, the lower the SES or age, the higher the engagement. The study serves as a baseline for parents' engagement with environmental literacy in China and has important implications for a concerted action by schools, the government, and environmental organisations to empower parents to be true agents of environmental literacy. © 2020 by the authors.","China; Environmental awareness; Environmental literacy; Parental engagement","baseline survey; environmental education; environmental protection; knowledge; literacy; pollution incidence; recycling; socioeconomic status; state role; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089845416

Urban planning must account for the diverse and changing interactions among the social, ecological, and technological systems (SETS) of a city. Cities struggle with long-range approaches to explore, anticipate, and plan for sustainability and resilience—and scenario development is one way to address this need. In this paper, we present the framework for developing what we call ‘strategic’ scenarios, which are scenarios or future visions created from governance documents expressing unrealized municipal priorities and goals. While scenario approaches vary based on diverse planning and decision-making objectives, only some offer tangible, systemic representations of existing plans and goals for the future that can be explored as an assessment and planning tool for sustainability and resilience. Indeed, the strategic scenarios approach presented here (1) emphasizes multi-sectoral and interdisciplinary interventions; (2) identifies systemic conflicts, tradeoffs, and synergies among existing planning goals; and (3) incorporates as yet unrealized goals and strategies representative of urban short-term planning initiatives. We present an example strategic scenario for the Central Arizona–Phoenix metropolitan region, and discuss the utility of the strategic scenario in long-term thinking for future sustainability and resilience in urban research and practice. This approach brings together diverse—sometimes competing—strategies and offers the opportunity to explore outcomes by comparing and contrasting their implications and tradeoffs, and evaluating the resulting strategic scenario against scenarios developed through alternative, participatory approaches. © 2020 The Authors","Content analysis; Future scenarios; Resilience; Social-ecological-technological systems strategies; Sustainability; Urban planning","adaptive management; decision making; environmental planning; future prospect; integrated approach; participatory approach; strategic approach; sustainability; trade-off; urban planning; Arizona; Phoenix; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083808806

Increasing temperatures reduced the carbon proportion of wood in some cases. Background and Objectives: Our goal was to estimate the structural carbon content of wood within hybrid white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) x engelmannii (Parry) grown in British Columbia, Canada, and compare the percent carbon content to wood properties and climate conditions of the region. Specific objectives included: (i) the determination of average incremental percent carbon, ring widths (RW), earlywood (EW) and latewood (LW) widths, cell wall thickness, and density over time; (ii) the determination of differences between percent carbon in individual forest stands and between regions; and (iii) the evaluation of the relationships between percent carbon and climate variation over time. Methods: Trees were sampled from twelve sites in northern British Columbia. Wood cores were analyzed with standard dendrochronology techniques and SilviScan analysis. Percent structural carbon was determined using acetone extraction and elemental analysis for 5 year increments. Individual chronologies of wood properties and percent carbon, and chronologies grouped by region were compared by difference of means. Temperature and precipitation values from the regions were compared to the carbon chronologies using correlation, regression, and visual interpretation. Results: Significant differences were found between the percent structural carbon of wood in individual natural and planted stands; none in regional aggregates. Some significant relationships were found between percent carbon, RW, EW, LW, and the cell wall thickness and density values. Percent carbon accumulation in planted stands and natural stands was found in some cases to correlate with increasing temperatures. Natural stand percent carbon values truncated to the last 30 years of growth was shown as more sensitive to climate variation compared to the entire time series. Conclusions: Differences between the stands in terms of structural carbon proportion vary by site-specific climate characteristics in areas of central interior British Columbia. Wood properties can be good indicators of variation in sequestered carbon in some stands. Carbon accumulation was reduced with increasing temperatures; however, warmer late-season conditions appear to enhance growth and carbon accumulation. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon; Carbon allocation; Climate; Forest growth; Hybrid white spruce; Natural and planted stands; Tree rings; Wood cell wall thickness; Wood density","Acetone; Forestry; Structural analysis; Wood; Acetone extraction; British Columbia , Canada; Carbon accumulation; Cell-wall thickness; Climate characteristics; Increasing temperatures; Structural carbon contents; Visual interpretation; Carbon; biomass allocation; cell; climate change; coniferous tree; dendrochronology; density; growth; hybrid; stand structure; tree ring; wood; Acetone; Canada; Carbon; Forestry; Structural Analysis; Wood; British Columbia; Canada; Picea engelmannii; Picea glauca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090423695

Literature stresses the necessity to link disaster risk reduction (DRR) and climate change adaptation (CCA) to make more efficient use of scarce resources and avoid overlapping efforts. However, integrating interventions for DRR and CCA remains a challenge because these two concepts originated from separate research-experts and are articulated by different sets of practitioners. Little study has yet investigated the challenges confronting integration and how best to overcome them in different contexts. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted in-depth interviews with 38 key stakeholders to explore the practices surrounding the integration of DRR and CCA in Bangladesh. As both approaches have similar aims to reduce vulnerabilities and increase resilience, the main arguments for linking DRR and CCA found were: to decrease overlapping of efforts and to improve the efficient use of scarce resources. Key challenges to the effective integration of DRR and CCA are found to be: inappropriate funding mechanisms, a lack of coordination and collaboration, a lack of implementation and mainstreaming, scale mismatches, poor governance, the socio-political-cultural structure, competing actors and institutions, lack of information, communication, knowledge sharing, and community involvement, and policy gaps. These challenges are underpinned by political economy, the nexus of influencing actors relevant to DRR and CCA. This study thus recommends that an in-depth political economy analysis of these challenges should be undertaken to identify reoriented institutional arrangements, and efficient governance frameworks to assist effective integration of DRR and CCA. © 2020","Bangladesh; Challenges and strategies; Climate change adaptation; Disaster risk reduction; Integration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081028635

These assumptions cover all of life as we know it, though more exotic entities can be envisioned, including organic forms with novel biochemistries, dynamic inorganic matter, and self-replicating machines. The probability that any particular form of life will be found on another planetary body depends on the nature and history of that alien world. So the biospheres would likely be very different on a rocky planet with an ice-covered global ocean, a barren planet devoid of surface liquid, a frigid world with abundant liquid hydrocarbons, on a rogue planet independent of a host star, on a tidally locked planet, on super-Earths, or in long-lived clouds in dense atmospheres. While life at least in microbial form is probably pervasive if rare throughout the Universe, and technologically advanced life is likely much rarer, the chance that an alternative form of life, though not intelligent life, could exist and be detected within our Solar System is a distinct possibility. © 2020 by the authors.

A critical part of improving the quality of life in urban areas is the reduction of urban heat island effect, especially in hot climate cities, and the reduction of adverse effects of winter in cold climates. Urban planning and landscape design strategies can have a great impact on urban microclimates, thereby providing relief from the harsh effects of climate change. Studies reveal that the cultivation of wetlands and open green spaces can have a direct impact on microclimate and comfort in densely populated areas. Erzurum is under the cold stress of the decreasing temperature in winter and continues to experience extreme temperatures in summer. This study is focused on the effects of urban design and landscape architectural interventions in the city of Erzurum. For this purpose, meteorological stations were placed in intensive construction areas of the urban city center, in wetland areas, and in the forested area of Ata Botanical Park in the city center. Three stations, dense green areas (1), temporary wetlands (2), and urban city center areas (3), were selected as urban area use types. Meteorological data were collected during March–April when the wetlands were full due to heavier periods of rain, and during July–August, the hottest months in the city. Thermal comfort values have been analyzed for different areas using RayMan soft model. The average value of Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) recorded in March–April was 3.5 °C in the city center, 2.8 °C in the dense green area, and − 0.3 °C around the temporary wetland area. In July and August, the average value of PET in the city center was 24.9 °C, 23.0 °C in dense green areas, and 21.2 °C around the wetland area. In cold cities, it was found that the water surfaces, which positively contribute to thermal comfort in summer, increased the cold stress in winter. It was determined that dense green areas function as balancing factors for thermal comfort of the city both for summer and winter seasons and they contributed positively in all conditions. As a result of this study, more accurate decisions can be made for future urban planning efforts by considering the effects of different environmental conditions on microclimates in the city, especially where this consideration can be applied to urban design and development, urban revitalization efforts, or when designing new settlements. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"cold region; greenspace; heat island; quality of life; urban design; urban planning; urban population; Erzurum [Erzurum (PRV)]; Erzurum [Turkey]; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086713573

As vehicles are a vital component of an urban setting, the risks of particulate pollution need to be assessed. An emission modelling is essential for that, and thus stochastic modelling approach involving Monte Carlo simulation technique was applied, aiming to reduce the uncertainty in emission modelling. The risks scenarios for the emissions were generated for 2019 (present state) and 2024 (future), integrating the probability of emissions and the associated AQI (Air Quality Index). Despite the vehicles being a minor source of PM in Dhaka (compared to the contribution from other sources), about one-third of the city is found under high risk due to the exhaust particulate pollution; having the potentiality to cover more than 60% of the city in the coming years, affecting the urban public health sustainability. However, the extent of implementation of planning and management strategies can revert the scenarios for the city, which can plausibly reduce the risk from 80% to 50%, or even to a no-risk state. © 2020 by the authors.","Probabilistic analysis; Urban public health; Vehicular particulate emissions","air quality; anthropogenic source; exhaust emission; Monte Carlo analysis; particulate matter; probability; public health; stochasticity; sustainability; urban area; urban population; Bangladesh; Dhaka [Bangladesh]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089891769

However, the increase in this ratio has become marginal. One of the main reasons for the stagnation is the alkalinity of the recycled sludge after treatment, as alkaline construction sludge can impact the environment owing to factors such as alkali leaching. Therefore, this study explored whether the neutralization of alkaline construction sludge can be accelerated with a controlled CO2 concentration during the production of recycled soils at recycling plants. A CO2 incubator was introduced in the laboratory to accelerate the neutralization of the alkaline sludge to investigate the effects of the initial water content and the layer thickness of the sludge on the neutralization process. The effects of the degree of CO2 concentration on the process were also examined, as were the contributions of other factors to the neutralization rate. First, the mixture conditions were explored to simulate alkaline construction sludge having a wide range of pH values (hydrogen-ion exponent) to investigate the effects of the initial pH on the neutralization rate. The results revealed that the neutralization rate of simulated alkaline sludge subjected to atmospheric curing was affected by the initial pH. Sludge with high alkalinity, such as a pH of 11 or 12, cannot fall below the upper limit of the pH regulated by the water pollution prevention act even after a dozen days. Consequently, sample surveys were conducted to capture the variation in the pH of actual construction sludge at several intermediate treatment facilities. The sample surveys showed that the pH of the sludge samples, which were in an either solid or semi-solid state, fell in the range of 6.9–13.0, with the samples having a pH of around 11 being dominant. Therefore, CO2 curing using a CO2 incubator was implemented in the laboratory on alkaline sludge that simulated the characteristics observed in the sample surveys. The laboratory test results revealed that, at a constant sludge height, a higher CO2 concentration increased the neutralization rate of the alkaline sludge. However, the contribution of the CO2 concentration to the acceleration of the neutralization decreased with a reduction in the initial water content. The test results also suggested that the contribution of the initial water content to the acceleration of the neutralization was more dominant than that of the sludge height for the present experimental conditions. © 2020","Alkaline construction sludge; CO2 incubator; Neutralization; pH","Accident prevention; Carbon dioxide; Curing; pH; Recycling; Surveys; Water pollution; CO2 concentration; Construction sludge; Experimental conditions; Fundamental studies; Initial water contents; Neutralization process; Neutralization rate; Pollution prevention; Alkalinity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089442617

This study organizes these interstitial spaces according to programme, zoning, access, spatial definition, microclimatic characteristics and material use. It undertakes a quantitative assessment identifying seven specific interstitial space types, found in the total study area.

Results suggest that the interaction term between air pollution and density is negatively related to new industries entry. It means that air pollution can reduce the effect of relatedness on industrial diversification and lead to path breaking. Further, a channel for how air pollution affects industrial dynamics is examined.

As one of the most important parts for the development of the GBA, the transportation sector has become a nonnegligible consumer of energy and source of emission. Therefore, vehicle energy consumption and related emissions in the GBA must be evaluated. However, an effective framework for accurately estimating the real-time transportation performance, vehicle energy consumption and emission in large urban areas is still lacking. This study aims to develop a novel method for examining the regional integration and the spatial connection that affect vehicle emission via crowdsourced traffic data and an emission model. The novelty of this study is that it explores the acquisition of large-scale and real-time data as well as the calculation of corresponding energy consumption and environmental impact. Based on the analysis of transportation in GBA, it is found that the vehicle energy consumption and emission on the expressway are nearly half as that on the other urban roads. Moreover, a significant difference exists in vehicle energy consumption and emission between passenger cars and medium-duty trucks. Regarding transportation performance, vehicle energy consumption and emissions, they are closely related to departure time. It is also found that most of the adjacent cities tend to have high vehicle energy consumption and emission. The contribution of the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macao Bridge to transportation from Hong Kong, Macao and Zhuhai is different. Hong Kong benefits most from the bridge in terms of traffic energy efficiency.

The upper model selects the construction effectiveness and carbon emissions of dry ports as the objective function of the model. The lower model selects the total cost of the owner's transportation as the objective function. The model is solved by genetic algorithm, and a case study is performed in the southwestern region of China. The research results show that the construction of dry ports can effectively concentrate inland cargo sources, reduce the carbon emissions of the transportation network, which has good economic and social benefits. After considering the construction utility function, the results of the dry port location will be more inclined cities with better economic and transportation indicators.

In this study, to simulate salinization and desalinization, sediments from Erhai Lake (salinity 0.3–0.8 g/L) and Chaka Lake (salinity 299.3–350.7 g/L) on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau were transplanted into different lakes with a range of salinity of 0.3–299.3 g/L, followed by in situ incubation for 50 days and subsequent geochemical and microbial analyses. Desalinization was faster than salinization in the transplanted sediments. The salinity of the transplanted sediment increased and decreased in the salinization and desalinization simulation experiments, respectively. The TOC contents of the transplanted sediments were lower than that of their undisturbed counterparts in the salinization experiments, whereas they had a strong negative linear relationship with salinity in the desalinization experiments. Microbial diversity decreased in response to salinization and desalinization, and microbial community dissimilarity significantly (P &lt; 0.01) increased with salinity differences between the transplanted sediments and their undisturbed counterparts. Microbial groups belonging to Gammaproteobacteria and Actinobacteria became abundant in salinization whereas Bacteroidetes and Chloroflexi became dominant in desalinization. Among the predicted microbial functions, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, methanogenesis through CO2 reduction with H2, nitrate/nitrogen respiration, and nitrification increased in salinization; in desalinization, enhancement was observed for respiration of sulfur compounds, sulfate respiration, sulfur respiration, thiosulfate respiration, hydrocarbon degradation, chemoheterotrophy, and fermentation, whereas depressing was found for aerobic ammonia oxidation, nitrate/nitrogen respiration, nitrification, nitrite respiration, manganese oxidation, aerobic chemoheterotrophy, and phototrophy. Such microbial variations could be explained by changes of transplantation, salinity, and covarying variables. In summary, salinization and desalinization had profound influence on the geochemistry, microbial community, and function in lakes. © Copyright © 2020 Huang, Yang, Jiang, Wu, Liu, Wang, Xiao and Han.","desalinization; lake sediments; microbial community; salinity; salinization","ammonia; manganese; nitrate; nitrite; RNA 16S; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; Betaproteobacteria; Chloroflexi; climate change; community structure; desalination; Euryarchaeota; fermentation; Firmicutes; Gammaproteobacteria; Methanobacteriales; methanogenesis; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbial response; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; pyrosequencing; salinization; sediment; simulation; Tibet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089852897

Especially in the north of China, decentralized wind power (DWP) has developed rapidly. However, wind curtailment exceeds 4% of the gross generation, which has become an important obstacle restricting the development of DWP in 2019. Technical schemes are effective solutions to promote decentralized wind power consumption (DWPC). Moreover, there are few economic analyses of DWP projects with key technologies. This paper summarizes the typical technical schemes and analyzes the economy of a DWP grid-connected project with typical technical schemes by combining methods of the net present value (NPV) and real options (RO). It appears that the DWP project can be profitable with an NPV of about CNY 4.3721 million and an option value of CNY 16.6022 million in the case of a feed-in tariff of 0.34 CNY/kWh. Feed-in tariff and equipment investment costs are the most relevant parameters for economic feasibility according to the sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, 30.73 million kWh connects to the Mengxi grid each year. The project has an annual maximum CO2 emission reduction of about 31 thousand tons and an SO2 of about 0.1 thousand tons. In addition, it also realizes fine social benefits, including the support of local residents and the improvement of local new urbanization levels. Finally, this paper puts forward policy suggestions for the development of DWP mainly from an economic point of view. © 2020 by the authors.

The improvement of active aeration for the CH4 oxidation efficiency of biochar-amended landfill soil cover was investigated over a period of 101 days. There were column 1 as the control group, column 2 with biochar amending the soil cover, and column 3 with daily active aeration besides the same biochar amendment. All groups were inoculated with enriched methane oxidation bacteria (MOB). The average CH4 removal efficiency was up to 78.6%, 85.2% and 90.6% for column 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The depth profiles of CH4 oxidation efficiencies over the whole period also showed that the stimulation of CH4 oxidation by biochar amendment was apparent in the top 35 cm but became very faint after two months. This probably was due to the rapid depletion of nitrogen nutrition caused by enhanced methanotrophic activities. While through aeration, CH4 oxidation efficiency was further improved for column 3 than column 2. This enhancement also lasted for the whole period with a reduced decline of CH4 oxidation. Finally, the major MOB Methylocystis, commonly found in the three columns, were most abundant in the top 35 cm for column 3. A more balanced ratio of MOB and more homogeneous microbial community structures across different soil depths were also the results of active aeration. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Aeration; Biochar; Landfill soil cover; Methane; MOB","Efficiency; Land fill; Methane; Oxidation; Water aeration; Bio chars; Biochar amendments; Different soils; Enriched methanes; Microbial community structures; Nitrogen nutrition; Removal efficiencies; Soil cover; Soils; biochar; charcoal; methane; unclassified drug; biochar; charcoal; aeration; bacterium; biochar; landfill; methane; soil amendment; soil cover; aeration; Article; calculation; concentration (parameter); landfill; methanotrophic bacterium; Methylocystaceae; Methylocystis; microbial community; nonhuman; oxidation; waste component removal; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; soil; waste disposal; waste disposal facility; Methylocystis; Charcoal; Methane; Oxidation-Reduction; Refuse Disposal; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Waste Disposal Facilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082423314

We are particularly interested in how the spatial characteristics impact emission levels. To this end we estimate a CO2 emission model taking the airport characteristics into account, and apply a spatial classification and autocorrelation model to distinguish between different types of airports and systems. Our analysis shows that: (1) there are strong spatial distribution differences between airports due to the patterns of economic development, airport size and aircraft used; (2) most airports have a high reduction potential of CO2 emission, without a loss of economic performance; (3) significant spatial aggregation effects exist and are persistent during most observational years, which indicates a strong Matthew effect of CO2 emission within Jiangsu province; and (4) airport size, linkage to the local economy, and airport location are closely related to aircraft CO2 emissions.

An adaptive greenhouse with thermochromic (TC) material has the potential to intelligently regulate solar radiation gain of the greenhouse in response to the outdoor environment, therefore abating energy demand of the greenhouse. This study evaluates the energy performance of an adaptive greenhouse with covering materials (TC glazing, TC film, TC film-TC glazing). The simulation results reveal that compared with normal glass, energy savings reaches up to 5%, 6%, and 13% with the application of TC glazing, TC film, and TC film-TC glazing to the greenhouse, respectively; the energy cost is correspondingly reduced by 7%, 17%, and 22% respectively; and the CO2 emission is reduced by 6%, 14%, and 20%, respectively. In comparison with low-emissivity glass, the total energy saving of the greenhouse reaches up to 3%, 3%, and 11% by employing TC glazing, TC film, and TC film-TC glazing, respectively. Moreover, the increase in envelope thickness increases energy efficiency of the adaptive greenhouse to 17%. TC film-TC glazing is recommended for use in heating energy-dominated scenarios.

However, the presence of a surfactant shell on the catalyst is detrimental, as the resulting performance of the electrocatalyst depends crucially on the ability of reactants to access active surface sites. Techniques for postsynthesis deprotection are therefore mandatory for removing the capping agents from the otherwise blocked reactions sites without compromising the structural integrity of the nanocatalysts. Herein, we present silver nanowires (Ag-NWs)-produced via PVP-assisted polyol synthesis (PVP, polyvinylpyrrolidone)-as effective catalysts for the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (ec-CO2RR), which reach Faradaic efficiencies close to 100% for CO formation after deprotection by a so-called ""electrochemical looping""(ec-l) pretreatment. Electrochemical looping refers to a sequence of potentiostatic CO2 electrolysis experiments that exhibit well-defined starting (Estart), vertex (Evertex), and end (Eend) potentials. The resulting product distribution undergoes a profound hysteresis in the forward and corresponding backward run of the electrochemical looping experiment, thus pointing to an effective deprotection of the catalyst as made evident by postelectrolysis XPS inspection. These results can be considered as a prime example demonstrating the importance of the catalyst's ""history""for the resulting ec-CO2RR performance. These transient (non-steady-state) effects are crucial in particular for the initial stage of the CO2 electrolysis reaction and for catalyst screening approaches carried out on the time scale of hours.

However, these benefits have been achieved at a massive cost to welfare and the economy. This commentary draws lessons from the COVID-19 crisis for climate change. It discusses whether there are more sustainable ways of achieving these benefits, as part of a more desirable, low carbon resilient future, in a more planned, inclusive and less disruptive way. In order to achieve this, we argue for a clearer social contract between citizens and the state. We discuss how COVID-19 has demonstrated that behaviours can change abruptly, that these changes come at a cost, that we need a ‘social mandate’ to ensure these changes remain in the long-term, and that science plays an important role in informing this process. We suggest that deliberative engagement mechanisms, such as citizens’ assemblies and juries, could be a powerful way to build a social mandate for climate action post-COVID-19. This would enable behaviour changes to become more accepted, embedded and bearable in the long-term and provide the basis for future climate action. © 2020, The Author(s).","Behaviour change; Climate change; COVID-19; Deliberative governance; Social mandate","Air cleaners; Sustainable development; Behaviour changes; Future climate; Global emissions; Low carbon; Side effect; Social contract; Climate change; action plan; climate change; economic conditions; nature-society relations; virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087703606

As the only direct connection between all three major oceans since the opening of the Southern Ocean gateways, the development of the Southern Ocean and its relationship with the Antarctic cryosphere has influenced the climate of the entire planet. Although the depths of the ocean floor have been recognized as an important factor in climate and paleoclimate models, appropriate paleobathymetric models including a detailed analysis of the sediment cover are not available. Here we utilize more than 40 years of seismic reflection data acquisition along the margins of Antarctica and its conjugate margins, along with multiple drilling campaigns by the International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) and its predecessor programs. We combine and update the seismic stratigraphy across the regions of the Southern Ocean and calculate ocean-wide paleobathymetry grids via a backstripping method. We present a suite of high-resolution paleobathymetric grids from the Eocene-Oligocene Boundary to modern times. The grids reveal the development of the Southern Ocean from isolated basins to an interconnected ocean affected by the onset and vigor of an Antarctic Circumpolar Current, as well as the glacial sedimentation and erosion of the Antarctic continent. The ocean-wide comparison through time exposes patterns of ice sheet development such as switching of glacial outlets and the change from wet-based to dry-based ice sheets. Ocean currents and bottom-water production interact with the sedimentation along the continental shelf and slope and profit from the opening of the ocean gateways. ©2020.

We applied a time-stratified analysis to compare it with mortality between 2001 and 2014 and between 2011 and 2014, to estimate the elevated risk of a 2050 heat event. We included change in daytime versus nighttime and urban versus rural temperatures as factors to project mortality, to evaluate the potential influence of climate change on mortality risk. Increases of 2.9 °C and 2.6 °C in maximum and minimum air temperature are projected in a 2050 heat event, with a day and a night that will have respective temperatures 9.8 °C and 4.9 °C higher than 2001–2014. Significantly higher mortality risk is forecasted in 2050 compared to 2001–2014 (IRR 1.721 [1.650, 1.796]) and 2011–2014 (IRR 1.622 [1.547, 1.701]) without consideration of temperature change. After consideration of changing temperature, change in maximum temperature in rural areas will induce the highest mortality risk during 2050, possibly due to rapid urbanization across the city, and with the second highest mortality risk induced by the change in minimum temperature in urbanized areas, possibly because local people in the city have been adapted to the maximum level of urban thermal stress during a summer day.

Since the 1980s, the sea surface temperature (SST) of the Sea of Japan has increased significantly. The mechanisms behind these changes in migratory fish assemblages are difficult to determine from general capture fishery databases. This study collected a long-term dataset of set-net catches reported from Toyama Bay in western Japan to analyse catch compositions. The results indicated that in the coastal zone at the front of the Tsushima warm current and Liman cold current, increased SSTs have caused fluctuations both in the presence of cold-water and warm-water fish and in the timing of fishing seasons. Additionally, the results based on multi-dimensional scaling and cluster analyses showed that the study period can be divided into 5 clusters: (1) 1963–1964, (2) 1966–1972, (3) 1973–1998, (4) 1999–2006, and (5) 2007–2013; the similarity value was 89%. The boundaries between these clusters were similar to the timing of changes in SST, Pacific decadal oscillation, and North Pacific gyre oscillation. A species composition change analysis of these clusters showed that clustering was associated with changes in the intensities of the Tsushima warm current and Liman cold current. A northward expansion of low-latitude fish species, especially small- and medium-sized fish, was observed in Toyama Bay, similar to the expansion of high-latitude fish species into polar regions. Based on the principles of risk management and these research results, the adaptation strategies recommended in this study were differentiated into two categories: proactive adaptation and planned adaptation. (1) Establishment of pre-disaster adaptation capability: Proactive adaptation emphasizes countering the uncertainty in marine fishery production and improving the resilience of local communities. (2) Establishment of resilience during and after climate disasters: Planned adaptation can be used to manage uncertainty in the seafood supply by implementing adjustments in production and marketing and also to mitigate the impact of climate variation on the marine fishery industry and local coastal communities. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Fish species composition; Global change; Liman cold current (LC); Sea of Japan; Sea surface temperature (SST); Set-net; Small- and medium-sized fish; Toyama Bay; Tsushima warm current (TWC)","adaptive management; assessment method; coastal zone; fish; fishery; fishing industry; global change; gyre; migratory species; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; strategic approach; Chubu; Honshu; Japan; Pacific Ocean; Sea of Japan; Toyama Bay; Toyama [Chubu]; Tsushima Current",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087944593

Waves are the primary driver of coastal evolution, and much of the interannual variability of the wave conditions in the Northeast Atlantic can be explained by broadscale patterns in atmospheric circulation. Two of the dominant climate indices that capture the wave climate in western Europe's coastal regions are the 'Western Europe Pressure Anomaly' (WEPA) and 'North Atlantic Oscillation' (NAO). This study utilises a shoreline prediction model (ShoreFor) which is forced by synthetic waves to investigate whether forecasts can be improved when the synthetic wave generation algorithm is informed by relevant climate indices. The climate index-informed predictions were tested against a baseline case where no climate indices were considered over eight winter periods at Perranporth, UK. A simple adaption to the synthetic wave-generating process has allowed for monthly climate index values to be considered before producing the 103 random waves used to force the model. The results show that improved seasonal predictions of shoreline change are possible if climate indices are known a priori. For NAO, modest gains were made over the uninformed ShoreFor model, with a reduction in average root mean square error (RMSE) of 7% but an unchanged skill score. For WEPA, the gains were more significant, with the average RMSE 12% lower and skill score 5% higher. Highlighted is the importance of selecting an appropriate index for the site location. This work suggests that better forecasts of shoreline change could be gained from consideration of a priori knowledge of climatic indices in the generation of synthetic waves. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate; Coastal; Erosion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090398092

Climate warming will stimulate the decomposition of organic matter, resulting in an increase in soil nutrient availability. However, it remains unclear how soil microorganisms in N-limited soils will respond, as the direct effect of inorganic N addition is often shown to inhibit microbial activity, while elevated N availability may have a positive effect on microorganisms indirectly, due to a stimulation of plant productivity. Here we used soils from a long-term fertilization experiment in the Subarctic (28 years at the time of sampling) to investigate the net effects of chronic N-fertilization (100 kg N ha−1 y−1, added together with 26 kg P and 90 kg K ha−1 y−1, as expected secondary limiting nutrients for plants) on microbial growth, soil C and N mineralization, microbial biomass, and community structure. Despite high levels of long-term fertilization, which significantly increased primary production, we observed relatively minor effects on soil microbial activity. Bacterial growth exhibited the most pronounced response to long-term fertilization, with higher rates of growth in fertilized soils, whereas fungal growth remained unaffected. Rates of basal soil C and N mineralization were only marginally higher in fertilized soils, whereas fertilization had no significant effect on microbial biomass or microbial community structure. Overall, these findings suggest that microbial responses to long-term fertilization in these subarctic tundra soils were driven by an increased flow of labile plant-derived C due to stimulated plant productivity, rather than by direct fertilization effects on the microbial community or changes in soil physiochemistry. © 2019, The Author(s).","bacterial and fungal growth; biogeochemistry; decomposition; microbial ecology; nitrogen cycling; nutrient fertilization; plant–soil interactions; soil respiration; Subarctic tundra","community structure; microbial activity; microbial community; nutrient availability; soil microorganism; soil nutrient; soil organic matter; soil-vegetation interaction; subarctic region; Arctic; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075242960

Nitrification inhibitors (NIs) are known for their potential to mitigate N2O. Therefore, we tested the effect of NIs added to cattle slurry before INJ on N2O fluxes from a Haplic Luvisol under silage maize in southwest Germany. We determined N2O fluxes at least weekly, with the closed chamber method over two full years. NIs differ in their chemical and physical behavior and we therefore tested a range of commercially available NIs: 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate, 3,4-dimethylpyrazol succinic acid, a mixture of both, nitrapyrin, dicyandiamide, and 1,2,4 triazol and 3-methylpyrazol. Although not significant, INJ treatments with NI showed lower mean annual N2O emissions than the INJ treatment without NI in the 1st year. The emission reduction by NI of 46% in the 2nd year was statistically significant. In both years, we did not find any difference in N2O release, crop yield, or nitrogen removal between the different NI treatments. In the 1st year, which was extraordinary dry and warm, emission factors (EFs) for all INJ treatments were 4 to 8-fold higher than default EF from the IPCC. Even in the 2nd year, only three NI treatments reached EFs within the range provided by the IPCC. Direct N2O accounted for between 81 and 91% of the total GHG emission. Area- and yield-related GHG emission of the broadcast application with subsequent incorporation was in both years in the statistical class with lowest emission. In contrast, INJ with NIs showed similar GHG emissions in only one year, and consequently, incorporation was found to be the optimum management practice for livestock farmers in our study region. © 2020 by the authors.

In natural open systems, evaporation should be considered as a time dependent function and a cumulative process. We applied and compared Craig-Gordon isotopic model with the Penman-Monteith physical evaporation model, after a biannual hydrologic cycle characterization in a natural semi-arid environment to determine annually reliable balance budgets and estimations. Our results show that isotopic evaporation rates reflect a sinusoidal behavior during isotopic fractioning rather than a lineal and constant evaporation rate. This sinusoidal behavior exhibits the influence of solar radiation and other meteorological variables that have not yet been considered in the C-G isotopic mass balance model. The estimation of isotopic evaporation in natural environments are reliable during the dry season while estimations of isotopic loss fraction (f) in the wet season behave as an isotopic mixing model of evaporated water-precipitation-runoff. Physical and isotopic methodologies are difficult to relate due to basic fundamentals and development conceptualizations: accordingly, further work is required to enhance the Craig-Gordon and Gonfiantini evaporation model and its relationship with physical methodologies in order to improve the estimation of evaporation in natural semiarid environments. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Craig-gordon model; Evaporation; Penman-monteith equation; Semi-arid areas; δ2H-δ18O stable isotopes","Budget control; Hydrology; Isotopes; Evaporation estimation; Isotopic mass balance model; Meteorological variables; Natural environments; Physical evaporation; Semi-arid environments; Terrestrial environments; Time-dependent functions; Evaporation; conceptual framework; estimation method; evaporation; hydrological cycle; hydrological modeling; runoff; semiarid region; solar radiation; terrestrial environment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083038416

This study proposes a fractional programming model to evaluate Chinese provincial carbon intensity reduction potential based on data envelopment analysis theory, which is superior to the common directional distance function approach in identifying global optimal solutions and improving the robustness of the estimation. To avoid the biased estimation, a meta-frontier is constructed according to the convergence of provincial carbon intensity, and then the overall potential is decomposed from the perspective of ineffective management, spatial technological gap and intertemporal technological gap. The results show that the carbon intensity of 30 Chinese provinces cannot converge to a common equilibrium and that 5 clubs that converge to different equilibria are clustered. Moreover, different clubs have diversified potentials for carbon intensity reduction, and spatial technological gaps contribute the most potential for clubs 3, 4 and 5. Even worse, the spatial technological gaps have not been significantly narrowed over time. This study provides not only a theoretical tool to investigate carbon intensity reduction potentials but also empirical evidence to guide China's carbon intensity reduction. © 2020","Carbon intensity reduction potential; Club convergence; DEA; Fractional programming","Climate change; Data envelopment analysis; Mathematical programming; Biased estimation; Carbon intensity; Carbon intensity reductions; Directional distance function; Fractional programming; Global climate changes; Global optimal solutions; Non-parametric; Carbon; carbon emission; climate change; data envelopment analysis; emission control; Article; carbon dynamics; chemical analysis; China; climate change; environmental decision making; environmental factor; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; geography; mathematical computing; mathematical model; priority journal; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084481310

In the future there are likely to be further demands for port capacity which will require additional port area while existing ports will need upgrading in response to sea-level rise to maintain current levels of operability. This analysis considers potential changes to 2050 under four climate-based scenarios which aim to explore changes in international maritime trade consistent with global temperature increases of 2 °C and 4 °C and the implications of associated sea-level rise. All scenarios anticipate a significant increase in trade, and a change in distribution across commodities. The demand for port handling areas in 2050 is roughly double to quadruple that of the baseline (2010) across scenarios. The maximum demand occurs under an unmitigated climate and high intensity in commodity movement with a maximum area in 2050 of 5,054km2. The minimum demand (2,510km2) occurs under a scenario of regionalized green energy production and lower material intensity. The total global investment costs for port adaptation to sea-level rise and provision of new areas are between 223 and 768 billion USD to 2050. These are dominated by the need for new area construction with the adaptation of base year areas to relative sea-level rise representing a maximum of 6% of total costs globally. Therefore, in addition to adapting existing port areas to sea-level rise, it is equally or more important to consider provision of new ports. ©2020 The Authors.","Climate change; Ports; Sea-level rise; Trade scenarios","cost analysis; demand analysis; environmental policy; investment; maritime trade; port; sea level change; trade-environment relations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089836251

Here, we show that the UN climate targets may be optimal even in the Dynamic Integrated Climate–Economy (DICE) integrated assessment model, when appropriately updated. Changes to DICE include more accurate calibration of the carbon cycle and energy balance model, and updated climate damage estimates. To determine economically ‘optimal’ climate policy paths, we use the range of expert views on the ethics of intergenerational welfare. When updates from climate science and economics are considered jointly, we find that around three-quarters (or one-third) of expert views on intergenerational welfare translate into economically optimal climate policy paths that are consistent with the 2 °C (or 1.5 °C) target. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon cycle; climate change; environmental economics; environmental policy; global warming; United Nations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087809178

In recent years, many empirical studies on the importance of functional traits for ecosystem service provisioning have been undertaken, but a general understanding and synthesis of results is lacking for many ecosystems. Here we focus on temperate grasslands and present a systematic literature review synthesizing how plant functional traits are interrelated with ecosystem services. Based on 108 studies, we identified a core set of 40 functional traits and 11 ecosystem services. Several of these traits were only linked to one, while 75% of traits were linked to two or more ecosystem services. We found that trait-specific constraints can lead to both synergies and trade-offs in the supply of multiple ecosystem services. For instance, synergies between biomass production and climate regulation can be achieved by changing morphometric root traits such as increasing root diameter, tissue density or shoot to root ratio. On the other hand, supporting fast-growing exploitative species characterized by high specific leaf area and nitrogen content typically leads to trade-offs between fodder quality and water purification. Synthesis and applications. By applying network analysis, we found five groups of ecosystem services sharing common functional traits. Within and among these groups, we identified trade-offs among traits as well as among services and found options for synergies. These can be particularly useful in landscape planning, and when management aims focus on maintaining multifunctionality of ecosystems and maximizing corresponding ecosystem service delivery. © 2020 The Authors.

Thus, NH3 emission from agricultural activities in China considerably affects the country's regional air quality and visibility. In this study, a high-resolution agricultural NH3 emission inventory compiled on 1 km1 km horizontal resolution was applied to calculate the NH3 mass burden in China and reliably estimate the influence of NH3 on agriculture. The key parameter emission factors of this inventory were enhanced by considering many experiment results, and the dynamic data of spatial and temporal information were updated using statistical data of 2015. In addition to fertilizers and husbandry, farmland ecosystems, livestock waste, crop residue burning, wood-based fuel combustion, and other NH3 emission sources were included in this inventory. Furthermore, a source apportionment tool, namely, the Integrated Source Apportionment Method (ISAM) coupled with the air quality modeling system Regional Atmospheric Modeling System and Community Multiscale Air Quality, was applied to capture the contribution of NH3 emitted from total agriculture (Tagr) in China. The aerosol mass concentration in 2015 was simulated, and results showed that the high mass concentration of NH3 exceeded 10 ìgm..3 and mainly appeared in the North China Plain, Central China, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Sichuan Basin. Moreover, the annual average contribution of Tagr NH3 to PM2.5 mass burden was 14 %-22% in China. Specific to the PM2.5 components, Tagr NH3 contributed dominantly to ammonium formation (87.6 %) but trivially to sulfate formation (2.2 %). In addition, several brute-force sensitivity tests were conducted to estimate the impact of Tagr NH3 emission reduction on PM2.5 mass burden. In contrast to the result of ISAM, even though the Tagr NH3 only provided 10.1% contribution to nitrate under the current emission scenario, the reduction of nitrate could reach 95.8% upon removal of the Tagr NH3 emission. This deviation occurred because the contribution of NH3 to nitrate should be small under a ""rich NH3""environment and large under a ""poor NH3""environment. Thus, the influence of NH3 on nitrate formation would be enhanced with the decrease in ambient NH3 mass concentration. © 2020 Author(s).",,"agricultural emission; air quality; concentration (composition); emission inventory; numerical model; particulate matter; source apportionment; spatial resolution; China; North China Plain; Sichuan Basin; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094946373

Specifically, promoters and their regulators involved in diverse carbon source utilization were characterized using mCherryOpt or beta-galactosidase as a reporter. Consequently, most of the genetic circuits tested in this study were functional in Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 in the presence of an inducer, leading to the expression of reporter proteins. These genetic sensor-regulators were found to be transferable to another Clostridium species, such as Clostridium beijerinckii NCIMB 8052. The gradual expression of reporter protein was observed as a function of the carbohydrates of interest. A xylose-inducible promoter allows a titratable and robust expression of a reporter protein with stringency and efficacy.

Hence, a nonlinear joint analytical inversion (Gauss Newton method) of both volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxide (NOx ) emissions is made by exploiting the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Nadir Mapper (OMPS-NM) formaldehyde (HCHO) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns during the Korea United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) campaign over East Asia in May June 2016. Effects of the chemical feedback of NOx and VOCs on both NO2 and HCHO are implicitly included by iteratively optimizing the inversion. Emission uncertainties are greatly narrowed (averaging kernels >0:8, which is the mathematical presentation of the partition of information gained from the satellite observations with respect to the prior knowledge) over mediumto high-emitting areas such as cities and dense vegetation. The prior amount of total NOx emissions is mainly dictated by values reported in the MIX-Asia 2010 inventory. After the inversion we conclude that there is a decline in emissions (before, after, change) for China (87:94 44:09 Gg d1, 68:0015:94 Gg d1, 23 %), North China Plain (NCP) (27:9613:49 Gg d1, 19:052:50 Gg d1, 32 %), Pearl River Delta (PRD) (4:231:78 Gg d1, 2:70 0:32 Gg d1, 36 %), Yangtze River Delta (YRD) (9:84 4:68 Gg d1, 5:770:51 Gg d1, 41 %), Taiwan (1:26 0:57 Gg d1, 0:970:33 Gg d1, 23 %), and Malaysia (2:892:77 Gg d1, 2:251:34 Gg d1, 22 %), all of which have effectively implemented various stringent regulations. In contrast, South Korea (2:711:34 Gg d1, 2:95 0:58 Gg d1, C9 %) and Japan (3:531:71 Gg d1, 3:96 1:04 Gg d1, C12 %) are experiencing an increase in NOx emissions, potentially due to an increased number of diesel vehicles and new thermal power plants. We revisit the welldocumented positive bias (by a factor of 2 to 3) of MEGAN v2.1 (Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Na-ture) in terms of biogenic VOC emissions in the tropics. The inversion, however, suggests a larger growth of VOCs (mainly anthropogenic) over NCP (25 %) than previously reported (6 %) relative to 2010. The spatial variation in both the magnitude and sign of NOx and VOC emissions results in nonlinear responses of ozone production and loss. Due to a simultaneous decrease and increase in NOx=VOC over NCP and YRD, we observe a 53% reduction in the ratio of the chemical loss of NOx (LNOx ) to the chemical loss of ROx (RO2 CHO2) over the surface transitioning toward NOx -sensitive regimes, which in turn reduces and increases the afternoon chemical loss and production of ozone through NO2 COH (0:42 ppbv h1)=HO2 (and RO2)CNO (C0:31 ppbv h1). Conversely, a combined decrease in NOx and VOC emissions in Taiwan, Malaysia, and southern China suppresses the formation of ozone. Simulations using the updated emissions indicate increases in maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) surface ozone over China (0.62 ppbv), NCP (4.56 ppbv), and YRD (5.25 ppbv), suggesting that emission control strategies on VOCs should be prioritized to curb ozone production rates in these regions. Taiwan, Malaysia, and PRD stand out as regions undergoing lower MDA8 ozone levels resulting from the NOx reductions occurring predominantly in NOx -sensitive regimes. © Author(s) 2020.

The fertilizer production process emits N2O, CO2, and CH4, and fertilized croplands emit N2O. We present continuous airborne observations of these trace gases in the Lower Mississippi River Basin to quantify emissions from both fertilizer plants and croplands during the early growing season. Observed hourly emission rates from two fertilizer plants are compared with reported inventory values, showing agreement for N2O and CO2 emissions but large underestimation in reported CH4 emissions by up to a factor of 100. These CH4 emissions are consistent with loss rates of 0.6–1.2%. We quantify regional emission fluxes (100 km) of N2O using the airborne mass balance technique, a first application for N2O, and explore linkages to controlling processes. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to use airborne measurements to distinguish N2O emission differences between neighboring fields, determining we can distinguish different emission behaviors of regions on the order of 2.5 km2 with emissions differences of approximately 0.026 μmol m−2 s−1. This suggests airborne approaches such as outlined here could be used to evaluate the impact of different agricultural practices at critical field-size spatial scales. © 2020.

According to these rules, the average FL emissions of each member state in 2021-2025 (compliance period 1, CP1) and in 2026-2030 (compliance period 2, CP2) will be compared to a projected forest reference level (FRL). The FRL is estimated by modelling forest development under fixed forest management practices, based on those observed in 2000-2009. In this context, the objective of this study was to estimate the effects of large-scale uptake of alternative forest management models (aFMMs), developed in the ALTERFOR project (Alternative models and robust decision-making for future forest management), on forest harvest and forest carbon sink, considering that the proposed aFMMs are expanded to most of the suitable areas in EU27+UK and Turkey. Methods: We applied the Global Forest Model (G4M) for projecting the harvest and sink with the aFMMs and compared our results to previous FRL projections. The simulations were performed under the condition that the countries should match the harvest levels estimated for their FRLs as closely as possible. A representation of such aFMMs as clearcut, selective logging, shelterwood logging and tree species change was included in G4M. The aFMMs were modeled under four scenarios of spatial allocation and two scenarios of uptake rate. Finally, we compared our results to the business as usual. Results: The introduction of the aFMMs enhanced the forest sink in CP1 and CP2 in all studied regions when compared to the business as usual. Conclusions: Our results suggest that if a balanced mixture of aFMMs is chosen, a similar level of wood harvest can be maintained as in the FRL projection, while at the same time enhancing the forest sink. In particular, a mixture of multifunctional aFMMs, like selective logging and shelterwood, could enhance the carbon sink by up to 21% over the ALTERFOR region while limiting harvest leakages. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon sink; Forest harvest; Forest management models; Forest reference level; Multifunctional forests; Production forests; Set-aside forests","Carbon; Decision making; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Harvesting; Mixtures; Business-as-usual; Forest carbon sinks; Forest development; Forest management practices; Reference levels; Robust decisions; Selective logging; Spatial allocation; Forestry; carbon emission; carbon sink; decision making; European Union; forest management; greenhouse gas; harvesting; management practice; modeling; Carbon; Decision Making; Greenhouse Gases; Harvesting; Mixtures; Selective Cutting; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089682807

We used the LANDIS forest landscape model to conduct a factorial simulation experiment to assess the landscape-wide effects of alternative cutting and planting practices in northern Wisconsin (USA) under three climate change scenarios simulated for 300 years to allow demographic legacies to be overcome by the experimental treatments. Our objective was to assess the relative ability of actionable components of silvicultural strategies to maintain productivity and economical and ecological values of forests under future climates compared to a “business as usual” (BAU) silviculture scenario representing current sustained yield practices. We found that the general effect of climate change was to increase the biomass of all species (CO2 fertilization and increased growing season), although the most cold-adapted species eventually declined under warming climate scenarios. Two alternative silvicultural strategies produced clearly different outcomes compared to the BAU scenario. Total landscape tree biomass was least under BAU, reflecting its high biomass removal rates, and greatest under the most aggressive climate-adapted silviculture strategy coupled with a high CO2 climate scenario due to increased growth and relatively high removal rates. Harvested outputs responded to both climate and silvicultural strategy, with the high CO2 scenario reducing biomass available for harvesting compared to a moderate CO2 scenario, except under the aggressive climate-adapted strategy. Our study suggests that creative silvicultural practices can be developed (and tested) to maintain productive and ecologically healthy forests under future climate conditions. © 2020","Climate change; Climate change adaptation; Elevated CO2; Forest management; LANDIS-II forest landscape model; Timber harvest","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Ecology; Forestry; Business-as-usual; Climate change scenarios; Ecological values; Forest landscape modeling; Forested landscapes; High removal rates; Silvicultural practices; Silvicultural strategies; Climate change; biomass; climate change; climate conditions; forest management; forestry practice; growth; harvesting; landscape; landscape change; silviculture; strategic approach; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Ecology; Forestry; Forests; Removal; Silviculture; Sustained Yield; United States; Wisconsin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084677805

Contributions of unit wastewater treatment processes and electricity sources to the overall emissions are considered. Tucson (Arizona), Denver (Colorado), and Washington, DC were chosen for their distinct locations, climatic conditions, raw water sources, wastewater treatment technologies, and electric power mixes. Denver experienced a 20% reduction in treated wastewater volumes per person despite a 16% increase in population. In Washington, DC, the reduction was 19%, corresponding to a 16% increase in population, and in Tucson 14% despite a population growth of 3%. The electricity intensity per volume of treated wastewater was higher in Tucson (1 kWh m-3) than in Washington, DC (0.7 kWh m-3) or Denver (0.5 kWh m-3). Tucson's GHG emissions per person were about six times higher compared to Denver and four times higher compared to Washington, DC. Wastewater treatment facilities in Denver and Washington, DC generated a quarter to third of their electricity needs from onsite biogas and lowered their GHG emissions by offsetting purchases from the grid, including coal-generated electricity. The higher GHG emission intensity in Tucson is a reflection of coal majority in the electricity mix in the period, gradually replaced with natural gas, solar, and biogas. In 2018, the GHG reduction was 20% when the share of solar electricity increased to 14% from zero in 2016. In the analysis period, reduced wastewater volumes relative to the 2010 baseline saved Denver 44 000 MWh, Washington, DC 11 000 MWh and Tucson 7000 MWh of electricity. As a result, Washington, DC managed to forgo 21 000 metric tons of CO2-eq and Denver 34 000 metric tons, while Tucson's cumulative emissions increased by 22 000 metric tons of CO2-eq.

These efforts are critical constraints to atmospheric assessment of anthropogenic fluxes in addition to offering the climate change policymaking community usable information to guide mitigation. In the United States, there are two high-resolution FFCO2 emission data products, Vulcan and the Anthropogenic Carbon Emissions System (ACES). As a step toward developing improved, accurate, and detailed FFCO2 emission landscapes, we perform a comparison of the two data products. We find that while agreeing on total FFCO2 emissions at the aggregate scale (relative difference = 1.7%), larger differences occur at smaller spatial scales and in individual sectors. Differences in the smaller-emitting sectors are likely errors in ACES input data or emission factors. ACES advances the approach for estimating emissions in the gas and oil sector, while Vulcan shows better geocoordinate correction in the electricity production sector. Differences in the subcounty residential and commercial building sectors are driven by different spatial proxies and suggest a task for future investigation. The gridcell absolute median relative difference, a measure of the average gridcell-scale relative difference, indicates a 53.5% difference. The recommendation for improved BU granular FFCO2 emission estimation includes review, assessment, and archive of point source geolocations, CO emission input data, CO and CO2 emission factors, and uncertainty approaches including those due to spatial errors. Finally, intensives where local utility data are publicly available could test the spatial proxies used in estimating residential and commercial building emissions. These steps toward best practices will lead to more accurate, granular emissions, enabling optimal emission mitigation policy choices.

The objective behind this study was to develop and evaluate a field-based non-injury method of inoculation technique for Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR) in oilseed Brassica, caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum (Lib.) de Bary. The non-injury method of screening technique involves stem inoculation using a five days old mycelial mat on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plug placed on the top of sterile water-soaked cotton pad firmly wrapped over the internodal region with parafilm at the basal portion of the stem (15–20 cm above the ground) in the field. Inoculation without injury substantiates the natural means of infection in the field and the use of moist cotton pad keeps humidity for longer to initiate infection even in case of adverse climatic conditions. Disease development on the inoculated stem was measured by the length and width of the lesion. The symptom appears with water-soaked lesion formation and spreading deeper and wider on the stem in >90% of inoculated plants. During the experiment, about 800 Brassica germplasms including their wild relatives were screened and evaluated for three consecutive years using near-natural (non-injury) method of disease inoculation in the field. The Inoculation severity index (ISI) obtained during these years at Pusa, New Delhi were significantly similar and correlated with the natural infection measured in terms of disease severity index (DSI) on selected germplasm in the sick plot at ICAR-DRMR, Bharatpur. The significant correlations obtained among the used Brassica lines that were earlier not subjected for natural screening suggest the potential of this technique in evaluating the breeding material for SSR before confirmation with natural infection in the field. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Inoculation; Lesion; Oilseed Brassica; Resistance; Sclerotinia sclerotiorum; Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR)","agricultural inoculation; Article; Brassica; brown stem rot; climate; disease course; disease severity assessment; germplasm; humidity; India; infection sensitivity; mycelium; nonhuman; oilseed; plant breeding; plant fungus interaction; plant stem; priority journal; Sclerotinia sclerotiorum; screening; agriculture; Ascomycetes; Brassica; disease resistance; microbiology; pathogenicity; plant disease; prevention and control; procedures; mycosis; Agriculture; Ascomycota; Brassica; Disease Resistance; Mycoses; Plant Diseases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086727739

Thus, operators are exploring enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques such as miscible gas injection (huff ‘n’ puff) and surfactants to increase the production from shales. This study evaluates several commercial surfactants and the commonly used solvent limonene for their ability to increase hydrocarbon recovery. The results show that the various surfactants at 2 gallons per ton (gal/t) or 0.8 wt% concentration recover up to 29, 33, and 34% hydrocarbons from Lyons sandstone, Wolfcamp, and Eagle Ford rock samples, respectively. This is significantly more than the base case (no surfactants), which recovers only 16, 19, and 14%, respectively. The increased recovery by surfactants can be partially explained by the reduction in interfacial tension (IFT) between crude oil and brine (up to 90%) caused by the surfactant solutions. Another important reason governing the hydrocarbon recovery is the ability of the surfactants to prevent asphaltene precipitation. This study focused on the interaction of the surfactants with the asphaltenes and found some surfactants can cause a linear decrease in asphaltene precipitation with increasing surfactant concentration. Finally, the contact angle measurements were used to study the change in wettability of the rock surface caused by surfactant solutions that can preferentially change the oil-wet and mixed-wet pores to more water-wet pores, thereby further aiding the hydrocarbon recovery. This study shows that an integrated approach including a broad spectrum of measurements such as aqueous stability, IFT, contact angle, phase behavior, spontaneous imbibition hydrocarbon recovery, and asphaltene precipitation is required to adequately characterize any surfactant and its ability to increase the hydrocarbon recovery.

An organic carbon mixture (OCM) formulated by mixing the test substrates was used to biostimulate microbial processes (SO42−/Fe3+reduction) necessary for efficient attenuation of the hazards imposed by AIS. OCM amendment in calcium carbonate–treated AIS enhanced reductive processes and removed dissolved SO42− and Fe3+ considerably raising the pH close to neutrality. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing performed with total DNA and RNA elucidated the microbial population dynamics of treated AIS. Metabolically active populations comprised of fermentative (Clostridium sensu stricto 1 and Fonticella), iron-reducing (Acidocella, Anaeromyxobacter, and Clostridium sensu stricto 1), and sulfate-reducing (Desulfovibrio, Desulfotomaculum, Desulfosporosinus, and Desulfobacteraceae) bacteria. Microbial guilds obtained highlighted the synergistic role of cellulolytic, fermentative, and SO42−/Fe3+-reducing bacteria in attenuation of hazardous contaminants. Quantitative PCR analysis well supported the role of OCM in stimulating the indigenous bacterial populations, including those harboring the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsrB) gene and involved actively in SO42− reduction.

In this work, via first principles calculations we have extensively studied the properties of two-dimensional transition metal carbides (MXenes) for efficient CO2 capture and reduction. Our results suggest that all the investigated MXenes exhibit excellent CO2 capture abilities, which are demonstrated to be originated from the surface lone pair electrons of MXenes and can be described via the effective charge numbers of their transition metal atoms. Then we highlight that the activated CO2 can be selectively reduced to methane (CH4) with a moderate limiting step, where the Mo2C MXene exhibit higher catalytic efficiency than the other MXenes. Further analysis on transition states confirms that the largest energy demand during CO2 reduction happens on the surface regeneration of Mo2C MXene, which is critical to realize sustainable catalytic activity. The stability of Mo2C MXene has been confirmed via phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings pave the way of MXenes for CO2 capture and pioneer the application of Mo2C MXene as novel CO2 reduction catalyst. © 2020","Catalysts; CH4; CO2 capture and reduction; First principles calculations; MXenes","Calculations; Carbides; Catalyst activity; Catalyst selectivity; Molecular dynamics; Transition metals; Ab initio molecular dynamics simulation; Adsorption ability; Catalytic efficiencies; Lone pair electrons; Phonon dispersions; Transition metal atoms; Transition metal carbide; Transition state; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083695716

Most analyses of air pollution trends in China are based on model simulations or satellite data. Studies using field observation data and focusing on the latest data from environmental monitoring stations covering the whole country to assess the latest trends of different pollutants in different regions are relatively rare. The State Council of China promulgated the toughest-ever Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (Action Plan) in 2013. This led to a major improvement in air quality. We use the hourly Air Quality Index (AQI) and mass concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO2, O3, and SO2 in 362 cities from 2015 to 2019, obtained from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, to study their temporal and spatial changes and assess the effectiveness of the policy on the atmospheric environment since its promulgation and implementation. We found that the national and regional air quality in China continues to improve, with PM2.5, PM10, AQI, CO, and SO2 exhibiting negative trends. However, O3 and NO2 pollution is an urgent problem that needs to be solved and the current control strategy for PM2.5 will only partially reduce the PM2.5 pollution in the western region. Although the implementation of ""Action Plan"" measures has effectively improved air quality, China’s air pollution is still serious and far from the WHO standard. Implementing measures for continuous and effective emissions control is still a top priority. © 2020 Guo et al.

Emission rates are measured using an airborne mass-balance technique from a low-flying aircraft. Annual measurement-based sectorwide methane emissions are 19,000 ± 2300 Mg for refineries, 136,700 ± 25,900 Mg for landfills, 11,900 ± 1,500 Mg for POTWs, and 11,100 ± 3,400 Mg for composting. The average of measured emissions for each refinery ranges from 4 to 23 times larger than the corresponding emissions reported to regulatory agencies, while measurement-derived landfill and POTW estimates are approximately twice the current inventory estimates. Significant methane emissions at composting facilities indicate that a California mandate to divert organics from landfills to composting may not be an effective measure for mitigating methane emissions unless best management practices are instituted at composting facilities. Complementary evidence from airborne remote sensing imagery indicates atmospheric venting from refinery hydrogen plants, landfill working surfaces, composting stockpiles, etc., to be among the specific source types responsible for the observed discrepancies.

Spatially explicit land change models can greatly help decision makers, but traditional regression approaches fail to capture the nonlinearity and complex interactions of the underlying drivers. Our objective was to use a machine learning algorithm combined with high-resolution data sets to provide simultaneous and spatial forecasts of deforestation, land degradation, and regeneration for the next two decades. A 17,000-km2 region in the south of Madagascar was taken as the study area. First, an empirical analysis of drivers of change was conducted, and then, an ensemble model was calibrated to predict and map potential changes based on 12 potential explanatory variables. These potential change maps were used to draw three scenarios of land change while considering past trends in intensity of change and expert knowledge. Historical observations displayed clear patterns of land degradation and relatively low regeneration. Amongst the 12 potential explanatory variables, distance to forest edge and elevation were the most important for the three land transitions studied. Random forest showed slightly better prediction ability compared with maximum entropy and generalized linear model. Business-as-usual scenarios highlighted the large areas under deforestation and degradation threat, and an alternative scenario enabled the location of suitable areas for regeneration. The approach developed herein and the spatial outputs provided can help stakeholders target their interventions or develop large-scale sustainable land management strategies. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","ensemble method; land use change modelling; Madagascar; REDD+; scenarios","Decision making; Decision trees; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Land use; Random forests; Reforestation; Ensemble methods; Land-use change modelling; Madagascar; REDD; scenarios; Machine learning; data set; deforestation; forecasting method; land degradation; land use change; landscape change; machine learning; modeling; regeneration; Madagascar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088910604

Simultaneously, sewage sludge is rich in nutrients and organic matter, therefore it is proposed for natural use. However, before such an application, sewage sludge should be properly prepared, so that it does not adversely affect on the environment. Apart from various methods commonly applied in sewage sludge conditioning, the utilization of bio-preparations seems to be an attractive alternative. The experiment was conducted in PVC boxes with one sewage sludge and one amendment treatment as Effective Microorganism (EMTM) preparation applied at two doses dissolved (the water: EMTM preparation ratio = 1:5) (T1) and concentrated (T2). Sewage sludge without EMTM preparation was a control treatment (T0). The chemical composition of sewage sludge was recorded at 12 incubation dates. The quantitative changes of macro and micronutrients during incubation sewage sludge were assessed and followed by evaluated by distance covariance which measure both linear and nonlinear relationship between variables. On the base of obtained results, one may state, that the significance of EMTM preparation in sewage sludge conditioning was minor. The positive effect of the bio-preparation was observed only in the case of carbon and nitrogen, which amounts increased along the incubation time. These conclusions were obtained thanks to the author’s method of selecting variables based on the covariance distance defined for multidimensional functional data. There is no doubt that modern statistical methods based on functional data lead to in-depth conclusions resulting from the conducted experiment.

This paper proposes a tool to schedule preventive maintenance for healthcare centers using Markov chains. To this end, the authors analyzed 25 healthcare centers belonging to the three Healthcare Districts of Spain and built between 1985 and 2005. Markov chains proved useful in choosing the most suitable maintenance policies for each healthcare building without exceeding a specific degradation boundary, which enabled achieving an ideal maintenance frequency and reduced the use of resources. Markov chains have also proven useful in optimizing the periodicity of routine maintenance tasks, ensuring a suitable level of maintenance according to the frequency of the failures and reducing the cost and carbon footprint. The healthcare centers observed during the study managed to save more than 700 km of journeys, reduce emissions in its operations as a whole by 174.3 kg of CO2 per month and increase the overall efficiency of maintenance operations by 15%. This approach, therefore, renders it advisable to plan the maintenance of healthcare buildings. © 2020 by the authors.","Healthcare center; Healthcare engineering; Maintenance policies; Markov chain; Patrol maintenance; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089521453

However, holistic reviews on the dynamic complexity and stability of climate change governance have received little attention. This study addresses this research gap by conducting a structurally comparative analysis between China and the United States based on the ""polity-policy-politics"" framework. Three analytical facets are identified for each dimension of the framework, including institutional settings, the nature of policy mechanisms used in climate change practices, and the degree of multi-actors' involvement under two governance scenarios. Results show that climate change governance in the two countries differs substantially. The process of climate governance in China is driven by strong leadership at the national level alongside policy continuity, whereas well-functioning market mechanisms and robust regulatory systems are still lacking. A more meaningful involvement of social forces is also critically needed when addressing increasingly complex and uncertain climate change. By contrast, the US federal climate policies are considered inadequate compared with sub-national actions and persistent efforts of non-state actors, to which the success of climate practices is largely attributed. This study systematically uncovers the divergence of climate mitigation under different political-institutional contexts, and evaluates the effectiveness of governance arrangement in the two countries, which helps policymakers to understand the potential of improving the performance of climate change governance. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change governance; Multi-level governance; Non-state actors; Policy instruments mixes","academic research; climate change; comparative study; complexity; environmental policy; governance approach; holistic approach; institutional reform; literature review; mitigation; persistence; China; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090081927

Here we infer the long-term dispersal abilities of three Geomalacus (Gastropoda, Pulmonata) species from their range-wide genetic–spatial distance relationships. This approach follows recent advances in statistical modelling of the analogous pattern at the community level: the distance decay in assemblage similarity. While linear relationships are expected for species with high long-term dispersal abilities, asymptotic relationships are expected for those with more restricted mobility. We evaluated three functional forms (linear, negative exponential and power-law) for the relationship between genetic distance (computed from mitochondrial cox1 sequences, n = 701) and spatial distance. Range fragmentation at present time and at the Last Glacial Maximum was also estimated based on the projection of climatic niches. The power-law function best fit the relationship between genetic and spatial distances, suggesting strong dispersal limitation and long-term population isolation in all three species. However, the differences in slope and explained variance pointed to disparities in dispersal ability among these weak dispersers. Phylogeographic patterns of Geomalacus species are thus largely driven by the same major process (i.e. dispersal limitation), operating at different strengths. This strong dispersal limitation results in geographic clustering of genetic diversity that makes these species highly vulnerable to genetic erosion due to climate change. © 2020 The Authors.

C6 glioma cells were treated with 5 μg/ml DNA wrapped single-walled carbon nanotubes and exposed to bi-phasic electric pulses (6.6 V/m, 200 Hz, pulse duration 1 ms). Nanotube accumulation was determined by Raman microspectroscopy and their intracellular local concentration was evaluated using the G-band intensity in Raman spectra of single-walled carbon nanotubes. It was revealed that the low-frequency and low-strength electric field stimulation of glioma cells exposed to single-walled carbon nanotubes led to facilitation and, thus, to amplification of nanotube accumulation inside the cells. The number of nanotubes in intracellular agglomerates increased from (28.8 ± 13.1) un./agglom. and (84.0 ± 28.7) un./agglom. in control samples to (60.6 ± 21.4) un./agglom. and (184.2 ± 53.4) un./agglom. for 1 h and 2 h stimulation, respectively. Thus, the tumor exposure to an external electric field makes it possible to more effectively regulate the accumulation and distribution of carbon nanotubes inside glioma cells allowing to reduce the applied therapeutic doses of carbon nanomaterial delivered anticancer drugs. © 2020 The Authors","Electric field; Glioma; Low-frequency; Low-strength; Nanotherapy; Single-walled carbon nanotubes","single walled nanotube; carbon nanotube; animal cell; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer nanotherapy; cancer therapy; cell membrane; cell stimulation; clinical effectiveness; concentration (parameter); controlled study; electric field; electrostimulation; endocytosis; exposure; glioma cell; nonhuman; priority journal; Raman microspectroscopy; Raman spectrometry; rat; regulatory mechanism; animal; chemistry; electricity; glioma; membrane potential; nanotechnology; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Membrane; Electric Stimulation; Electricity; Glioma; Membrane Potentials; Nanotechnology; Nanotubes, Carbon; Rats; Spectrum Analysis, Raman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088141638

Using data on 93 million individual households, we estimate these GHGs across the contiguous United States and clarify the respective influence of climate, affluence, energy infrastructure, urban form, and building attributes (age, housing type, heating fuel) in driving these emissions. A ranking by state reveals that GHGs (per unit floor space) are lowest in Western US states and highest in Central states. Wealthier Americans have per capita footprints ∼25% higher than those of lower-income residents, primarily due to larger homes. In especially affluent suburbs, these emissions can be 15 times higher than nearby neighborhoods. If the electrical grid is decarbonized, then the residential housing sector can meet the 28% emission reduction target for 2025 under the Paris Agreement. However, grid decarbonization will be insufficient to meet the 80% emissions reduction target for 2050 due to a growing housing stock and continued use of fossil fuels (natural gas, propane, and fuel oil) in homes. Meeting this target will also require deep energy retrofits and transitioning to distributed low-carbon energy sources, as well as reducing per capita floor space and zoning denser settlement patterns. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

These plans are increasingly subsumed within urban development projects, and embedded in global flows of capital and networks of environmental governance and planning. And yet, scholarship on urban adaptation has tended to approach the city as an analytically bounded territory, neglecting interconnections across space and processes of globalisation, urbanisation, and geopolitics. This paper extends theories of relational geographies to explore the emerging conditions of urban adaptation in the context of climate change and globalised urban development. Focusing on the global links of Dutch water expertise, and tracing relationships within and between Rotterdam, New York, and Jakarta, it illustrates the formation of global-urban networks – the multiscalar, multilevel connections through which capital, knowledge, and influence flow. It probes the ways in which these networks emerge to mobilise ideas and influence across geographical scales and political boundaries, driven and defined by interrelated factors including economic relationships, historically defined situational relationships, and interface conditions including narratives of culture and environmental urgency. The paper introduces the concept of ‘network formation’ to see and understand such interconnected, relational processes. It explains the spatial and temporal interconnections within and across sites, and the relationships between urban spatial projects and broader political economies and ecologies. The paper asserts the importance of conceptualising the relationships and interfaces of increasingly mobile and interconnected urban environmental futures. © Urban Studies Journal Limited 2019.","built environment; climate change; environment/sustainability; infrastructure; planning; theory; urban politics","adaptive management; capital city; climate change; geopolitics; global perspective; territoriality; urban development; urban ecosystem; urbanization; Indonesia; Jakarta; Netherlands; New York [United States]; Rotterdam; South Holland; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060918101

The monthly data for this study were collected for the period from 2000 M1 to 2019 M8. In this study, QARDL econometric approach as discussed by Cho et al. (2015) has been used to tests the relationship between transportation services and CO2 emissions. Due to the chaotic and nonlinear behavior of our concerning variables, it was quite difficult to gauge the principle properties of their variations. Therefore, we relied on QARDL, which has been missing in previous researches. By utilizing the QARDL method, this research assesses the long-term stability of the nexus across the quantiles to provide an econometric framework that is more flexible than the traditional ones. In particular, the authors have analyzed how the quantiles of transportation (i.e., passenger and freight) influence the quantiles of CO2 emissions (environmental degradation). The empirical evidence revealed the negative significant relationship of both the transportation system (i.e., passenger and freight) with carbon emissions; however, this relationship holds at low quantiles of freight transport, whereas the same relationship has been observed at the majority of quantiles of passenger transport. So, this depicts that the transportation system of the USA helps to reduce CO2 emissions. Therefore, to maintain this situation, the government shall introduce more technologies that are fuel-efficient and promote clean consumption, thus reducing CO2 emissions, boosting economic growth, and making green transportation services. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","EKC; Freight transportation; Passenger transportation; QARDL; USA","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; econometrics; economic growth; energy efficiency; environmental economics; freight transport; fuel consumption; transportation system; United States; carbon; carbon dioxide; economic development; traffic and transport; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085283552

Connecting docked ships to onshore grid electricity and using electric tugboats are two approaches to reduce pollution damages. This paper examines the effects of the widespread adoption of electrification in waterborne shipping. Our study is novel in the use of an equilibrium model of the U.S. energy system to capture the effects of increasing electricity generation to electrify waterborne shipping both with and without a carbon pricing policy. We examine three scenarios, Electrifying in ports, Electrifying in Emission Control Areas, and Electrifying all U.S. vessel fuels, as well as an electrification scenario under carbon pricing, allowing electrification of waterborne shipping to contribute to deeper decarbonization. We find that electrification results in slight carbon emission reductions in early projected years and that the reductions increase as the electric grid evolves out to 2050. We also show that an ambitious scenario of electrifying all U.S. vessel fuels results in up to 65% net reduction in air pollution as we approach 2050, even after accounting for the pollution increase from grid generation. Our baseline results indicate that intensive waterborne shipping electrification can provide considerable social benefits that exceed the costs, especially as the electric grid decarbonizes.

Following excitation, different radiative and non-radiative recombination pathways can occur that are informative of the energetic structure of the material as well as of the presence of crystal defects and impurities. Usually, the characterization of the optical emission of crystalline materials is achieved through the study of emission spectra as a function of the excitation wavelength. A different approach employs variable excitation fluence to populate the energetic levels until saturation, which promotes the emission from other radiative and non-radiative pathways. The method is particularly effective for understanding conduction phenomena and studying charge recombination channels in semiconductor materials. In this work, we propose its application for characterizing radiative recombination paths in crystalline pigments. The approach has been tested in spectroscopy mode for the identification of paints in a model painting and in micro-imaging modality for the study of paint stratigraphies. We demonstrate that the method is highly informative of the nature of different recombination paths in crystalline pigments and allows a deeper characterization of the emission from luminescent paints with respect to the conventional steady-state photoluminescence approach. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Crystal defects; Crystal impurities; Crystal structure; Crystallites; Emission spectroscopy; Photoluminescence; Pigments; Charge recombinations; Crystalline solids; Defects and impurities; Excitation wavelength; Non-radiative recombinations; Optical emissions; Radiative recombination; Study of emissions; Nanocrystalline materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095974175

As a result, many researches are now devoted to the development of new bifunctional crystals and/or the improvement of the specific properties of existing ones. In this review, we focus on our recent work on Czochralski-grown undoped, Yb- and Nd-doped LaxGdySc4-x-y(BO3)4 - LGSB crystals as efficient bifunctional laser and NLO crystals. Structural, linear and NLO properties, as well as NIR laser emission performances in the case of Yb- and Nd-doped crystals are reported. The results prove that all these crystals have good NLO properties, characteristic to huntite-type crystals. A remarkable advantage of the Czochralski-grown LGSB crystal is that it can be grown with large size and high quality, which makes it a very promising candidate for various NLO applications, especially for frequency conversion through SHG processes of the high-average power NIR laser radiation into VIS radiation. In addition, the good NLO properties of the Yb:LGSB and Nd:LGSB crystals, together with the advantage to grow large size and high-quality crystals by the Czochralski technique, and the excellent NIR laser performances demonstrated experimentally, recommend Yb:LGSB and Nd:LGSB as promising bifunctional crystals to design new laser sources in the NIR and green spectral ranges based on direct laser emission and self-frequency doubling processes, respectively. © 2020 The Authors","Bifunctional crystals; Laser crystals; Nonlinear optical crystals; Optical spectroscopy; Solid-state laser sources","Crystals; Frequency doublers; Infrared devices; Bi-functional laser; Czochralski technique; Frequency-doubling; High average power; High quality crystals; Laser performance; Self-frequency-doubling; Specific properties; Harmonic generation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086076890

Results of bibliometric analysis show that the number of SDfUs articles has generally continuously increased since 2007. The most productive scholars are from the USA, the UK, and China, while the top three organizations are Loughborough University, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and Delft University of Technology. Different focuses of SDfUs appear among developed and developing countries. Green building design has emerged as one key area that uses the concept of SDfUs in developed countries such as the USA and the UK. SDfUs studies in developing countries such as China focus on design for end-of-life products’ treatment and disposal. Most SDfUs studies examine how design can contribute to environmental performance through emission reduction and energy saving during products’ use, and articles in one of five clusters from co-word analysis explore users’ behaviors for sustainable design in the textile industry. This paper is the first study that systematically reviews the literature on SDfUs.

These threats are of particular interest in low-income regions with limited investments in public health and a growing urban population, such as Brazil. Here, we apply a comprehensive interdisciplinary climate-health approach, including meteorological data and a daily mortality record from the Brazilian Health System from 2000 to 2015, covering 21 cities over the Metropolitan Region of Rio de Janeiro. The percentage of absolute mortality increase due to summer extreme temperatures is estimated using a negative binomial regression modeling approach and maximum/minimum temperature-derived indexes as covariates. Moreover, this study assesses the vulnerability to thermal stress for different age groups and both genders and thoroughly analyzes four extremely intense heat waves during 2010 and 2012 regarding their impacts on the population. Results showed that the highest absolute mortality values during heat-related events were linked to circulatory illnesses. However, the highest excess of mortality was related to diabetes, particularly for women within the elderly age groups. Moreover, results indicate that accumulated heat stress conditions during consecutive days preferentially preceded by persistent periods of moderate-temperature, lead to higher excess mortality rather than sporadic single hot days. This work may provide directions in human health policies related to extreme climate events in large tropical metropolitan areas from developing countries, contributing to altering the historically based purely reactive response. © 2020, ISB.","Extreme events; Extreme heat factor; Heat waves; Mortality levels; Rio de Janeiro","aged; Brazil; city; climate; climate change; female; heat; human; male; mortality; Aged; Brazil; Cities; Climate; Climate Change; Female; Hot Temperature; Humans; Male; Mortality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084090200

As governments are preparing new and updated NDCs for 2020, the question as to how much collective improvement is achieved is a pivotal one for the credibility of the international climate regime. The recent Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has assessed a wide range of scenarios that achieve the 1.5 °C limit. Those pathways are characterised by a substantial increase in near-term action and total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission levels about 50 % lower than what is implied by current NDCs. Here we assess the outcomes of different scenarios of NDC updating that fall short of achieving this 1.5 °C benchmark. We find that incremental improvements in reduction targets, even if achieved globally, are insufficient to align collective ambition with the goals of the Paris Agreement. We provide estimates for global mean temperature increase by 2100 for different incremental NDC update scenarios and illustrate climate impacts under those median scenarios for extreme temperature, long-term sea-level rise and economic damages for the most vulnerable countries. Under the assumption of maintaining ambition as reflected in current NDCs up to 2100 and beyond, we project a reduction in the gross domestic product (GDP) in tropical countries of around 60 % compared to a no-climate-change scenario and median long-term sea-level rise of close to 2 m in 2300. About half of these impacts can be avoided by limiting warming to 1.5 °C or below. Scenarios of more incremental NDC improvements do not lead to comparable reductions in climate impacts. An increase in aggregated NDC ambition of big emitters by 33 % in 2030 does not reduce presented climate impacts by more than about half compared to limiting warming to 1.5 °C. Our results underscore that a transformational increase in 2030 ambition is required to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. © 2020 SPIE.

However, such models suffer from computational difficulties due to the large aspect ratio between the horizontal and vertical directions. To overcome this problem, we developed a global model using a vertically implicit correction (VIC) scheme in which the integration time step is no longer limited by the vertical propagation of acoustic waves. We proved that our model, based on the Athena++ framework and its extension for planetary atmospheres - SNAP (Simulating Nonhydrostatic Atmospheres on Planets), rigorously conserves mass and energy in finite-volume simulations. We found that traditional numerical stabilizers such as hyperviscosity and divergence damping are not needed when using the VIC scheme, which greatly simplifies the numerical implementation and improves stability. We present simulation results ranging from 1D linear waves to 3D global circulations with and without the VIC scheme. These tests demonstrate that our formulation correctly tracks local turbulent motions, produces Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and generates a super-rotating jet on hot Jupiters. Employing this VIC scheme improves the computational efficiency of global simulations by more than two orders of magnitude compared to an explicit model and facilitates the capability of simulating a wide range of planetary atmospheres both regionally and globally. © 2020.

Because of its high spatial and temporal variability and limited observations, quantifying net tropospheric ozone changes across the Northern Hemisphere on time scales of two decades had not been possible. Here, we show, using newly available observations from an extensive commercial aircraft monitoring network, that tropospheric ozone has increased above 11 regions of the Northern Hemisphere since the mid-1990s, consistent with the OMI/MLS satellite product. The net result of shifting anthropogenic ozone precursor emissions has led to an increase of ozone and its radiative forcing above all 11 study regions of the Northern Hemisphere, despite NOx emission reductions at midlatitudes.

Here, we describe the contribution of inertia to future trends. Drawing from thermodynamic principles, and using 38 years of available statistics between 1980 to 2017, we find a constant scaling between current rates of world primary energy consumption EðtÞ and the historical time integral W of past world inflation-adjusted economic production Y, or WðtÞ ¼ R0t Yðt0Þdt0. In each year, over a period during which both E and W more than doubled, the ratio of the two remained nearly unchanged, that is l ¼ EðtÞðtÞ=WðtÞ ¼ 5:9 * 0:1 Gigawatts per trillion 2010 US dollars. What this near constant implies is that current growth trends in energy consumption, population, and standard of living, perhaps counterintuitively, are determined by past innovations that have improved the economic production efficiency, or enabled use of less energy to transform raw materials into the makeup of civilization. Current observed growth rates agree well with predictions derived from available historical data. Future efforts to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions are likely also to be constrained by the contributions of past innovation to growth. Assuming no further efficiency gains, options look limited to rapid decarbonization of energy consumption through sustained implementation of at least one Gigawatt of renewable or nuclear power capacity per day. Alternatively, with continued reliance on fossil fuels, civilization could shift to a steady-state economy, one that devotes economic production exclusively to maintining ongoing metabolic needs rather than to material expansion. Even if such actions could be achieved immediately, energy consumption would continue at its current level, and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations would only begin to balance natural sinks at concentrations exceeding 500 ppmv. © 2020 Garrett et al.

There is a consensus that matter flowing through the disk is channelled onto the stellar surface by the stellar magnetic field. This is thought to be strong enough to truncate the disk close to the corotation radius, at which the disk rotates at the same rate as the star. Spectro-interferometric studies in young stellar objects show that hydrogen emission (a well known tracer of accretion activity) mostly comes from a region a few milliarcseconds across, usually located within the dust sublimation radius1–3. The origin of the hydrogen emission could be the stellar magnetosphere, a rotating wind or a disk. In the case of intermediate-mass Herbig AeBe stars, the fact that Brackett γ (Brγ) emission is spatially resolved rules out the possibility that most of the emission comes from the magnetosphere4–6 because the weak magnetic fields (some tenths of a gauss) detected in these sources7,8 result in very compact magnetospheres. In the case of T Tauri sources, their larger magnetospheres should make them easier to resolve. The small angular size of the magnetosphere (a few tenths of a milliarcsecond), however, along with the presence of winds9,10 make the interpretation of the observations challenging. Here we report optical long-baseline interferometric observations that spatially resolve the inner disk of the T Tauri star TW Hydrae. We find that the near-infrared hydrogen emission comes from a region approximately 3.5 stellar radii across. This region is within the continuum dusty disk emitting region (7 stellar radii across) and also within the corotation radius, which is twice as big. This indicates that the hydrogen emission originates in the accretion columns (funnel flows of matter accreting onto the star), as expected in magnetospheric accretion models, rather than in a wind emitted at much larger distance (more than one astronomical unit). © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"hydrogen; cosmology; dust; hydrogen; magnetosphere; spectroscopy; sublimation; tracer; wind field; Article; astronomy; atmosphere; Doppler flowmetry; interferometry; magnetic field; magnetosphere; near infrared spectroscopy; priority journal; solar radiation; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089883627

The establishment of a carbon emissions trading scheme (ETS) has an important role in China's achievement of these targets. China designed its ETS in 2011 and implemented it in pilot regions in 2013. This study investigated whether the ETS reduces carbon emissions and how it influences carbon leakage. First, the production-based emissions, consumption-based emissions, and carbon leakage of 28 industries in 30 provinces during 2005–2015 were calculated based on provincial environmentally extended input–output tables. Then, the difference-in-differences and difference-in-difference-in-differences models were used to evaluate the effectiveness of ETS. The following conclusions were derived. (1) ETS contributes to emissions mitigation in pilot regions and industries. (2) ETS has greater effect on the mitigation of production-based emissions than consumption-based emissions. (3) ETS encourages outsourcing of emissions from pilot areas to non-pilot areas, resulting in carbon leakage (or “pollution haven” effect), which aggravates the imbalance of emissions transfers among China's provinces. The success of China's ETS in promoting emissions mitigation can serve as an example for other emerging economies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions trading scheme; Carbon mitigation policy; Difference-in-differences; Policy evaluation","Climate change; Commerce; Emission control; A-carbon; Carbon emissions; Carbon leakage; Carbon mitigation; Difference-in-difference-in-difference; Difference-in-differences; Emerging economies; Emissions mitigation; Carbon; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; input-output analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088876170

In order to understand the current suitability and limitation of GLC products, the discrepancy and pixel-level uncertainty in major GLC products in three epochs are assessed in this study by using an integrated uncertainty index (IUI) that combines the thematic uncertainty and local classification accuracy uncertainty. The results show that the overall spatial agreements (Ao values) between GLC products are lower than 58%, and the total areas of forests are very consistent in major GLC products, but significant differences are found in different forest classes. The misclassification among different forest classes and mosaic types can account for about 20% of the total disagreements. The mean IUI almost reaches 0.5, and high uncertainty mostly occurs in transition zones and heterogeneous areas across the world. Further efforts are needed to make in the land cover classifications in areas with high uncertainty. Designing a classification scheme for climate models, with explicit definitions of land cover classes in the threshold of common attributes, is urgently needed. Information of the pixel-level uncertainty in major GLC products not only give important implications for the specific application, but also provide a quite important basis for land cover fusion. © 2020, The Chinese Meteorological Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","discrepancies; global land cover (GLC); local accuracy; pixel-level uncertainty; thematic similarity","data set; image analysis; image classification; land cover; pixel; satellite imagery; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090085896

In order to analyze the evolution of the area of water in Ulungur Lake (Buluntuohai Lake, Jili Lake) and the main causes of those changes, 3S technology, satellite data preprocessing, water extraction and database construction methods are combined with consideration of climatic changes and human activity in this study. The data in this study include 11 phases of remote sensing image data, field mapping data and relevant attribute data of the study area from 1977 to 2017. The results demonstrated the following. (1) Over the past 40 years, the change in Ulungur Lake’s area was characterized by natural expansion, fluctuation stability, and recovery increase. Significant changes were mainly concentrated in the waters of Zhonghaizi, Xiaohaizi, Camel’s Neck, and the waters near Akekule. (2) The period from 1977 to 1995 was the expansion period of the lake water area, and human activities were the main driving factors. The period from 2000–2017 was a smaller period of expansion of the lake water area, with warmer and more humid climate trends combined with human activities driving the change. (3) The water area that was extracted based on the MNDWI water index method can increase the contrast between bodies of water and buildings, which can aid in interpreting and extracting water element information from flat terrain and single types of surface features. This can provide an effective technical means for quantitative and dynamic analysis of the temporal and spatial changes in lake water area. © 2020 IWA Publishing.

In terms of economic spillovers, this implies that a dollar entering a particular economy nowadays follows a different path than a decade before, permeating in longer interregional feedback loops and creating additional multiplier effects outside its region of origin. However, it also implies that the environmental burden that such this dollar generates has changed in scale and spatial distribution. In this paper, we explore the evolution of these “paths” over the period 1997–2008 and highlight the main drivers of observed structural changes that contribute to the surge or decline of the spatial distribution of economic spillovers and greenhouse gases emissions. We specifically study the effects of an increase in income in the United States, the country with the largest trade volume in the world. We introduce an extended version of the Temporal Leontief Inverse (TLI) framework that allows tracing the evolutionary path of the American households' multiplier in a quasi-dynamic fashion, isolating the contribution of expenditure patterns, income, trade and foreign structural change to the temporal evolution. We find similar growing multiplier effects inside and outside the US due to services and manufacturing respectively, but a declining local environmental burden due to changes in interindustry relations inside the US with declining manufacturing and a reduced emission intensity. We also highlight the fragmentation process with declining foreign intraregional spillovers and increasing trade spillovers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Consumption-based accounting; Greenhouse gases emissions; Temporal Leontief Inverse; Time-series analysis; Trade","complexity; emission control; environmental education; household survey; international trade; spatial distribution; spillover effect; structural change; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083798841

Transport electrification combined with renewable energy sources (RES) deployment in power generation is a key decarbonization option assessed in many recent studies that focus on national or international climate policies. The penetration of electric vehicles (EVs) together with a gradual retirement of conventional oil-fuelled vehicles implies that a new ‘trade ecosystem’ will be created characterized by different features (move from OPEX to CAPEX) and supply chains. A key component of the EVs are the Lithium-Ion batteries, the manufacturing of which is employment intensive and constitutes an essential element of the EVs that can act as a driver for establishing comparative advantages and increasing EV market shares. Our study focuses on the size of the EV market that can be established within ambitious global and EU decarbonization scenarios and investigates the economic, trade and employment implications considering the production chain of EVs (i.e., the regional production of batteries and vehicles). We use the large-scale global GEM-E3-FIT model to capture the trade dynamics of decarbonization scenarios. We find that under ambitious climate policies, the global size of the clean energy technologies will be US$44 trillion cumulatively over the 2020–2050 period. 44per cent of the market relates to EVs, which will mostly be produced outside EU. For the EU to capture a significant segment of the EV value chain, it needs to increase clean energy R&D and associated supportive policies so as to boost the domestic capacity to produce competitively batteries.

The approach is based on earlier work on understanding transitions, applying a multi-level perspective with landscape, regime and niche levels to the development of socio-technical scenarios. The pathways to 2050 focus on the power sector, including the potential for increasing the use of low-emissions electricity for heating and transport. Part 1 describes studies of historical energy and infrastructure transitions that help to understand the dynamics and timing of past transitions. The role of large-scale and small-scale actors in the electricity sector and methods used to develop the pathways are then described.

Despite widespread success of many elimination initiatives, elimination efforts in some regions of the world have stalled. Barriers to malaria elimination include climate and land use changes, such as warming temperatures and urbanization, which can alter mosquito habitats. Socioeconomic factors, such as political instability and regional migration, also threaten elimination goals. This is particularly relevant in areas where local elimination has been achieved and consequently surveillance and control efforts are dwindling and are no longer a priority. Understanding how environmental change, impacts malaria elimination has important practical implications for vector control and disease surveillance strategies. It is important to consider climate change when monitoring the threat of malaria resurgence due to socioeconomic influences. However, there is limited assessment of how the combination of climate variation, interventions and socioeconomic pressures influence long-term trends in malaria transmission and elimination efforts. In this study, we used Bayesian hierarchical mixed models and malaria case data for a 29-year period to disentangle the impacts of climate variation and malaria control efforts on malaria risk in the Ecuadorian province of El Oro, which achieved local elimination in 2011. We found shifting patterns of malaria between rural and urban areas, with a relative increase of Plasmodium vivax in urbanized areas. Minimum temperature was an important driver of malaria seasonality and the association between warmer minimum temperatures and malaria incidence was greater for Plasmodium falciparum compared to P. vivax malaria. There was considerable heterogeneity in the impact of three chemical vector control measures on both P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria. We found statistically significant associations between two of the three measures [indoor residual spraying (IRS) and space spraying] and a reduction in malaria incidence, which varied between malaria type. We also found environmental suitability for malaria transmission is increasing in El Oro, which could limit future elimination efforts if malaria is allowed to re-establish. Our findings have important implications for understanding environmental obstacles to malaria elimination and highlights the importance of designing and sustaining elimination efforts in areas that remain vulnerable to resurgence. © Copyright © 2020 Fletcher, Stewart-Ibarra, Sippy, Carrasco-Escobar, Silva, Beltran-Ayala, Ordoñez, Adrian, Sáenz, Drakeley, Jones and Lowe.","climate; elimination; environmental change; malaria; spatio-temporal model; vector control",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090766304

While woody encroachment is commonly considered as a climate change mitigation measure, studies suggest a still uncertain role of the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool in contributing to climate change mitigation during this process. Therefore, the objective of the study is to investigate the possible SOC variations occurring as a consequence of the secondary succession process at the provincial level in an Alpine area in Italy. Materials and Methods: A chronosequence approach was applied to identify, in five different study areas of the Belluno province, the land use/land cover change over four different stages of natural succession, from managed grazing land to secondary forest developed on abandoned grazing land. In each chronosequence stage, soil samples were collected down to the bedrock (0-60 cm depth) to determine the changes in the SOC stock due to the woody encroachment process. Results: In all areas, small or no significant (p < 0.05) SOC stock changes were observed during the secondary succession in the upper 30 cm of mineral soil, while significant changes were evident in the 30-60 cm compartment, with the SOC stock significantly decreasing from 30% to 60% in the final stage of the succession. This fact indicates the great importance of considering also the subsoil when dealing with land use/land cover change dynamics. Conclusions: The recorded trend in SOC has been proved to be the opposite in other Italian regions, so our results indicate the importance of local observation and data collection to correctly evaluate the soil contribution to climate change mitigation during woody encroachment. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change mitigation; Common agricultural policy; Rural development program; Soil organic carbon; Woody encroachment","Forestry; Land use; Organic carbon; Soils; Climate change mitigation; Land use/land cover change; Local observations; Natural succession; Secondary forests; Secondary succession; Soil organic carbon; Woody encroachments; Climate change; climate change; Common Agricultural Policy; land cover; mitigation; rural development; soil organic matter; woody plant; Coverings; Data Processing; Forestry; Italian; Land Use; Processes; Soil; Alps; Belluno; Italy; Veneto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090351419

We focus on a set of UK habitats of recognised conservation value, first quantifying the carbon stored in the vegetation and top 30 cm of soil in these areas. We estimate that these areas store 0.55 gigatonnes of carbon in vegetation and soil to a depth of 30 cm, approximately 30% of the UK terrestrial carbon store to a similar depth, on 20% of the land area. Most of these high carbon, high conservation value habitats are in upland areas, with particularly notable extents and mass of carbon in Scotland. In their current condition, we estimate these areas to exert a net sequestration effect of more than 8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents per year. Furthermore, restoration of these habitats from their current, generally poor condition could result in an extra 6–7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents per year, in the context of the UK's total emissions of 455.9 million tonnes CO2eq in 2017.

Usually, the decentralization of the energy distribution is treated by considering the interactions between prosumers and main grid, neglecting to include the rising chance for prosumers to directly exchange the produced energy, thus bypassing the grid. In this direction, this paper proposes a prosumer-centred dynamical model able to take the energy interactions among prosumers into account, along with the usual interactions established with the grid. The modelling approach takes inspiration from the methodological framework of agent-based models, particularly appropriate to deal with problems characterized by a significant number of interactions among the parts. Specifically, the developed model has been formulated with the main scope of investigating to what extent energy exchanges among prosumers reduce the supply from traditional plants. The electricity demand and production of each prosumer, the distance among buildings, operational and technological features (usage of the links, installed capacity of the energy production systems have been included in the analysis. Hourly-based simulations run on NetLogo performing a real urban area in Southern Italy as a case study for two scenarios evaluating the distribution from photovoltaic panels and small-scale cogeneration units. In addition, an a posteriori environmental analysis to evaluate the reduction of carbon emissions due to the distribution among prosumers has been conducted. Results reveal that short-range interactions among prosumers are preferred when planning to reduce the electricity supply from the main grid. In addition, the spatial configuration of the buildings within the area as well as the capacity of the installed energy production systems significantly affect the distribution. Finally, simulations highlight the noticeable impact of seasonality on both the distribution and the emissions’ reduction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based models; Energy distribution; Micro-cogeneration; Photovoltaic panels; Prosumers","Autonomous agents; Cogeneration plants; Photovoltaic cells; Urban planning; Decentralized distribution; Distributed production systems; Energy production systems; Environmental analysis; Methodological frameworks; Short range interactions; Spatial configuration; Technological feature; Computational methods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085360920

This hydraulic system makes it possible to measure the engine power output with simplicity and low cost. By using energy analysis, the engine performance was evaluated using four different fuels: mineral diesel; biodiesel; a diesel–biodiesel blend composed of mineral diesel (90%) and biodiesel (10%) in volume; and a ternary mixture composed of mineral diesel (82%), biodiesel (10%) and ethanol (8%) in volume. The biodiesel used in the tests came from waste cooking oil, and it was produced in the local pilot plant. Ethanol was used to decrease combustion temperature due to its high enthalpy of vaporization while increasing oxygen content in the mixture. Results revealed a slight increase in the emission of NOx emissions and a reduction in CO emissions with the increase in biodiesel content. The use of ethanol resulted in lower NOx (up to 6.5%) and PM emissions (up to 31.0%) but CO and HC emissions were increased. The energy efficiency and specific fuel consumption were increased when compared to mineral diesel when biodiesel content was increased.

Epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated the vulnerability of human fetuses and infants to the effects of OPs because of their rapid growth and organ development, cell differentiation, and immaturity of metabolism. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prenatal exposure to OPs characterized by different physicochemical properties using non-invasive biological samples (meconium and placenta). A total of 88 placenta and 53 meconium samples were collected in Ourense, a city located in northwestern Spain, at the delivery and after birth from mothers and their infants from the University Hospital of Ourense, respectively. Selective pressurized liquid extraction (SPLE) methodologies were used to determine the targeted OPs in the selected biological samples. Cleanup of extracts was performed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) using EZ-POP cartridges and detection by gas chromatography (GC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (QqQ-MS/MS). The targeted OPs were detected with the following mean level total concentration order polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) > organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) > non-dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls (NDLPCBs) > pyrethroids (PYRs) > polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) > dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyls (DLPCBs) > organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) for placenta and ΣNDLPCBs > ΣPAHs > ΣOCPs > ΣPYRs > ΣOPPs > ΣDLPCBs > ΣPBDEs for meconium, respectively. Significant correlations (p < .050) between the socio-demographic characteristics of the selected population (mother's parity, age, weight increase during pregnancy, place of living and smoking habits) and log transformed concentration of some of the targeted OPs (OCPs, PBDEs, PYRs, OPPs and PAHs) were detected. The results obtained shown the complementary information given by both biological samples selected. Nevertheless, additional research will be needed to gain an understanding of the trans-placental transfer of OPs, to choose the best biological matrix to evaluate the prenatal exposure to OPs in a correct way and to know their health implications. © 2020","Meconium; Non-invasive samples; Organic pollutants; Placenta; Prenatal exposure","Drug products; Extraction; Gas chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Pesticides; Phase separation; Physicochemical properties; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls; Non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls; Organochlorine pesticides; Organophos-phorus pesticides; Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Selective pressurized liquid extractions; Socio-demographic characteristics; Organic pollutants; dioxin like polychlorinated biphenyl; organochlorine pesticide; organophosphate pesticide; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; pyrethroid; unclassified drug; diphenyl ether derivative; pesticide; polychlorinated biphenyl; concentration (composition); correlation; epidemiology; health impact; health risk; organic pollutant; pollution effect; pollution exposure; adult; aging; Article; cohort analysis; concentration (parameter); demography; extraction; female; gestational weight gain; human; human tissue; mass fragmentography; meconium; obstetric delivery; parity; persistent organic pollutant; physical chemistry; placenta tissue; prenatal exposure; priority journal; selective pressurized liquid extraction; smoking habit; solid phase extraction; Spain; university hospital; chemistry; infant; meconium; newborn; placenta; pollutant; pregnancy; tandem mass spectrometry; Spain; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Meconium; Pesticides; Placenta; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Spain; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084254798

An investigation of the driving factors of China's transport energy-related CO2 emissions has great importance for clarifying the “gains” and “losses” as well as the future focuses of CO2 emissions emission reduction in this sector. Existing studies on the driving factors of transport CO2 emissions in China fail to incorporate effects of technology and efficiency into decomposition analysis framework. Based on the provincial panel data of China's transportation industry for the period of 2004–2016, this paper uses a comprehensive decomposition framework, which combines the logarithmic mean Divisia index method (LMDI) and production-theoretical decomposition analysis (PDA), to decompose China's transport CO2 emissions into nine components: emission factor effect, energy structure effect, scale effect, regional structure effect, energy-saving technology effect, production technology effect, energy efficiency effect, production efficiency effect, and potential energy intensity effect. The main results indicate that: (1) during the sample period, China's transport industry witnessed 498.998 million tons (Mt) CO2 emissions growth. Scale effect was the largest contributor, followed by production technology, energy-saving technology, and energy structure; (2) the improvement of energy efficiency and production efficiency, the decline of electricity's emission factor, and regional structure adjustment played active roles in the CO2 emission reduction of transportation industry; (3) the performance of various driving factors varies greatly in different provinces.

Contrary to expectation, the average concentrations of both the PM2.5 and the PM10 were markedly higher during the former, increasing by 20.5% and 15.7%, respectively, for the first month of the outbreak (20 February–19 March 2020) and by 23.5% and 20.0% for the subsequent Nowruz New Year holidays (from late March till early April), which resulted in overall increases of 20.5% and 16.5% for the entire period. The non-integrated responses to the pandemic, including the failure to close administrative centers and, in particular, the recommendation to maintain social distancing by reducing public transportation use (prompting citizens to travel by private vehicle), have worsened the ambient air quality in Tehran, providing an exceptional opportunity to evaluate the direct/indirect influence of air quality policies and emission control measures on PM2.5 and PM10.

This study investigated the influence of the host plant and climate in the seasonal dynamics of the DBM and the within-plant distribution of DBM in the most cultivated cole crops in Southeast Brazil (broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower). Broccoli and cauliflower presented the highest and lowest DBM abundances, respectively. Temperature and relative humidity were negatively related to the pest occurrence, indicating that high temperature and humidity are limiting for this pest in the study region.

Vegetation cover evolution near WWTPs was also analysed using satellite images (Landsat TM and OLI). Six WWTP were evaluated based on treated water quality and a survey of nearby farmers and residents. Results showed treated wastewater is in line with Moroccan standards, and can be reused for irrigation and aquaculture without harmful effects. The survey pointed to the Boujaad WWTP as a model in the region. The vegetation cover evolution before and after WWTP existence showed an important improvement of cultivated lands.

However, recent research suggests that edaphic factors and plant functional traits may play a more important role than previously expected. In this study, we investigated how biotic and abiotic factors interacted with litter quality by analyzing decomposition rates for two forms of standardized litter substitutes: green tea (high-quality litter) and red tea (low-quality litter). We placed 1188 teabags at two different positions (forest floor and 8 cm deep) across 99 forest sites in France and measured 46 potential drivers at each site. We found that high-quality litter decomposition was strongly related to climatic factors, whereas low-quality litter decomposition was strongly related to edaphic factors and the identity of the dominant tree species in the stand. This indicates that the relative importance of climate, soil and plant functional traits in the litter decomposition process depends on litter quality, which was the predominant factor controlling decomposition rate in this experiment. We also found that burying litter increased decomposition rates, and that this effect was more important for green tea in drier environments. This suggests that changes in position (surface vs. buried) at the plot scale may be as important as the role of macroclimate on decomposition rates because of varying water availability along the soil profile. Acknowledging that the effect of climate on decomposition depends on litter quality and that the macroclimate is not necessarily the predominant factor at large spatial scales is the first step toward identifying the factors regulating decomposition rates from the local scale to the global scale. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon turnover; climate; decomposition; nutrient cycling; plant traits; soil depth; soil parent material; soil properties; tea bag index","decomposition; environmental factor; forest ecosystem; litter; tree; water availability; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074014225

An enhanced meta-modeling approach, polynomial functions based response surface modeling coupled with the sectoral linear fitting technique (pf-ERSM-SL), integrating a new differential method (DM), was proposed to break through the limitation. The pf-ERSM-SL with DM was applied for analysis of O3 formation regime and real-time source contributions in July and October 2015 over the Pearl River Delta Region (PRD) of Mainland China. According to evaluations, the pf-ERSM-SL with DM was proven to be effective in source apportionment when the traditional sensitivity analysis was unsuitable for deriving the source contributions in the nonlinear system. After diagnosing the O3-NOx-VOC relationships, O3 formation in most regions of the PRD was identified as a distinctive NOx-limited regime in July; in October, the initial VOC-limited regime was found at small emission reductions (less than 22–44%), but it will transit to NOx-limited when further reductions were implemented. Investigation of the source contributions suggested that NOx emissions were the dominated contributor when turning-off the anthropogenic emissions, occupying 85.41–94.90% and 52.60–75.37% of the peak O3 responses in July and October respectively in the receptor regions of the PRD; NOx emissions from the on-road mobile source (NOx_ORM) in Guangzhou (GZ), Dongguan&amp;Shenzhen (DG&amp;SZ) and Zhongshan (ZS) were identified as the main contributors. Consequently, the reinforced control of NOx_ORM is highly recommended to lower the ambient O3 in the PRD effectively. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Nonlinear response; O3; O3-NOx-VOC relationships; Response surface modeling; Source contribution","nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; anthropogenic source; anthropology; detection method; nitrogen oxides; ozone; real time; source apportionment; volatile organic compound; ambient air; Article; China; nonlinear system; reduction (chemistry); river; sensitivity analysis; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; river; China; Air Pollutants; China; Environmental Monitoring; Ozone; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084261822

Previous studies have considered this problem for nitrogen (N) but have limited themselves to reactive N species (i.e. excluding N2) or have considered total N (including N2) but have been limited to regional or national scales. In this study the spatially-distributed total nitrogen (N) budget of Great Britain (GB) was estimated at a 1 km2 grid scale. The inputs of N considered were: biological N fixation; atmospheric deposition; food and feed transfer; and inorganic synthetic fertilizer. The outputs of N considered were: atmospheric emission; terrestrial denitrification; fluvial loss from the soil; gaseous emissions from sewage treatment plants; direct sewage flux loss; and groundwater loss. All pathways were considered over a number of years. This study constructed a spatially-differentiated total N budget for GB, which not only includes all major N pathways but also distributes the N budget to various land uses with a 1 km2 spatial resolution. The results showed that both sink and source areas exist across GB, although the majority of 1 km2 grid squares were identified as sources. Based on a mass balance model calculated for 2015, total N exhibited a net flux of a source of −1045 (±244) ktonnes N/year. The spatial N budget across GB ranged from −21 (±3) tonnes N/year to 34 (±5) tonnes N/year, where 66% of grid squares were source areas and 34% were sink areas. Urban and arable land use were predominantly source areas: 97% of total urban land use and 98.5% of total arable land use. 65% of grassland was a sink area.

However, regional drivers of BECCS sustainability and cost remain broadly unknown and the regional attribution of a global CO2 removal burden remains largely undetermined. This study explores the mechanisms behind cost-optimal BECCS deployment with evolving regional CO2 removal targets and energy sectors to provide insights into the ways in which different regional players will interact as a function of their bio-geophysical endowments and their ability to trade these assets. An important finding is that inter-regional cooperation—in choosing the right burden-sharing principle to establish regional targets—and collaboration—in trading negative emissions credits and biomass—are central to sustainably and affordably meeting these targets. This multilateralism in biomass and carbon credits trading constitutes important value creation opportunities for key providers of CO2 removal. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions mitigation and removal are both required to deliver on the “well below” 2°C target by the end of the century. While CO2 emissions budget allocation and trading of carbon credits have been discussed in the context of CO2 emissions mitigation, these concepts have yet to be defined for CO2 removal. As acknowledging bio-geophysical constraints acting to limit the extent to which individual countries can remove CO2 from the atmosphere, it is crucial to recognize the value of (1) allocating CO2 removal burdens in an equitable way and (2) inter-regional trading of CO2 removal assets to guarantee the fulfilment of global climate commitments in an affordable and sustainable manner. With bioenergy with carbon capture and storage as an archetypal CO2 removal method, and five regions of the world, this study aims at highlighting the importance of active cooperation and collaboration in delivering global CO2 removal. Removing CO2 from the atmosphere is needed in addition to deep mitigation of CO2 emissions. As not all countries possess the geo-biophysical assets to provide sustainable, permanent, and affordable CO2 removal, a cooperative and collaborative approach to CO2 removal, based on equitable burden sharing and CO2 sink trading, is needed to meet global CO2 removal goals at least cost. © 2020 The Authors","BECCS; bioenergy with CO2 capture and storage; collaboration; greenhouse gas removal; negative emissions; optimization","bioenergy; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; environmental assessment; greenhouse gas; optimization; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096650280

Merr.] yield variation in Pennsylvania. We studied 22 site-years over the 2016 and 2017 growing seasons in two regions. The average yields were 3.4 Mg ha-1 in 2016 (range 1.4 to 5 Mg ha-1) and 5.5 Mg ha-1 in 2017 (range 3.5 to 7.4 Mg ha-1). Solar radiation capture and water availability, both controlled by planting date, were the main predictors of soybean yield. Principal component analysis and Random Forest analysis revealed that the soil predictors of soybean yield were the content of zinc, copper, phosphorus, sulfur, potassium, as well as A horizon depth and total soil depth. The yield response to nutrients is likely a surrogate for a more complex response to animal manure additions. Soybean yield correlated positively with the ratio of soil respiration to soil organic matter, but did not correlate with the physical and biological soil metrics in the comprehensive Cornell Assessment of Soil Health (CASH). Saturated hydraulic conductivity (ksat) and root depth correlated with both soybean yield and each other. Thus, while planting date sets the maximum achievable yield, only soils having the most water and nutrient availability (manured soils with high ksat) expressed yields exceeding 7 Mg ha-1. The ksat appears to be a valuable indicator of soil condition that can be relevant well beyond its association with high soybean grain yield. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Saturated hydraulic conductivity; Soil health; Soybean; Yield limiting factors","crop yield; hydraulic conductivity; manure; soil property; soil respiration; soybean; water availability; yield response; Pennsylvania; United States; Animalia; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084733128

Each new law reduces annual carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 0.78% nationally in the short term (during the first three years) and by 1.79% in the long term (beyond three years). The results are driven by parliamentary acts and by countries with a strong rule of law. In 2016, current climate laws were associated with an annual reduction in global CO2 emissions of 5.9 GtCO2, more than the US CO2 output that year. Cumulative CO2 emissions savings from 1999 to 2016 amount to 38 GtCO2, or one year’s worth of global CO2 output.

These systems are likely to host neutron stars accreting mass at super-Eddington (supercritical) rates from their massive companion in high-mass X-ray binaries. Taking into account the spherization of the accretion flow in the supercritical regime, the beaming of X-ray emission, and the reduction of the scattering cross section in a strong magnetic field, we infer the ranges for the neutron-star surface magnetic dipole field strengths, beaming fractions, and fastness parameters in the PULX M82 X-2, ULX NGC 5907, ULX NGC 7793 P13, NGC 300 ULX1, M51 ULX-7, NGC 1313 X-2, and Swift J0243.6+6124 from a set of conditions based on a variety of combinations of different spin and luminosity states. Using the observed spin-up rates under the critical luminosity condition, we estimate the surface-field strengths in the ∼1011-1013 G range for all PULX. In general, the results of our analysis under the subcritical luminosity condition indicate surface-field strengths in the ∼1011-1015 G range. We argue that PULX do not require magnetar-strength surface dipole fields if beaming is taken into account, yet the fields are strong enough for the neutron stars in ULX to magnetically channel the accretion flow in supercritical accretion disks. © 2020.

Progress in innovation is one of the main measures that can be used to reduce carbon emissions. It is important to demonstrate the impact of innovation at the sectoral level, in terms of more realistic data on policy measures. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of innovation on carbon emissions on a sectorial basis for fourteen countries in the G20, for the period between 1991 and 2017. The selected countries are Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Mexico, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States for which data is available. The results show that the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis is invalid and, in the long-term, innovations did not have a statistically significant effect on the energy sector, transport sector, and other sectors. It was also found that while an increase in innovation in the industrial sector leads to a reduction in carbon emissions, an increase in innovation in the construction sector increases carbon emissions. Therefore, it can be recommended that, in addition to national policies to reduce CO2 emissions, specific policies should be implemented for each sector separately. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","G20 countries; Innovation; Sectoral carbon emissions","carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; emission control; G-20 country; innovation; Kuznets curve; policy making; Argentina; Article; Brazil; Canada; carbon footprint; economic development; environmental policy; France; Germany; India; Indonesia; Japan; Korea; Mexico; South Africa; Turkey (republic); United Kingdom; United States; South Korea; turkey (bird); Argentina; Brazil; Canada; France; Germany; India; Indonesia; Japan; Korea; Mexico [North America]; South Africa; Turkey; United Kingdom; United States; Argentina; Brazil; Canada; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; France; Germany; India; Indonesia; Japan; Mexico; Republic of Korea; Turkey; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083661599

Presently, it is not known in which inland waters on Earth a significant pCO2 reduction by phytoplankton is likely. Since detailed, comparable carbon budgets are currently not available for most inland waters, we modified a proxy to assess the pCO2 reduction by phytoplankton, originally developed for boreal lakes, for application on a global scale. Using data from 61 rivers and 125 lakes distributed over five continents, we show that a significant pCO2 reduction by phytoplankton is widespread across the temperate and sub-/tropical region, but absent in the cold regions on Earth. More specifically, we found that a significant pCO2 reduction by phytoplankton might occur in 24% of the lakes in the temperate region, and 39% of the lakes in the sub-/tropical region. We also showed that such a reduction might occur in 21% of the rivers in the temperate region, and 5% of the rivers in the sub-/tropical region. Our results indicate that CO2 uptake by phytoplankton is a relevant flux in regional and global carbon budgets. This highlights the need for more accurate approaches to quantify CO2 uptake by primary producers in inland waters, particularly in the temperate and sub-/tropical region. © 2020, The Author(s).","Chlorophyll a; CO2 dynamics; Global carbon cycle; Inland waters; Phytoplankton; Total organic carbon","carbon budget; carbon dioxide; lake ecosystem; partial pressure; phytoplankton; primary production; reduction; river water; temperate environment; tropical region; carbon dioxide; air pollutant; chemistry; environmental monitoring; lake; metabolism; phytoplankton; procedures; river; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Lakes; Phytoplankton; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086778063

The reason thereof is the lack of improved efficiency, which affects the organic semiconductors performance in many devices when compared with their inorganic-based counterparts. A recent peculiar idea of using heterostructures consisting of both organic and inorganic materials has become an auspicious solution. To this end, the ability to synthesize hybrid organic/inorganic semiconductors targeting different applications is of utmost importance. We hereby present a successful simple route to synthesize a stable homogenous hybrid organic/inorganic system consisting of zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) oligomers as the organic base, and Cadmium sulfide quantum dots (CdS QDs) as the inorganic part. The structural and optical characterizations of the prepared samples demonstrate new optical absorption transitions for the hybrids in the red region belonging to the ZnPc molecules, besides the original blue band absorption of the CdS QDs. This is combined with a reduced radiative emission of the whole system. Thus, the hybrid materials are capable of harvesting multiple frequencies within the visible spectra more efficiently than pure QDs, while relaxing non-radiatively rather than by emitting electrons or heat. These qualities favor the use of these hybrids as solar cell or thermal-power active materials. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",,"Cadmium sulfide; Environmental technology; II-VI semiconductors; Light absorption; Semiconductor quantum dots; Sulfur compounds; Zinc compounds; Absorption transitions; Cadmium sulfide quantum dots; Economic and environmental benefits; Organic semiconducting materials; Organic/inorganic semiconductors; Science and Technology; Structural and optical characterizations; Zinc phthalocyanines; Hybrid materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086783263

Specifically, we perform a scenario-based analysis on the IMF economic growth forecasts for 2020 and 2021 using a global multi-commodity agricultural market model. According to our results, the sharp decline in economic growth causes a decrease in international meat prices by 7–18% in 2020 and dairy products by 4–7% compared to a business as usual situation. Following the slowdown of the economy, biofuel prices fall strongly in 2020, followed by their main feedstocks, maize and oilseeds. Although the income losses and local supply chain disruptions associated with the pandemic undoubtedly has led to an increase in food insecurity in many developing countries, global food consumption is largely unaffected due to the inelastic demand of most agricultural commodities and the short duration of the shock.

Results show that top-down emissions derived in several recent studies exhibit similar uncertainty as bottom-up inventories in some regions for certain species and even less in the case of Chinese CO emissions. In general, the largest discrepancies are found outside of regions such as the United States, Europe, and Japan where the most accurate and detailed information on emissions is available. In some regions such as China, which has recently undergone dynamical economic growth and changes in air quality regulations, the top-down estimates better capture recent emission trends than global bottom-up inventories. These results show the potential of top-down estimates to complement bottom-up inventories and to aide in the development of emission scenarios, particularly in regions where global inventories lack the necessary up-to-date and accurate information regarding regional activity data and emission factors such as Africa and India. Areas of future work aimed at quantifying and reducing uncertainty are also highlighted. A regional comparison of recent CO and NOx trends in the five SSPs indicate that SSP126, a strong pollution control scenario, best represents the trends from the top-down and regional bottom-up inventories in the United States, Europe, and China, while SSP460, a low-pollution control scenario, lies closest to actual trends in West Africa.

Hence, climate action, both in terms of mitigation and adaptation to climate change, has become a priority for urban planning. This work introduces an example of the promising role that spatial analysis and statistical modelling, employing Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and freely available satellite and land-based data, can provide in supporting urban climate design and policymaking. In particular, this study puts special attention on the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon. Here, we first introduce a simple, but effective morphological-based approach for mapping potential ventilation corridors across cities of uniform built-up structure, as a common UHI mitigation measure. Then, we propose a methodology for assessing the relative role of these corridors in maximizing the impacts of green solutions upon lowering high temperature. Results show that even under very calm wind conditions, there is still an opportunity for maximizing the benefits of greening measures on the urban climate. Also, it has been demonstrated that green ventilation corridors are more effective during night-time when the UHI effect is peaked. The research findings are very promising, especially for cities where wind is a marginal potentiality. © Authors 2020.

Here we address knowledge gaps for NP foam in porous media by tracking the bubble density (nf) of NP foam data spatially and temporally using an established surfactant (SF) population-balance model. We suggest a reduced shear-thinning effect, compared to SF, to accurately model NP CO2 foam flow in both the high- and low-quality regime.

We considered measurements of emissions at different ambient temperatures and for various operating conditions regarding hybridization. The results show that the initial battery state-of-charge (SoC) determines the absolute CO2 emissions as CO2 emissions decrease with a higher proportion of electric driving. Therefore, the use of different hybrid driving strategies can have a strong influence on the overall fuel-saving potential. This does not apply to other pollutants such as NOx and particles, as the emission of these pollutants depends on the operating conditions of the internal combustion engine. RDE tests with a high proportion of electric driving show, in some cases, higher pollutant emissions than in tests with a low electric share. In general, the emission measurements done under real driving conditions show a higher variance compared to the test bench tests.

The paper studies HP and NEHS performance in residential buildings, under different climate conditions and energy tariffs, in six different European countries. Furthermore, a primary energy and environmental analysis is performed to evaluate if the use of HPs is more convenient than NEHS, based on different factors of the electric mix in each country. A specific HP model is developed considering the main physical phenomena occurring along its cycle. Open data from building, climatic and economic sources are used to feed the analysis. Ad hoc primary energy factors and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission coefficients are calculated for the selected countries. The costs and the environmental impact for both heating systems are then compared. The outcomes of the study suggest that, in highly fossil fuels dependent electricity mixes, the use of NEHS represents a more efficient decarbonization approach than HP, in spite of its higher efficiency. Additionally, the actual high price of the electric kWh hampers the use of HP in certain cases. © 2020 by the authors.

Here we test the impact of acidified pig slurry, untreated slurry, and mineral N–S fertiliser on soil dehydrogenase activity (DHA), microbial community composition (PLFA), soil pH, and SO4-S, NO3-N, and NH4-N content in the 0–20 cm layer in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plots in Estonia in a field experiment conducted in 2017 and 2018. The slurry was acidified with H2SO4 (96%) to reach the target pH of 6.0 (to imitate the in-storage acidification system). The soil was sampled twice each year: 2 weeks after slurry spreading and at winter wheat harvest. In both years, the spreading of acidified slurry significantly increased the SO4-S content in the soil. The level of SO4-S was remarkably higher 2 weeks after slurry spreading, then decreased towards harvest, but remained significantly higher compared to other treatments. Compared to the untreated slurry, the use of acidified slurry had no significant (p &lt; 0.05) effect on soil pH or NO3-N, and NH4-N content, nor soil DHA and microbial community composition. Only the relative abundance of Actinobacteria was significantly different between treatments, which is likely due do the added nitrogen in the NO3-N. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Acidified pig slurry; NH4-N; NO3-N; Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA); SO4-S; Soil dehydrogenase activity (DHA)","Acidification; Ammonia; Crops; Mammals; Microorganisms; Slurry pipelines; Soil testing; Soils; Actinobacteria; Effect on soils; Field experiment; Microbial community composition; Relative abundance; Soil dehydrogenase activity; Soil micro-organisms; Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); Soil pollution; field method; microbial community; microbiology; relative abundance; slurry; soil chemistry; soil microorganism; Estonia; Actinobacteria; Animalia; Suidae; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084186263

However, accurate measurements of atmospheric Hg, including temporal trends, are mostly limited to recent decades. Natural environmental archives including tree rings show promise for reconstructing atmospheric concentrations of Hg0. In this paper, we present a new white spruce (Picea glauca) tree-ring Hg record (1696-2005) from the Old Crow Flats in northern Yukon. The record we present shows an increase in tree-ring Hg concentration (a proxy for gaseous Hg0 concentration) between 1748 and 1990 at a rate of +3.3% per year. A decrease in measured Hg is observed at the end of the record between 1990 and 2005, which may reflect the success of international regulations to reduce emissions including Hg. When compared with two other sites (a continental and marine location) in northwest Canada, there is not only some coherence in Hg trends at the regional scale but also some unique differences, suggesting that the location may influence atmospheric Hg0 available for assimilation. Further local factors within a site, such as soil moisture, may also affect the efficiency of this uptake. Results from this study highlight the need to better understand intra-site and inter-site differences in measured tree-ring Hg, and we recommend the continued development of a spatially resolved tree-ring Hg network in the northern boreal forest. Such records will be useful for developing better atmospheric Hg and global Hg models.

Yet rigorous evidence on social and environmental outcomes of sustainable development policies remains scarce. We conduct a national-level analysis of Brazil’s flagship social protection program, Zero Hunger (ZH), which aims to reduce food insecurity and poverty. Using data from rural municipalities across Brazil and quasi-experimental causal inference techniques, we assess relationships between social protection investment and outcomes related to sustainable development goals (SDGs): ""no poverty"" (SDG 1), ""zero hunger"" (SDG 2), and ""health and well being"" (SDG 3). We also assess potential perverse outcomes arising from agricultural development impacting ""climate action"" (SDG 13) and ""life on land"" (SDG 15) via clearance of natural vegetation. Despite increasing daily per capita protein and kilocalorie production, summed ZH investment did not alleviate child malnutrition or infant mortality and negligibly influenced multidimensional poverty. Higher investment increased natural vegetation cover in some biomes but increased losses in the Cerrado and especially the Pampa. Effects varied substantially across subprograms. Conditional cash transfer (Bolsa Familia [BF]) was mainly associated with nonbeneficial impacts but increased protein production and improved educational participation in some states. The National Program to Strengthen Family Farming (PRONAF) was typically associated with increased food production (protein and calories), multidimensional poverty alleviation, and changes in natural vegetation. Our results inform policy development by highlighting successful elements of Brazil’s ZH program, variable outcomes across divergent food security dimensions, and synergies and trade-offs between sustainable development goals, including environmental protection. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Previous analyses of LUC impacts on soil C have focused on biophysical variables, leaving aside the influence of socioeconomics. The aim of our study was to determine global soil organic carbon (SOC) change patterns after LUC and to assess the impacts of both biophysical and socioeconomic factors that influence stocks of SOC after LUC simultaneously. This was done at a global scale using 817 sites from 99 peer-reviewed publications. We performed separate analyses for cases in which there were gains and losses of SOC. The best predictors of SOC stock changes were the type of LUC and predictors related to sampling depth, climate, biome, soil order, relief, geology, years since LUC, and primary productivity. However, also, socioeconomic variables such as indices of poverty, population growth, and levels of corruption were important. They explained 33% of the variability in SOC on their own and helped improve model accuracy from 42 to 53% when considered in combination with biophysical variables. SOC losses were highly correlated to the type of LUC and social variables, while SOC gains correlated most strongly with years since LUC and the biophysical variables. The analyses confirm that one of the biggest drivers of SOC loss is conversion to agroindustrial scale cropping, whereas with regard to the recuperation of SOC after LUC, the factor “time since conversion” emerged as the most important predictive variable, which must be better integrated in respective policy expectations. We conclude that policies should more than ever incentivize holistic approaches that prevent additional loss of native SOC, while at the same time promoting sustainable intensification of existing agricultural regions. Finally future investments on LUC to regain SOC should be aligned with efforts to alleviate poverty and corruption for their potential to achieve mutual gains in soil fertility and socio-economic parameters. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Biophysical; Global; Land use change; Socioeconomic context; Soil organic carbon change","carbon sequestration; continuous cropping; global perspective; holistic approach; land use change; soil carbon; soil fertility; sustainability",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088576044

Recent observations suggest that emissions from OS development contribute to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, but the chemical composition, mass fluxes, and sources of those emissions are poorly delineated. Here, we simulated OS extraction and used comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography to quantify and characterize direct air emissions, bitumen froth, residual wastewater, and tailings components, ultimately enabling fate modeling of over 1500 chromatographic features simultaneously. During the non-ice cover season, tailings ponds emissions contributed 15000-72000 metric tonnes of hydrocarbon SOA precursors, translating to 3000-13000 tonnes of SOA, whereas direct emissions during the extraction process itself were notably smaller (960 ± 500 tonnes SOA yr-1). These results suggest that tailings pond waste management practices should be targeted to reduce environmental emissions.

Here vegetation strongly interacts with climate and other environmental factors, such as herbivory and humans. Fire-enabled Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs) display high uncertainty in predicting the distribution of current tropical biomes and the associated transitions, mainly due to the way they represent the main ecological processes and feedbacks related to water and fire. The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of two state-of-the–art DGVMs, LPJ-GUESS and JSBACH, also currently used in two Earth System Models (ESMs), in order to assess which key ecological processes need to be included or improved to represent realistic interactions between vegetation cover, precipitation and fires in sub-Saharan Africa. To this end, we compare models and remote-sensing data, analyzing the relationships between tree and grass cover, mean annual rainfall, average rainfall seasonality and average fire intervals, using generalized linear models, and we compare the patterns of grasslands, savannas, and forests in sub-Saharan Africa. Our analysis suggests that LPJ-GUESS (with a simple fire-model and complex vegetation description) performs well in regions of low precipitation, while in humid and mesic areas the representation of the fire process should probably be improved to obtain more open savannas. JSBACH (with a complex fire-model and a simple vegetation description) can simulate a vegetation-fire feedback that can maintain open savannas at intermediate and high precipitation, although this feedback seems to have stronger effects than observed, while at low precipitation JSBACH needs improvements in the representation of tree-grass competition and drought effects. This comparative process-based analysis permits to highlight the main factors that determine the tropical vegetation distribution in models and observations in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting possible improvements in DGVMs and, consequently, in ESM simulations for future projections. Given the need to use carbon storage in vegetation as a climate mitigation measure, these models represent a valuable tool to improve our understanding of the sustainability of vegetation carbon pools as a carbon sink and the vulnerability to disturbances such as fire. © Copyright © 2020 D’Onofrio, Baudena, Lasslop, Nieradzik, Wårlind and von Hardenberg.","dynamic global vegetation models; fire; precipitation; savanna; sub-Saharan Africa; tree and grass cover; tropical forest; tropical grassy biomes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090000713

Comprehensive records of land cover land use dynamics in urban regions are essential for strategic climate change adaption and mitigation and sustainable urban development. This study aims to develop a Google Earth Engine (GEE) application for high-resolution (15-m) urban LCLUC mapping with a novel classification scheme using pan-sharpened Landsat images. With this approach, we quantified the annual LCLUC in Changchun, China, from 2000 to 2019, and detected the abrupt changes (turning points of LCLUC). Ancillary data on social-economic status were used to provide insights on potential drivers of LCLUC by examining their correlation with change rate. We also examined the impacts of LCLUC on environment, specifically air pollution. Using this approach, we can classify annual LCLUC in Changchun with high accuracy (all above 0.91). The change detection based on the high-resolution wall-to-wall maps show intensive urban expansion with the compromise of cropland from 2000 to 2019. We also found the growth of green space in urban regions as the result of green space development and management in recent years. The changing rate of different land types were the largest in the early years of the observation period. Turning points of land types were primarily observed in 2009 and 2010. Further analysis showed that economic and industry development and population migration collectively drove the urban expansion in Changchun. Increasing built-up areas could slow wind velocity and air exchange, and ultimately led to the accumulation of PM2.5. Our implement of pan-sharpened Landsat images facilitates the wall-to-wall mapping of temporal land dynamics at high spatial resolution. The primary use of GEE for mapping urban land makes it replicable and transferable by other users. This approach is a first crucial step towards understanding the drivers of change and supporting better decision-making for sustainable urban development and climate change mitigation. © 2020 by the authors.","Land cover land use change; Landsat; Northeast China; Pan-sharpening; Urban environment; Urbanization","Air; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Economics; Expansion; Land use; Mapping; Population dynamics; Urban growth; Walls (structural partitions); Classification scheme; Climate change mitigation; Global climate changes; High spatial resolution; Industry development; Land cover land use; Land cover land use changes; Sustainable urban development; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089544093

Excess Nr loss negatively affects environment and human health. Compared with large-scale studies, greater attention should be paid to the urban system as a burgeoning and important Nr creation source. In this study, we investigated the anthropogenic effects on urban Nr inputs (1995–2015) and assessed the potential to mitigate Nr pollution in Guangzhou, China. Here, we show that compared to the national level, the Nr input structure in urban systems is greatly dependent on external Nr inputs, massive Nr emissions during fossil fuel combustion and increasing Haber-Bosch N fixation associated with industrial synthetic production. The relatively slow increase in Nr inputs with rapid GDP growth shows a decoupling of N with economic development. Under baseline conditions, Nr inputs in 2050 can be assumed to rise to 112–138% of the 2015 value. Under the mitigation scenario involving reducing Nr emissions from fossil fuel combustion, increasing recycling rate of industrial N, controlling per capita demand for food and materials and improving N use efficiency, the Nr pollution possibly decreases to 52–64% of the 2015 levels. The combined mitigation scenario suggests that the biophysical potential for a sustainable future for urban Nr use exists. This study provides decision-makers with a novel view and rational strategies for urban N management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropogenic disturbance; Mitigation potential; Nitrogen input; Reactive nitrogen; Urban system","Combustion; Decision making; Fossil fuels; Industrial emissions; Nitrogen; Synthetic fuels; Anthropogenic effects; Base-line conditions; Fossil fuel combustion; Guangzhou , China; Large-scale studies; Nitrogen pollution; Per capita demand; Reactive nitrogen; Pollution control; fossil fuel; nitrogen; anthropogenic effect; combustion; fossil fuel; human activity; nitrogen; pollution control; recycling; urban pollution; Article; carbon footprint; China; combustion; controlled study; economic development; gross national product; human activities; industrial production; nitrogen cycle; nitrogen fixation; pollution; population growth; recycling; socioeconomics; urban area; urbanization; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083487066

Fully considering the potential heterogeneity and asymmetry, the two-step panel quantile regression approach is utilized. Also, to test the mediation impact mechanism between natural gas infrastructure and CO2 emissions, this study then analyzes the three major mediation effects of natural gas infrastructure on China's CO2 emissions (i.e., scale effect, technique effect, and structure effect). The empirical results indicate that expansion of the natural gas infrastructure can effectively mitigate China's CO2 emissions; however, this impact is significantly heterogeneous and asymmetric across quantiles. Furthermore, through analyzing the mediation impact mechanism, the natural gas infrastructure can indirectly affect CO2 emissions in China through the scale effect (i.e., gas population and economic effects) and structure effect (i.e., energy structure effect). Conversely, the technique effect (i.e., energy intensity effect) brought by natural gas infrastructure on CO2 emissions in China has not been significant so far.

This study first reports on the gaseous/particulate phases of chlorine emissions from typical integrated steel industries, including the major manufacturing processes (i.e., sintering, ironmaking, and steelmaking) and self-owned coal-fired power plant (CFPP). The concentration of chlorine species emitted from the ironmaking/steelmaking processes and the self-owned CFPP is very low (&lt;1 mg/Nm3). Owing to the combustion of chlorine-rich sinter raw materials, the sintering processes emitted unexpectedly high concentrations of chlorinated substances, including chlorinated very short-lived CH3Cl, CH2Cl2, C2H5Cl, and C2H4Cl2. Flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems equipped on the sintering processes can slightly reduce chlorinated hydrocarbons emissions (ClVOCs). However, the chlorine species bonded in filterable/condensable particulate states (ClFPM/ClCPM) can be removed by high efficient systems (with efficiencies of 64.8–94.1% for ClFPM and 97.3–98.5% for ClCPM), relying on employed FGD technology. Owing to rapid rate at which FGD systems have been installed in China, ClInorganic gases, ClCPM, and ClFPM emissions from the sintering and iron industry in 2016 were reduced by 75.3%, 82.7%, and 45.6%, respectively. Our results indicate that the current ultralow-emission equipment facilitates the reduction in chlorine emissions from iron and steel industry, but subsequent retrofits should give greater consideration to the simultaneous removal of ClVOCs. ©2020.

However, ensuring energy security, affordability, and environmental sustainability remains a significant challenge for the future development of the sub-region. Here, we examine how the electricity supply can evolve into the future to meet potential emission obligations for the period of 2020–2040. A generation expansion planning model which is able to incorporate the reality of fuel shortages and fuel switching typical of a developing country's power system is used. In doing so, we generate a range of emission reduction costs that provide important benchmarks for the relatively under-studied sub-Saharan region and identify drivers of these costs specific to developing countries. Results indicate that the total discounted cost in expanding generation to meet the demand for all scenarios range from 13–17 billion US$, while the expected emission ranges from 99–189 mtCO2. Subsequently, the cost of meeting different emission targets up to 2040 was quantified for each scenario ranging from 11–39 US$/tonne, which could be used as a benchmark for comparison in developed countries. We find that discount rates, representing Ghana's access to capital, are a particularly important variable for developing countries. We find that lower discount rates can lead to more investment in capital intensive renewable energy in the long run but can also lock in an additional conventional generation investment in the short term. Sensitivity analysis of demand growth reduction shows that with a 1% growth rate, the requirement of generation capacity could be reduced by 84%, providing initial evidence for the benefits of investing in demand-side measures. The study provides data and policy recommendations needed to inform decision-makers in developing countries as well as a comparison point for identifying decarbonization costs internationally. © 2020 International Energy Initiative","CO2 emissions; Generation expansion plan; Mixed-integer linear programming; Renewable energy integration; Unit commitment","Decision making; Developing countries; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy security; Investments; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Conventional generation; Developed countries; Environmental sustainability; Generation capacity; Generation expansion planning; Policy recommendations; Renewable energies; Total discounted cost; Climate change; assessment method; climate change; cost analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy resource; future prospect; sustainable development; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085931958

The use of weather forecasts in place of local observations can extend early warnings by up to 1-2 weeks, allowing for greater proactive coordination of resource-sharing and mobilization within and across countries. Using 1 year of pre-operational service in 2017 and the Fire Weather Index (FWI), here we assess the capability of the system globally and analyse in detail three major events in Chile, Portugal and California. The analysis shows that the skill provided by the ensemble forecast system extends to more than 10&thinsp;d when compared to the use of mean climate, making a case for extending the forecast range to the sub-seasonal to seasonal timescale. However, accurate FWI prediction does not translate into accuracy in the forecast of fire activity globally. Indeed, when all fires detected in 2017 are considered, including agricultural- and human-induced burning, high FWI values only occur in 50&thinsp;% of the cases and are limited to the Boreal regions. Nevertheless for very large events which were driven by weather conditions, FWI forecasts provide advance warning that could be instrumental in setting up management and containment strategies. © 2020 EDP Sciences.

Marine microbes are an essential part of the marine food web and are a critical link in biogeochemical processes in the ocean, such as the cycling of nutrients and carbon. Despite this, the response of Antarctic marine microbial communities to ocean acidification is poorly understood. We investigated the effect of increasing fCO2 on the growth of heterotrophic nanoflagellates (HNFs), nano- and picophytoplankton, and prokaryotes (heterotrophic Bacteria and Archaea) in a natural coastal Antarctic marine microbial community from Prydz Bay, East Antarctica. At CO2 levels ≥634 μatm, HNF abundance was reduced, coinciding with increased abundance of picophytoplankton and prokaryotes. This increase in picophytoplankton and prokaryote abundance was likely due to a reduction in top-down control of grazing HNFs. Nanophytoplankton abundance was elevated in the 634 μatm treatment, suggesting that moderate increases in CO2 may stimulate growth. The taxonomic and morphological differences in CO2 tolerance we observed are likely to favour dominance of microbial communities by prokaryotes, nanophytoplankton, and picophytoplankton. Such changes in predator-prey interactions with ocean acidification could have a significant effect on the food web and biogeochemistry in the Southern Ocean, intensifying organic-matter recycling in surface waters; reducing vertical carbon flux; and reducing the quality, quantity, and availability of food for higher trophic levels. © Author(s) 2020.",,"biogeochemistry; carbon dioxide; dominance; flagellate; food web; grazing management; microbial community; nanoplankton; ocean acidification; prokaryote; recycling; top-down control; Antarctica; East Antarctica; Prydz Bay; Southern Ocean; Prokaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092612972

These “climate-development organizations” (CDOs) are found at different levels: from the international organizations of the UN system through national ministries to local governments and community organizations. Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have also been recognized as playing an important role in climate-development. To local CDOs in developing countries, however, this presents not only technology access and capacity issues but also strategic and governance challenges; the more so since–to date–there have been few frameworks on how CDOs could effectively build ICTs onto their interventions and governance. This paper advances a conceptual structure that provides CDOs guidance on how to build better “informational governance for climate-development,” based on arrangements, frameworks, coordination, and accountability. This framework presents questions that organizations can use to achieve better informational governance for climate-development. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate governance; climate mobilization; ICT4D; Informational governance; localization; Paris Agreement; resilience; Sustainable Development Goals","developing world; development strategy; governance approach; information and communication technology; strategic approach; United Nations",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073963049

In addition to its role in extension assessment and therapeutic planning, positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography provides useful functional information for the evaluation of tumour response. The objective of this article is to review published data on positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography as a tool for evaluating external radiotherapy for cancers. Data on positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography scans acquired at different times (during, after initial and after definitive [chemo-]radiotherapy, during post-treatment follow-up) in solid tumours (lung, head and neck, cervix, oesophagus, prostate and rectum) were collected and analysed. Recent recommendations of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network are also reported. Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography with (18F)-labelled fluorodeoxyglucose has a well-established role in clinical routine after chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancers, particularly to limit the number of neck lymph node dissection. This imaging modality also has a place for the evaluation of initial chemoradiotherapy of oesophageal cancer, including the detection of distant metastases, and for the post-therapeutic evaluation of cervical cancer. Several radiotracers for positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography, such as choline, are also recommended for patients with prostate cancer with biochemical failure. (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography is optional in many other circumstances and its clinical benefits, possibly in combination with MRI, to assess response to radiotherapy remain a very active area of research. © 2020 Société française de radiothérapie oncologique (SFRO)","Monitoring; Positron emission tomography; Radiotherapy; Therapeutic response","antineoplastic agent; choline; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; tracer; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; radiopharmaceutical agent; advanced cancer; biochemical recurrence; chemoradiotherapy; distant metastasis; esophagus cancer; external beam radiotherapy; follow up; head and neck cancer; human; lung cancer; lymph node dissection; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; priority journal; prostate cancer; rectum cancer; Review; solid malignant neoplasm; treatment response; uterine cervix cancer; adjuvant radiotherapy; diagnostic imaging; esophagus tumor; female; head and neck tumor; lung tumor; male; neoplasm; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; procedures; prostate tumor; rectum tumor; treatment outcome; uterine cervix tumor; Chemoradiotherapy; Esophageal Neoplasms; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Neoplasms; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Prostatic Neoplasms; Radiopharmaceuticals; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Rectal Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084980438

Currently, N. simulans in soybean is predominantly found in Argentina, but future changes in the distribution from both dispersal and range shifts due to climate change may affect soybean cultivation in southern South America. We developed a species distribution model to examine the distribution range of N. simulans. We compared the potential distribution of N. simulans under current and future projected climatic conditions in order to identify future areas of natural occurrence with ecological niche models using Maxent. Current records of N. simulans show that while the species is present in Argentina, and some areas of Brazil, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay, our models suggest that many new suitable areas will be available for N. simulans under climate change including other regions of Argentina, and southern Chile. Our results also predict potential future range shifts and distributions into Bolivia, but not Peru nor Brazil. In our model, seasonal trends in temperature were shown to have the greatest contribution to the potential distribution, whereas isothermality (i.e., temperature variability) was correlated to potential future distribution ranges. We conclude that current populations of N. simulans may be expanding its distribution range by diffusion (i.e., range expansion over generations at the margins of populations), and regions with potential future N. simulans distribution should be closely monitored. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The new generation of smart district heating and cooling networks, for instance, pledges efficient energy distribution, flexibility and low-carbon energy integration. However, in the literature it is hard to find comprehensive frameworks for the integrated setup and testing of smart control strategies. This paper defines and demonstrates a framework that involves all steps of the controller development for small-scale district heating networks: from conceptualization to prototype testing. The innovative controller prototype, which relies on Model Predictive Control and aims to minimize operating costs and/or energy, is demonstrated in three original case studies, one in a simulation environment and two in real systems of different complexity in operational conditions. Compared to the control approaches previously adopted, based on predefined rules and operator experience, the smart solution achieves 6% reduction in cost and up to 34% reduction in energy consumption while meeting user requirements. The fast replicability of the proposed integrated methodology can foster the transition toward the next generation of smart heating networks. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","District heating and cooling network; Dynamic simulation; Experimental case study; Library of energy system components; Model predictive control; Smart energy systems","Carbon; District heating; Energy utilization; Heating equipment; Model predictive control; Operating costs; Renewable energy resources; Advanced control technologies; Controller development; District heating and cooling; District heating networks; Integrated methodology; Operational conditions; Simulation environment; Smart control strategies; Controllers; alternative energy; conceptual framework; cooling; energy resource; fuel consumption; heating; integrated approach; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086435436

Nevertheless, from May to October, the valley still experiences numerous exceedances of the ozone health standard. As the standards are tightened, it is becoming harder to design policies to attain them. To better understand historical emissions reductions in the context of necessary future control efforts, we analyze 25 years of hourly measurements of ozone and nitrogen oxides concentrations for the hottest one third of days in Fresno using multiple linear regression analysis. We then analyze the changing dynamics of the weekend effect over the years in order to evaluate the growing importance of day-to-day carryover on ozone concentrations. A simplified model of the day-of-week pattern of ozone concentrations is used to explore the impact of same-day and previous-day concentrations. In addition to ozone, Ox (O3 + NO2) is used to distinguish reductions of atmospheric oxidants from short-duration exchanges between O3 and NO2. The analysis shows that there has been a significant increase in the importance of day-to-day carryover on ozone levels, and that consequently the ozone weekend effect in Fresno has changed over the last 25 years. In the 1990s, lower NOx on the weekend led to increased ozone on Saturdays and Sundays but levels of Ox remained constant. In the 2010s, lower weekend NOx led to reduced ozone on Saturdays, Sundays and Mondays showing that reductions in primary pollutants are sufficient to yield immediate decreases in secondary pollutants. Overall, the photochemical regime in the atmosphere has evolved such that carryover and regional pollution will be increasingly important in determining local ozone concentrations. Policies will therefore need to pay greater attention to regional emissions as local reductions may not be sufficient to meet the health standard. © 2020 Elsevier LtdCapsule: Meeting the ozone health standard in Fresno, California will require increased attention to regional emissions and to the day-to-day carryover of air pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carryover; Diurnal profiles; Multiple linear regression; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Photochemical regime; Weekend effect","Air pollution control; Air quality; Health; Linear regression; Nitrogen oxides; Carryover; Diurnal profiles; Multiple linear regressions; Photochemical regime; Weekend effects; Ozone; nitrogen oxide; ozone; nitrogen oxide; ozone; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; multiple regression; nitrogen oxides; ozone; photochemistry; pollutant; air pollutant; air quality standard; Article; atmosphere; California; circadian rhythm; concentration (parameter); controlled study; environmental policy; photochemistry; weekend effect; air pollution; environmental monitoring; periodicity; California; Fresno [California]; San Joaquin Valley; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Atmosphere; California; Environmental Monitoring; Nitrogen Oxides; Ozone; Periodicity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082182581

On March 16, the state's governor declared public health emergency in the city of Rio de Janeiro and partial lockdown measures came into force a week later. The main goal of this work is to discuss the impact of the measures on the air quality of the city by comparing the particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone concentrations determined during the partial lockdown with values obtained in the same period of 2019 and also with the weeks prior to the virus outbreak. Concentrations varied with substantial differences among pollutants and also among the three studied monitoring stations. CO levels showed the most significant reductions (30.3–48.5%) since they were related to light-duty vehicular emissions. NO2 also showed reductions while PM10 levels were only reduced in the first lockdown week. In April, an increase in vehicular flux and movement of people was observed mainly as a consequence of the lack of consensus about the importance and need of social distancing and lockdown. Ozone concentrations increased probably due to the decrease in nitrogen oxides level. When comparing with the same period of 2019, NO2 and CO median values were 24.1–32.9 and 37.0–43.6% lower. Meteorological interferences, mainly the transport of pollutants from the industrial areas might have also impacted the results. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon monoxide; COVID-19; Lockdown; Nitrogen dioxide; Ozone; PM10","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Carbon monoxide; Ozone; Viruses; Health emergencies; Monitoring stations; Movement of peoples; Nitrogen dioxides; Ozone concentration; Particulate Matter; Transport of pollutants; Vehicular emission; Nitrogen oxides; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; emission control; particulate matter; public health; viral disease; air pollution; air quality; Article; city; communicable disease control; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental impact; industrial area; infection control; lockdown; meteorological phenomena; pandemic; particulate matter; pollutant; pollution monitoring; pollution transport; priority journal; Rio de Janeiro (state); social distancing; air pollutant; air pollution; Betacoronavirus; Brazil; city; Coronavirus infection; environmental monitoring; human; virus pneumonia; Brazil; Rio de Janeiro [Brazil]; Rio de Janeiro [Rio de Janeiro (STT)]; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; Brazil; Carbon Monoxide; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral; Sulfur Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083821632

This study aims to identify major sources of PM and quantify effectiveness of possible control measures and strategies during these episodes. The Brute Force Method (BFM) with Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ) was implemented to estimate the contributions from major local anthropogenic sources on PM levels. In this regard several scenarios including the effect of existing governmental policies and regulations to upgrade vehicles emission standards were investigated. Emission due to the existing condition and future scenarios were estimated and effect of them on concentrations were modeled. Major local contributors were found to be transportation, energy and residential sources with the contributions of 64%, 15%, and 11%, respectively. The major governmental regulation to upgrade vehicles standard could led up to average of 35% PM concentration reduction during these stable weather episode. It is estimated that a set of scenarios could result in a goal of about 10% reduction in overall pollutant emissions, including both primary PM and precursor pollutants such as sulfate, nitrate and ammonium species. Our results show primary pollutants reduction led to average 8.4% reduction in aerosol levels, whereas precursor gaseous reduction could led to less than 1% PM concentration reduction.

Meeting the Climate Change Challenge (MC3) is the first longitudinal study exploring climate innovation in Canadian municipalities. A tri-university research collaborative, it focuses on British Columbia (BC), whose voluntary efforts to set and meet climate change goals were far more ambitious than those offered by the federal government (and almost any other province in North America at the time). These efforts included introducing a carbon tax and the Climate Action Charter voluntary agreement in 2007. Since then, 187 of the 190 local governments in BC have signed the Charter to take action on climate change. Research in the first phase of MC3explored the dynamics of innovative local responses to the coordinated suite of government legislation, complimentary policy instruments, financial incentives and partnerships with quasi-institutional partners. In the second phase, the 11 original case studies were revisited to explore the nature of transformative change in development paths and indicators of change. Methods include sentiment analysis, decomposition analysis of regional/local emissions, and modelling relationships between climate action co-benefits and trade-offs. This paper provides a synthesis of research outcomes and their implications for environmental governance at multiple scales and the potential of policy innovations to accelerate transformation towards carbon neutral economies. Key policy insights Local governments are on the front line of identifying indicators of change in current development paths and policy innovations to effect the necessary changes for transformation to carbon neutral economies. Barriers to transformational change include lack of coordination or concerted action across multiple scales of governance, electoral cycles and large swings in leadership, and lack of policy coherence across governance levels. Drivers of climate innovation include leadership at multiple levels of governance. Understanding the co-benefits (and trade-offs) of climate actions is important for integrated strategies that achieve broader sustainability goals, as well as accelerating more innovations on climate change. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change adaptation and mitigation; development paths; local climate action; local government","carbon emission; climate change; decomposition analysis; environmental management; greenhouse gas; local government; sustainability; British Columbia; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070992733

Hitherto, all studies have been conducted on a homogeneous-isotropic cosmological background, which is unable to consistently account for realistic distributions of matter, and for inhomogeneities in the Horndeski scalar field. Yet, the latter are essential for screening mechanisms. In this article, we comprehensively analyze the propagation of Horndeski gravitational waves in an arbitrary background spacetime and scalar field. We restrict our study to the class of theories in which gravitational waves propagate at light speed, we work in the geometric-optics regime, and we neglect scalar radiation. We find that kinetic braiding produces a nonphysical longitudinal mode, whereas conformal coupling affects the amplitude of the standard transverse modes but not their polarization. We confirm that any observable deviation from general relativity depends on the local value of the effective Planck mass at emission and reception of the wave.

Projections suggest that this share will increase, leaving millions of people with limited development prospects. Kenya's nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the 2015 Paris Agreement includes a commitment to expand power supply, and in doing so, provide all its citizens with access to electricity. Access in rural areas, where the majority remains unconnected, is planned to be reached through different technologies. These include mini-grids, which are expected to bring multiple sustainable development benefits. However, comprehensive studies looking at synergies and trade-offs between environmental, social, and economic impacts of mini-grids are scarce. Analyzing the expected contribution of mini-grids to targets such as the NDC and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) can provide evidence-based decision-support to policymakers, thus promoting well-designed and sustainable rural electrification policies. By using the Initiative for Climate Action Transparency (ICAT) Sustainable Development Methodology, this paper goes beyond the calculation of greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts resulting from access to modern electricity, analyzing also other environmental and socio-economic implications of 146 solar PV mini grids under construction in Kenya. Using specific targets from the SDG framework, the paper presents a combined qualitative and quantitative analysis of the extent to which mini-grids can contribute to the implementation of Kenya's NDC and to sustainable development priorities. Key policy insights The deployment of mini-grids is expected to lower the GHG emissions of the villages currently without access to electricity by 71%. This contributes to 0.4% of the current NDC target for the power sector, in line with the capacity of the systems analyzed. This action is expected to also bring about positive impacts on electricity access, indoor air quality, healthcare, education and economic activities, which are found to contribute to 16 SDG targets. Apart from the economic investment required, possible negative impacts are associated with the electronic waste generated at the end-of-life of the mini-grids. Accounting for sustainable development impacts of policies can increase support among policymakers for climate action, and ultimately raise ambition. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","mitigation pathways; nationally determined contribution (NDC); solar PV mini-grids; sustainability assessment; Sustainable development goals (SDGs); transparency","electricity generation; emission control; environmental economics; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; rural electrification; sustainable development; Sustainable Development Goal; trade-off; Kenya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088777199

A new configuration of CO2 heat pump system integrated with vapor injection and dedicated mechanical subcooling (VIDMS) is proposed, and compared with five configurations of CO2 heat pump system and three traditional heating methods. The life cycle model of energy consumption, pollutant emissions, and economic performance is developed. Assessment is conducted by taking seven typical cities located in different climate regions of China as scenarios. Coefficient of performance (COP) of VIDMS system is superior to other transcritical CO2 systems, and the COP is enhanced more notably in the case of severe cold or cold regions. The COP reaches up to 2.13 at the low ambient temperature of −20 °C, 36.51% higher than the baseline (BASE) CO2 system. The primary energy consumption (PEC) of the other five CO2 systems and coal-fired boiler (CFB) can decrease by 4.15–18.26% and 19.27%, respectively, when VIDMS is adopted. Moreover, the PEC reduction is more prominent when used in severe cold region. Life cycle climate performance (LCCP) decreases significantly by employing VIDMS compared with other transcritical CO2 systems and traditional heating methods. CO2 emissions can be reduced by 13.81–23.20% and 16.56–34.31% in contrast to BASE and CFB, respectively. Furthermore, the gaseous (NOx and SO2) and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) emissions also decrease. Life cycle cost (LCC) by using VIDMS is much lower than the other transcritical CO2 systems.

Air pollution may be associated with heart rhythm disturbances, but there is limited evidence regarding whether short-term changes in air pollution levels are associated with acute onset of AF episodes. METHODS: We screened 8,899 randomly selected 75-yearolds living in Stockholm without previously known AF for AF using home-based short-term ambulatory 1-lead ECG-measurements 2-4 times a day for 14 days. Screenings were carried out in 2012-2013 and 2016-2018. We used generalized estimating equations to quantify the association between PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and O3 obtained from a fixed monitoring station and risk of AF onset among participants with AF observed during the screening period, adjusting for temperature, relative humidity and temporal factors. We explored potential susceptible subgroups. RESULTS: Among 218 participants with 469 AF episodes we observed higher odds of AF following higher 24-hour mean levels of PM10 and O3, reaching statistical significance for PM10 levels averaged over the previous 12-24-hours [OR 1.10 (95%CI 1.01-1.19) per IQR of PM10 (7.8 µg/m3)]. In subgroup analyses, PM2.5 was more strongly associated with AF among participants with hypertension and PM10 and O3 were more strongly associated with AF among participants with diabetes and overweight. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that in an urban setting with relatively low levels of ambient air pollution, hourly changes in pollutant levels may increase the risk of acute episodes of both asymptomatic and symptomatic AF, especially among people with diabetes, hypertension or overweight.

Vegetation affects the Earth's O2 and CO2 levels in multiple ways, including preferential organic carbon preservation by decay-resistant biopolymers (e.g. lignin) and changing the continental weathering regime that governs oceanic nutrient supply and marine biological production. Over shorter time scales (≤1 Myr), land plant evolution is hypothesized to have occasionally enhanced P weathering and fertilized the oceans, expanding marine anoxia and causing marine extinctions. Oceanic anoxia would eventually become limited by oceanic O2 uptake as oxygen accumulates in the atmosphere and surface oceans when excess organic carbon is buried in marine sediments. Here, we review hypotheses and evidence for how the evolving terrestrial ecosystems impacted atmospheric and oceanic O2 and CO2 from the Ordovician and into the Carboniferous (485–298.9 Ma). Five major ecological stages in the terrestrial realm occurred during the prolonged time interval when land was colonized by plants, animals and fungi, marked by the evolution of 1) non-vascular plants, 2) vascular plants with lignified tissue, 3) plants with shallow roots, 4) arborescent and perennial vegetation with deep and complex root systems, and 5) seed plants. The prediction that land vegetation profoundly impacted the Earth system is justified, although it is still debated how the individual transitions affected the Earth's O2 and CO2 levels. The geological record preserves multiple lines of indirect evidence for environmental transitions that can help us to reconstruct and quantify global controls on Earth's oxygenation and climate state. © 2020 The Authors","Climate; Early land plants; Earth history; Oxygenation; Soils; Terrestrialization","Biopolymers; Carbon dioxide; Decay (organic); Earth (planet); Ecology; Organic carbon; Oxygenation; Seed; Submarine geology; Weathering; Biological production; Land vegetation; Marine sediments; Organic-carbon preservation; Stepwise increase; Terrestrial ecosystems; Terrestrial plants; Weathering regimes; Vegetation; accumulation; anoxic conditions; atmospheric chemistry; chemical weathering; interdisciplinary approach; oxygenation; paleoceanography; paleoclimate; Paleozoic; terrestrial ecosystem; Carbon Dioxide; Ecology; Oxygenation; Plants; Weathering; Animalia; Embryophyta; Fungi; Spermatophyta; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084959639

Ordinary Portland cement is used as binding material in concrete production. The manufacturing process of cement is accompanied with carbon dioxide emission. The use of green concrete as environmentally friendly material is very important. The local natural pozzolan (LNP) found in volcanic areas in Almadinah Almunawara in Saudi Arabia may be used as partial replacement of cement and sand to produce lightweight, environmental friendly concrete with special properties and improved mechanical properties. The main objective of this study is to investigate the effect of partial replacement of cement by weight with local natural pozzolan powder in cement mortar cubes to reduce carbon gas emissions and energy in the manufacturing process of cement. The study also includes the effect of partial substitution for sand used in cement mortars with (LNP) and with partial substitution for cement with silica fume on its mechanical properties. The use of pozzolan with special type of cement is recommended by the Saudi Building Code in case of concrete exposed to sulfate and / or chloride with severe exposure. The experimental work was carried out on 84 cement mortar cubes (50 mm in size). The specimens comprised two groups: cement replacement by weight with (LNP) powder at levels ranged from 10% to 40% and sand replacement by volume with (LNP) at levels ranged from 10% to 40% in addition to cement replacement by weight with silica fume at levels ranged from 0% to 10%.

In combating with this emission target, using the green power has becoming an important strategy in Beijing. Quantifying the effect of varies driving forces (including the adoption of green power) on carbon emissions will provide more accurate policy suggestions for carbon mitigation. Using the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method, this study 1) explore the driving forces of carbon emissions changes in Beijing during the 2010–2017 period, with special attention to the role of green power; 2) and analysis the emission reduction potential during the 2020–2030 period based on two scenarios. Results show that the main factor increasing carbon emissions in Beijing is the economic output effect, followed by the population scale effect; while the major factor decreasing carbon emissions is the energy intensity effect, followed by energy structure and emission factor effects. Beijing, characterized by gross energy consumption, has a high proportion of electricity which is transferred from other locations. In 2015, Beijing began to import green power, which has made a significant contribution to carbon reduction. Looking ahead to the future, imported green power is likely to become the most cost-effective means of reducing emissions. By harnessing green power, Beijing has the potential to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 30 million tons from 2020 to 2030, with an additional cost of about only 5 yuan/ton. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; Carbon mitigation; Decomposition; Green power; Impact factors","Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Emission control; Energy utilization; Carbon mitigation; Carbon reduction; Cost-effective means; Emission reduction potentials; Energy structures; Logarithmic mean; Policy suggestions; Reducing emissions; Carbon; carbon; alternative energy; carbon emission; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; emission inventory; energy use; environmental economics; policy approach; strategic approach; sustainability; targeting; Article; carbon footprint; China; cost benefit analysis; decomposition; economic aspect; energy consumption; policy; prediction; priority journal; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083815377

In pulque maguey, although reproduction by seed is not a common practice, its study is necessary. For this reason, the objectives of this study were 1) to evaluate the effect of organic and chemical fertilization on growth and 2) to determine the CO2 exchange rate (CER) in two conditions of soil moisture in three variants of A. salmiana (subsp. crassispina, var. salmiana and var. ferox) obtained from seed in San Bartolomé Actopan, municipality of Temascalapa, State of Mexico. The hypothesis was that plants treated with chemical fertilizer will have greater growth than those treated with organic fertilizer and the control, and plants fertilized with organic and chemical fertilizer will have a higher CER in two conditions of soil moisture. The experimental design was completely randomized with n=11 for growth variables, n=3 for nutrient content and CO2 exchange rate. Growth was measured every month in 2.9- to 3.6-year-old plants, and CO2 exchange rate was measured in 3.6-year-old plants with irrigation and in 3.75-year-old plants under water stress. Organic fertilizer from pig manure favored plant height and diameter and number of leaves. The subespecies crassispina had the highest values of the evaluated variables, and A. salmiana var. salmiana cultivated with chemical fertilization was outstanding for the number of shoots emitted. The highest CO2 exchange rate occurred between 22:00 and 02:00 h and was higher in plants with abundant soil moisture (irrigated) than in plants with moisture below permanent wilting point. In the latter condition, the plants grown with organic and chemical fertilizer assimilated 60% more CO2 than the control. © 2020.

Most integrated assessment models assume an expansion of agricultural land for cultivation of energy crops. This study examines the suitability of land for growing a range of energy crops on areas that are not required for food production, accounting for climate change impacts and conservation requirements. A global fuzzy logic model is employed to ascertain the suitable cropping areas for a number of sugar, starch and oil crops, energy grasses and short rotation tree species that could be grown specifically for energy. Two climate change scenarios are modelled (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5), along with two scenarios representing the land which cannot be used for energy crops due to forest and biodiversity conservation, food agriculture and urban areas. Results indicate that 40% of the global area currently suitable for energy crops overlaps with food land and 31% overlaps with forested or protected areas, highlighting hotspots of potential land competition risks. Approximately 18.8 million km2 is suitable for energy crops, to some degree, and does not overlap with protected, forested, urban or food agricultural land. Under the climate change scenario RCP8.5, this increases to 19.6 million km2 by the end of the century. Broadly, climate change is projected to decrease suitable areas in southern regions and increase them in northern regions, most notably for grass crops in Russia and China, indicating that potential production areas will shift northwards which could potentially affect domestic use and trade of biomass significantly. The majority of the land which becomes suitable is in current grasslands and is just marginally or moderately suitable. This study therefore highlights the vital importance of further studies examining the carbon and ecosystem balance of this potential land-use change, energy crop yields in sub-optimal soil and climatic conditions and potential impacts on livelihoods. © 2020 The Authors.

Flue gases released by thermal power plants are important contributors to these emissions and the scientific research community firmly engaged to find efficient carbon capture solutions. The post-combustion CO2 capture using amines is a leading technology, striving to continuously increase its efficiency and reduce its associated costs. Achieving these aims is progressively dependent on the flexibility of the carbon capture plant to cope with changes in its operation due to the power plant variable loading. Control systems have the potential and are responsible for fulfilling this task. The paper presents the design and assesses the performance of a 4 × 4 proposed decentralized control system intended to reject the most challenging CO2 influent flow rate and concentration disturbances emerging from the power plant, but also to satisfy the setpoint tracking ability demand. A previously developed complex model for the absorber and desorber columns was extended with a buffer tank and a cross heat exchanger meant to reduce the interacting effects between the columns and support the control system efficiency. The model was then scaled-up with the aim of building a novel simulation tool for an industrial scale carbon capture plant. Carbon Capture rate and Energy Performance indices have been selected as main metrics for evaluating the capture plant performance. Selection of the controlled and manipulated variables was based on a process analysis and the pairing of the control loops was conducted according to the Relative Gain Array matrix. The control system disturbance rejection performance was investigated considering the influent flow rate and CO2 concentration major disturbances, either with positive and negative slope ramp signals or with periodic changes and considering different testing scenarios. Setpoint tracking of the Carbon Capture rate ability was also examined. Simulation results revealed the capability of the decentralized control system to successfully reject disturbances, demonstrating zero steady state offset, reduced overshoot and short settling time control performance. Setpoint tracking also proved to be efficient. The synergic contribution of all control loops succeeded to achieve flexible control against the action of both ramp, constant or periodic disturbances. The proposed decentralized control system showed promising perspectives for the industrial implementation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Control strategies; Dynamic simulation; Flexible operation; Post-combustion CO2 capture","Amines; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Disturbance rejection; Flue gases; Greenhouse gases; Thermoelectric power plants; Energy performance indices; Environmental problems; Greenhouse gases emissions; Industrial implementation; Manipulated variables; Periodic disturbances; Scientific researches; Thermal power plants; Decentralized control; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; combustion; control system; decentralization; design method; gas flow; industrial emission; power plant; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086091912

A discourse of climate urgency had a substantial impact on perceptions, with CDR seen as offering too slow a response to the climate crisis. CDR also fails to reflect long-term hopes for a sustainable world, being interpreted as not addressing the root causes of climate change. A social license to operate may therefore depend on resolving these temporal dilemmas regarding both the short- and long-term implications of technology development. While research under well-controlled conditions is likely to be acceptable, at-scale deployment without corresponding efforts to reduce emissions may represent a red line for many people. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"bioenergy; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; chemical weathering; climate change; perception; public attitude; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088797858

This paper presents a research aimed at generating updated typical weather files for the city of Catania (Italy), based on 18 years of records (2002-2019) from a local weather station. The paper reports on the statistical analysis of the main recorded variables, and discusses the difference with the data included in a weather file currently available for the same location based on measurements taken before the 1970s but still used in dynamic energy simulation tools. The discussion also includes a further weather file, made available by the Italian Thermotechnical Committee (CTI) in 2015 and built upon the data registered by the same weather station but covering a much shorter period. Three new TWYs are then developed starting from the recent data, according to well-established procedures reported by ASHRAE and ISO standards. The paper discusses the influence of the updated TWYs on the results of building energy simulations for a typical residential building, showing that the cooling and heating demand can differ by 50% or even 65% from the simulations based on the outdated weather file. © 2020 by the authors.","Building energy simulations; Energy demand; Residential building; Typical weather year; Weather data","Electric substations; Weather information services; Building energy simulations; Energy simulation; Heating demand; Location based; Mediterranean climates; Residential building; Typical weather years; Weather stations; ISO Standards",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090097662

The collection and energy valorization at the local level of biomass from forest management practices and wildfire prevention cutting can be settled in protected areas to contribute to local decarbonization, by removing power generation from fossil fuels. Despite the evident advantages of bioenergy systems, several problems still hinder their diffusion, such as the need to assure their reliability by extending the operating range with materials of different origin. The Italian project ""INNOVARE-Innovative plants for distributed poly-generation by residual biomass"", funded by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development (MISE), has the main scope of improving micro-cogeneration technologies fueled by biomass. A micro-combined heat and power (mCHP) unit was chosen as a case study to discuss pros and cons of biomass-powered cogeneration within a national park, especially due to its flexibility of use. The availability of local biomasses (woodchips, olive milling residuals) was established by studying the agro-industrial production and by identifying forest areas to be properly managed through an approach using a satellite location system based on the microwave technology. A detailed synergic numerical and experimental characterization of the selected cogeneration system was performed in order to identify its main inefficiencies. Improvements of its operation were optimized by acting on the engine control strategy and by also adding a post-treatment system on the engine exhaust gas line. Overall, the electrical output was increased by up to 6% using the correct spark timing, and pollutant emissions were reduced well below the limits allowed by legislation by working with a lean mixture and by adopting an oxidizing catalyst. Finally, the global efficiency of the system increased from 45.8% to 63.2%. The right blending of different biomasses led to an important improvement of the reliability of the entire plant despite using an agrifood residual, such as olive pomace. It was demonstrated that the use of this biomass is feasible if its maximum mass percentage in a wood matrix mixture does not exceed 25%. The project was concluded with a real operation demonstration within a national park in Southern Italy by replacing a diesel genset with the analyzed and improved biomass-powered plant and by proving a decisive improvement of air quality in the real environment during exercise. © 2020 by the authors.","Biomass; Combined heat and power generation (CHP); Syngas","Air quality; Blending; Cogeneration plants; Conservation; Economics; Electric power generation; Exhaust systems (engine); Forestry; Fossil fuels; Microwave devices; Mixtures; Residual fuels; Bio-energy systems; Cogeneration systems; Engine control strategy; Experimental characterization; Forest management practices; Industrial production; Micro-combined heat and power; Ministry of economic development; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090044976

Six simulations were carried out using four different LSSs (Noah, NoahMP, CLM, RUC) for the period 2000–2010, driven by ERA-Interim meteorological reanalyses at a horizontal resolution of 50 km. Deviations of key surface climate variables, radiation, and turbulent fluxes from the different LSS runs are presented relative to the default Noah scheme. The simulated annual mean climate variables in the MENA (indicating uncertainty) range from 0.7 to 2.4 ∘C for air temperature, 2.0 to 3.4 ∘C for land temperature, and 5 to 25 mm/month (54–65%) for precipitation. The Noah scheme deviates less than − 1 W/m2 from the domain-wide surface energy balance and the NoahMP less than − 2 W/m2, while for CLM and RUC the deviation is 3–4 W/m2. Considering the differences among the surface energy balance from the various LSSs compared to the reference Noah, a surface climate response is calculated, and average LSS-induced climate sensitivity is derived for the air (and land) temperature of 0.1 ∘C per W/m2 and − 6 mm per W/m2 for precipitation. The LSS-induced range in the modelled climate is of similar magnitude to the climate change projection estimates for the region, which highlights the importance of carefully selecting a land surface scheme in the regional climate simulations. © 2020, The Author(s).","Land surface schemes; MENA; Regional climate model; Sensitivity; WRF","climate change; climate prediction; land surface; regional climate; sensitivity analysis; weather forecasting; Middle East; North Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086359306

However, no detailed microstructure characterization of this hydrocarbon play has been performed. An exceptional oil-prone level is determined through outcrop information, petrography, x-ray diffraction, geochemical analysis, and x-ray micro-computed tomography (mCT). Microscopic studies reveal a lenticular fabric and calcareous nannofossils suggesting high carbonate productivity in the water column and algal-derived organic matter. The high organic matter content points to anoxic-euxinic conditions consistent with pyrite framboids, authigenic fluorapatite, and an elevated concentration of redox-sensitive elements. However, burrows reveal the activity of infaunal organisms, thus rejecting the idea of persistent bottom-water anoxia. The bioturbated, calcareous plankton and carbonate-rich mudstone represents accumulation in a distal outer ramp setting with calcareous plankton blooms and the co-occurrence of benthic microbial mats. Bottom currents, probably as a consequence of storm-related processes, were involved in detrital transport and oxygenation pulses. A three-dimensional (3-D)-microstructure reconstruction reveals three main mCT density-dependent phases: (1) a low-density phase composed of organic matter and calcite, (2) an intermediate-density phase dominated by calcite and minor organic matter, and (3) a high-density phase composed of authigenic minerals (pyrite, marcasite, and fluorapatite) and silt-sized detrital quartz and plagioclase. This analysis showed that burial diagenesis did not create enough pore space to be evaluated through mCT and that besides mineralogy, particle-size distribution, particle arrangement (sorting), and the local compaction degree affect the 3-D reconstructed structure. The analyzed sample is located toward the carbonaceous end member of the shale spectrum and exemplifies new approaches for the characterization of carbonate oil shales in the unit and similar deposits. From the perspective of unconventional exploration, the evaluation of depositional and postdepositional controls on the resultant microstructure might contribute to a better understanding of potential target intervals within the Agrio Formation. © 2020.

The energy transition, though, is socially and politically complex, particularly where the transition is felt most viscerally such as in resource-dependent regional communities. In this paper, I explore the social-political dimension of the energy transition in Australia by analysing a specific episode of social-political conflict: a multi-week, moving protest against a large thermal coal mine currently planned for development in Queensland, Australia, Adani Mining's Carmichael Coal Mine. The contestation was related to an ‘Anti-Adani Convoy’ that travelled from the southern-most state of Australia, Tasmania, to the regional Queensland community, Clermont, nearest the proposed mine site in mid-2019. The analysis is grounded in the social psychology tradition of the Social Identity Approach, and applies a model for exploring how social context makes salient certain identities and norms (the Situated Identity Enactment model). Social identity dimensions are explored via qualitative coding of online news media reporting on the Convoy, and from this analysis identity-based insights are drawn regarding the social-political dynamics of the energy transition in Australia. The Convoy experience indicates that regional communities are unlikely to be convinced about the need for the energy transition––or decarbonisation specifically and climate action more broadly––by advocates from afar who adopt tactics that appear as a threat to one group from another group. Instead, the energy transition will be best served by place-based, bottom-up initiatives that are congruent with local identity, values, preferences, and priorities. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Coal; Intergroup relations; Mining; News media analysis; Social identity; Social movement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081261089

While examinations of the C-R relationship are designed to assess the shape of the C-R curve, they do not provide the information needed to quantitatively characterize uncertainty at specific PM2.5 concentrations, which is often needed in the context of risk assessments and benefits analyses. We developed a novel approach, using information that is typically available in published epidemiologic studies, to quantitatively characterize uncertainty at different concentrations along the PM2.5 concentration distribution. Our approach utilizes the annual mean PM2.5 concentration and corresponding standard deviation from a published epidemiologic study to estimate the standard deviation of hypothetical PM2.5 concentration distributions defined at 0.1 μg/m3 increments. The hypothetical distributions are then used to derive adjusted uncertainty estimates in the reported effect estimate at low concentrations (i.e., concentrations lower than the annual mean observed in the study). We demonstrate the application of this method in six individual epidemiologic studies that examined the relationship between long-term PM2.5 exposure and mortality and were conducted in different geographic locations worldwide and at different PM2.5 concentrations. This new method allows for a more comprehensive quantitative evaluation of uncertainty in the shape of the C-R relationship between long-term PM2.5 exposure and mortality at concentrations below the mean annual concentrations observed in current studies. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Risk assessment; Statistics; Epidemiologic-study; Geographic location; Long term exposure; PM2.5 concentration; Quantitative characterization; Quantitative evaluation; Threshold concentrations; Uncertainty estimates; Uncertainty analysis; concentration (composition); epidemiology; health risk; maternal mortality; mortality; particulate matter; pollution exposure; quantitative analysis; risk factor; spatiotemporal analysis; uncertainty analysis; article; concentration response; geography; human; mortality; PM2.5 exposure; quantitative analysis; uncertainty; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental exposure; epidemiology; mortality; particulate matter; risk assessment; uncertainty; United States; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Mortality; Particulate Matter; Risk Assessment; Uncertainty; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089711717

The first is to explain the geo-environmental determinants of the accelerated diffusion of COVID-19 that is generating a high level of deaths.

Using data on sample of N = 55 Italian province capitals, and data of infected individuals at as of April 7th, 2020, results reveal that the accelerate and vast diffusion of COVID-19 in North Italy has a high association with air pollution of cities measured with days exceeding the limits set for PM10 (particulate matter 10 μm or less in diameter) or ozone. In particular, hinterland cities with average high number of days exceeding the limits set for PM10 (and also having a low wind speed) have a very high number of infected people on 7th April 2020 (arithmetic mean is about 2200 infected individuals, with average polluted days greater than 80 days per year), whereas coastal cities also having days exceeding the limits set for PM10 or ozone but with high wind speed have about 944.70 average infected individuals, with about 60 average polluted days per year; moreover, cities having more than 100 days of air pollution (exceeding the limits set for PM10), they have a very high average number of infected people (about 3350 infected individuals, 7th April 2020), whereas cities having less than 100 days of air pollution per year, they have a lower average number of infected people (about 1014 individuals). The findings here also suggest that to minimize the impact of future epidemics similar to COVID-19, the max number of days per year that Italian provincial capitals or similar industrialized cities can exceed the limits set for PM10 or for ozone, considering their meteorological conditions, is about 48 days. Moreover, results here reveal that the explanatory variable of air pollution in cities seems to be a more important predictor in the initial phase of diffusion of viral infectivity (on 17th March 2020, b1 = 1.27, p &lt; 0.001) than interpersonal contacts (b2 = 0.31, p &lt; 0.05). In the second phase of maturity of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19, air pollution reduces intensity (on 7th April 2020 with b′1 = 0.81, p &lt; 0.001) also because of the indirect effect of lockdown, whereas regression coefficient of transmission based on interpersonal contacts has a stable level (b′2 = 0.31, p &lt; 0.01). This result reveals that accelerated transmission dynamics of COVID-19 is due to mainly to the mechanism of “air pollution-to-human transmission” (airborne viral infectivity) rather than “human-to-human transmission”. Overall, then, transmission dynamics of viral infectivity, such as COVID-19, is due to systemic causes: general factors that are the same for all regions (e.g., biological characteristics of virus, incubation period, etc.) and specific factors which are different for each region and/or city (e.g., complex interaction between air pollution, meteorological conditions and biological characteristics of viral infectivity) and health level of individuals (habits, immune system, age, sex, etc.). Lessons learned for COVID-19 in the case study here suggest that a proactive strategy to cope with future epidemics is also to apply especially an environmental and sustainable policy based on reduction of levels of air pollution mainly in hinterland and polluting cities- (having low wind speed, high percentage of moisture and number of fog days) -that seem to have an environment that foster a fast transmission dynamics of viral infectivity in society. Hence, in the presence of polluting industrialization in regions that can trigger the mechanism of air pollution-to-human transmission dynamics of viral infectivity, this study must conclude that a comprehensive strategy to prevent future epidemics similar to COVID-19 has to be also designed in environmental and socioeconomic terms, that is also based on sustainability science and environmental science, and not only in terms of biology, medicine, healthcare and health sector. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air Pollution; Airborne disease; Airborne Transmission; Coronavirus Infection; COVID-19; Disease Transmission; Epidemic Outbreak; Infection Prevention; Lung Disease; Opportunistic pathogen; Pandemic; Particulate Matter; Quarantine; SARS Coronavirus; SARS-CoV-2; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Transmission Dynamics; Viral infectivity; Virus Pneumonia; Virus Transmission","Diffusion; Dynamics; Epidemiology; Ozone; Sustainable development; Transmissions; Viruses; Wind; Biological characteristic; Environmental determinants; Environmental science; Human-to-human transmission; Meteorological condition; Regression coefficient; Sustainability science; Transmission dynamics; Air pollution; ozone; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; disease control; disease transmission; epidemic; infectivity; mortality; particulate matter; strategic approach; viral disease; air pollution; airborne particle; Article; city; coronavirus disease 2019; disease transmission; environmental factor; epidemic; human; industrialization; infection rate; Italy; meteorological phenomena; particulate matter; priority journal; quarantine; risk factor; virus infectivity; wind speed; air pollutant; Betacoronavirus; coronavirus disease 2019; Coronavirus infection; pandemic; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; virus pneumonia; Italy; Coronavirus; SARS coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Betacoronavirus; Cities; Coronavirus Infections; Humans; Italy; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; Pneumonia, Viral",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084059780

The provision of this climate information can help to decision-making and limit the economic and social damages caused by climate-related disasters. This product aligns with the concept of climate services, increasingly requested to help economic activities to achieve optimal performances. We employ use in our study of two sources of data: meteorological buoys (Redcos, Redex and Costeira) and citizen science data, specifically information mined from surfers reanalyzed, namely the information contained in the Glassy app for smartphones (GAC &amp; GAS). The surf spots are characterized using bottom type, surf break type and optimal wind (Owd) and optimal swell direction (Osd). Then, we define a surfing day as the ones in which optimal swell direction and waves bigger than 0.9m occur; using three parameters mean swell direction (Dmd), significant wave height (Hm0) and optimal swell direction for each surf spot (Osd) and compute the expected frequency of surfing days per year. Once this is done, we attempt to validate the approach taken to characterize a surfing day using buoys parameters (Hm0, Hmax, Tp and Dmd) and information about actual surf sessions for a small subset of our spots (i.e., Costa Tarragona). Our findings confirm that the area of western shore is the best suited for surfing, with over 300 days/year, followed by northern shore (300, 200 days/year) and southern and southeastern shores (&lt;100 days/year). We expect that these values may modestly contribute to a climate-informed planning and management of the surfing activities. © 2020 by the authors.","Buoy data; Iberian peninsula; Ocean waves observation; Significant wave height; Surf; Surf spots; Surfing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089997117

This work investigates the effect of spring soil moisture (SM) over the ICP on the following summer precipitation over the Yangtze River basin (YRB) during 1961-2010. The results show that the spring SM over the ICP has a significant negative correlation with the following summer YRB precipitation. However, this relationship experiences an obvious interdecadal change with a much stronger correlation in the epoch before the early 1990s (1961-91) than in the later decades (1992-2010). In spring, an abnormally lower SM over the ICP could induce less surface evapotranspiration, increasing local temperature until the summer. Before the 1990s, the resultant anomalous ICP heating raises the local geopotential height, resulting in an excessive westward extension of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH). Accordingly, the enhanced southwesterly summer monsoon would transport more moisture to the YRB, intensifying the mei-yu front and local precipitation. In the early 1990s, the East Asian summer monsoon underwent an abrupt change with an interdecadal westward extension of the climatic WPSH. Consequently, the similar abnormal ICP surface heating induced by the anomalous SM would have different influences on the monsoonal circulation, causing a much weaker effect on the YRB precipitation in the recent decades. © 2020 American Meteorological Society.

Trends in tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) can be an indicator of the effectiveness of national environmental policies to reduce NO2 emissions. A number of studies have focused on long-terms trends in NO2 VCDs, mostly relying on arithmetic means obtained from various satellite sensors. The results of such studies may provide limited insights due to the skewed measurement distributions. To analyze these whole data, this study used the lowest 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles (hereinafter referred to as B05, Q1, MED, Q3, and T95, respectively), as well as the arithmetic means, of NO2 VCDs over Northeast Asia (Northeast China, Southeast China, Republic of Korea, and Japan) retrieved from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) from 2005 to 2018. This paper presents in priority the trends for the means, B05 (background concentrations), and T95 (high concentrations) in tropospheric NO2. All three categories showed a reversal in their trends from positive to negative at about 2011. However, the absolute results from 2005 to 2018 show the following differences: the mean and T95 decreased (NE China: −0.04 and −0.34, SE China: −0.05 and −0.32, Korea: −0.02 and −0.16, and Japan: −0.01 and −0.24 × 1015 molecules cm−2 yr−1, respectively) while B05 increased (NE China: +0.07, SE China: +0.06, Korea: +0.03 × 1015 molecules cm−2 yr−1), except in Japan (−0.01 × 1015 molecules cm−2 yr−1). We ascribe this discrepancy to a significant increase in the background concentrations (B05) of tropospheric NO2 until 2011 due to intensive industrial activities in Northeast Asia. High concentration (T95) emissions, on the other hand, have substantially decreased since 2011 partly due to strict environmental regulations in the region. These findings require further elaboration in the future using diurnal variations of tropospheric NO2 VCDs from the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS), as well as the consideration of socioeconomic factors (e.g., economic growth/recession, environmental regulations, etc.). © 2020","Northeast Asia; Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI); Percentiles; Trend analysis; Tropospheric Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085954343

To date, efficient CO2 electroreduction to CO has been accomplished predominantly by using the control of the structural parameters of a catalyst, including its nanostructure and surface morphology. In this study, the highly selective CO formation (∼90% of faradaic efficiency) at a low applied potential (-0.4 V vs. reverse hydrogen electrode) is reported by using the control of the local pH near the reaction site, which has been of less interest compared to other factors in prior studies. The local pH near the reaction site was controlled by using a confined cavity in the Au wrinkle film. Experimental and computational calculation results revealed that such enhancement is mainly related to the few-micrometer-amplitude confined space in the tens of nanometers thickness Au wrinkle film.

On Mojave Desert pavement and biocrust substrates after experimental soil disturbance and carbon addition (1,263 g C/m2 as sucrose), we observed declines in lichens and moss cover in sucrose-treated plots. To further explore this unforeseen potential side effect of using carbon addition as a non-native plant treatment, we conducted biocrust surveys 5 and 7 years after treatments, sampled surface soils to observe if treatments additionally affected soil filamentous cyanobacteria, and conducted laboratory trials testing the effects of different levels of sucrose on cyanobacteria and desert mosses. Sucrose addition to biocrust plots reduced lichen and moss cover by 33–78% and species richness by 40–80%. Sucrose reduced biocrust cover in biocrust plots to levels similarly detected in pavement plots (&lt;1%). While cyanobacteria in the field did not appear to be affected by sucrose, laboratory tests showed negative effects of sucrose on both cyanobacteria and mosses. Cyanobacteria declined by 41% 1 month after exposure to 5.4 g C/m2 equivalent solutions. We detected injury to photosynthesis in mosses after 96 hour exposure to 79–316 g C/m2 equivalent solutions.

In this study, the estimation of the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) was performed for the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, where oil palm is the major crop. Three stations, namely Station 48603 (Alor Setar), Station 48620 (Sitiawan) and Station 48650 (KLIA Sepang) were selected representing different regions along the west coast. Estimation of ET0 using the popular and conventional Penman-Monteith (PM) model is data intensive. On the contrary, simpler empirical models such as the temperature-based Hargreaves-Samani (HS), mass transfer-based Romanenko and radiation-based Makkink models are less accurate, unstable and are greatly affected by local climate conditions. In order to solve the problems of the PM and other simple empirical models, the SVM was used to mimic the simple empirical models. The results of this study revealed that the HS and Makkink models were favorable for ET0 estimation at the northern region, whereas for the central region, the Makkink model was not suitable. Simple averaging of the empirical models improved the estimations. However, the model was still deemed to be poor as the MARE ranged from 0.087 to 0.099, with the R2 still being possible to dip below 0.900. It was found that the SVM could greatly improve the ET0 estimation. Unlike the empirical models, the regional factor had minimal effect on the ET0 estimation; where the SVM-Mak model performed better than the SVM-HS and SVM-Rom models over the whole study area. The best performance was achieved by SVM-Mak model at Station 48620 (Sitiawan) where the MARE was only 0.020 when compared to the chosen standard PM model. It was found that the simple averaging of the SVM models could further boost the performance, but such an approach was non-rewarding. The SVM models were found to be better alternatives for the empirical models when using similar inputs. The study concluded that the SVM model which imitated the Makkink model was suitable for ET0 estimation along the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Estimation improvement; Limited meteorological parameter; Reference evapotranspiration; Simple empirical model; Support vector machine","Agricultural robots; Evapotranspiration; Mass transfer; Palm oil; Support vector machines; Agricultural activities; Empirical model; Meteorological parameters; Minimal effects; Northern regions; Penman Monteith; Reference evapotranspiration; Regional factors; Climate models; accuracy assessment; climate conditions; empirical analysis; estimation method; evapotranspiration; farming system; performance assessment; support vector machine; water resource; Malaysia; West Malaysia; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086594283

To authenticate this claim, a survey was conducted in six districts of Bhutan, representing low- , mid- and high-altitude regions of the country from March to May, 2019. Based on the current research, we present farmers’ perceptions of climate change and its impacts on agricultural production, including the different coping strategies prevalent in rural communities. The study found that the farmers were well aware of climate change, although perceptions varied among the respondents. For most of the farmers, climate change meant unpredictable weather (79%), less or no rain (70%) and drying of irrigation sources (55%). Some farmers referred to climate change as the emergence of diseases and pests (45%), high-intensity rains (30%), less or no snow (24%) and shorter winter (11%). These climate change impacts were assessed to be responsible for 10–20% crop damages, resulting in crop losses to the tune of 8079–16,159 t and 7202–14,405 t for rice and maize, respectively. This is likely to affect the already low domestic food production of the country. Additionally, the study has successfully captured information on climate change adaptation strategies applied by the farmers. The most commonly observed ones were: the use of plant protection chemicals, improved varieties, increasing frequency of irrigation, land fallowing, off-farm works and improved management practices. Findings such as these are important towards the identification and formulation of an integrated sustainable and climate-proof farming support system. © 2020, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change; Impacts; Perception","Agriculture; Crops; Damage detection; Irrigation; Rain; Sensory perception; Adaptation; Agricultural development; Agricultural productions; Altitudinal zones; Climate change adaptation; Climate change impact; Impacts; Management practices; Climate change; adaptive management; agrometeorology; altitudinal zonation; climate change; climate effect; farmers knowledge; maize; perception; rainfed agriculture; rice; rural area; seasonality; Bhutan; Himalayas; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079463553

Therein, low–temperature anoxic combustion results in the emission of hazardous air pollutants. This study employed a dilution sampling system to conduct open burning testing on MSW samples from different functional urban areas. Additionally, modified combustion efficiency was used to distinguish smoldering and flaming combustion in two of the most common open burning practices in China: pile–up burning and barrel burning. The sampled pollutants included gaseous pollutants (e.g., CO2, CO, SO2, and NOx) and fine particles (PM2.5). This study also analyzed the carbonization compounds, 9 water–soluble ions, and 8 toxic heavy metals in PM2.5. Emission factors of air pollutants from open burning of different MSW compositions and burning modes were determined. The composition of PM2.5 from MSW open burning comprised average 43.9%, 22.5%, and 0.4% of organic carbon (OC), water–soluble ions, and toxic heavy metals (THMs), respectively. OC was found to be the primary component of PM2.5. Based on localized emission factor database, the emissions and source contribution of open burning of MSW in China were quantified. The open burning of MSW can contribute averaged 8.7%, 16.7%, 3.8%, 1.3% of PM2.5, OC, THMs, and gaseous air pollutants of reported emissions of anthropogenic sources, respectively.

Therefore, it is meaningful to perform an overview of possible climate change scenarios to provide appropriate strategies for climate change adaptation in the THP. In this study, spatio-temporal variations of climate data were mapped in the THP during 2000-2009, 2050-2059, and 2090-2099 periods using 14 research-grade meteorological stations and 19 bias-corrected General Circulation Models (GCMs) under representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios RCP 4.5 and 8.5. Results indicated different bias correction methods were needed for different climatic parameters and study purposes. For example, using high-quality data from the meteorological stations, the linear scaling method was selected to alter the projected precipitation while air temperatures were bias corrected using the quantile mapping method. At the end of the 21st century (2090-2099) under the severe CO2 emission scenario (RCP 8.5), the maximum and minimum air temperatures could increase from 3.9 to 10.0 °C and 2.8 to 8.4 °C across the entire THP, respectively, while precipitation could decrease by ~7.5% relative to the historical (2000-2009) observed data. However, large uncertainties were found according to 19 GCM projections. © 2020 by the authors.","Bias correction; Climate change; General Circulation Models; Maximum air temperature; Meteorological data; Minimum air temperature; Precipitation","air temperature; climate change; drought; future prospect; groundwater resource; historical perspective; precipitation assessment; scenario analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; water availability; Great Plains; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089339886

Results reveal that built-up land accounts for [88.62%, 99.64%] of total carbon emissions. Compared with other cities, the higher amount of carbon emissions occur in Chengdu and Chongqing, while the eastern region has a stronger carbon absorption capacity. Uncertainties in carbon-emission coefficient have significant effects on regional carbon emissions. With aid of interval-stochastic analysis for carbon emersions, it can help offset some of the mutual effects caused by differences between cities. The values of eco-carrying and carbon-emission coefficients are characterized as a feature of high to low from the east to west, and their highest values exist in Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture. There are slight variations in the regional average ESVs during the periods from 2000 to 2015, but a high sensitive coefficient occurs in grassland that has a significant influence on the overall ESV. Generally, a high regional economic performance corresponds to a high amount of carbon emissions and a low ESV, but variations in the proportion of cultivated and forest lands have slight impacts on carbon emissions and ecosystem services. Policy implications indicate that switching from coal to shale gas might be regarded as a potential approach for carbon-emission reduction.

However, there is a lack of real methodology on the measurement of interaction. Then, this article presents a method to calculate the interaction among multiple criteria, including static interaction and dynamic trend similarity, and to compute the weigh coefficient of each indicator induced by this interaction. In addition, the applicability of the proposed method is demonstrated by evaluating the sustainability performance of 14 cities in Liaoning province China in the context of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework. Our results show that the sustainable development of 14 cities in Liaoning province experienced dramatically downward and has a crucial condition from 2013 to 2017. Only Dalian, Shenyang, Panjin, Benxi, and Yingkou could be classified as a Good level (Level Ⅱ), and none of cities was an Excellent level (Level Ⅰ). From spatial-temporal perspective, regional disparities of sustainability are demonstrated by spatial distributions of city sustainability. In detail, the comprehensive sustainability and subsystem exhibit a “cold-spot in West” feature. The scores for indicators reveal that the shortage of science expenditure, declining investment in fixed asset, lack of economic growth, and lagging public transportation are the main limit factor faced by most cities. Meanwhile, tertiary industry development, energy efficiency improvement, increase green coverage, and reduce pollutant emissions are primary driving factors for improving sustainability.

Note that, through the analysis of total factor decomposition, this paper seeks the key points for the safe operation and emissions reduction of provincial highway transportation sector in China. The results show that the quantity of traffic accidents, CO2 emissions from highway transport sector, along with investment constitute important source leading to the inefficiency of highway transport sector in China. The static inefficiency values associated with conventional provinces whose value added growth relies on transportation is high. Regarding Luenberger productivity indicator, the reduction of traffic accidents has had a significant positive effect on total factor productivity (TFP), and has been slightly better than the weak positive effect of CO2 emissions reduction since 2006.

Global climate change has increased both the intensity and frequency of disaster events, causing serious impacts worldwide. Because most people and economic activities are clustered in urban areas, most studies focus on how to enhance the resilience of urban areas, often overlooking the practicable resilience in rural areas, especially in radically different areas, such as coastal and alpine areas. There should be a fundamentally different resilience approaches in areas with low population densities, weak institutional capacities, and limited financial feasibility. The application of local and indigenous knowledge as an adaptation strategy for climate change to achieve the goal of balance between humans and nature has also received considerable attention. Therefore, this study applied in-depth interviews in the coastal rural village of Guogou in Taiwan. The results showed that practices utilizing local and indigenous knowledge have helped locals effectively mitigate the impacts of disasters and encouraged residents to live in areas with high flood exposure. Overall, the application of local and indigenous knowledge in such rural areas might be a possible solution to enhance local resilience. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Local and indigenous knowledge; Resilience; Rural village",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081696988

In the paper, the development of waste electrical and electronic products processing field is analyzed, from which we find the shortcomings of the existing electronic waste fund operation in China. First of all, the paper analyzes the influence of household appliances dismantling fund on household appliances production industry by using partial equilibrium model, and finds that expropriation fund is not the main reason for enterprises to adjust their production and operation strategies and adopt ecological design. Through further analysis, it finds that the main reason for enterprises to adopt ecological design is firstly attributed to the public's increasing attention to health, and secondly to the environmental standards and sections issued by the government subsidy and other policies directly related to ecological design. In terms of the fund subsidies, DEA model is used to analyze the impact of fund subsidies on the dismantling and treatment industry. The model results show that fund subsidies are effective for the dismantling and treatment of 5 major electronic waste products. On one hand, they alleviate the loss of enterprises; on the other hand, they promote energy conservation and emission reduction, and improve the efficiency of dismantling. The economic benefit, environmental and resource benefit and social benefit of the fund of dismantling and processing enterprises are all affected by the fund subsidy. Finally, it gives policy implications. In order to improve the financial efficiency of the fund, it is suggested that in the aspect of fund policy management, we should appropriately improve the current fund collection standards, adjust the products and scope of the fund collection catalogue, and formulate differentiated collection standards for the products with different environmental protection performance, so as to realize the incentive and constraint of the fund collection on the production enterprises. In terms of the fund subsidy, we should further adjust the design of subsidy amount, establish a long-term subsidy performance evaluation system and a qualification examination mechanism for enterprises entering and exiting the subsidy list, ensure the effectiveness of fund subsidy distribution, narrow the gap in the fund pool, reduce the waste of fund subsidy, and achieve the unity of economic benefits, resources and environmental benefits and social benefits. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","DEA model; efficiency; financial fund; local equilibrium model; WEEE","Domestic appliances; Ecodesign; Electronic Waste; Emission control; Environmental protection; Planning; Public policy; Sustainable development; Waste treatment; Electrical and electronic products; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Environmental benefits; Environmental standards; Financial efficiency; Partial equilibrium model; Performance evaluation system; Production industries; Economic and social effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091250750

The results reveal that the policy has reduced the total carbon emission reduction by 13.39%, with an upward abatement trend annually. Secondly, a systematic framework containing technique effect, composition effect and allocation effect is proposed to further investigate the influencing mechanisms of the achieved emission curbing effect. It reflects that the policy has not yet promoted the low-carbon innovation completely, only innovation of high-quality played an effective mediating role. Meantime, two other influencing channels of industrial upgrading and optimized resource allocation are verified. Thirdly, policy's heterogeneous impacts are detected by classifying China into three representative regions according to economic and geographical differences, where western China experiences the strongest emission abatement by 21.57%, whereas central China and eastern China is 9.83% and 6.65% respectively. Fourthly, assessments of the regional influencing mechanisms show that the mediating role of high-quality low-carbon technology innovation is only significant in the western region, while the other two regions tend to have rebound effect. Besides, the promotion of industrial upgrading is positively related to the development levels of regions, with the improvement of 18.01% in the eastern region, followed by 17.34% and 12.46% in the central and western region. Finally, the optimization of the resource allocation has not been promoted regardless of the regions.

Previous studies mainly used climate indicators to analyze the variation of the potential NLWW in different historical periods, while little attention has been paid to the actual migrations and changes of the NLWW. The objectives of the present study were three-fold: (i) to map the spatial distribution of winter wheat in northern China in 2001, 2007, 2014 and 2019; (ii) to extract the actual NLWW; and (iii) to quantitatively explore the dynamics of the NLWW. First, we adopted the ""combining variations before and after estimated heading dates"" method to map the winter wheat in northern China based on time series MODIS EVI2 data. Second, we used the kernel density estimation algorithm to extract the actual NLWW in four historical periods. Finally, the fishnet method was utilized to quantitatively analyze the direction and distance of the spatiotemporal changes of the NLWW. The results demonstrated that the NLWW has exhibited a marked fluctuating trend of migration southward, with a 37-km shift in latitude over the past 20 years. The elevation limit of winter wheat planting was around 1600 m; however, the centroid of winter wheat planting has shifted slowly to lower elevations. There was a gap between the actual NLWW and the potential NLWW. The reason for this gap was that the actual NLWW moved southward under the interacting effects of human activities and climate change, while the potential NLWW moved northward due to climate change. The results of this study are of great scientific value in the formulation of winter wheat planting strategies in climate-sensitive areas to respond to climate change and ensure food security. © 2020 by the authors.","Crop mapping; MODIS EVI2; Northern China; Northern limit of winter wheat; Time series classification","Crops; Food supply; Radiometers; Time series; Climate indicators; Historical periods; Human activities; Kernel Density Estimation; Modis time series; Scientific values; Spatio-temporal changes; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089533740

However, the mechanisms of the latent heat transfer and coupling processes between the alpine wetland and atmosphere have rarely been investigated with a combination of land surface models. In this paper, the hydrometeorological factors are analyzed, the coupling degree is quantified, and the controlling factors are discussed. Alpine wetland has a hysteretic response to the net radiation, and the dominant factor controlling the latent heat flux is downward shortwave radiation (Rs), which intensely promoting the exchange of latent heat flux in the daytime. Biological control exercised by Rs is positive and decreasing with the increasing of Rs, while biological control exercised by water vapor pressure deficit (D) is negative and increasing with the increasing of D. The coupling degree is low from 9:00–17:00 when latent heat flux is mainly controlled by Rs and high in the early morning and 19:00 when D is the dominant factor.

In this study, we develop probabilistic projections of hydrological drought characteristics through a convection-permitting climate simulation and a multimodel hydrological prediction for two major river basins in South Texas of the United States. The probabilistic hydrological drought projection depicts the future evolution of spatiotemporal characteristics of droughts under best- and worst-case scenarios. Our findings reveal that there is a considerable variation in hydrological drought regimes near the urban area in South Texas. And the prolonged severe drought events are expected to be punctuated by the increasing extreme precipitation in a changing climate. This could lead to an increasing number of the dry-wet abrupt alternation events. Moreover, hydrological droughts are projected to occur more frequently for the fall season in the Guadalupe River Basin and for the winter season in the Blanco River Basin, advancing our understanding of future changes in seasonal characteristics of hydrological droughts at a river basin scale. © 2020.

Climate changes could alter precipitation patterns and hydroperiods in woody wetlands, resulting in a hydrologic shift along the low elevation gradient and change the productions of DOC and DBP precursors and their exports to source water. Here, we conducted an 80-week field decomposition study using fresh-fallen leaves along an elevation gradient, representing well-drained, relatively moist, and inundated environments, in Congaree National Park, South Carolina. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) yield and formation potential (FP) of trihalomethanes (THMs; a dominant category of studied DBPs) were 48.9–79.7 mg-DOC/g-litter and 2.23–6.57 mg/g-litter in the freshly fallen leaf litter, respectively. The level of leachable DOM and its DBP FP decreased with time, and during the first 16 weeks of decomposition, the decomposing litter served as an important source of leachable DOM and DBP precursors. Week 28 was a turning point for DOM optical properties, with fewer tyrosine/tryptophan/soluble microbial byproduct-like compounds and more aromatic, humified, and fulvic/humic acid-like compounds. Litterfall primarily occurred from September to January, while less precipitation occurred from October to January, indicating that large amounts of DOC and DBP precursors could be leached from litterfall in February. In the first 16 weeks of field exposure study, we observed higher residual mass and lower water-extractable DOC and DTN in more inundated environments, demonstrating that the shifts of DOM composition and DBP precursors if climate reduces rainfall in the southeastern US. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Congaree national park; Disinfection byproducts; Elevation gradient; Leachable dissolved organic matter; Litter decomposition","Amino acids; Biogeochemistry; Decomposition; Disinfection; Dissolution; Optical properties; Organic carbon; Water quality; Water supply; Wetlands; Disinfection by-product precursors; Disinfection byproducts; Dissolved organic carbon; Dissolved organic matters; Elevation gradient; Formation potential; Precipitation patterns; Source water qualities; Climate change; aromatic compound; chlorine; disinfection byproduct; dissolved organic carbon; dissolved organic matter; fulvic acid; humic acid; microbial products not classified elsewhere; natural products and their synthetic derivatives; organic carbon; rain; soluble microbial byproduct like compound; trihalomethane; tryptophan; tyrosine; unclassified drug; water; byproduct; climate change; digital elevation model; disinfection; dissolved organic carbon; humic acid; leaching; litterfall; water quality; Article; climate change; dynamics; environmental exposure; environmental impact; field experiment; humic substance; humification; hydrology; leaching; leaf litter; litter decomposition; mass; moisture; national park; nonhuman; optics; plant leaf; precipitation; precursor; priority journal; seasonal variation; South Carolina; water quality; water supply; wetland; woody wetland; climate change; disinfection; water management; water pollutant; water quality; wetland; Congaree National Park; South Carolina; United States; Climate Change; Disinfection; South Carolina; Trihalomethanes; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification; Water Quality; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085568633

To estimate the emissions from these organic constituents in on-site liquid storage tanks, studies were performed using the AP-42 model on data collected from 72,023 wells put into production using hydraulic fracturing between 2008 and 2014 in the United States. Results show that a total of 8.11 × 105 kg volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were potentially emitted from liquid storage tanks during fracturing operations, which was relatively low compared to other sources/activities in well fracturing. The median well emission roughly increased from 0.110 to 0.786 kg per well in 2008 and 2014, respectively, and was primarily due to the increase in the volume of chemical additives for fracturing one well.

The experiments were conducted by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Additionally, the performance, combustion and gaseous pollutant emissions characteristics were also performed. The results indicate that the carbon chain length of main compounds in light hydrocarbons sample is shorter and the volatile matter content is higher. TG/DTG curves of light hydrocarbons move to a lower temperature region compared to diesel, which is due to lower decomposition temperature and higher volatility of light hydrocarbons. The performance characteristics show that BSFC is higher and BTE is lower in light hydrocarbons PCCI engine compared to conventional diesel engine. The combustion and emission characteristics show that the in-cylinder peak pressure of light hydrocarbons PCCI engine is reduced by 18.1%, and the pressure rise rate and heat release rate present a consistent variation trend compared to conventional diesel engine. Light hydrocarbons PCCI engine exhibits higher THC emission with respect to different engine load, while CO and NOx emissions are lower. Compared with conventional diesel engine, the soot aggregate of light hydrocarbons PCCI engine exhibits more sparse, and it appears more chain-like.

Such a concept is attractive for CO2 electro-conversion to multicarbons (C2+), especially at high rates. Here, we show that a Cu-Ag tandem catalyst on a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) can enhance the C2+ production rate from CO2 through CO2 reduction to CO on Ag and subsequent carbon coupling on Cu. With added Ag, the C2+ partial current over a Cu surface increases from 37 to 160 mA/cm2 at −0.70 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 1 M KOH with no mutual interference between the two metals. Moreover, the intrinsic C2H4 and C2H5OH activity in the tandem platform is significantly higher than Cu alone under either pure CO2 or CO atmosphere. Our results indicate that the CO-enriched local environment generated by Ag can enhance C2+ formation on Cu beyond CO2 or CO feeding, suggesting new mechanisms in a tandem three-phase environment. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Electrochemical CO2 reduction (CO2RR) converts renewable electricity, waste CO2, and water into value-added chemicals. Of particular interest is the synthesis of multicarbon molecules (C2+), requiring complex multi-electron transfer pathways. One strategy is to divide the reaction into distinct steps carried out in tandem by multiple catalytic sites, independently tuned in local vicinity. We explore the catalytic behavior of such a tandem architecture for high-rate CO2RR in an alkaline gas diffusion electrolyzer. In this system, Ag converts CO2 to CO, which is then used for C2+ production on Cu. The CO-enriched atmosphere created by Ag results in a 4-fold enhancement of C2+ conversion on Cu without mutual electronic interaction. The tandem architecture also shows higher activity than pure CO conversion over Cu, suggesting new mechanistic advantages of tandem strategies. These insights inform future design of more sustainable electrolyzers in neutral electrolyte for high-rate CO2RR. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.Electrocatalysis of CO2 to valuable multicarbon molecules involves a complex reaction pathway. Here, a tandem strategy is employed to divide this pathway into two segments, each over a different catalyst, at rates approaching industrial relevance. We achieve a 4-fold enhancement of multicarbons formation rate with this Cu-Ag tandem architecture. Since no mutual interaction between Cu and Ag can be observed, this enhancement is attributed to local gas environment changes, which is further confirmed with co-feeding experiments. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","catalyst; CO2 electrolysis; Cu-Ag tandem strategy; high-rate multicarbon productions","Architecture; Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Catalysis; Catalysts; Copper; Diffusion in gases; Electrocatalysis; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrolytic cells; Molecules; Potassium hydroxide; Reduction; Synthesis (chemical); Electronic interactions; Gas diffusion electrodes; Local environments; Mutual interference; Neutral electrolytes; Renewable electricity; Reversible hydrogen electrodes; Value-added chemicals; Silver; carbon; carbon dioxide; catalysis; catalyst; copper; electrode; electrokinesis; hydrogen; silver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089468412

Data was collected from a bulk carrier during 2010–2016 covering both the Southern and Northern Hemispheres with high seasonal variability. Using the meteorological and wave models, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and WAVEWATCH III (WW3), numerical simulations of the weather and sea state were conducted for eight rough sea cases using the grid point value (GPV) datasets NCEP-FNL and ERA-Interim. Model results were validated by shipboard measurements and ship motion calculations. Results show a better performance of NCEP-FNL on generating high ocean surface wind speed of heavy weather than that of the ERA-Interim, while the ERA-Interim tends to perform better for generation of wind direction. Besides, utilization of a high-resolution WRF model tends to increase the accuracy of wind simulations for extremely high and low wind speed cases when compared to the linear interpolation of GPV datasets, which tends to perform better for relatively modest wind speed conditions. Results also suggest that, to achieve an optimum ship routing considering safety, cost and emission reduction; it should use the high-resolution WRF model with NCEP-FNL initial and boundary conditions to generate ocean surface winds, followed by the WW3 wave model to generate ocean surface waves for the most accurate performance in heavy weather. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","ERA-Interim; NCEP-FNL; Numerical weather and ocean simulation; Optimum ship routing; Rough sea navigation; Ship motion calculation; Shipboard measurements; WAVEWATCH III; Weather Research and Forecasting Model","Emission control; Numerical models; Ocean currents; Surface waves; Vehicle performance; Weather forecasting; Wind; Accurate performance; Comparative assessment; Environment friendly; Initial and boundary conditions; Linear Interpolation; Numerical approaches; Shipboard measurements; Weather research and forecasting models; Ships; comparative study; computer simulation; data set; model validation; navigation; numerical model; performance assessment; seasonal variation; ship motion; shipborne measurement; wave modeling; weather forecasting; Goose parvovirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086426345

Agitation can cause the release of dangerously high H2 S concentrations, resulting in human and animal fatalities. To date, there is no proven technology to mitigate these short-term releases of toxic gas from manure. In our previous research, we have shown that biochar, a highly porous carbonaceous material, can float on manure and mitigate gaseous emissions over extended periods (days–weeks). In this research, we aim to test the hypothesis that biochar can mitigate H2 S emissions over short periods (minutes–hours) during and shortly after manure agitation. The objective was to conduct proof-of-the-concept experiments simulating the treatment of agitated manure. Two biochars, highly alkaline and porous (HAP, pH 9.2) made from corn stover and red oak (RO, pH 7.5), were tested. Three scenarios (setups): Control (no biochar), 6 mm, and 12 mm thick layers of biochar were surficially-applied to the manure. Each setup experienced 3 min of manure agitation. Real-time concentrations of H2 S were measured immediately before, during, and after agitation until the concentration returned to the initial state. The results were compared with those of the Control using the following three metrics: (1) the maximum (peak) flux, (2) total emission from the start of agitation until the concentration stabilized, and (3) the total emission during the 3 min of agitation. The Gompertz’s model for determination of the cumulative H2 S emission kinetics was developed. Here, 12 mm HAP biochar treatment reduced the peak (1) by 42.5% (p = 0.125), reduced overall total emission (2) by 17.9% (p = 0.290), and significantly reduced the total emission during 3 min agitation (3) by 70.4%. Further, 6 mm HAP treatment reduced the peak (1) by 60.6%, and significantly reduced overall (2) and 3 min agitation’s (3) total emission by 64.4% and 66.6%, respectively. Moreover, 12 mm RO biochar treatment reduced the peak (1) by 23.6%, and significantly reduced overall (2) and 3 min total (3) emission by 39.3% and 62.4%, respectively. Finally, 6 mm RO treatment significantly reduced the peak (1) by 63%, overall total emission (2) by 84.7%, and total emission during 3 min agitation (3) by 67.4%. Biochar treatments have the potential to reduce the risk of inhalation exposure to H2 S. Both 6 and 12 mm biochar treatments reduced the peak H2 S concentrations below the General Industrial Peak Limit (OSHA PEL, 50 ppm). The 6 mm biochar treatments reduced the H2 S concentrations below the General Industry Ceiling Limit (OSHA PEL, 20 ppm). Research scaling up to larger manure volumes and longer agitation is warranted. © 2020 by the authors.

The impact of “C” stocks on climate change at different altitudes can have vital implications for the conservation and management of “C” sinks. This study was undertaken in subtropical belt of Tehri Garhwal, Uttarakhand, India, to understand the carbon-storing potential of Anogeissus latifolia tree and its soil properties in three altitudes, i.e., lower (LA: 790–824 m), middle (MA: 825–960 m), and upper (UA: 1168–1212 m), which provide fuel, fodder, and small timber for life support purposes. Results of the study suggested that soil moisture and pH increase with increasing depth and altitude, whereas SOC and soil nitrogen show reverse patterns. Moreover, bulk density (BD) does not follow any trend (i.e., BD increases with soil depth and altitude until 960 m and further decreases with an increase in altitude). Tree density, biomass, and carbon stock reported highest in MA compared with UA and LA because of dense forest and greater tree diameter. Looking into the soil carbon stock, nitrogen, C/N ratio (C/N: < 10), and climatic drivers supportive to microbial degradation, it is concluded that A. latifolia forest has played an important role in carbon reduction and mitigating climate change at regional and global levels. The study will help environmentalists, foresters, and policy-makers to stimulate the combined effect of degradation of forest species on climate change and socioeconomic development at regional and global scale. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Altitude; Biomass; Carbon sequestration; Forestry; Subtropical","Biodegradation; Deforestation; Economic and social effects; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Soil moisture; Carbon reduction; Climatic drivers; Combined effect; Forest species; Microbial degradation; Socio-economic development; Soil carbon stock; Soil property; Climate change; nitric oxide; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; organic carbon; rain; soil organic matter; carbon emission; climate change; environmental degradation; pH; policy making; soil organic matter; soil pollution; soil quality; altitude; Anogeissus latifolia; Article; biomass; bulk density; carbon footprint; carbon storage; case study; climate change; controlled study; economic development; environmental exploitation; environmental impact; environmental protection; humidity; India; latitude; longitude; nitrification; nitrifying bacterium; Nitrobacter; Nitrococcus; Nitrosomonas; nonhuman; sandy loam; socioeconomics; soil acidity; soil degradation; soil depth; soil moisture; soil temperature; soil texture; soil water potential; tree; Garhwal Himalayas; Himalayas; India; Tehri Garhwal; Uttarakhand; Anogeissus latifolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089237224

Here we combine 30 meter resolution global maps of aboveground woody carbon, tree cover, and cropland extent, as well as a 1 km resolution map of global pasture land, to estimate the current and potential carbon storage of trees in nonforested portions of agricultural lands. We find that global croplands currently store 3.07 Pg of carbon (C) in aboveground woody biomass (i.e., trees) and pasture lands account for an additional 3.86 Pg C across a combined 3.76 billion ha.

In the aspect of energy consumption, the energy varieties are subdivided and a random shock model is introduced to depict the declining trend of energy intensity in different sectors. In the aspect of industrial structure, CGE model is used to describe the trend of economic growth. The NDC constraints would affect the total economic output and energy consumption of various industries according to the emission reduction cost function in EMRICES. The results show that the global temperature would be 2.61°C by 2100 under NDC constraints, and it is still unable to achieve the target of 2°C warming. The global carbon emission mitigation should be paid to more attention. In terms of energy consumption, the proportion of nonfossil energy and natural gas consumption will be greatly increased. The change of industrial competitive advantage represented by location quotient shows that China's manufacturing competitiveness will decline, but its relative concentration and specialization level are still higher than the global average level.

The emission inventory was prepared from point source emissions of the power plant and two representative large-scale industries to differentiate the impact of the thermal power plant alone. Prediction of ground-level concentrations of air pollutants viz. SO2, NO2, and SPM was performed by the United States Environment Protection Agency‑approved air quality dispersion models, namely Industrial Source Complex-Short Term Version 3 (ISCST3) and American Meteorological Society/Environmental Protection Agency Regulatory Model (AERMOD). The spatial dispersion of maximum concentration for the sources of thermal power plant showed that AERMOD predicted higher concentrations near the source when compared with ISCST3 for daily averaging periods. The predicted ground-level concentrations of both the models with data from all the sources’ inventory were found to be similar to the predicted ground-level concentrations of both the models with inputs limited to the source emission data of the thermal power plant alone. The predicted concentrations by two models were compared with each other and validation of models was done with the actual observed concentrations at eight major receptor sites within the study area for the better model performance. The coefficient of correlation graphs suggested that the overall results of AERMOD predictions were better than those of ISCST3 predictions. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AERMOD; Air quality; GLCs; ISCST3; Meteorological data; Thermal power plant","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Forecasting; Sulfur dioxide; Thermoelectric power plants; Air Pollution Modeling; Air quality dispersion models; American meteorological societies; Coefficient of correlation; Environment protection agency; Ground level concentrations; Industrial source complex short terms; Maximum concentrations; Thermal pollution; air quality; atmospheric pollution; comparative study; emission inventory; meteorology; modeling; pollutant source; power plant; thermal power; India; Punjab [India]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081586479

The complexity of this natural phenomenon in the catchment area of the Ayda river located in the highlands of Siliana, Tunisia, is linked to a rather reduced vegetal cover because of the hardness of the climate and the anthropic actions. It covers an area of 7.30 Km2 drained mainly by Ayda river. It is characterized by moderately rugged terrain with a minimum altitude of 844 m and maximum of 1182 m. For slopes, they can be very strong by 70% but also in some locations does not exceed 6%. Several methods and models are commonly used for water erosion study. The revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) was chosen in our study. It is an empirical and spatialized model, based on the characteristics of the watershed, such as the slope, the vegetation, and the state of erosion of its soils and their protection. Integration of this model data with geographic information system (GIS) allowed us to establish an erosion risk map to quantify soil loss, target areas of high erosion, and direct erosion control measures. Each of these factors has been expressed as a thematic map. The resulting soil loss map shows a variation in the erosion rate value, between 9 t/ha/year downstream of Ayda river and a maximum value 330 t/ha/year towards land without vegetation and areas with high slope values mainly in the southwestern part of the basin at Djebel Barbrou and Kef Guedouara respectively, which are the most vulnerable to water erosion. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","GIS; RUSLE model; Tunisia; Water erosion; Watershed","erosion control; GIS; land degradation; Universal Soil Loss Equation; water erosion; watershed; Siliana; Tunisia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089476780

Climate data were hourly organized, PET index was established to determine the climate comfort, and these indices were classified according to the psychology diagram equivalent to the temperature. Later, the climate comfort maps obtained spatially were superimposed on the city settlements. It has been determined that throughout the city planning, people moved and developed a different way of life due to the temporal-spatial variation of climate comfort. This movement has gathered pace due to the effect of summer heat waves which is a direct result of urban heat islands and climate change.

Nevertheless, scaling issues can emerge in presence of carbonates and impact their efficiency. Even though a thermo-hydro-geochemical model demonstrated the impact of the water temperature on carbonate concentration, this conclusion has not been yet demonstrated by field investigations. To do so, an experimental ground source heat pump system connected to a standing column well was operated under various conditions to collect 50 groundwater samples over a period of 267 days. These field samples were used for mineral analysis and laboratory batch experiments. The results were analyzed with multivariate regression and geochemical simulations and confirmed a clear relationship between the calcium concentrations measured in the well, the temperature and the calcite equilibrium constant. It was also found that operating a ground source heat pump system in conjunction with a small groundwater treatment system allows reduction of calcium concentration in the well, while shutting down the system leads to a quite rapid increase at a level consistent with the regional calcium concentration. Although no major clogging or biofouling problem was observed after two years of operation, mineral scales made of carbonates precipitated on a flowmeter and hindered its operation. The paper provides insight on the impact of standing column well on groundwater quality and suggests some mitigation measures. © 2020 by the authors.","Clogging; Geothermal open-loop systems; Ground heat exchanger; Scaling; Standing column well; Water treatment","Calcite; Calcium; Equilibrium constants; Geochemistry; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Regression analysis; Water quality; Water treatment; Calcium concentration; Carbonate concentrations; Geochemical modeling; Geochemical simulation; Greenhouse gases emissions; Groundwater treatment; Multivariate regression; Standing column wells; Geothermal heat pumps; calcite; calcium carbonate; concentration (composition); emission control; groundwater; operations technology; precipitation (chemistry); water quality; water temperature; well",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090086009

Typical exhaust emissions, which include nitrogen oxides (NOx), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), soot, and particulate matter (PM), doubtless have important negative effects on the environment and human health, including cardiovascular effects such as cardiac arrhythmias and heart attacks, and respiratory effects such as asthma attacks and bronchitis. The mitigation measures comprise either the use of clean alternative fuels or the use of innovative technologies. Several existing emission control technologies have proven effective at controlling emissions individually, such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and leanNOx trap (LNT) to reduce NOx and diesel particulate filter (DPF) specifically for PM abatement. These after-treatment devices are the most profitable means to reduce exhaust emissions to acceptable limits (EURO VI norms) with very little or no impact on the engine performances. Additionally, the relative lack of physical space in which to install emissions-control equipment is a key challenge for cars, especially those of small size. For this reason, to reduce both volume and cost of the after-treatment devices integrated catalytic systems (e.g., a sort of a ""single brick"") have been proposed, reducing both NOx and PM simultaneously.

Thus, specific carbon sources may favor different respiratory processes. We profiled the influence of 94 carbon sources on the end products of nitrate respiration in microbial enrichment cultures from diverse terrestrial environments. We found that some carbon sources consistently favor dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA/nitrate ammonification) while other carbon sources favor nitrite accumulation or denitrification. For an enrichment culture from aquatic sediment, we sequenced the genomes of the most abundant strains, matched these genomes to 16S rDNA exact sequence variants (ESVs), and used 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing to track the differential enrichment of functionally distinct ESVs on different carbon sources. We found that changes in the abundances of strains with different genetic potentials for nitrite accumulation, DNRA or denitrification were correlated with the nitrite or ammonium concentrations in the enrichment cultures recovered on different carbon sources. Specifically, we found that either L-sorbose or D-cellobiose enriched for a Klebsiella nitrite accumulator, other sugars enriched for an Escherichia nitrate ammonifier, and citrate or formate enriched for a Pseudomonas denitrifier and a Sulfurospirillum nitrate ammonifier. Our results add important nuance to the current paradigm that higher concentrations of carbon will always favor DNRA over denitrification or nitrite accumulation, and we propose that, in some cases, carbon composition can be as important as carbon concentration in determining nitrate respiratory end products. Furthermore, our approach can be extended to other environments and metabolisms to characterize how selective parameters influence microbial community composition, gene content, and function. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"ammonium; carbon; concentration (composition); DNA; genome; metabolism; microbial community; nitrate; Escherichia; Klebsiella; Pseudomonas; Sulfurospirillum; ammonium derivative; carbon; nitric acid derivative; nitrite; breathing; denitrification; Ammonium Compounds; Carbon; Denitrification; Nitrates; Nitrites; Respiration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085092820

This study by considering the capital formation as a productive input of final consumer products estimates the carbon consumption of Chinese residents. Furthermore, it explores the driving factors of carbon consumption based on structural decomposition analysis. Results showed that the carbon consumption of Chinese residents (rural and urban) grew steadily. The annual carbon consumption by urban and rural residents increased at a rate of 9.94% and 0.81%, respectively. The average per capita indirect carbon consumption by urban residents during the period was 3.17 times of that by rural residents. Structural decomposition analysis showed that the structure of the urban and rural population and that of the total population are both critical factors promoting carbon consumption by residents, where the former is more powerful. The per capita product consumption caused an increase in the carbon intake of households, while the carbon emission intensity of industrial production decreased the carbon use. Although other factors also contributed to the increase in carbon consumption by residents, their role was comparatively less.

As a result, the Chinese government has implemented stricter policies and regulation to control air pollution. In this paper, the authors create a measure of government policies on air pollution by tracking all pollution-related government announcements in Chinese newspapers. The authors then use this variable, along with measures of actual pollution, to investigate how air pollution, industrial production, and government policies on air pollution are interrelated. The authors conduct this investigation nationwide, as well as in five large cities in China. A vector autoregression model suggests that, nationwide, government policies seem to decrease air pollution without significantly affecting industrial production. However, the effect appears to be short-lived, dissipating after a few months. In addition, the authors find that the dynamic relationship among these variables differs by city. For instance, following an adverse air quality shock in Beijing, government efforts to control pollution seem to have an ameliorating city-wide effect, decreasing local air pollution in subsequent months. In Shanghai and Guangzhou, while the local government reacts to adverse air pollution shocks, the ameliorating effects are not statistically significant. In Chengdu and Shenyang, the authors detect no significant local government reaction to adverse air pollution shocks. Moreover, in these cities, local government policies do not impart a statistically measurable effect on air pollution. © 2020, The Editorial Office of JSSC & Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Air pollution; government regulation; industrial output","Air quality; Deterioration; Public policy; Quality control; Regression analysis; Ameliorating effect; Chinese Government; Government efforts; Industrial production; Local air pollutions; Local government; Pollution regulation; Vector autoregression models; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085545295

The use of high-strength concrete (HSC) is an eco-efficient alternative concrete solution since it requires lower binder contents per unit of compressive strength. The objective of the present work is to propose a new mix design method for sustainable HSC wherein cement consumption and CO2 emissions are reduced in comparison to HSC designed using existing mix design methods. In the proposed method, the proportions between fine materials and aggregates are based on particle packing technics. The method was validated by producing a HSC using both silica fume and stone powder as mineral admixtures, as well as a mix of one fine and two coarse aggregates. The results indicate that a compressive strength of 104 MPa and a dynamic modulus of elasticity of 60 GPa were obtained with 336 kg/m3 of cement. This represents a cement consumption of only 3.2 kg to deliver 1 MPa of compressive strength. Notably, this value is lower than the values obtained in the literature for HSC, thus demonstrating that the proposed method enables the production of more sustainable HSC.

Climate-responsive design strategies through courtyards can help to moderate temperatures and reduce the thermal stress of its occupants. Thermal response inside courtyard is affected not only by its morphological composition but also by subjective factors. Thus, standardized thermal scales may not reflect the stress of the occupants. This study investigated the impact on thermal attenuation provided by a courtyard located in a tropical climate under extreme cold and hot synoptic conditions by means of local thermal sensation scales. Microclimatic variables were monitored, simultaneously with the application of a thermal comfort questionnaire, by using weather stations installed outside and inside the courtyard. The Modified Physiological Equivalent Temperature Index (mPET) was utilized to predict the heat stress. Calibration was conducted using linear regression to attribute particular thermal sensation votes to correspondent mPET values. It was found that thermal sensation can be affected by factors such as psychological, behavioral, and physiological. The courtyard's form provides a passive cooling effect, stabilizing interior thermal sensation, with attenuation peaks of 6.4 °C on a cold day and 5.0 °C on a hot day. Courtyards are an alternative passive strategy to improve thermal ambience in tropical climate, counterbalancing climate change. © 2020 by the authors.","Aspect ratio; Climate-responsive design; Courtyard; Insolation; Tempering potential; Thermal comfort; Tropical architecture","climate change; extreme event; microclimate; questionnaire survey; regression analysis; strategic approach; temperature effect; tropical environment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089395621

In karst systems, springs provide consistent flows and stenothermal conditions that buffer extremes. Our objective was to assess the impacts of spring discharge on instream temperatures, using the pristine Devils River in Texas as a case study, where climate change and groundwater development threaten to reduce spring flows and aquatic habitats of protected species (Devils River minnow and Texas hornshell mussel). Instream temperatures and discharge were monitored for three years above and below the Finegan Spring complex. These time series were extended back 30 years using temperature data from North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) land surface models. Monitoring data revealed that springs contributed ~40% of total river discharge. Spring temperatures were consistently 22.6 ± 0.3 °C providing thermal refugia to 200 m of river—cooling the streamflow in summer and warming it in winter, with a noted stratification overturning each winter. High correlations between NLDAS air and soil temperatures and instream temperatures allowed the water temperature record to be extended over 30 years. While air and soil temperatures increased 0.35 °C and 0.30 °C per decade, spring inputs from karst aquifer buffer downstream temperature increases to 0.12 °C per decade. Furthermore, spring discharge reduced the duration of extreme thermal habitat thresholds by 50–70%. A similar approach could be applied to other groundwater dependent ecosystems with sparse temperature data. The results underscore the importance of spring discharge in maintaining heterogeneous aquatic habitats in karst terrain. © 2020","Climate change; Fisheries; Groundwater dependent ecosystems; Karst hydrology; Refugia; Springs","Aquifers; Climate change; Groundwater resources; Landforms; Open hearth furnaces; Rivers; Temperature; Groundwater dependent ecosystems; Groundwater development; Karst environment; Land surface models; North american land data assimilation systems; Spring temperatures; Temperature increase; Water temperatures; Aquatic ecosystems; aquatic organism; aquifer; arid region; bivalve; climate change; cyprinid; discharge; karst; river discharge; river system; seasonal variation; spring (season); stratification; streamflow; thermal regime; Texas; United States; Dionda diaboli; Popenaias popeii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083813320

The leaf fossils were divided into 23 dicotyledonous leaf morphotypes and two unknown leaf morphotypes. The mean annual temperature results from LMA indicate 32.3 ± 1.17°C and CLAMP shows 21.2°C. CLAMP also provides temperature data of a warm month mean temperature (WMMT) of 27.4°C and a CMMT of 14.2°C, which is similar to the present climate. The mean annual precipitation is estimated by LAA to be ~ 125 cm. CLAMP suggests precipitation in the 11 months of growing period was 154.9 cm with the three wettest months having precipitation of 73 cm, widely contrasting with 15.5 cm for the three driest months. The precipitation shows the signal of the monsoon effect. The temperature, precipitation, and LSI mirrored the vegetation of the contemporary Doi Ton area which is a semi-evergreen forest in the tropical zone. The palaeoclimatic parameters of Doi Ton are in good agreement with those of south China and northwest India from the Eocene period and the present-day Mae Sot area. Moreover, the Doi Ton flora also closely matches the humid subtropical modern vegetation of south China.

To do this, initially, the emissions as a result of 435 trips of 19 ships engaged in domestic transportation in Izmir Bay were evaluated by the bottom-up method. The spatial distribution map was then compiled using the point density analysis through MapInfo v.16 software as a GIS instrument. The study revealed that annual emissions of PM10,CO2,NOx, SO2, and HC from domestic shipping were 601.5 t, 925.9 t, 62612.1 t, 22.0 t, and 61.2 t, respectively. In addition, the highest emissions as ton per daily trip were recorded in the cruising mode due to longer operation periods compared to the other modes. It was found that the lines between Pasaport, Alsancak and Karsiyaka piers are the most polluted routes due to dense ship traffic. Furthermore, Bostanli and Karsiyaka piers were determined as the points with the lowest air quality due to heavy traffic. We concluded that the ship emissions do not spread homogeneously throughout the region. In order to reduce the emissions in the area, the number of daily voyages and ship size should be optimized for passenger and vehicle density. The study also recommends installing emission monitoring stations at the piers to control air pollution. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bottom-up method; Domestic shipping; Geographic information system (GIS); Izmir bay; Ship emission","Air quality; Geographic information systems; Piers; Ships; Spatial distribution; Waterway transportation; Bottom up methods; Distribution of emissions; Emission monitoring; Evaluation methodologies; Operation period; Ship emissions; Spatial distribution map; Vehicle density; Air pollution control; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; GIS; mapping method; shipping; software; spatial distribution; traffic emission; Izmir Bay; Izmir [Turkey]; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086599465

The goal of this study was to investigate ecology, land-use and health associations of these pathogens and to make future disease projections. Methods: The rates of five acute gastrointestinal illnesses (AGIs) (campylobacteriosis, Verotoxin- producing Escherichia coli, salmonellosis, giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis) from 2000 to 2013 in British Columbia, Canada, were calculated across three environmental variables: ecological zone, land use, and aquifer type. A correlation analysis investigated relationships between 19 climatic factors and AGI. Mean annual temperature at the ecological zone scale was used in a univariate regression model to calculate annual relative AGI risk per 1 °C increase. Future cases attributable to climate change were estimated into the 2080s. Findings: Each of the bacterial AGI rates was correlated with several annual temperature-related factors while the protozoan AGIs were not. In the regression model, combined relative risk for the three bacterial AGIs was 1.1 [95% CI: 1.02–1.21] for every 1 °C in mean annual temperature. Campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis and giardiasis rates were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the urban land use class than in the rural one. In rural areas, bacteria and protozoan AGIs had significantly higher rates in the unconsolidated aquifers. Verotoxin-producing Escherichia coli rates were significantly higher in watersheds with more agricultural land, while rates of campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis and giardiasis were significantly lower in agricultural watersheds. Ecological zones with higher bacterial AGI rates were generally projected to expand in range by the 2080s. Interpretation: These findings suggest that risk of AGI can vary across ecosystem, land use and aquifer type, and that warming temperatures may be associated with an increased risk of food-borne AGI. In addition, spatial patterns of these diseases are projected to shift under climate change. © 2020","Canada; Climate change; Gastrointestinal illness; Health; Projections; Spatial","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Aquifers; Ecology; Escherichia coli; Hydrogeology; Land use; Protozoa; Regression analysis; Rural areas; Watersheds; Agricultural watersheds; Anthropogenic climate changes; British Columbia , Canada; Environmental variables; Food- and water-borne disease; Mean annual temperatures; Unconsolidated aquifers; Water-borne pathogens; Climate change; verotoxin; ground water; aquifer; climate change; disease control; food; land use; pathogen; spatial distribution; water; agricultural land; aquifer; Article; British Columbia; campylobacteriosis; climate change; controlled study; correlation analysis; cryptosporidiosis; ecological niche; environmental health; environmental temperature; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli infection; food poisoning; gastrointestinal infection; geographic distribution; giardiasis; human; infection risk; infectious agent; land use; major clinical study; medical research; priority journal; rural area; salmonellosis; univariate analysis; urban area; water borne disease; watershed; animal; climate change; ecosystem; British Columbia; Canada; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Protozoa; Animals; British Columbia; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Groundwater; Waterborne Diseases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084380721

As the ocean stores most of the carbon on our planet, there is an important task in unraveling the natural and anthropogenic processes that drive the carbon cycle at different spatial and temporal scales. We contribute to this by designing a global monthly climatology of total dissolved inorganic carbon (TCO2), which offers a robust basis in carbon cycle modeling but also for other studies related to this cycle. A feedforward neural network (dubbed NNGv2LDEO) was configured to extract from the Global Ocean Data Analysis Project version 2.2019 (GLODAPv2.2019) and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory (LDEO) datasets the relations between TCO2 and a set of variables related to the former’s variability. The global root mean square error (RMSE) of mapping TCO2 is relatively low for the two datasets (GLODAPv2.2019: 7.2 μmolkg1; LDEO: 11.4 μmolkg1) and also for independent data, suggesting that the network does not overfit possible errors in data. The ability of NNGv2LDEO to capture the monthly variability of TCO2 was testified through the good reproduction of the seasonal cycle in 10 time series stations spread over different regions of the ocean (RMSE: 3.6 to 13.2 μmolkg1). The climatology was obtained by passing through NNGv2LDEO the monthly climatological fields of temperature, salinity, and oxygen from the World Ocean Atlas 2013 and phosphate, nitrate, and silicate computed from a neural network fed with the previous fields. The resolution is 11 in the horizontal, 102 depth levels (0-5500 m), and monthly (0-1500 m) to annual (1550-5500 m) temporal resolution, and it is centered around the year 1995. The uncertainty of the climatology is low when compared with climatological values derived from measured TCO2 in the largest time series stations. Furthermore, a computed climatology of partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) from a previous climatology of total alkalinity and the present one of TCO2 supports the robustness of this product through the good correlation with a widely used pCO2 climatology (Landschützer et al., 2017). Our TCO2 climatology is distributed through the data repository of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC; https://doi.org/10.20350/digitalCSIC/10551, Broullón et al., 2020). © 2020 International Union of Crystallography.

Climate change is the result of polluting resource use which is, like consumption and investments, based on the intertemporal optimization of the households. Highlighting the importance of bounded resource supply and of rational extraction decisions I show that climate change is independent of population growth in steady state and there is no causal relationship between climate and population during transition to steady state. The consumption per capita growth rate rises in the innovation rate and the output elasticities of labour and capital in the different sectors. Unlike climate policy, population policy is not warranted; it may be counterproductive because labour is crucial for the research sector. © 2020 The Author(s)","Climate change; Endogenous innovation; Fertility choice; Population growth; Sectoral change","climate change; economic development; fertility; growth modeling; innovation; investment; Malthusian theory; population growth; structural change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085522493

Cover crops are one such way to improve biodiversity, and broadcasting calcium carbonate-coated (lime) seeds can be a viable method for plant establishment. In addition to improving seed-to-soil contact, calcium carbonate may also reduce arthropod granivory. Here we examine the effect of this seed-coating technology on arthropod granivory for seven cover crop species under field conditions. Carabidae, Gryllidae, and Staphylinidae were the three most frequently collected granivorous taxa in pitfall samples, and Pterostichus permundus and Gryllus pennsylvanicus represented 60.8% of all individual granivores. Cover crop seed damaged was variable among plant species. Among all plant species, the presence of a seed coating significantly reduced granivory by nearly 40% in the 7-d field exposure. Individually, hairy vetch and sorghum × sudan seeds were especially protected by calcium carbonate. No positive correlations were observed between invertebrate groups and the number of seeds consumed. Alternative methods for assessing the functionality of granivorous arthropod communities should be pursued, as activity-density measured from pitfall traps failed to reveal important cover crop seed consumers. Protection of cover crop seeds from granivory through a calcium carbonate coating may allow producers to adjust seeding rates and save on costs, increasing the rate of adoption for this conservation practice. © 2020 The Author(s).

In April 2019, the European Parliament adopted new regulations on public procurement to encourage investment in clean buses—electric, hydrogen, or gas. Directive 2009/33/EC is to apply from the second half of 2021. The aim of this article is to make an attempt to simulate the number of zero-emission buses (ZEB) in European Union (EU) member countries in two time horizons: 2025 and 2030, and to forecast the number of clean vehicles in the precise time horizons, including before and after 2050. Research questions are as follows: (1) what will be the number of ZEBs in individual EU countries over the next few years; (2) which of the EU countries will reach by 2030 the level of 95% share of ZEBs in all buses, which are a fleet of public transport buses; and (3) in which year will which EU countries reach the level of 95% share of zero-emission buses. The method used is a Bass model. The conducted analyses demonstrate that, by 2050, only four of the EU members will be able to reach 95% level of share of clean buses in the city bus transport fleets. It is likely that other countries may not achieve this even by 2050. © 2020 by the authors.

Yet, despite their growing popularity, up to now, there is little consensus on how such approaches should move forward in specific jurisdictions. In this paper we examine two contrasting municipal-level case studies in the eastern Amazonian state of Pará where jurisdiction-wide efforts are underway to reduce deforestation. By developing detailed forest governance intervention timelines since 2005, conducting semi-structured interviews with key informants, analyzing municipal deforestation trends, plus extensive examination of project reports, governmental documents and other secondary sources, this paper performs two main analyses. First, it characterizes the processes in each municipality by linking context and forest governance intervention timelines to deforestation trends. Second it provides a systematic comparison of processes based on (1) the role of the government, (2) multi-stakeholder participation and inclusiveness, (3) adaptive management, (4) horizontal and vertical coordination, and (5) alignment of public and private (supply-chain) initiatives. In so doing, this article answers some of the imperative questions on how to implement and improve jurisdictional approaches aimed at halting deforestation in the tropics. © Copyright © 2020 Brandão, Piketty, Poccard-Chapuis, Brito, Pacheco, Garcia, Duchelle, Drigo and Peçanha.","adaptive management; forest governance; multi-stakeholder participation; REDD+; supply-chain initiatives; third-tier jurisdictions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094641279

Therefore, air pollutant parameters should be measured at regular intervals, and the necessary measures should be taken by evaluating the results of measurements. In order to prevent air pollution, pollutant parameters must be evaluated within the framework of a model. Recently, in order to obtain objective and more sensitive results with regard to air pollution nowadays, studies, which use machine learning algorithms in artificial intelligence technologies, have been carried out. In this study, PM10 concentrations, which are obtained from 7 stations in Ankara province in Turkey, were trained with machine learning algorithms (LASSO, SVR, RF, kNN, xGBoost, ANN). The PM10 concentrations of the years 2009–2017 of 6 stations in Ankara were given as input, and the PM10 concentrations of the seventh station for the year 2018 were predicted. The model development stage was repeated for each station, and the performance and error rates of the algorithms were determined by comparing the results produced by the algorithms with the actual results. The best results were provided with ANN (R2 = 0.58, RMSE = 20.8, MAE = 14.4). The spatial distribution of the estimated concentration results was provided through Geographic Information System (GIS), and spatial strategies for improving air pollution over land use were established. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution parameter; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Predictive modeling; Spatial distribution","Air pollution; Land use; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Ankara , Turkey; Artificial intelligence technologies; Global problems; Model development; PM10 concentration; Pollutant parameters; Spatial prediction; Spatial strategies; Learning algorithms; algorithm; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); machine learning; particulate matter; prediction; spatial analysis; spatial distribution; air pollution; article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; developmental stage; geographic information system; land use; prediction; Turkey (republic); air pollutant; algorithm; artificial intelligence; environmental monitoring; machine learning; particulate matter; turkey (bird); Ankara [Turkey]; Turkey; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Environmental Monitoring; Machine Learning; Particulate Matter; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083825455

In this article, the environmental trade-offs in road passenger transportation between conventional vehicles and electrified vehicles are compared, using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. Hence, the relevance of a massive electrification approach can be questioned. Assessing a set of current midsize passenger cars and buses allows for investigation of potential environmental issues. This is the first detailed LCA concerning several hybridization levels for cars and buses, and it is based on real consumption data for two traffic conditions. Methods: We focused on the ISO standards (ISO 2006a, b) and analyzed the energy carriers’ life cycle and the vehicle’s life cycle. The functional unit is clearly defined as the transportation of one passenger over 1 km in specific driving conditions from a point A to a point B, without prejudice toward the path taken. Vehicle specifications were derived based on the available manufacturers’ data, literature, and French Institute of Petroleum (IFPEN) experts. For the use stage, two driving cycles were assessed: the “worldwide harmonized light vehicles test procedure” (WLTP) cycle and an urban cycle. France was selected as the study area, and a sensitivity analysis was performed based on a European electricity charging mix for electrified vehicles. Results and discussion: Battery electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) exhibit the highest climate change (CC) mitigation potential, provided that the electricity mix has low carbon and that the PHEV is used with a fully-charged battery. With these conditions, PHEVs can perform even better than EVs. In that regard, PHEVs using only a thermic engine perform the worst in regard to CC indicator. It is also worth mentioning that electric buses are the best solution in urban traffic conditions for decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. Among powertrains, the electrified powertrains are even more important when performing in urban cycles. For other environmental indicators, such as particulate matter emissions, EVs perform worse than conventional thermic vehicles. Conclusions: The results underline the importance of considering vehicles’ life cycles for LCA in the transportation sector and the need for multicriteria environmental analysis. Therefore, electrification of the transportation sector should not be driven by a single CC indicator, as this may generate potential environmental drawbacks. It is also crucial to adapt public policies to the local context because the results are highly sensitive to the electricity charging mix. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Buses; Driving conditions; Electrified vehicles; Energy mix; Life cycle assessment; Passenger car; Road transportation","carbon; Article; battery electric vehicle; bus; car; car driving; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; electricity; energy recovery; environmental change; France; hybridization; life cycle assessment; motor vehicle; particulate matter; plug in hybrid electric vehicle; priority journal; public policy; sensitivity analysis; traffic and transport; traffic safety",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085397842

Air pollution has been warned of as a modifiable factor contributing to differential SARS-CoV-2 spread but the biological mechanisms underlying the phenomenon are still unknown. Air quality and COVID-19 epidemiological data from 110 Italian provinces were studied by correlation analysis, to evaluate the association between particulate matter (PM)2.5 concentrations and incidence, mortality rate and case fatality risk of COVID-19 in the period 20 February–31 March 2020. Bioinformatic analysis of the DNA sequence encoding the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) was performed to identify consensus motifs for transcription factors mediating cellular response to pollutant insult. Positive correlations between PM2.5 levels and the incidence (r = 0.67, p &lt; 0.0001), the mortality rate (r = 0.65, p &lt; 0.0001) and the case fatality rate (r = 0.7, p &lt; 0.0001) of COVID-19 were found. The bioinformatic analysis of the ACE-2 gene identified nine putative consensus motifs for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR). Our results confirm the supposed link between air pollution and the rate and outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection and support the hypothesis that pollution-induced over-expression of ACE-2 on human airways may favor SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. © 2020 by the authors.

Here we use a multivariate approach1,2 to identify two distinct externally forced fingerprints from multiple ensembles of Earth system model simulations. The leading fingerprint, FM1(x), is characterized by global warming, intensified wet–dry patterns3 and progressive large-scale continental aridification, largely driven by multidecadal increases in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The second fingerprint, FM2(x), captures a pronounced interhemispheric temperature contrast4,5, associated meridional shifts in the intertropical convergence zone6–9 and correlated anomalies in precipitation and aridity over California10, the Sahel11,12 and India. FM2(x) exhibits nonlinear temporal behaviour: the intertropical convergence zone moves southwards before 1975 in response to increases in hemispherically asymmetric sulfate aerosol emissions, and it shifts northwards after 1975 due to reduced sulfur dioxide emissions and the GHG-induced warming of Northern Hemisphere landmasses. Both fingerprints are statistically identifiable in observations of joint changes in temperature, rainfall and aridity during 1950–2014. We show that the reliable simulation of these changes requires combined forcing by GHGs, direct and indirect effects of aerosols, and large volcanic eruptions. Our results suggest that GHG-induced aridification may be modulated regionally by future reductions in sulfate aerosol emissions. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"aerosol; anthropogenic effect; aridification; aridity; climate forcing; drought stress; global warming; greenhouse gas; intertropical convergence zone; meridional circulation; Northern Hemisphere; rainfall; temperature effect; California; India; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087607398

By using two types of inocula (from a full-scale dry anaerobic digestion plant and from lab-scale biomethanation tests), the obtained experimental results did not show significant increase in methane yield related to the presence of biochar (330.40 NL CH4 kgVS−1 using plant inoculum; 335.41 NL CH4 kgVS−1 using plant inoculum with biochar, 311.78 NL CH4 kgVS−1 using lab-inoculum and 366.43 NL CH4 kgVS−1 using lab-inoculum with biochar), but led to significant changes in the microbial community composition. These results are likely related with the specific biochar physical-chemical features and low adsorption potential. Resulting digestate quality was also investigated: biochar-enriched digestates were characterized by increased biological stability (809 ± 264 mg O2 kgVS−1 h−1 vs. 554 ± 76 mg O2 kgVS−1 h−1 for biochar-free and biochar-enriched digestates, respectively), lower heavy metals concentrations (with the exception of Cd), but higher polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons content, with a reported maximum concentration of 8.9 mgPAH kgTS−1 for biochar-enriched digestate derived from AD test with lab-inoculum, which could trigger non-compliance with regulation limits for agricultural reuse of digestates.

One approach to quantify the contribution of management practices towards that goal is through analysis of long-term experiments (LTEs). Our objectives were to analyze knowledge gained in literature reviews on SOC changes in LTEs, to evaluate the results regarding interactions with pedo-climatological factors, and to discuss disparities among reviews in data selection criteria. We summarized mean response ratios (RRs) and stock change rate (SCR) effect size indices from twenty reviews using paired comparisons (N). The highest RRs were found with manure applications (30%, N = 418), followed by aboveground crop residue retention and the use of cover crops (9–10%, N = 995 and 129), while the effect of nitrogen fertilization was lowest (6%, N = 846). SCR for nitrogen fertilization exceeded that for aboveground crop residue retention (233 versus 117 kg C ha−1 year−1, N = 183 and 279) and was highest for manure applications and cover crops (409 and 331 kg C ha−1 year−1, N = 217 and 176). When data allows, we recommend calculating both RR and SCR because it improves the interpretation. Our synthesis shows that results are not always consistent among reviews and that interaction with texture and climate remain inconclusive. Selection criteria for study durations are highly variable, resulting in irregular conclusions for the effect of time on changes in SOC. We also discuss the relationships of SOC changes with yield and cropping systems, as well as conceptual problems when scaling-up results obtained from field studies to regional levels. © 2020, The Author(s).","Carbon sequestration; Management practices; Meta-analysis; Relative response ratio; Soil organic carbon; Stock change rates","agricultural ecosystem; carbon dioxide; cover crop; crop residue; cropping practice; fertilizer application; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil nitrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086784811

Its mechanism is central for controlled solid synthesis but remains controversial. Herein, we report a nanoelectrode approach to study the nucleation and growth of an ionic solid. Using CaCO3 as a model system, by increasing the local pH near a nanoelectrode to convert bicarbonate to carbonate via water reduction, a local supersaturation of CaCO3 is created in the presence of Ca2+. Nucleation and growth of CaCO3 quickly cover the nanoscale electrode surface, resulting in a characteristic peak current that can be used to quantify the supersaturation ratio required for nucleation. The excess energy of 12-14 kJ/mol is required for CaCO3 to nucleate based on the measured supersaturation ratio between 220 and 420.

These intermediates include, sequentially, a μ-hydroxo diferrous species, a mono-NO intermediate, a di-NO intermediate (FDPdiNO), and a bis-μ-hydroxo diferric species. This paper focuses on the reaction path connecting the last two intermediates on which the nitrous oxide product is released. On the basis of density functional theory calculations, a reaction sequence is proposed in which the enzyme passes through an intermediate with a bridging hyponitrite ligand, which accepts a proton, initiating a rate-determining ligand rotation from an N/N- to an N/O-coordinated conformation. This rotation is facilitated by a second-sphere tyrosine residue, which provides a transient hydrogen bond to one of the nitrogen atoms of the substrate near the transition state. The role of the tyrosine residue in the NOR activity has been tested by steady-state kinetics and rapid freeze-quench (RFQ) studies of the Y197F variant of the FDP from T. maritima in which the hydrogen bonding interaction is absent. The Y197F variant displayed little or no steady-state NOR activity in support of the importance of Y197. The RFQ samples, monitored by Mössbauer spectroscopy, showed that Y197F follows the same reaction path as a wild-type FDP up to and including the formation of FDPdiNO but diverges subsequently with the variant forming an inactive mono-NO species. The RFQ results demonstrate that Y197 enables the postFDPdiNO section of the reaction cycle in the wild-type FDP to proceed to N2O. The proposed refinement of the reaction mechanism provides an explanation for the lack of NOR activity of the variant Y197F of T. maritima and of other di-NO binding diiron enzymes and model compounds with active site structures like those of FDPs. The reported reductions of NO to N2O catalyzed by synthetic diiron complexes proceed only with the support of radiation, additional electrons, or an electron-rich ligand environment. However, higher potential diiron sites like those of FDPs require hydrogen bonding to second-sphere residues to turn over NO to N2O.

Genetic variations will leave unambiguous signatures in the patterns of intraspecific genetic variation in extant species since the genome of each individual is an imperfect mosaic of the ancestral genomes. Here, we report the genome sequences of 20 Branchiostoma individuals by whole-genome resequencing strategy. We detected over 140 million genomic variations for each Branchiostoma individual. In particular, we applied the pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) method to estimate the trajectories of changes in the effective population size (Ne) of Branchiostoma population during the Pleistocene. We evaluated the threshold of sequencing depth for proper inference of demographic histories using PSMC was =25×. The PSMC results highlight the role of historical global climatic fluctuations in the long-term population dynamics of Branchiostoma. The inferred ancestral Ne of the Branchiostoma belcheri populations from Zhanjiang and Xiamen (China) seawaters was different in amplitude before the first (mutation rate = 3 × 10-9) or third glaciation (mutation rate = 9 × 10-9) of the Pleistocene, indicating that the two populations most probably started to evolve in isolation in their respective seas after the first or third glaciation of the Pleistocene. A pronounced population bottleneck coinciding with the last glacial maximum was observed in all Branchiostoma individuals, followed by a population expansion occurred during the late Pleistocene. Species that have experienced long-term declines may be especially vulnerable to recent anthropogenic activities. Recently, the industrial pollution and the exploitation of sea sand have destroyed the harmonious living environment of amphioxus species. In the future, we need to protect the habitat of Branchiostoma and make full use of these detected genetic variations to facilitate the functional study of Branchiostoma for adaptation to local environments. © 2020 The Authors.

At maximally polluted areas (impact zone), the animal-controlled transit Cu, Cd, and Pb flows approached their background values by the end of the study period, and the Zn flow simultaneously twofold decreased compared to the background areas. At moderately polluted areas (buffer zone), no significant changes in the metal fluxed were detected for any of the elements. The specifics of the transit flows of the elements at variably polluted areas are controlled by the concentrations of these elements in the diet of the animals and by the abundance of voles. Thereby the manyfold (fifty-fold) decrease in the emissions did no result in an equivalent decrease in the concentrations of the metals in the animal rations at the polluted areas.

Control of corruption is a key governance variable that is positively associated with carbon-pricing outcomes. Another important political dimension is the degree of political globalisation. For economic resources, there is evidence that larger stocks of domestic credit help to enable carbon pricing. There is some evidence that climate change awareness is positively associated with carbon pricing, but the proportion perceiving climate change as a serious threat is negatively associated with carbon pricing.

Flair car system incorporates various gas sensors, including a weather station and GPS (Global Positioning System) module, mounted on a plugin hybrid electric vehicle. This enables the real-time monitoring and the recording of geo-time-stamped gas concentration measurements. Flair map corresponds to the on board real-time visualization software./Flair map development required two important challenges: a quick and agile software modification capability together with a real-time display of measurements on maps. In order to meet these two challenges, we adopted a software rapid-prototyping approach based on the xDash tool. In this paper, our proposed real-time data visualisation approach is first introduced. Then, the rapid-prototyping development methodology which resulted in the Flair map software is described. Finally, two main operational usages of Flair map are illustrated.

This is furthering the demand for the implementation of governance relocation frameworks. In order to stay true to the principles of environmental justice while at the same time ensuring an effective policy that meets the needs and wants of affected communities, an adaptive relocation framework requires collaboration between state and non-state actors. It is thus important to pay attention to how non-state actors are incorporated into public participatory climate change adaptation efforts. In order to affectively address previous limitations of public participation, stakeholders must pay attention to already existing power systems. Through a case study approach of a village relocation project in Fiji, I examine the role of power in a climate change adaptation plan that involved the community of Vunidogoloa, local government, and national government stakeholders. I employ Steven Lukes’s three-dimensional framework of power to the case of Vunidogoloa, a Fijian village that relocated inland due to coastal erosion and shoreline flooding, to illustrate how the political arrangement of participation reinforced existing hierarchies between the village and the government. © The Author(s) 2020.","climate change adaptation; Fiji; participation; power; relocation; Steven Lukes","adaptation; climate change; climate effect; governance approach; local participation; power relations; Fiji",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081966128

In this context, an Ultra-Low Power Eddy Current Displacement Sensor (ULP-ECDS) targeting common industrial applications and designed to be embedded in wireless Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices is presented. A complete characterization of the realized ULP-ECDS operating with different metallic targets was carried out. The choice of the considered targets in terms of material and thickness was inspired by typical industrial scenarios. The experimental results show that the realized prototype works properly with extremely low supply voltages, allowing for obtaining an ultra-low power consumption, significantly lower than other state-of-the-art solutions. In particular, the proposed sensor reached the best resolution of 2 µm in case of a carbon steel target when operated with a supply voltage of 200 mV and with a power consumption of 150 µW. By accepting a resolution of 12 µm, it is possible to further reduce the power consumption of the sensor to less than 10 µW. The obtained results also demonstrate how the performances of the sensor are strongly dependent on both the target and the demodulation technique used to extract the displacement information. This allowed for defining some practical guidelines that can help the design of effective solutions considering application-specific constraints. © 2020 by the authors.

How this is accomplished at the atomic level, however, has still not been established. The molybdenum-dependent nitrogenase has been extensively studied and is the most active catalyst for dinitrogen reduction of the nitrogenase enzymes. The vanadium-dependent form, on the other hand, displays different reactivity, being capable of CO and CO2 reduction to hydrocarbons. Only recently did a crystal structure of the VFe protein of vanadium nitrogenase become available, paving the way for detailed theoretical studies of the iron-vanadium cofactor (FeVco) within the protein matrix. The crystal structure revealed a bridging 4-atom ligand between two Fe atoms, proposed to be either a CO32- or NO3- ligand. Using a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics model of the VFe protein, starting from the 1.35 Å crystal structure, we have systematically explored multiple computational models for FeVco, considering either a CO32- or NO3- ligand, three different redox states, and multiple broken-symmetry states. We find that only a [VFe7S8C(CO3)]2- model for FeVco reproduces the crystal structure of FeVco well, as seen in a comparison of the Fe-Fe and V-Fe distances in the computed models. Furthermore, a broken-symmetry solution with Fe2, Fe3, and Fe5 spin-down (BS7-235) is energetically preferred. The electronic structure of the [VFe7S8C(CO3)]2- BS7-235 model is compared to our [MoFe7S9C]- BS7-235 model of FeMoco via localized orbital analysis and is discussed in terms of local oxidation states and different degrees of delocalization. As previously found from Fe X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies, the Fe part of FeVco is reduced compared to FeMoco, and the calculations reveal Fe5 as locally ferrous. This suggests resting-state FeVco to be analogous to an unprotonated E1 state of FeMoco. Furthermore, V-Fe interactions in FeVco are not as strong compared to Mo-Fe interactions in FeMoco. These clear differences in the electronic structures of otherwise similar cofactors suggest an explanation for distinct differences in reactivity. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,"Binary alloys; Crystal atomic structure; Crystal symmetry; Electronic structure; Enzymes; Iron; Iron alloys; Ligands; Mechanics; Molecular modeling; Molybdenum metallography; Quantum theory; Vanadium; Vanadium metallography; X ray absorption spectroscopy; Active catalyst; Computational model; Delocalizations; Local oxidation; Localized orbitals; Nitrogen reduction; Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics; Theoretical study; Iron metallography; iron-vanadium cofactor; ligand; metalloprotein; nitrogenase; catalysis; chemistry; protein conformation; quantum theory; X ray crystallography; Catalysis; Crystallography, X-Ray; Ligands; Metalloproteins; Nitrogenase; Protein Conformation; Quantum Theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089711252

However, it faces major problems of land-use change that are exacerbated by climate change that affects these ecosystem services. For instance, conventional agriculture contribute to deforestation, soil degradation, and biodiversity loss, which might be further aggravated by climate change–induced droughts, thus reducing staple crop production and, consequently, food security. Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), maize (Zea mays L.), and plantain (Musa paradisiaca L.) are major staple crops in the region. They play a key role for food security and local farmers’ income but are highly exposed to climate risks. This article aims to quantify the level of exposure to climate change (measured as climatic suitability) of these crops in the Andean-Amazon foothills by using the EcoCrop model by the 2030s, 2050s, and 2080s under Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5 scenarios. EcoCrop results showed that, whereas cassava will not lose climatic suitability, maize will lose more than half of its current suitable area, and plantain will gain and lose area, which would affect local food security. Globally, these results are important in highlighting adaptive and cost-effective strategies in agriculture and suggest that agricultural crop diversification may improve resilience by promoting the use of local crops varieties. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Cassava; Crop climatic suitability; EcoCrop; Exposure; Maize; Plantain","action plan; biodiversity; climate change; crop plant; cultivar; drought; ecosystem service; food security; land use change; spatiotemporal analysis; Amazonia; Andes; South America; Manihot esculenta; Musa x paradisiaca; Zea mays",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087411136

In particular, type-B oscillations in the 2-8 Hz range, observed in the soft-intermediate state, have been associated with the emission from a relativistic jet. We present the results of the timing and spectral analysis of a set of observations of the bright transient MAXI J1348—630 made with the NICER (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer) telescope. The observations are in the brightest part of the outburst and all feature a strong type-B quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) at ∼4.5 Hz. We compute the energy dependence of the fractional rms and the phase lags at the QPO frequency, obtaining high signal-to-noise data and sampling for the first time at energies below 2 keV. The fractional rms decreases from more than 10 per cent at 9 keV to 0.6 per cent at 1.5 keV, and is constant below that energy. Taking the 2-3 keV band as reference, photons at all energies show a hard lag, increasing with the distance from the reference band. The behaviour below 2 keV has never been observed before, due to the higher energy bandpass of previous timing instruments. The energy spectrum can be fitted with a standard model for this state, consisting of a thin disc component and a harder power law, plus an emission line between 6 and 7 keV. We discuss the results, concentrating on the phase lags, and show that they can be interpreted within a Comptonization model. © 2020 The Author(s).","Accretion, accretion discs; Stars: black holes; Stars: jets; X-rays: binaries; X-rays: individual: GRS 1915+105",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095421115

The impacts of climate change are critically affected to desertification, biodiversity loses, decreases of water sources, land degradation of rangeland in Mongolia. In order to better adapt to such changing climate, it is important to understand the long terms vegetation dynamics and its relation with precipitation. In this study, the third-generation GIMMS NDVI data of NOAA satellites and CASA model with metrological data have been used to estimate NPP between 1982 and 2015 throughout Mongolia. Results show that during 34 years mean NPP seems to have decreased greatly from semi-Arid in the North to desert in the South across natural zone in Mongolia. The average NPP value was averaged at 166.1-g-C/m2 and ranged between 19 and 724.85-g-C/m2 for the terrain land. 60% of total NPP was relating to annual precipitation about R2-Combining double low line-0.78 (p-Combining double low line-0.000). Total amount of NPP between 1982 and 2015 was estimated to be 0.32-Pg-C/year and 0.29-Pg-C/year in 1982 and 2015, respectively, with an average amount of NPP was 0.32-Pg (1-Pg-Combining double low line-1015-g) for 34 years. These results indicate that during most of vegetation growing season, NPP decreased by 0.03-Pg-Crossed D sign-/year. Field measurement data of 2007, 2009, 2014 and 2015 were used for correlation with the NPP estimation. As a result, R2-Combining double low line-0.742 (p-&lt;-0.001) in 2007 for forest steppe, R2-Combining double low line-0.74 (p-&lt;-0.001) in 2009 for meadow steppe and grassy steppe, R2-Combining double low line-0.73 (p-&lt;-0.001) in 2014 for meadow steppe, R2-Combining double low line-0.715 (p-&lt;-0.001) in 2015 for a desert steppe, respectively. The results obtained in this study contributes to understanding productivity of pasturelands of semi-Arid ecosystems of Mongolia and Central Asia. By providing insights on the relationship between pasture productivity and climate variables such as precipitation and temperature, this study could be useful for national and regional scale climate change adaptation strategies. © Authors 2020.

Beside the fact that growing individual road traffic already brings urban infrastructure to its limits, future UAM is recognized as a potential efficient contribution to traffic related carbon-dioxide reduction. But, using pure electric engines, which are regarded to be less noisy than combustion machines, all currently discussed propulsion concepts will generate aerodynamic noise from rotors, propellers or fans. In a previous study, covering an area of about 9,500 km2 and operating two different generic air taxi systems, the author has shown that - depending on their propulsion concepts - additional aviation noise will be created, not only close to air taxi ports but also en-route in regions where currently no aircraft noise is relevant.

Many climate activists focus on the fossil fuel industry as the main culprit for greenhouse gas emissions and advocate for a cessation of investments in this sector. This is despite the fact that it is the use of oil and gas in housing, transportation and industry, not its production that represents over 90 per cent of its global emissions.1 This misrepresents the global challenge that is one facing society's energy use at large. During this period of energy transition, and for decades to come, oil and gas will continue to constitute a major component of the world's growing energy demand. All energy consumers, whether governments, industries and the general public therefore need to reduce their energy consumption, while producing countries and companies need to reduce their carbon footprint, as well as increase investments in renewable energy. In this context, Norway serves as a valuable case study of what it takes to become a carbon efficient energy producer. The example of Lundin Energy AB, one of Europe's leading independent oil and gas producers, operating exclusively offshore Norway, shows how the Norwegian regulatory environment, coupled with the Company's sustainability commitments and its Decarbonization Strategy, have resulted in the production of one of the lowest carbon intensity barrels in the world. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Improving the efficiency of climate control systems requires advanced simulation tools for an accurate evaluation of both the energy savings and thermal comfort of innovative heating and cooling solutions. In this study, the advancements beyond the state of the art consists primarily of the methodology tackling the reduction of computational costs of intensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and/or time-consuming experimental investigations and the simultaneous assessment of vehicle cabin thermal comfort and energy flows. The approach was validated against climatized chassis dyno measurements from the EU Horizon 2020 research project QUIET. Indeed, all the considered locations within the cabin were properly validated, both in steady state and transient conditions with the largest deviations at steady state below 3 ◦C. Additionally, the validation results show a perfect agreement for the average cabin predicted mean vote (PMV) value and a largest deviation in terms of the PMV for the other locations below 0.3. Furthermore, the applicability of the methodology is proved with the help of its application on a parametric study for which various cabin temperature setpoints and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) modes were simulated in winter operation. © 2020 by the authors.

However, the baseline state of air quality in Colombia is relatively unknown. In this study we aim to assess the baseline state of air quality in Colombia with a focus on the spatial and temporal variability in emissions and atmospheric burden of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) and evaluate surface NOx , ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO) mixing ratios. We quantify the magnitude and spatial distribution of the four major NOx sources (lightning, anthropogenic activities, soil biogenic emissions and biomass burning) by integrating global NOx emission inventories into the mesoscale meteorology and atmospheric chemistry model, namely Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) coupled with Chemistry (collectively WRF-Chem), at a similar resolution ( 25 km) to the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) anthropogenic emission inventory and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) remote sensing observations. The model indicates the largest contribution by lightning emissions (1258 GgNyr1), even after already significantly reducing the emissions, followed by anthropogenic (933 GgNyr1), soil biogenic (187 GgNyr1) and biomass burning emissions (104 GgNyr1). The comparison with OMI remote sensing observations indicated a mean bias of tropospheric NO2 columns over the whole domain (WRF-Chem minus OMI) of 0.02 (90% CI: [0:43, 0.70])1015 molecules cm2, which is < 5% of the mean column. However, the simulated NO2 columns are overestimated and underestimated in regions where lightning and biomass burning emissions dominate, respectively. WRFChem was unable to capture NOx and CO urban pollutant mixing ratios, neither in timing nor in magnitude. Yet, WRFChem was able to simulate the urban diurnal cycle of O3 satisfactorily but with a systematic overestimation of 10 parts per billion (ppb) due to the equally large underestimation of NO mixing ratios and, consequently, titration. This indicates that these city environments are in the NOx-saturated regime with frequent O3 titration. We conducted sensitivity experiments with an online meteorology-chemistry singlecolumn model (SCM) to evaluate how WRF-Chem subgridscale- enhanced emissions could explain an improved representation of the observed O3, CO and NOx diurnal cycles. Interestingly, the SCM simulation, showing especially a shallower nocturnal inversion layer, results in a better representation of the observed diurnal cycle of urban pollutant mixing ratios without an enhancement in emissions. This stresses that, besides application of higher-resolution emission inventories and model experiments, the diurnal cycle in boundary layer dynamics (and advection) should be critically evaluated in models such as WRF-Chem to assess urban air quality. Overall, we present a concise method to quantify air quality in regions with limited surface measurements by integrating in situ and remote sensing observations. This study identifies four distinctly different source regions and shows their interannual and seasonal variability during the last 1.5 decades. It serves as a base to assess scenarios of future air quality in Colombia or similar regions with contrasting emission regimes, complex terrain and a limited air quality monitoring network. © Author(s) 2020.

There are several reasons of such state, including requirements for energy-efficient new buildings and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. An exemplary solution that may help to reduce “traditional” primary energy consumption is local energy source utilization. The article presents a simplified feasibility study of hybrid energy system under Polish law and economic conditions for a self-government unit, that is legally obliged to apply means of energy efficiency improvement. The aim of this paper is to provide a simple algorithm to find optimal hybrid PV and wind power source sizing for a prosumer. Resource data used in analyses are imported from Photovoltaic Geographical Information System and cover a period of one year. The paper includes two different methodologies applied to solve the problem of optimal hybrid energy system sizing. The first approach is heuristic and based on monthly energy balancing while the second is iterative and takes into account hourly energy balance. The results from both methods are compared and verified by HomerPro software, that shows significant differences between two algorithms. At the end economic assessment based on Net Present Value method is performed. © 2020 Polish Academy of Sciences.

Although this type of trophic interaction has been recognised as being important for shaping how vegetation responds to climate, better knowledge about how this process occurs on the landscape scale and over a long time range is necessary. Here, we evaluated the potential roles of herbivores in modulating the response of mountainous Mediterranean vegetation to seasonal and long-term climate oscillations. To understand the relations among climate, plants and animal population, we fitted a Bayesian model to a combination of long-term (1995–2014) climate datasets, satellite greenness maps (NASA Landsat NDVI) and exotic Barbary sheep census data (breeding success and abundance of Ammotragus lervia). We also used the intrinsic mode function and Hilbert spectrum transformations to decompose NDVI time series and to evaluate their periodic oscillations. We found remarkable dissimilarities as to how climate affects the temporal oscillation of vegetation greenness between landscapes both with and without ungulates, albeit their similarities under environmental conditions. Vegetation responses to climate are particularly attenuated in landscapes with ungulates, an effect that depends on ungulate population abundance. In a world where extreme climate events are becoming frequent and intense, our results indicate that ungulates can strongly modulate how grasslands and scrublands respond to climate change. Increasing our knowledge as to how this type of trophic interaction affects vegetation responses to climate variability is of much importance for managing ungulate rewilding strategies. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","climate adaptability; climate change; exotic animals; herbivore; Normalised Difference Vegetation Index; plant biomass; primary productivity; ungulates","climate change; environmental conditions; extreme event; greenspace; herbivore; landscape; mountain region; NDVI; satellite data; seasonal variation; ungulate; vegetation type; Mediterranean Region; Ammotragus lervia; Animalia; Ungulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074557816

Using satellite data, we test the effect of property rights on deforestation between 1982 and 2016. In order to identify causal effects, we combine a regression discontinuity design with the orthogonal timing of homologation. We find that observations inside territories with full property rights show a significant decrease in deforestation, while the effect does not exist in territories without full property rights. While these are local average treatment effects, our results suggest that not only do indigenous territories serve a human-rights role, but they are a cost-effective way for governments to preserve their forested areas. First, obtaining full property rights is crucial to recognize indigenous peoples’ original right to land and protect their territories from illegal deforestation. Second, when implemented, indigenous property rights reduce deforestation inside indigenous territories in the Amazon rainforest, and could provide an important positive externality for Brazil and the rest of the world in terms of climate change mitigation. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Similar quarantine measures were imposed on other Chinese cities within days. Human mobility and relevant production and consumption activities have since decreased significantly. As a likely side effect of this decrease, many regions have recorded significant reductions in air pollution. We employed daily air pollution data and Intracity Migration Index (IMI) data form Baidu between 1 January and 21 March 2020 for 44 cities in northern China to examine whether, how, and to what extent travel restrictions affected air quality. On the basis of this quantitative analysis, we reached the following conclusions: (1) The reduction of air pollution was strongly associated with travel restrictions during this pandemic—on average, the air quality index (AQI) decreased by 7.80%, and five air pollutants (i.e., SO2, PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and CO) decreased by 6.76%, 5.93%, 13.66%, 24.67%, and 4.58%, respectively.

The variant emission policies in different sailing areas and the impact of physical and environmental phenomena on ships energy consumption are two interesting and serious concepts in the maritime issues. In this paper, an efficient energy management strategy is proposed for a hybrid vessel that can effectively consider the emission policies and apply the impacts of ship resistant, wind direction and sea state on the ships propulsion. In addition, the possibility and impact of charging and discharging the carried electrical vehicles’ batteries by the ship is investigated. All mentioned matters are mathematically formulated and a general model of the system is extracted. The resulted model and real data are utilized for the proposed energy management strategy. A genetic algorithm is used in MATLAB software to obtain the optimal solution for a specific trip of the ship. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed energy management method in economical and reliable operation of the ship considering the different emission control policies and weather condition impacts. © 2020 MDPI AG.

Grassland ecosystems are among the most endangered in the world and ongoing grassland declines in the Great Plains have been a major concern for avian biodiversity conservation. Objectives: Threat mitigation may include biofuel cultivation, CO2 emissions reductions, and land conservation strategies. However, spatially explicit and species-specific population responses to future scenarios remain unknown. We show how future land-use and climate scenarios may affect abundance and biodiversity patterns for grassland birds in the Upper Missouri River Basin. Methods: We used georeferenced abundance records, 20 environmental predictors, and gradient boosting machines to create spatial abundance models for 24 grassland bird species. Models were scored to current conditions and seven future landcover/climate-change scenarios to spatially predict changes in bird abundance for 2050. Results: Model accuracy varied by species (0.2% ≤ NRMSE ≤ 39.3%) but spatial predictions were highly accurate (.03 ≤ MAE ≤ 7.67). Mean abundances declined for eight species in at least one scenario, whereas abundances increased for 16 species. Multi-species change analyses identified areas of decreasing abundance, particularly in the southeast, whereas increasing were predicted at higher elevations to the west. Important predictors included temperature, forest distance, and elevation. Conclusions: Predicted abundances varied by species and geography. Abundances and distributions expanded for most species, but multi-species declines also occurred in many low-elevation areas. These models may improve understanding of species-specific responses to environmental change by identifying emerging areas of avian conservation concern. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Biofuels; Ecological niche model; Gradient boosting machines; Great plains; Land-use/land-change","abundance; accuracy assessment; biodiversity; biofuel; bird; climate change; environmental change; grassland; land use change; Great Plains; Missouri Basin; United States; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087407804

Dengue viruses have infected several citizens of Kolkata since 2012 and it is amplifying every year. It has been derived from earlier studies that certain meteorological variables and climate change play a significant role in the spread and amplification of dengue infections in different parts of the globe. In this study, our primary objective is to identify the relative contribution of the putative drivers responsible for dengue occurrences in Kolkata and project dengue incidences with respect to the future climate change. The regression model was developed using maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity and rainfall as key meteorological factors on the basis of statistically significant cross-correlation coefficient values to predict dengue cases. Finally, climate variables from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) for South Asia region were input into the statistical model to project the occurrences of dengue infections under different climate scenarios such as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). It has been estimated that from 2020 to 2100, dengue cases will be higher from September to November with more cases in RCP8.5 (872 cases per year) than RCP4.5 (531 cases per year). The present research further concludes that from December to February, RCP8.5 leads to suitable warmer weather conditions essential for the survival and multiplication of dengue pathogens resulting more than two times dengue cases in RCP8.5 than in RCP4.5. Furthermore, the results obtained will be useful in developing early warning systems and provide important evidence for dengue control policy-making and public health intervention. © 2020, ISB.","Climate; Dengue fever; Kolkata; Model; Mosquito-borne; Prediction","Asia; climate change; dengue; human; incidence; India; weather; Asia; Climate Change; Dengue; Humans; Incidence; India; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084143878

GDP is growing by 3% annually and poverty rates are declining. Despite these gains, Kenya still has a lot of ground to cover to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. SDG7, which aims to 'Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all', exemplifies both Kenya's achievements and the challenges that remain. Access to grid-based electricity and LPG have grown rapidly. However, over 90% of Kenyans still rely on polluting fuels like wood, charcoal and/or kerosene for some or all of their cooking needs. Substantial effort is needed to ensure all Kenyans have access to clean cooking options by 2030. We present the results of a pilot study in which gasifier-based pellet stoves were introduced in 150 peri-urban households. The stoves include an internal fan that improves combustion efficiency and reduces emissions by 90%-99% relative to charcoal and fuelwood in traditional devices. A subset of participants received stoves with 'Pay-as-You-Cook' (PAYC) hardware, which relies on pre-paid RFID card to activate the stove's internal fan, allowing vendors to sell the stove below cost and recoup losses through pellet sales. We find that people were willing to include pellet stoves in their cooking routines and, in many cases, pellets displaced polluting fuels. We also find that PAYC hardware did not negatively impact adoption: PAYC users had higher daily rates of fuel consumption and reported higher willingness to pay for the stove than non-PAYC users. However, stoves were not used exclusively. Instead, people stacked pellets in combination with other cooking options, with pellets contributing to 12%-40% of their cooking needs (inter-quartile range). Though the project did not successfully overcome all of the barriers necessary to achieve long-term adoption of advanced pellet stoves, the results demonstrate that pellets could contribute to a portfolio of cleaner options.

The non-parametric local linear estimates for GSP are consistent with a conventional inverted U-shaped EKC, which peaks in 2010 and declines thereafter. The peak coincides with a significant policy shift in Australia's commitment to reducing CO2 emissions, whereby, in 2010, the Australian Government, and subsequently the states and territories, pledged to reduce CO2 emissions to 5% below 2000 levels by 2020 under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (the Cancun Agreement). © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Australia; CO2 emissions; Environmental Kuznets Curve","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Public policy; Bootstrapping method; Carbon dioxide emissions; Confidence bands; Environmental Kuznets curves; Functional forms; Gross state products; Non-parametric estimations; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Parameter estimation; bootstrapping; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; Kuznets curve; territory; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088135684

A tunability of around 18 nm in the wavelength of ASE is achieved by tweaking the size and shape of the droplets through controlling the pressure given to the chip, thus by modifying the flow rate of the liquid through the channel. The shift in ASE peak wavelength observed upon changing the droplet configuration is attributed to the concentration-dependent redshift exhibited by the dye molecules. This assumption is confirmed by observing a blueshift in emission peak after reducing the region of illumination of the chip, thereby reducing the number of dye molecules under the illumination region.

Many researches have been done to address the issue of carbon emissions, TOD (Transit-Oriented Development) is one of them. This paper focuses entirely on how to develop the Transit-Oriented Development (TOD) design through low carbon city concepts in Indonesia. The concept of low-carbon cities is potentially implemented for high-energy efficiency in the areas of transport and housing will be able to reduce carbon footprint by decreasing trip frequencies, greater public transportation use for residents, increasing of walking level and higher accessibility. The city has to stimulate compact development with the high mobility movement of space in which space, building and infrastructure will be incorporated into a complex to authorise for living varied, commercial and social space to merge in environmentally sustainability. The development of a design strategy for the stakeholders is needed to develop and promote design ideas to optimise the spatial structure of cities. This paper aims to improve low carbon city model by adding integration between the urban spatial structure and land use to promote urban mixed, mobility, walkability, urban connectivity, and accessibility. These strategies will be used in a new development city in Palembang. Palembang is selected as representative of the rising megapolitan city in Indonesia where it still has capabilities for new spatial development planning to be improved the quality of life, well-planned new connectivity and sustainable cities.

The exchange-correlation functional was approximated by generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The Co2TiSn bulk has mechanical stability in three static, dynamic, and elastic forms. All phonon branches have positive frequencies, and elastic results have shown the hardness with brittle behavior for this case. The Co2TiSn has half-metallic nature with full spin polarization at the Fermi energy and 2.0 μB magnetic moment. It also has a good figure of merit (ZT) about one that makes it suitable for thermoelectric applications. All four Co–Co, Co–Sn, Ti–Sn, and Ti–Co terminations of the [001] films have the ground state point.

For tropical soils, the SOC accumulation was limited by the unfavorable environment, likely the sandy soil area in Northeast (NE) Thailand. This review aims to quantify and understand SOC in sandy paddy fields of NE Thailand. The existing research gap for alternative management practices is also highlighted to increase ecological and agronomic values. We review previous studies to determine the factors affecting SOC dynamics in sandy paddy fields, in order to enhance SOC and sustain rice yields. High sand content, up to 50% sand, was found in 70.7% of the observations. SOC content has ranged from 0.34 to 31.2 g kg-1 for the past four decades in paddy rice soil of NE Thailand. The conventional and alternative practice managements were chosen based on either increasing rice crop yield or improving soil fertility. The lack of irrigation water during the mild dry season would physically affect carbon sequestration as the soil erosion accelerates. Meanwhile, soil chemical and microbial activity, which directly affect SOC accumulation, would be influenced by nutrient and crop residue management, including chemical fertilizer, manure and green manure, unburned rice straw, and biochar application. Increasing SOC content by 1 g kg-1 can increase rice yield by 302 kg ha-1. The predicted carbon saturation varied tremendously, from 4.1% to 140.6% (52% in average), indicating that the sandy soil in this region has the potential for greater SOC sequestration. Our review also suggests that broadening the research of rice production influenced by sandy soil is still required to implement adaptive management for sustainable agriculture and future food security. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon saturation; Northeast Thailand; Rice paddy; Sandy soil; Soil organic carbon",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090405739

Food experts know detailed information about foods, but there is a lack of understanding about what citizens know. Citizen science has been used successfully in various fields however, is virtually absent from food research. This pilot study explores the efficacy of Zooniverse citizen science platform as a method of food citizen research, and assesses the impact of response method, food type, portion size and weight information, on estimates of carbon footprint and energy content. Estimates of the carbon footprint (grams of carbon dioxide equivalent) and energy content (Kcal) of 10 foods were measured in a 3 (Between: Response Method; multiple-choice, slider, text box) × 3 (Within: portion size; small, medium, large) × 2 (Between: weight information; present, absent) observational survey. Citizens (N = ~516, unique IP addresses) were recruited via informal email networks. Kruskal–Wallis and Chi-square analyses compared citizen estimations with validated values, and assessed the impact of the variables on estimations. The majority of carbon footprint and energy content estimates were inaccurate, with citizens typically overestimating values. We observe an unexpected correlation between carbon footprint and energy content estimates. Portion size impacts perceptions, with estimations increasing with larger portion sizes. Weight information impacts perceptions, with estimations of carbon footprint being lower, and estimates of energy content being higher when weight information is present. Input method significantly affects observed values, estimates of carbon footprint and energy content estimates were lowest using the text box, followed by the slider tool, highest estimates were given using multiple choice. Citizens are unable to accurately estimate the carbon footprint and energy content of foods, though citizens may possess understanding of the hierarchy of values. These compelling findings highlight the need for consumer education, with a focus on carbon footprint, to precede interventions intended to move consumers toward more sustainable and healthy diets. We have demonstrated that citizen science can be used to measure food carbon footprint and energy content perceptions, and the slider tool offers greater sensitivity of estimation and functionality than other input methods. © Copyright © 2020 Armstrong, Bridge, Oakden, Reynolds, Wang, Panzone, Rivera, Kause, Ffoulkes, Krawczyk, Miller and Serjeant.","carbon footprint; citizen science; consumer perception; energy content; food environmental impact; methods; portion size",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090392992

However, although the ocean supports respiratory activity throughout its entire volume, to our knowledge there are no studies that tackle both the spatial and temporal variability of respiration in the dark ocean and its dependence on organic carbon sources. Here, we have studied the variability of epipelagic and mesopelagic R via the enzymatic activity of the electron transport system (ETS) in microbial communities, along two zonal sections (21°N and 26°N) extending from the northwest African coastal upwelling to the open-ocean waters of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, during the fall 2002 and the spring 2003. Overall, integrated R in epipelagic (Repi; 0–200 m) waters, was similar during the two periods, while integrated mesopelagic respiration (Rmeso; 200–1000 m) was &gt;25% higher in the fall. The two seasons, however, exhibited contrasting zonal and meridional patterns of ETS distribution in the water column, largely influenced by upwelling effects and associated mesoscale variability. Multiple linear regression between average R and average concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and slow-sinking (suspended) particulate organic carbon (POCsus) indicates that POCsus is the main contributor to Rmeso, supporting previous results in the same area. Rmeso exceeded satellite-derived net primary production (NPP) at all stations except at the most coastal ones, with the imbalance increasing offshore. Moreover, the export flux of sinking POC collected at 200 m with sediment traps, represented on average less than 6% of the NPP. All this indicates that Rmeso depends largely on small particles with low sinking rates, which would be laterally advected at mid water depths from the continental margin toward the open ocean, or transported by mesoscale features from the surface to the mesopelagic ocean, providing support to inferences from modeling studies in the region. © Copyright © 2020 Arístegui, Montero, Hernández-Hernández, Alonso-González, Baltar, Calleja and Duarte.","Canary Current upwelling region; dissolved organic carbon; ETS activity; mesopelagic respiration variability; suspended and sinking particulate organic carbon","Electron transport properties; Linear regression; Oceanography; Offshore oil well production; Average concentration; Dissolved organic carbon; Electron transport systems; Multiple linear regressions; Net primary production; North Atlantic subtropical gyres; Particulate organic carbon; Spatial and temporal variability; Organic carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090495118

By employing a mixed-methods design, it combined LULC data with socioeconomic and climatic data, to analyze the pattern of LULC changes and its socioeconomic and climatic driving forces along with moderating factors. It was found that rangeland decreased by 764 km2 (13% of total area) between 1986 and 2015. The results from the Seemingly Unrelated time series regression models confirmed preliminary evidence that climate variability, as well as adaptive land-use policies lacking components of sustainability increase the likelihood of degradation and contraction of rangelands. We also found an indication from the qualitative data that a widening power gap between the customary and statutory governance system reinforces unsustainable land use by obscuring the values of the customary land governance system. However, those policies encompassing economic and natural resource development objectives abate adverse effects of climate variability on land degradation and shrinkage of rangelands. The results suggest that a land governance system with natural resource development objectives fitting to the local context could be an effective policy instrument to lessen the adverse effects of climate anomalies on LULC changes. Although this study focused on analyzing the LULC changes and its drivers in dry-land area, the findings may well have a bearing on the formulation and implementation of effective adaptation and sustainable land-use policies. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Drivers; LULC; Moderators; Pastoralism; Policy; Sustainable","climate change; dryland farming; empirical analysis; land cover; land degradation; land use; land use change; land use planning; policy implementation; policy making; rangeland; resource development; sustainability; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089795921

An array of chemical, physical and spectroscopic techniques (gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC–MS), mobility analyzer, UV–Visible absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy) was applied for characterizing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), heavy aromatic compounds and soot, constituting the particulate matter (PM) sampled from the exhaust. The engine was operated in half load (HL) (188 Nm, representing the more common condition for engine in urban traffic) and full load (FL) (452 Nm, representing the best performance of the engine operation) conditions, at the same engine speed (2000 rpm). Soot formation was enhanced in HL condition, with respect to FL, but, just because of the much lower soot amount, the after-treatment systems in this last condition resulted to be less efficient in the soot abatement. Indeed, the abatement through DPF was about 40% lower in the FL condition with respect to HL condition, and any significant further concentration decrease was found after SCR, in both conditions. By contrast, PAH concentration after DPF abatement was found to be higher in the HL with respect to FL condition. A further PAH concentration decrease of about 30% was found after the SCR in the HL condition whereas in FL the reduction was only about 5–6%. Also the heavy aromatic compounds having molecular weight above the GC–MS detection limit (300 u), were mitigated by SCR. Therefore, SCR did not cause a further soot reduction, whereas it was effective in largely reducing PAH and heavy aromatics emissions, especially in the lower temperature condition featuring the half-load condition, when combustion efficiency is worse. Moreover, SCR system reduced the emission of small particles probably due to an enhanced agglomeration of particles, with beneficial effect on the harmfulness to human health. © 2020","After-treatment systems for engine exhausts; BaPeq; Diesel engine particulate emissions; DPF; PAH; PM; SCR","Absorption spectroscopy; Aromatization; Diesel engines; Dust; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Gas chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Promethium; Soot; Thyristors; Absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy; After-treatment; BaPeq; Combustion efficiencies; Diesel particulate filters; Particulate matter emissions; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); Spectroscopic technique; Exhaust systems (engine)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082136870

Recent pan-tropical bleaching events driven by unprecedented global heat waves have shifted the playing field for coral reef management and policy. While best-practice conventional management remains essential, it may no longer be enough to sustain coral reefs under continued climate change. Nor will climate change mitigation be sufficient on its own. Committed warming and projected reef decline means solutions must involve a portfolio of mitigation, best-practice conventional management and coordinated restoration and adaptation measures involving new and perhaps radical interventions, including local and regional cooling and shading, assisted coral evolution, assisted gene flow, and measures to support and enhance coral recruitment. We propose that proactive research and development to expand the reef management toolbox fast but safely, combined with expedient trialling of promising interventions is now urgently needed, whatever emissions trajectory the world follows. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of embracing new interventions in a race against time, including their risks and uncertainties. Ultimately, solutions to the climate challenge for coral reefs will require consideration of what society wants, what can be achieved technically and economically, and what opportunities we have for action in a rapidly closing window. Finding solutions that work for coral reefs and people will require exceptional levels of coordination of science, management and policy, and open engagement with society. It will also require compromise, because reefs will change under climate change despite our best interventions. We argue that being clear about society’s priorities, and understanding both the opportunities and risks that come with an expanded toolset, can help us make the most of a challenging situation. We offer a conceptual model to help reef managers frame decision problems and objectives, and to guide effective strategy choices in the face of complexity and uncertainty.

The traditional data envelopment analysis (DEA) model has limited practical applicability for measuring environmental performance, as it lacks the computational capacity to deal with undesirable outputs. The current study employs “radial” and “non-radial” DEA technology, and acknowledges the associations of a mathematical foundation to increase the analytical capability of the environmental performance of DEA. Results show that in the measurement of environmental performance analysis, the non-radial DEA model has a higher discriminating power compared to radial DEA. Results show that the average values of radial and non-radial environmental performance are highest for Latin America and the Caribbean, at 0.99 and 0.96, respectively, while the former USSR has the lowest values of 0.22 and 0.32, respectively. The South Asian region shows relatively stable values of about 0.58 to 0.65, and Latin America &amp; Caribbean countries and sub-Saharan Africa also show a stable radial environmental performance ranging from 0.82 to 1.00. These results indicate a considerable difference among the eight world regions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Eight world regions; Environmental index; Innovation energy; Radial DEA and non-radial DEA","data envelopment analysis; emission control; energy planning; energy use; innovation; numerical model; performance assessment; Sustainable Development Goal; Africa; Caribbean Islands; Latin America; USSR; Caribbean; economic development; productivity; Caribbean Region; Economic Development; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085306253

Electrochemical transformation of CO2 into fuels and chemicals using copper (Cu)-based materials has attracted enormous attention. However, the competitive hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) heavily influences their efficiency. Thus, it is urgent to promote the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) and suppress the competitive HER. In this work, enhanced CO2RR with suppressed HER was achieved on polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) coated Cu nanoneedles (CuNNs). The concentration of surface adsorbed CO2 could be enhanced via the field-induced reagent concentration (FIRC) effect through the CuNN structures. The hydrophobic PTFE can prevent the supply of protons to CuNNs and thus suppress the HER. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed that the PTFE coated CuNNs maintained the nanoneedle structures and metallic Cu state during the catalytic reaction process. As a result, highly suppressed HER coupled with high C2 selectivity can be achieved on these PTFE coated CuNNs with a Faraday efficiency (FE) of 47% toward C2 products and an ultralow FE of 5.9% toward H2 at -1.49 V vs. RHE (without IR correction). This work provides an effective strategy to promote the CO2RR and suppress the competitive HER.

In this study, a aquifer storage and recovery simulation-optimization model (ASRSOM) is developed to optimize aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) wellfield operations. ASRSOM combines an analytical hydraulic model and a numerical optimization model to optimize wellfield operations. The objective function used to minimize energy consumption is the temporal integral of the products of temporally varying total dynamic head values and pumping rates. Comparison of ASRSOM results with work by others for idealized aquifer operations supports the validity of ASRSOM. Four scenarios were simulated to evaluate the role that optimization of operations and aquifer recharge plays in reducing the energy required to pump groundwater out of the aquifer. The operations of a municipal ASR wellfield located in the Denver Basin, Colorado, were simulated for a 10-year period. Optimization decreased energy consumption by 2,179 MW h of power (-19.6% compared with historical scenario) and 1,541 t of atmospheric carbon. For the conditions considered, managed aquifer recharge reduced power consumption by 1%. The limited benefit of recharge is attributed to the small recharge volume in the case study, the short duration of the analysis, and the depth of water levels in the aquifer. Additional opportunities to address economic and environmental impacts associated with groundwater pumping include optimal position of wells and factors controlling total pumping head. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Energy efficiency; Optimization of groundwater recharge and pumping; Sustainable development of groundwater","Aquifers; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Groundwater resources; Hydraulic models; Optimization; Pumps; Recovery; Water levels; Analytical hydraulics; Aquifer storage and recovery; Climate change mitigation; Managed aquifer recharges; Numerical optimizations; Objective functions; Reduced power consumption; Simulation-optimization models; Recharging (underground waters); aquifer; computer simulation; energy efficiency; energy use; groundwater resource; numerical model; optimization; water resource; Denver Basin; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086765243

This study examined the climatology of PBL-associated meteorological parameters over the Korean peninsula and surrounding sea using data from the ERA5 dataset produced by the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The data covered the period from 2008 to 2017. The bulk Richardson number methodology was used to determine the PBL height (PBLH). The PBLH obtained from the ERA5 data agreed well with that derived from sounding and Global Positioning System Radio Occultation datasets. Significant diurnal and seasonal variability in PBLH was observed. The PBLH increases from morning to late afternoon, decreases in the evening, and is lowest at night. It is high in the summer, lower in spring and autumn, and lowest in winter. The variability of the PBLH with respect to temperature, relative humidity, surface pressure, wind speed, lower tropospheric stability, soil moisture, and surface fluxes was also examined. The growth of the PBLH was high in the spring and in southern regions due to the low soil moisture content of the surface. A high PBLH pattern is evident in high-elevation regions. Increasing trends of the surface temperature and accordingly PBLH were observed from 2008 to 2017. © 2020 by the authors.","Climatology; Korean peninsula; Planetary boundary layer height; Surface meteorological parameters","Air quality; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Climatology; Soil moisture; Springs (components); Wind; Air quality prediction; Bulk Richardson number; European centre for medium-range weather forecasts; Meteorological parameters; Planetary boundary layers; Pollution transport; Seasonal variability; Surface temperatures; Weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090005462

To address the power demand-supply gap, Pakistan has increased its use of fossil fuel energy sources for power generation. To support a lower carbon power supply Pakistan needs renewable energy sources such as hydropower. However, most of the water for irrigation and power generation in the country is derived from a watershed in a disputed territory shared between India and Pakistan. Construction of hydroelectric dams over transboundary rivers have led to concerns regarding their ecological impacts. In this paper, we evaluated the sustainability of the Bursar Hydroelectric Project, proposed on such a transboundary river. Emergy analysis was used to holistically determine the change in the intrinsic value of the local ecosystem both before and after the construction of the dam. The results show that the project would increase the qualitative value of outputs derived from the local ecosystem. However, it would also extract and stock significant resources thus decreasing the overall sustainability of the system. In conclusion, the construction of the subject dam has negative consequences for unrestricted flow of water, sediments and biomass downstream. Policy makers can use this study to design mitigation measures for ecological conservation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Developing country; Emission reduction; Renewable energy; Sustainable development","Dams; Ecosystems; Fossil fuels; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Ecological conservation; Ecological impacts; Fossil fuel energy; Hydroelectric project; Mitigation measures; Renewable energy source; Sustainability evaluations; Trans-boundary rivers; Hydroelectric power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083733647

The main barriers to commercializing a CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) system for formate production are the chemical inertness, low aqueous solubility, and slow mass transport characteristics of CO2, along with the low selectivity and high overpotential observed in formate production via CO2 reduction. To address those problems, we first explain the possible reaction mechanisms of CO2RRs to formate, and then we present and discuss several strategies to overcome the barriers to commercialization. The electronic structure of the catalyst can be tuned to favor a specific intermediate by adjusting the catalyst composition and tailoring the facets, edges, and corners of the catalyst to better expose the active sites, which has primarily led to increased catalytic activity and selectivity. Controlling the local pH, employing a high-pressure reactor, and using systems with three-phase boundaries can tune the mass transport properties of reactants at the catalyst surface. The reported electrocatalytic performances are summarized afterward to provide insight into which strategies have critical effects on the production of formate. © 2020 by the authors.

Design/methodology/approach: Based on interviews, field observations and analysis of documents, case studies of international forestry companies and wood energy in local areas of Chile and Sweden are examined comparatively. A conceptual framework combining political ecology and environmental communication is developed to approach the cases. Findings: The paper finds that the two international forestry companies studied here have widely incorporated the use of wood energy as a renewable and carbon neutral energy strategy for their forestry business. Second, the paper finds that wood energy is used as a way to reproduce forestry development in the two countries, which is contested by NGOs and activists which are today articulating critical approaches to forestry development in the two countries. Third, related to the former finding, the paper finds that the incorporation of wood energy into the forest sector’s interests in Chile and Sweden takes place in the context of important social-ecological conflicts related to industrial forestry development. Originality/value: The paper’s analytical framework helps to analyse the social-ecological nature of international business and the way they organise material practices and communicative meaning around renewable energy.

Energy storage and pollutant reduction in the city play a crucial role in the process of conserving the existing energy. In addition, the transportation sector should be emphasized due to its importance. Further, it can bring significant amounts of annual economic savings to the people and governments by reducing the energy consumption and adverse environmental effects, as well as reducing the travel time and unwanted delays. Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the most important parameters of environmental pollutant emissions in the urban transport sector and develop the system dynamics model of Tehran urban transport. To this aim, six scenarios including Business As Usual, Priority to the Development of Public Transport, Technical Progress, Administrative Rules and Regulations Management (ARM), Travel Demand Management (TDM), and Comprehensive Policy (CP) were quantitatively analyzed. Based on the results, both TDM and ARM scenarios were effective in the short term. Although CO2 emissions in the TDM scenario were estimated at about 155,072 million kilograms in 2015, which was better than all individual policies, the reduction of the ARM scenario was better after 2019 and the CO2 emissions of the ARM scenario were estimated to be 153,940 million kilograms in 2025. However, the CP scenario had generally the best performance compared with all the individual policies. Finally, by implementing the scenarios simultaneously, we observed that each plays a role in improving the situation while reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions significantly. In particular, CO2 emissions in the CP scenario were estimated to be 125,934 million kilograms by 2025. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CO2 emission; Energy consumption; System dynamics; Urban transport","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy storage; Energy utilization; System theory; Tourism industry; Travel time; CO2 emission reduction; Environmental pollutants; Environmental pollutions; Reducing energy consumption; System dynamics approach; System dynamics model; Travel demand management; Urban transport sector; Urban transportation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; energy use; urban policy; urban transport; Iran; Tehran [Iran]; Tehran [Tehran (PRV)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079684835

Genetic improvements in carbon sequestration are also promising, implying a possibility for further financial gains. Research Highlights: Including carbon pricing (i.e., timber production combined with carbon sequestration) with genetically improved material improves financial performance compared to pure timber production. Furthermore, the proportion of carbon benefit (%) of absolute bare land value fluctuates between 27% and 42%, indicating a substantial role of carbon sequestration to financial performance. Background and Objectives: Until now, economic analyses of the impact of tree improvement have mainly dealt with growth performance: volume yield or height growth. Yet planted forests can have a significant contribution to carbon sequestration, which will play a major role in carbon markets. This study focuses on comparing the financial performance between genetically improved and unimproved reforestation material when stand management is optimized according to timber production or to joint production (timber and carbon sequestration together). Another goal is to reveal possible differences in financial performance related to climatic conditions along the south-north gradient. Materials and Methods: The stand projections are based on simulations with and without genetic gains for joint production (timber + carbon) and merely timber production in eight locations in Finland. Stand-level optimization is applied for financial analyses. Results: Genetically improved reforestation material considerably enhanced financial performance when the joint production of timber and carbon was applied, regardless of the climatic region. Conclusions: If carbon pricing became a reality, there would be a distinctive shift in bare land values, which is further boosted by a genetic gain. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon pricing; Genetic gains; Joint production; Scots pine; Stand-level optimization","Costs; Economic analysis; Reforestation; Timber; Carbon sequestration; Climatic conditions; Economic performance; Financial analysis; Financial performance; Genetic improvements; Growth performance; Timber production; Carbon; carbon sequestration; economic analysis; economic impact; finance; forestry production; genetics; pollution tax; reforestation; Carbon; Chelation; Costs; Economic Analysis; Finland; Performance; Production; Reforestation; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089813692

In 2015, collective wisdom stirred the global community to agree upon two unprecedented milestones in recent human history-the Paris agreement and sustainable development goals (SDGs). The twin global agreements set a platform for collective efforts to secure socio-economic and climatic sustainability. Pakistan also joined the board to put forth policy interventions for the mitigation and adaption of climate change risks to maintain symmetry between the environmental quality and economic development. The government of Pakistan (GOP) formulated the National Climate Change Policy (NCCP (2012) and passed the Pakistan Climate Change Act (PCCA (2017) to provide an impetus for the implementation of the NCCP. Yet, an appropriate assessment and prioritization of the objectives of the NCCP are indispensable for productive and effective policies to achieve the targets. This study serves this purpose by prioritizing the climate change policy objectives (CCPOs) based on symmetric principles, i.e., energy, transport, urban and town planning, industry, and agriculture as criteria, with 17 sub-criteria in total. The fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) results show that the energy sector is the most pivotal while implementing the NCCP. Energy production is the most critical area that needs mitigation policy intervention for shifting the energy mix of the economy from high-carbon to low-carbon energy. The fuzzy AHP analysis further revealed the railway, population and urbanization, air pollution, crop growing practices and techniques as the most important related to transport, urban planning, industry, and agriculture sub-criteria, respectively. The fuzzy VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR) analysis showed the ranking of the CCPOs from high to low through the integration of policies, institutional capacity building, water security, natural resource management, natural disaster management, environmental financial structure development, and social sector development. The findings of the present research would be helpful for experts and policymakers to re-examine the NCCP and put forth action plans to achieve sustainable climate and SDGs. © 2020 by the authors.","Adaptation; Climate change policy; Decision criteria; Development; Fuzzy AHP-VIKOR; Mitigation; Sustainability; Sustainable development goals; Water management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089681777

The present study investigated cotton farmers’ climate change adaptation and its impact on increasing cotton productivity and net cotton income in Punjab province of Pakistan. A pretested and well-structured questionnaire was used for data collection of 480 cotton farmers from three major cotton-producing divisions of cotton-wheat zone of Punjab, Pakistan. Logistic regression analysis approach was used in this study to find out the factors of adaptation and propensity score matching method employed to identify connecting adaptation impact on cotton productivity and cotton income. Empirical estimates of this study indicated as owing to some external and internal constraint farmers were limited focused on adaptation while conscious about adverse effects of climate change. Usage of required and recommended types of fertilizer, variation in planting dates, and changing varieties of crop were main adaptation strategies implemented by cotton farmers. Cotton farmers’ adaptation decision was significantly influenced by some major factors as weather forecasting, market information, easy access to agricultural extension services, farming experience, and education of cotton farmer. Farm-level increase in cotton productivity and net cotton crop income was direct while overall increases in national output and improving rural area farmer well-being were indirect and significant outcomes of implementing climate change adaptation of cotton farmers. Cotton farmers were using various combinations of adaptation strategies and achieving more benefits regarding their crop productivity and net returns. Findings of the study suggest need for larger investment in farm-level extension services, farmers’ schooling, and develop climate change institutional setup for enhancing farmers’ adaptation capability to increasing cotton productivity, improving well-being of farming community, and securing agriculture from future climatic uncertainties. Future policies must deal with farm-level limitations of advanced adaptation measures like making available information and sustaining sponsoring soil conservation practices, launching climate smart varieties and advanced adaptation measures based on various agro-ecological zones. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation; Climate change; Cotton productivity; Pakistan; Punjab","adaptive management; agroecology; cash cropping; climate change; cotton; crop production; cultivar; ecozone; strategic approach; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]; Gossypium hirsutum; Triticum aestivum; agricultural land; agricultural worker; agriculture; climate change; human; Pakistan; Agriculture; Climate Change; Farmers; Farms; Humans; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085704636

A simple Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) method was used in selecting the three (3) representative renewable energy (RE) businesses based on registered energy projects by the Energy Commission (EC) of Ghana. The analysis compared the 3 business sites with regard to generating power: (1) feeding to the national grid (FiT) (2) for self-consumption (prosumers) and (3) for agricultural use (through irrigation). The result showed that hybridization of solar and waste to energy systems is feasible with the use of manual change over for small and non-critical applications and smart energy control systems for community based and critical applications. It also revealed that integrating solar PV system with an existing biogas plant is both feasible in terms of technical and cost-effective wise to boost the power production for daily usage. However, the hybrid power system would be viable at an operational cost of 40% revenue and at a FiT unit price of $0.17/kWh. Further, the study found that adding a biogas plant to an existing solar PV plant would be more expensive. In all, solar–biogas hybrid power system has a great future through its operational flexibility of mitigating potential shortfall in power, both seasonally and diurnally, and assuring a more secure and efficient supply of energy for communities both grid and non-grid connected. The use of energy from renewable sources, by its efficiency and reduction of carbon footprints, will contribute to the attainment of the core objectives of some key global protection and socio-economic development initiatives/programs including Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) - namely SDGs 7,13. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Hybrid power system; Hybrid solar–biogas system; Multi criteria analysis; Renewable energy; Sustainable development goals",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85083880309

This narrative is based on two assumptions- first, that project will be able to offset the opportunity cost of land and labour through carbon and other benefits and second assumption being that social, economic, political and biophysical factors will remain largely stable and not affect the land use significantly. This research critically evaluates these assumptions with the help of empirical evidence from a project in Haryana in India. The analysis suggests that various socioeconomic factors such as the development context of the region, changes in crop, wage and carbon prices have increased the opportunity cost of land manifold. Similarly, factors such as increased uncertainty over resource rights and biophysical factors have adversely affected the land use choices and project viability. Around 50% of the participants have changed the land use affecting the project viability. The opportunity cost of participation has been unevenly high for marginal and poor participants, who are worst affected. Hence, it can be argued that these universal land use assumptions of forest carbon projects are questionable. These findings have implications for the role and design of forest carbon projects in the broad context of climate mitigation. The land use change and forestry options through market based forest carbon projects might not offer as big a mitigation opportunity as is generally projected in the literature due to changing opportunity costs of land, complex property rights and other factors. Hence it might require recalibration of the role of these projects in the mitigation strategies at local,national and global levels. Similarly, the forest carbon projects need to be designed based on a comprehensive assessment of land use, which considers not only a dynamic and differential opportunity cost across various stakeholders, but also other sociocultural and political factors, which can impact the land use and sustainability of the project. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon; CDM; Forestry; India; Land use","carbon; forest ecosystem; forestry; land use change; strategic approach; sustainability; agriculture; Article; crop; forest; guar; Haryana; household; human; India; land use; nonhuman; opportunity cost; socioeconomics; climate change; environmental protection; forest; forestry; Haryana; India; Carbon; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forestry; Forests; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084046467

With the aim to face the COVID-19 data collection, harmonization and integration problems, we present the design and development of COVID-WAREHOUSE, a data warehouse that models, integrates and stores the COVID-19 data made available daily by the Italian Protezione Civile Department and several pollution and climate data made available by the Italian Regions. After an automatic ETL (Extraction, Transformation and Loading) step, COVID-19 cases, pollution measures and climate data, are integrated and organized using the Dimensional Fact Model, using two main dimensions: time and geographical location. COVID-WAREHOUSE supports OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) analysis, provides a heatmap visualizer, and allows easy extraction of selected data for further analysis. The proposed tool can be used in the context of Public Health to underline how the pandemic is spreading, with respect to time and geographical location, and to correlate the pandemic to pollution and climate data in a specific region. Moreover, public decision-makers could use the tool to discover combinations of pollution and climate conditions correlated to an increase of the pandemic, and thus, they could act in a consequent manner. Case studies based on data cubes built on data from Lombardia and Puglia regions are discussed. Our preliminary findings indicate that COVID-19 pandemic is significantly spread in regions characterized by high concentration of particulate in the air and the absence of rain and wind, as even stated in other works available in literature. © 2020 by the authors.

Niger is one of the most affected countries, where, there is little knowledge of farmers’ perceptions of climate risks and adaptation strategies. This research aimed to address these knowledge gaps. In total 160 farm households were randomly selected from two villages and respondents were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and a regression model were used for data analysis. Based on the survey results, the perceived risks include temperature increases, short rain season, recurrent droughts, stronger winds, increased pests, and diseases and reduced crop yields. Agronomic practices including crop association and diversification, changing planting dates, use of improved seed varieties, use of mineral fertilizers were implemented as adaptation strategies. Strategy adoption was significantly influenced by farming experience, education, farm and household size, soil fertility, livestock ratio. 80% of farmers adjusted their farming system, and the level of adaptation was significantly determined by soil fertility, climate change information, food production, and number of strategies adopted.

Gross primary production (GPP) is the amount of carbon captured by plants and it is an important biophysical parameter in the spatio-temporal dynamics of CO2. GPP estimates derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are converted to the forest area and compared. GPP is estimated through a light use efficiency model (LUE) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) as a proxy of greenness to address spatial and temporal variation in terrestrial photosynthetic activities. This study is important because the output will be used as a reference to estimate the approximate total carbon in Kelantan. Estimation GPP of Kelantan state is also useful for natural resource and land management, regional carbon cycle analysis, ecosystem status assessment, and environmental change monitoring. The objective of this study is to estimate Gross Primary Production (GPP) value of forested area in Kelantan using MODIS data. MODIS data was preprocessed, classified and analysed to get the estimated GPP of study site. The results show that average GPP value of Kelantan was estimated within the range of 0 to 646 gC/m2/month. In average, GPP in Kelantan was at 428.63 gC/m2/month. Gua Musang recorded the highest GPP value, while the lowest GPP value detected were in Kota Bharu, Tumpat and Bachok where lot of development are found at the area. The estimation of GPP in Kelantan using MODIS data is a timely significant method. However, the requirement of more study that uses MODIS data in different terrestrial types and vegetation is needed for future study. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Forestry; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Biophysical parameters; Enhanced vegetation index; Gross primary production; Light-use-efficiency models; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Photosynthetic activity; Spatial and temporal variation; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Radiometers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090124064

Here we conducted fluid transport experiments on Carrara marble fractures with a novel customized surface topography. Transmissivity measurements were conducted under mechanical loading conditions representative of deep geothermal reservoirs (normal stresses from 20 to 70 MPa and shear stresses from 0 to 30 MPa). A numerical procedure simulating normal contact and fluid flow through fractures with complex geometries was validated toward experiments. Using it, we isolated the effects of roughness parameters on fracture fluid flow. Under normal loading, we find that (i) the transmissivity decreases with normal loading and is strongly dependent on fault surface geometry and (ii) the standard deviation of heights (hRMS) and macroscopic wavelength of the surface asperities control fracture transmissivity. Transmissivity evolution is nonmonotonic, with more than 4 orders of magnitude difference for small variations of macroscopic wavelength and hRMS roughness. Reversible elastic shear loading has little effect on transmissivity; it can increase or decrease depending on contact geometry and overall stress state on the fault. Irreversible shear displacement (up to 1 mm offset) slightly decreases transmissivity and its variation with irreversible shear displacements can be predicted numerically and geometrically at low normal stress only. Finally, irreversible changes in surface roughness (plasticity and wear) due to shear displacement result in a permanent decrease of transmissivity when decreasing differential stress. Generally, reduction of a carbonate fault's effective stress increases its transmissivity while inducing small shear displacements does not. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

Monitoring was made by MARGA (Monitoring AeRosol and Gases in ambient Air) under winter fog experiment (WIFEX) program of the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), Government of India. The result based on the analysis of the data so generated reveals that Cl−, NH4+, NO3− and SO42− were dominant ions in order which collectively constituted 96.8 and 97.3% of the of the total measured ionic mass in PM1 and PM2.5 respectively. Their overall average concentrations in PM1 were 19.5 ± 19.7, 18.4 ± 10.5, 16.6 ± 8.7 and 10.3 ± 5.7 μg/m3 and in PM2.5 were 36.0 ± 33.9, 32.7 ± 17.2, 28.5 ± 13.6 and 19.9 ± 13.9 μg/m3. Average concentrations of HCl, HNO3, HNO2, SO2 and NH3 trace gases were 0.7 ± 0.3, 2.7 ± 1.1, 6.6 ± 4.7, 22.0 ± 12.3 and 25.7 ± 9.1 μg/m3 respectively. Weather parameters along with low mixing height played significant role in the occurrence of high concentration of these chemical species. NH4+ was the prime neutralizer of the acidic components and mostly occurred in (NH4)2SO4/NH4HSO4, NH4NO3 and NH4Cl molecular forms. Major sources of these chemical species were fossil fuel combustion in aviation activity and transportation, coal burning in thermal power plants, industrial processes and emissions from biomass burning and agro-based activity. The quality of air with respect to PM2.5 always remained deteriorated. It became alarming during low visibility period mainly due to high concentration of Cl−, NO3−, SO42− and NH4+. Both meteorological and chemical processes interactively fed each other which occasionally resulted in fog development and visibility degradation.

Estimates show that in the year 2011, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from developing countries constituted about 63% of the world’s total, compared with only 37% for developed countries. Thus, developing countries must be an integral part of global actions toward combating climate change. In Saudi Arabia, the energy use per capita of 6937.23 kg of oil equivalent in 2014 was 3.6 times the global average and the per capita CO2 emission of 19.53 metric tons was the seventh highest. With sensitive ecosystems, limited freshwater resources and substantial coastal developments, the country is vulnerable to climate change. As such, the country has recently initiated some sustainable urban planning strategies in its major urban centers as part of its climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. However, few studies have assessed the extent of the implementation of the strategies. Based on secondary data analysis, this article found that the implementation of the strategies is at infancy with urban greening, public transportation, and green building projects gradually gaining prominence. The paper recommends more focus on rising building and population density, mandating mixed land uses, as well as public enlightenment and engagement about climate change impacts and energy choices. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation and mitigation; Building density; Carbon emissions; Climate change; Compact cities; Environment; Greenhouse gases; Sustainability; Transportation; Urban planning","action plan; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; energy use; estimation method; greenhouse gas; greenspace; mitigation; policy implementation; public transport; strategic approach; sustainability; urban planning; Saudi Arabia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069183050

Although various dust removal methods have been introduced, the self-cleaning method is favorable because of the cost-effective cleaning process. Dust mitigation from surfaces by water droplets, mimicking nature, is fruitful because it involves low-cost operations. The dust removal rate from surfaces by rolling water droplets can be increased by creating bubbles inside the rolling droplets through which dust pinning on surfaces can be lowered and the droplet liquid infusion on dust surfaces can be enhanced. This study provides insight into bubble formation and dust mitigation in carbonated and distilled water droplets located on hydrophobic surfaces by examining bubble formation and dust distribution inside the water droplets. The behavior of bubbles inside the carbonated water droplet and emanating from the hydrophobic surface was recorded and analyzed by incorporating high-speed camera data. The influence of environmental dust particles on bubble formation was also assessed. Bubble velocity was formulated analytically and the findings are compared with those of the experimental values. Findings revealed that the bubble formation inside the carbonated droplet fluid had a significant effect on the transition of dust particles from the hydrophobic surface towards the droplet fluid. The volume concentration of dust particles in the carbonated water droplet was almost 1.5 to 2.5 times larger than that of the distilled water droplet. The dissolution of alkaline and alkaline earth metal compounds in the carbonated droplet fluid acted like nucleation centers for bubble formation; hence, the number of bubbles formed on the dusty hydrophobic surface was greater than that of the clean hydrophobic surface. Some bubbles attached at the dust particle surface contributed to dust mobility in the droplet fluid, which occurred particularly in the droplet bottom region. This enhanced the velocity of the dust particles transiting from the dusty hydrophobic surface to the droplet fluid interior by almost 1.5 times in the early period. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Alkaline earth metal compounds; Bubble formation; Carbonation; Cost effectiveness; Dust control; High speed cameras; Hydrophobicity; Surface chemistry; Bubble velocities; Carbonated waters; Dust distribution; Experimental values; Hydrophobic surfaces; Low-cost operations; Nucleation center; Volume concentration; Drops",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089202717

It employs the STochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model. The spatial econometric approach is applied to examine the validity of the pollution haven hypothesis (PHH) and the pollution halo hypothesis (P-HH) (from now on, we will use the acronyms PHH and P-HH to denote the pollution haven hypothesis and pollution halo hypothesis, respectively). The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are linked to the study results with a focus on cleaner production practices. The global Moran’s I, local Moran’s I, and Lagrange multiplier (LM) tests are used to ascertain the existence of spatial autocorrelation (SAR) and determine its trend. We also apply the spatial lag model (SLM), the spatial error model (SEM), and the spatial Durbin model (SDM) to achieve the study objectives. Data are analyzed by using the SDM on the basis of the results of the Wald and likelihood ratio tests. The results of the LM and global and local Moran’s I tests confirm the existence of SAR. The SDM results reveal that a slight increase in CO2 is an influence of the FDI on EP. Findings support the existence of PHH in the Arab countries. The direct effect of the FDI is increased CO2 and environmental degradation, and the spatial spillover effects are statistically insignificant. This study suggests a set of policies for managing and directing FDI toward clean technology-based industries and reduced CO2 emissions. Such policies may contribute to the achievement of some SDGs and balancing economic development and environmental sustainability according to the cleaner production practice perspective in the Arab countries and other states with similar conditions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Arab countries; Environmental pollution; FDI; Pollution halo hypothesis; Pollution haven hypothesis; Spatial econometric analysis","Arab world; cleaner production; econometrics; economic development; environmental degradation; environmental economics; environmental fate; foreign direct investment; numerical model; panel data; spillover effect; Sustainable Development Goal; carbon dioxide; Arab; economic development; human; investment; pollution; spatial analysis; Arabs; Carbon Dioxide; Economic Development; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Investments; Spatial Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087368902

The study explored the potential of applying waste-to-energy (WTE) systems to alleviate the negative environmental impacts of waste disposal while providing a renewable source of energy. An extensive field study was conducted on 1200 households in the urban centers of four representative governorates, with the aim of finding the waste generation rates and composition in correlation with key socioeconomic features such as household income, family size, and electricity consumption. The per capita waste generation rates were found to range between 0.63 and 0.82 kg/day, and the waste was composed mostly of food (41–70%) followed by plastics (6–16%). The generation rates had significant negative and nonsignificant positive correlations with the family size and electricity consumption, respectively. The Egyptian governorates were sub-grouped under the four surveyed ones based on analogous local features. Accordingly, a high-level assessment suggested that a national strategic WTE plan for the urban regions in Egypt would involve incineration in five governorates and anaerobic digestion in the remaining ones. The proposed plan would lead to an estimated total energy production of 11 TWh per year, and an annual reduction in the country’s carbon footprint by approximately 7307 Gg CO2eq. Based on the current market conditions and waste service fees, the national WTE plan would be financially unviable; however, excluding capital investments, potential annual revenues could cover the operating cost and provide a steady profit. Charging 24 USD/ton as tipping fees for the WTE plants or increasing the electricity tariff to 0.076 USD/kWh, financial profitability of the proposed national plan would be achieved.

One opinion is that anthropogenic activities have distinct carbon footprints – measured as total emissions of GHGs resulting from an activity, in this case, “agricultural operations”. In contrast, it is argued that agriculture potentially serves to mitigate GHGs emissions when the best management practices are implemented. We review the literature on agricultural carbon footprints in the context of agricultural practices including soil, water and nutrient management. It has been reported that the management practices that enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) in arid and semi-arid areas include conversion of conventional tillage practices to conservation tillage approaches. We found that agricultural management in arid and semi-arid regions, which have specific characteristics related to high temperatures and low rainfall conditions, requires different practices for maintenance and restoration of SOC and for control of soil erosion compared to those used in Mediterranean, tropical regions. We recommend that in order to meet the global climate targets, quantification of net global warming potential of agricultural practices requires precise estimates of local, regional and global carbon budgets. We have conducted and present a case study for observing the development of deep soil carbon profile resulting from a 10-year wheat-cotton and wheat-maize rotation on semi-arid lands. Results showed that no tillage with mulch application had 14% (37.2 vs 43.3 Mg ha−1) higher SOC stocks in comparison to conventional tillage with mulch application. By implementing no tillage in conjunction with mulch application, lower carbon losses from soil can mitigate the risks associated with global warming. Therefore, it is necessary to reconsider agricultural practices and soil erosion after a land-use change when calculating global carbon footprints. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprints; Semi-arid lands; Soil erosion; Soil tillage practices","nitrogen fertilizer; organic carbon; rain; soil organic matter; carbon; agricultural management; best management practice; carbon footprint; conservation tillage; global warming; greenhouse gas; human activity; literature review; management practice; soil carbon; soil erosion; agricultural land; agricultural management; air temperature; ambient air; Article; biomass production; carbon dynamics; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; comparative study; conservation tillage; conventional tillage; global climate; grain yield; greenhouse effect; growing season; harvest index; high temperature; land use; maize; mulch; no tillage; nutrient management; soil analysis; soil depth; soil erosion; soil management; soil moisture; water management; wheat; agriculture; carbon cycle; soil; Gossypium hirsutum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Soil; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084256705
