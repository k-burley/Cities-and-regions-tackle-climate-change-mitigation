Soil microbial communities in agricultural soil responded to the n-hexadecane addition more rapidly compared to those of forest soil, with lag-periods of about 23 ± 10 and 68 ± 13 hours, respectively. Insignificant difference in the lag-period duration was detected for agricultural (tlag = 30 ± 13 h) and forest (tlag = 30 ± 14 h) soils treated with n-hexadecanoic (palmitic) acid. These results demonstrate that the soil microbiota has different metabolic activities for using n-hexadecane as a reductive hydrocarbon and n-hexadecanoic acid as a partly oxidized hydrocarbon. The corresponding δ13C of respired CO2 after the addition of the hydrocarbon contaminants to soils indicates a shift in microbial activity towards the consumption of exogenous substrates with a more complete degradation of n-hexadecane in the agricultural soil, for which some initial contents of hydrocarbons are inherent. It is supposed that the observed deviation of RQ from theoretically calculated value under microbial substrate mineralization is determined by difference in the time (Δti) of registration of CO2 production and O2 consumption. Positive priming effect (PE) of n-hexadecane and negative PE of n-hexadecanoic (palmitic) acid were detected in agricultural and forest soils. It is suggested that positive PE of n-hexadecane is conditioned by the induction of microbial enzymes that perform hydroxylation/oxygenation of stable SOM compounds mineralized by soil microbiota to CO2. The microbial metabolism coupled with oxidative decarboxylation of n-hexadecanoic acid is considered as one of the most probable causes of the revealed negative PE value. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","hydrocarbon contamination; microbial activity; O2 consumption and CO2 evolution; priming effect; respiratory quotient; respired CO2-C isotopic signature","agricultural soil; biodegradation; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; forest soil; hydrocarbon; metabolism; microbial activity; mineralization; soil microorganism; soil pollution; topsoil; Fagus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860910600

The angular resolution was from ∼2″ to ∼5″ for all instruments. With the SMA we detected a total of about 50 spectral lines of 20 different molecules (including isotopologues). About half of the lines and half of the species (in particular N2H+, SiO, C 34S, DCN, DNC, DCO+, HC3N, H2CO, H2CS, SO2) have not been previously reported in S255IR and partly in S255N at high angular resolution. Our data reveal several new clumps in the S255IR and S255N areas through their millimeter wave continuum emission. Masses of these clumps are estimated at a few solar masses. The line widths greatly exceed expected thermal widths. These clumps have practically no association with NIR or radio continuum sources, implying a very early stage of evolution. At the same time, our SiO data indicate the presence of high-velocity outflows related to some of these clumps. In some cases, strong molecular emission at velocities of the quiescent gas has no detectable counterpart in the continuum. We discuss the main features of the distribution of NH3, N2H+, and deuterated molecules.

Although the yields of the DMNNs are low, ≤0.3%, the DMNN (and ethylnitronaphthalene) profiles from chamber experiments match well with those observed in polluted urban areas under conditions where OH radical-initiated chemistry is dominant. Daytime OH radical and nighttime NO3 radical reactions appear to account for the alkylnitronaphthalenes formed and their observed profiles under most urban atmospheric conditions, with profiles reflecting daytime OH chemistry modified by contributions from isomers formed by any NO3 radical chemistry that had occurred. Since the formation yields and NO2 dependencies for the formation of a number of alkylnitronaphthalenes have now been measured, the effect of NOx emissions control strategies on their atmospheric formation can be quantitatively assessed, and the decrease in formation of these genotoxic species may provide a previously unrecognized health benefit of NOx control. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Atmospheric conditions; Atmospheric formations; Chamber experiments; Concentration ranges; Dimethylnaphthalene; Emissions control; Gasphase; Genotoxic; Health benefits; Isomer distributions; OH radical; Radical chemistry; Radical reactions; Urban areas; Free radicals; Isomers; Naphthalene; Nitrogen oxides; Reaction kinetics; Atmospheric chemistry; hydroxyl radical; naphthalene derivative; nitrite; nitrogen dioxide; oxygen; atmospheric chemistry; concentration (composition); emission control; gas phase reaction; health care; hydroxyl radical; naphthalene; nitrogen dioxide; toxic substance; urban atmosphere; urban pollution; air pollution; article; atmosphere; chemical reaction; concentration (parameters); gas; isomer; photolysis; urban area; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Gases; Hydroxyl Radical; Isomerism; Kinetics; Naphthalenes; Nitrates; Photolysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863970745

However, land-use change to bioenergy crops can result in carbon emissions from soil and vegetation in amounts that could take decades to compensate. Perennial grasses such as Miscanthus offer a possible solution to this problem as measurements on experimental plots planted with Miscanthus have shown significant carbon sequestration in the soil. It can, however, be expected that sequestration potentials in commercial use might differ from those measured in experimental plots due to different farming practices and soil characteristics. For this study, Miscanthus plantations on 16 farms in SE Ireland as well as on-farm controls representing the former land-use (grassland and tillage) have been examined. The Miscanthus plantations were 2-3 years old. Soil organic carbon (SOC) content and a number of soil properties were measured and the amount of Miscanthus-derived carbon was determined using the 13C natural abundance method. On both former tillage fields and grasslands, although there were no significant differences in SOC contents between Miscanthus and control sites, it was shown that 2-3 years after Miscanthus establishment, 1.82 ± 1.69 and 2.17 ± 1.73 Mg ha-1 of the SOC under former-tilled and former grassland respectively were Miscanthus-derived. Mixed-effects models were used to link the total SOC concentrations and Miscanthus-derived carbon to the landuse parameters as well as to soil properties. It was shown that on control sites, pH had an effect on total SOC. In the case of Miscanthus-derived carbon, the initial SOC content, pH, former land-use and crop age had significant effects. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Carbon sequestration; Energy crops; Land-use change; Miscanthus; Soil organic carbon","Agricultural machinery; Agriculture; Biofuels; Biomass; Climate change; Crops; Forestry; Land use; Organic carbon; pH effects; Soil surveys; Soils; Carbon sequestration; Energy crops; Land-use change; Miscanthus; Soil organic carbon; Soil pollution; Miscanthus; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866507452

The minimum technical standards necessary for approaching ecological sustainability directly contravene the prospects for financial profitability. Therefore, industrial-scale SFM is likely to lead to the degradation and devaluation of primary tropical forests as surely as widespread conventional unmanaged logging does today. Recent studies also show that logging in the tropics, even using SFM techniques, releases significant carbon dioxide and that carbon stocks once stored in logged timber and slash takes decades to rebuild. These results beg for a reevaluation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change proposals to apply a Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation subsidy for the widespread implementation of SFM logging in tropical forests.

It shows that this policy has been developed from a voluntary approach, aimed at reducing the specific emissions of passenger cars, to a complex integrated strategy. Legally binding efficiency requirements for passenger cars have been set in the meantime and efficiency requirements for other road vehicles are in preparation. More important for the long-term success of the decarbonization strategy, however, are strategic decisions on alternative fuels and alternative power-train technologies. But the key for the long-term success of transport decarbonization lies outside the transport sector: It is the production of renewable electricity, be it as future transport fuel or as energy source for the generation of low carbon transport fuels. Currently no other approach seems to be able to deliver the emission reductions necessary to meet the goal of limiting global temperature increase to maximum 2°C. Most likely it also requires to set-up new regulatory approaches. However, the way toward the realization of this vision is full of obstacles. In fact, it requires re-inventing motorized transport, thus entailing significant changes in the automobile industry, but even more drastic changes in the oil industry. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

In this paper, the effect of phosphorus on particulate matter (PM 10) formation during co-combustion of coal and sewage sludge was intensively investigated in a 25 kW one-dimensional, down-fired pulverized coal combustor. PM 10 was collected from the furnace centerline in the outlet of the flue gas cooler using a two-stage nitrogen-aspirated, water-cooling isokinetic sampling probe, followed by an electric low-pressure impactor (ELPI). The particle size distributions (PSDs) of the PM 10 mass concentration during co-combustion exhibit a high sub-micrometer peak and a relatively low super-micrometer peak compared to those in pure coal combustion. Considering the high ash content of sewage sludge, at a 15% thermal blending ratio, the mass concentration of the total fly ash and PM 10+ (dp &gt; 10 μm) increases from 1088 to 5059 mg N -1 m -3 and from 547 to 4403 mg N -1 m -3, respectively, with respect to pure coal combustion. However, the mass concentrations of fine particulates, including PM 1, PM 2.5, and PM 10, still maintain the similar emission level with coal combustion. The phosphonation of inorganic matters during the cooling of flue gas obviously reduces the mass concentration of fine particles. When the fraction of sewage sludge was 15% (on a thermal basis), the phosphate and P 2O 5 were appreciably rich in the ultrafine mode. The PSDs of phosphorus indicate the intermediate mode, knowing as a fact that the formed phosphates of inorganic metals cause finer particles to form larger agglomerates. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Ash contents; Centerlines; Cocombustion; Emission level; Fine particles; Fine particulates; Finer particles; Gas cooler; High thermal; Impactors; Inorganic matters; Inorganic metals; Iso-kinetic sampling probes; Mass concentration; Municipal sewage sludge; Optimal operation; Particulate Matter; Particulate matter formations; Phosphonation; Phosphorus transformations; Pollutant emission; Pulverized coal combustors; Submicrometers; Thermal blending; Ultrafine; Blending; Coal; Flue gases; Fly ash; Micrometers; Phosphorus; Sewage sludge; Waste incineration; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862679519

Four sets of OIC are used to initialize the 12-month hindcasts of the tropical climate from 1979 to 2007, using the Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2), the current operational climate prediction model at the National Centers for Environmental Predictions (NCEP). These OICs are chosen from four ocean analyses produced by the NCEP and the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). For each hindcast starting from a given OIC, four ensemble members are generated with different atmosphere and land initial states. The predictive skill in the tropical Pacific Ocean is assessed based on the ensemble mean hindcasts from each individual as well as multiple oceanic analyses. To reduce the climate drift from various oceanic analyses, an anomaly initialization strategy is used for all hindcasts. The results indicate that there exists a substantial spread in the sea surface temperature (SST) prediction skill with different ocean analyses. Specifically, the ENSO prediction skill in terms of the anomaly correlation of Nio-3.4 index can differ by as much as 0.1-0.2 at lead times longer than 2months. The ensemble mean of the predictions initialized from all four ocean analyses gives prediction skill equivalent to the best one derived from the individual ocean analysis. It is suggested that more accurate OIC can improve the ENSO prediction skill and an ensemble ocean initialization has the potential of enhancing the skill at the present stage.

The simulations under designed scenarios were implemented over a 2-level nested grid domain for comparing the difference of PM 10 concentrations under restriction and no-restrictions situations. The restriction measures include alternate-day vehicle driving, construction activities, trans-boundary emissions from neighboring provinces, and vehicle restrictions during the post-Olympic period. Meteorological contributions to the air quality improvement were also examined. The results show that significant improvement of air quality in Beijing during the 2008 Games was attributed largely to these restriction measures, although favorable weather conditions play an important role. Also, during the post-Olympic period, daily vehicle restrictions implemented temporarily under extreme weather conditions played a crucial role in alleviating Beijing's air pollution. Beijing not only needs to take continuing efforts to addresses its own PM 10 problem, but also has a clear self-interest in demanding better environmental performance from neighboring provinces.

Various financial incentive programs have been developed to promote the adoption of these products. However, their effectiveness in attracting consumers is not very well understood. In this study, we investigated impacts of financial incentives on homeowner's decision making towards six EERE products. Two forms of incentives, tax credits and interest-free loans, were examined through a household mailing survey in Florida, the United States. Results showed that, although half of the respondents were interested in EERE products, the high investment cost was a major concern that hindered their purchase activities. Homeowners were attracted to financial incentives and valued tax credits much higher than interest-free loans. The current federal home energy tax credit levels were found to attract only 2-12 percent of homeowners to buy EERE products. The willingness of participation was especially low for the costly products (such as solar panels). The participation rate was also very low for lower income (i.e., annual household income below $50,000) families living in older residences. This study contributes to the understanding of economic and social aspects of consumer decision making on energy efficiency and alternative energy. © 2012.","Energy efficiency; Loan subsidies; Tax credits","Alternative energy; Carbon emissions; Consumer decision making; Consumer Response; Energy efficient; Energy taxes; Financial incentives; Florida; Household income; Investment costs; Loan subsidies; Participation rate; Renewable energies; Solar panels; Tax credits; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Purchasing; Social aspects; Surveys; Taxation; Investments; alternative energy; carbon emission; decision making; emission control; energy conservation; energy efficiency; finance; household income; household survey; renewable resource; residential energy; tax incentive; Florida [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862260154

Encapsulation of organic dyes into nanoparticles (NPs) is an effective strategy to minimize photobleaching, but classical organic dye molecules tend to have their fluorescence quenched in aggregate states, which is termed aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ). Here we demonstrate our attempt to tackle this problem through the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) strategy. 3,4:9,10-Tetracarboxylic perylene bisimide (PBI) is a well-known organic dye with a serious ACQ problem. By attaching two tetraphenylethene (TPE) moieties to the 1,7-positions, the ACQ-characteristic PBI-derivative was converted to an AIE-characteristic molecule. The obtained PBI derivative (BTPEPBI) exhibits several advantages over classical PBI derivatives, including pronounced fluorescence enhancement in aggregate state, red to near infrared emission, and facile fabrication into uniform NPs. Studies on the staining of MCF-7 breast cancer cells and in vivo imaging of a tumor-bearing mouse model with BTPEPBI-containing NPs reveal that they are effective fluorescent probes for cancer cell and in vivo tumor diagnosis with high specificity, high photostability and good fluorescence contrast. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2012.",,"Cells; Diagnosis; Fluorescence; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Infrared devices; Medical imaging; Molecules; Photobleaching; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Tumors; Aggregate state; Aggregation-induced emissions; Bio-imaging; Cancer cells; Facile fabrication; Fluorescence enhancement; Fluorescent probes; High specificity; In-vivo; In-Vivo imaging; MCF-7 breast cancer cells; Mouse models; Near-infrared emissions; Organic dye; Organic dye molecules; Organic nanoparticles; Perylene bisimides; Photo-stability; Photostable; Tetraphenylethene; Tumor diagnosis; Aggregates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863977795

We infer that NGC2392 might have an intrinsic structure similar to the bipolar nebula Mz3, which also exhibits a number of [Fe III] lines arising from the central regions. In this scenario, the inner and outer regions of NGC2392 correspond to the inner lobes and the outer outflows of Mz3, respectively.

The impact of debris cover has not yet been taken into account in regional- or global-scale assessments of glacier mass balances and freshwater resources by using physically based numerical models. Here, a surface energy-mass balance model that accounts for the significance of debris cover and its effect on the ice melt rate is applied to reconstruct the glacier mass balance of Hailuogou catchment, which is located in the south-eastern Tibetan Plateau and contains three debris-covered and four debris-free monsoonal maritime glaciers. According to our calculations, the glaciers in Hailuogou catchment show a mean annual balance of -0.42. m water equivalent (w.e.) per year, for a total mass loss of 24.3. m w.e. over the period 1952-2009. A comparison of summer temperature- and precipitation-mass balance/equilibrium line altitude (ELA) relations indicates that the glaciers in the catchment are much more sensitive to temperature change than to precipitation change. In the last 20. yrs, increasing summer temperature is the main cause of rapid wasting of the glacier mass in the catchment. Meanwhile, the presence of supraglacial debris markedly accelerates glacier mass loss, resulting in the unstable termini of debris-covered glaciers in Hailuogou catchment. This highlights the importance of debris cover for understanding glacier mass balance and hydrology in the Tibetan Plateau. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Catchment scale; Debris cover; Glacier; Mass balance; Tibetan Plateau","Balance model; Catchment scale; Debris-covered glacier; Fresh water resources; Glacier mass balance; Global climates; Mass balance; Mass loss; Melt rate; Physically based; Precipitation change; Summer temperature; Temperature changes; Tibetan Plateau; Total mass; Water equivalent; Catchments; Climate change; Debris; Glaciers; Runoff; ablation; catchment; climate change; debris flow; glacier mass balance; global climate; reconstruction; runoff; China; Hailuogou Glacier; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Sichuan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861224400

However, microbial studies have never been performed in the cold seep sediments in the SCS. In 2004, ""SONNE"" 177 cruise found two cold seep areas with different water depth in the northern SCS. Haiyang 4 area, where the water depth is around 3000 m, has already been confirmed for active seeping on the seafloor, such as microbial mats, authigenic carbonate crusts and bivalves. We investigated microbial abundance and diversity in a 5.55-m sediment core collected from this cold seep area. An integrated approach was employed including geochemistry and 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analyses. Here, we show that microbial abundance and diversity along with geochemistry profiles of the sediment core revealed a coupled reaction between sulphate reduction and methane oxidation. Acridine orange direct count results showed that microbial abundance ranges from 10 5 to 10 6 cells/g sediment (wet weight). The depth-related variation of the abundance showed the same trend as the methane concentration profile. Phylogenetic analysis indicated the presence of sulphate-reducing bacteria and anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea. The diversity was much higher at the surface, but decreased sharply with depth in response to changes in the geochemical conditions of the sediments, such as methane, sulphate concentration and total organic carbon.

When CaSO 4 was decomposed reductively by carbon monoxide (CO), usually there were CaS and/or calcium oxide (CaO) in the decomposition products of CaSO 4 depending on the reaction temperature and reactant concentrations. In this paper, the mechanism of CaSO 4 reductive decomposition by CO was studied in the framework of density functional theory (DFT). In the calculation, the exchange-correlation term was approximated by Perdew-Wang (PW91), a functional within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) family. To study the interaction of CO and CaSO 4, the transition states of CaSO 4 decomposition and the minimum energy path (MEP) were analyzed. The results showed that the CaS product could be obtained when CaSO 4 was reduced by CO with the 4:1 stoichiometric ratio of CO and CaSO 4, and the decomposition of CaSO 4 to CaSO 3 was the rate-determining step, and activation energy in this step was 191.19 kJ/mol. With the increase of the reaction temperature, the CaO product could be obtained with a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of CO and CaSO 4, and the activation energy is 318.28 kJ/mol during the process. It was found that the CaS product was formatted at a lower reaction temperature and a higher mole ratio of CO and CaSO 4, and the CaO product was preferred at a higher reaction temperature and a lower mole ratio of CO and CaSO 4. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Calcium sulfate; Calcium sulfide; Decomposition products; Density functional theories (DFT); Exchange-correlations; Generalized gradient approximations; Lower mole ratio; Lower reaction temperature; Minimum energy paths; Mole ratio; Rate determining step; Reactant concentrations; Reaction temperature; Reductive decomposition; Resource utilizations; Stoichiometric ratio; Transition state; Activation energy; Density functional theory; Driers (materials); Carbon monoxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861085229

We present a successful demonstration example in a coniferous forest of two product prototypes: fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorbed by chlorophyll of a canopy (fAPAR chl) and leaf water content (LWC), for future HyspIRI implementation at 60-m spatial resolution. For this, we used existing 30-m resolution imaging spectrometer data available from the Earth Observing One (EO-1) Hyperion satellite to simulate and prototype the level one radiometrically corrected radiance (L1R) images expected from the HyspIRI visible through shortwave infrared spectrometer. The HyspIRI-like images were atmospherically corrected to obtain surface reflectance and spectrally resampled to produce 60-m reflectance images for wavelength regions that were comparable to all seven of the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land bands. Thus, we developed MODIS-like surface reflectance in seven spectral bands at the HyspIRI-like spatial scale, which was utilized to derive fAPAR chl and LWC with a coupled canopy-leaf radiative transfer model (PROSAIL2) for the coniferous forest. With this paper, we provide additional evidence that the fAPAR chl product is more realistic in describing the physiologically active canopy than the traditional fAPAR parameter for the whole canopy (fAPAR canopy), and thus, it should replace it in ecosystem process models to reduce uncertainties in terrestrial carbon cycle and ecosystem studies. © 2012 IEEE.","Earth Observing One (EO-1) Hyperion; fAPAR canopy; fAPAR chl; foliar moisture content; Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI); leaf water content (LWC); terrestrial carbon cycle","fAPAR canopy; fAPAR chl; Hyperion; Infrared imagers; Leaf water content; Terrestrial carbon cycle; Chlorophyll; Forestry; Physiological models; Radiometers; Reflection; Satellite imagery; Spectrometers; Spectrometry; Ecosystems; absorbance; carbon cycle; chlorophyll; coniferous forest; ecosystem modeling; EOS; forest canopy; Hyperion; image analysis; leaf; MODIS; moisture content; photosynthetically active radiation; spatial resolution; surface reflectance; water content; Carbon; Chlorophylls; Ecosystems; Foliar Analysis; Forestry; Image Analysis; Leaves; Mathematical Models; Moisture Content; Satellites; Hyperion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860326063

Using input-output analysis, we calculated both direct and indirect carbon emissions in 1997, 2000, 2002, 2005 and 2007. The study aimed to classify Jiangsu's industrial sectors by the carbon reducing potential (CRP), which was indicated both by carbon reducing efficiency (CRE) and by the amount of carbon reduction (ACR), with a 1% decrease in the output of a certain industrial sector. The results indicate that the high CRE of a certain sector might be due to its high direct carbon intensity, indirect carbon intensity or high economic status. Based on the varying contexts, corresponding policy measures were provided. Moreover, export carbon emissions were abundant in sectors with the highest CRE, indicating the production of emissions due to consumption elsewhere. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon; Direct carbon intensity; Indirect carbon intensity; Industrial restructuring; Input-output analysis; Output","Economic analysis; Industry; Carbon emissions; Carbon intensity; Carbon reduction; Development stages; Economic growths; Economic status; Industrial restructuring; Industrial sector; Industrial structures; Input output analysis; Jiangsu province; Output; Policy measures; Carbon; carbon emission; consumption behavior; economic development; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; industrial production; industrial restructuring; industrial structure; input-output analysis; policy approach; China; Jiangsu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864356110

The model considers key supply chain activities including biomass harvesting/processing, transportation, and storage. The model uses the delivered feedstock cost, energy consumption, and GHG emissions as system performance criteria. The utility of the supply chain simulation model is demonstrated by considering a biomass supply chain for a biofuel facility in the lower peninsula of Michigan.

A well-defined model of macrophage activation at sites of inflammation is the treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), with the resulting production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS and other free radicals can be trapped with the nitrone spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), a cell-permeable probe with antioxidant properties, which thus interferes with free-radical-operated oxidation processes. Here we have used immuno-spin trapping to investigate the role of free-radical-operated protein oxidation in LPS-induced cytotoxicity in macrophages. Treatment of RAW 264.7 cells with LPS resulted in increased ROS production, oxidation of proteins, cell morphological changes and cytotoxicity. DMPO was found to trap protein radicals to form protein-DMPO nitrone adducts, to reduce protein carbonyls, and to block LPS-induced cell death. N-Acetylcysteine (a source of reduced glutathione), diphenyleneiodonium (an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase), and 2,2′-dipyridyl (a chelator of Fe 2) prevented LPS-induced oxidative stress and cell death and reduced DMPO-nitrone adduct formation, suggesting a critical role of ROS, metals, and protein-radical formation in LPS-induced cell cytotoxicity. We also determined the subcellular localization of protein-DMPO nitrone adducts and identified some candidate proteins for DMPO attachment by LC-MS/MS. The LC-MS/MS data are consistent with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, one of the most abundant, sensitive, and ubiquitous proteins in the cell, becoming labeled with DMPO when the cell is primed with LPS. This information will help find strategies to treat inflammation-associated tissue dysfunction by focusing on preventing free radical-operated proteotoxic stress and death of macrophages. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Antioxidant; Lipopolysaccharide; Macrophage; Protein oxidation; Reactive oxygen species; Spin trapping","5,5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline 1 oxide; acetylcysteine; free radical; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; lipopolysaccharide; protein; reactive oxygen metabolite; animal cell; article; cell death; cell structure; cellular distribution; controlled study; cytotoxicity; liquid chromatography; macrophage; mouse; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein analysis; protein carbonylation; protein degradation; tandem mass spectrometry; Acetylcysteine; Animals; Blotting, Western; Cell Death; Cells, Cultured; Cyclic N-Oxides; Free Radical Scavengers; Free Radicals; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Immunoprecipitation; Inflammation; Lipopolysaccharides; Macrophages; Mice; Nitrogen Oxides; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Protein Carbonylation; Proteins; Reactive Oxygen Species; Spin Labels; Spin Trapping; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861792679

Many host communities could be affected by increased prevalence of disease, heightening the risk of extinction for many already threatened species. To understand how host communities could be affected by changing parasite distributions, we need information on the distribution of parasites in relation to variables like temperature and rainfall that are predicted to be affected by climate change. Methodology/Principal Findings: We determined relations between prevalence of blood parasites, temperature, and seasonal rainfall in a bird community of the Australian Wet Tropics along an elevation gradient. We used PCR screening to investigate the prevalence and lineage diversity of four genera of blood parasites (Plasmodium, Haemoproteus, Leucocytozoon and Trypanosoma) in 403 birds. The overall prevalence of the four genera of blood parasites was 32.3%, with Haemoproteus the predominant genus. A total of 48 unique lineages were detected. Independent of elevation, parasite prevalence was positively and strongly associated with annual temperature. Parasite prevalence was elevated during the dry season. Conclusions/Significance: Low temperatures of the higher elevations can help to reduce both the development of avian haematozoa and the abundance of parasite vectors, and hence parasite prevalence. In contrast, high temperatures of the lowland areas provide an excellent environment for the development and transmission of haematozoa. We showed that rising temperatures are likely to lead to increased prevalence of parasites in birds, and may force shifts of bird distribution to higher elevations. We found that upland tropical areas are currently a low-disease habitat and their conservation should be given high priority in management plans under climate change. © 2012 Zamora-Vilchis et al.",,"rain; animal parasitosis; article; biodiversity; bird; blood parasite; cold climate; controlled study; endoparasite; environmental temperature; geographic distribution; global change; global climate; greenhouse effect; haemoproteus; host parasite interaction; leucocytozoon; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; parasite load; parasite transmission; parasite vector; Plasmodium; polymerase chain reaction; population abundance; prediction; prevalence; seasonal variation; species difference; species distribution; tropics; Trypanosoma; Altitude; Animals; Australia; Birds; Malaria, Avian; Prevalence; Seasons; Temperature; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862580401

The reduction in albedo associated with shrub-induced greening of the tundra is predicted to cause significant positive feedbacks to regional warming. Enhanced soil fertility arising from climate change is expected to be the primary mechanism driving shrub responses, yet our overall understanding of the relative importance of soil nitrogen(N) and phosphorus(P) availability and the significance of other ecological drivers is constrained by experiments with varying treatments, sites, and durations. We investigated dwarf birch apical stem growth responses to a wide range of ecological factors (enhanced summer temperatures, deepened snow, caribou exclusion, factorial high level nitrogen and phosphorus additions, and low level nitrogen additions) after six years of experimental manipulations in birch hummock tundra. As expected, birch apical stem growth was more strongly enhanced by the substantial increases in nutrient supply than by our changes in any of the other ecological factors. The factorial additions revealed that P availability was at least as important as that of N, and our low N additions demonstrated that growth was unresponsive to moderate increases in soil nitrogen alone. Experimental warming increased apical stem growth 2.5-fold - considerably more than in past studies - probably due to the relatively strong effect of our greenhouses on soil temperature. Together, these results have important implications for our understanding of the biogeochemical functioning of mesic tundra ecosystems as well as predicting their vegetation responses to climate change. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Arctic tundra; Betula glandulosa; Climate change; Experimental warming; Fertilization; Herbivory; Nitrogen; Nutrient limitation; Phosphorus; Shrub expansion; Snow depth","Ecology; Landforms; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Snow melting systems; Arctic tundra; Betula glandulosa; Experimental warming; Fertilization; Herbivory; Nutrient limitations; Snow depths; Climate change; albedo; deciduous tree; global warming; growth rate; growth response; herbivory; nitrogen; nutrient availability; phosphorus; soil nitrogen; tundra; Canada; Caribou Harbour; Nova Scotia; Betula glandulosa; Betula nana; Rangifer tarandus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867046378

The Trewartha and Köppen climate classification schemes are applied, and four summer-based extreme temperature indices (i.e., summer days, tropical nights, growing degree days, and cooling degree days (CDD) and two winter-based indices (frost days and heating degree days (HDD) are analyzed. To represent significantly the change in threshold indices, the monthly mean bias is corrected in model. The model result reasonably captures the temporal and spatial distribution of the present-day extreme temperatures associated with topography. It was found that in the future climate, the area of the subtropical climate zone in Korea expands northward and increases by 21% under the Trewartha classification scheme and by 35% under the Köppen classification scheme. The spatial change in extreme climate indices is significantly modulated by geographical characteristics in relation to land-ocean thermal inertia and topographical effects. The change is manifested more in coastal regions than in inland regions, except for that in summer days and HDD. Regions with higher indices in the present climate tend to reveal a larger increase in the future climate. The summer-based indices display an increasing trend, while the winter-based indices show a decreasing trend. The most significant increase is in tropical nights (+452%), whereas the most significant decrease is in HDD (-25%). As an important indicator of energy-saving applications, the changes in HDD and CDD are compared in terms of the frequency and intensity. The future changes in CDD reveal a higher frequency but a lower temperature than those in HDD. The more frequent changes in CDD may be due to a higher and less dispersed occurrence probability of extreme temperatures during the warm season. The greater increase in extreme temperature events during the summer season remains an important implication of projecting future changes in extreme climate events. © The Korean Meteorological Society and Springer 2012.","Climate classification; East Asian climate; Extreme climate; Future climate change; High resolution model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871100253

Induction of anti-herbivory defences can occur directly in grazed plants or from emission of risk cues to the environment, which modifies interactions of adjacent plants with, for instance, their consumers. This study confirmed the induction of anti-herbivory responses by water-borne risk cues between adjoining con-specific seaweeds and firstly examined whether plant-plant signalling also exists among adjacent hetero-specific seaweeds. Furthermore, differential abilities and geographic variation in plant-plant signalling by a non-indigenous seaweed as well as native seaweeds were assessed. Twelve-day induction experiments using the non-indigenous seaweed Sargassum muticum were conducted in the laboratory in Portugal and Germany with one local con-familiar (Portugal: Cystoseira humilis, Germany: Halidrys siliquosa) and hetero-familiar native species (Portugal: Fucus spiralis, Germany: F. vesiculosus). All seaweeds were grazed by a local isopod species (Portugal: Stenosoma nadejda, Germany: Idotea baltica) and were positioned upstream of con- and hetero-specific seaweeds. Grazing-induced modification in seaweed traits were tested in three-day feeding assays between cue-exposed and cue-free (= control) pieces of both fresh and reconstituted seaweeds. Both Fucus species reduced their palatability when positioned downstream of isopod-grazed con-specifics. Yet, the palatability of non-indigenous S. muticum remained constant in the presence of upstream grazed con-specifics and native hetero-specifics. In contrast, both con-familiar (but neither hetero-familiar) native species reduced palatability when located downstream of grazed S. muticum. Similar patterns of grazer-deterrent responses to water-borne cues were observed on both European shores, and were almost identical between assays using fresh and reconstituted seaweeds. Hence, seaweeds may use plant-plant signalling to optimise chemical resistance to consumers, though this ability appeared to be species-specific. Furthermore, this study suggests that native species may benefit more than a non-indigenous species from water-borne cue mediated reduction in consumption as only natives responded to signals emitted by hetero-specifics. © 2012 Yun et al.",,"water; article; controlled study; Cystoseira humilis; experimental design; Fucus; Fucus spiralis; fucus vesiculosus; geographical variation (species); Germany; grazer; Halidrys siliquosa; herbivory; Idotea baltica; introduced species; Isopoda; native species; nonhuman; palatability; Portugal; Sargassum; sargassum muticum; seaweed; species difference; Stenosoma nadejda; animal; association; Atlantic Ocean; brown alga; chemistry; comparative study; drug effect; herbivory; Isopoda; nonparametric test; physiology; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Cues; Germany; Herbivory; Isopoda; Phaeophyta; Portugal; Seaweed; Species Specificity; Statistics, Nonparametric",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862208183

However, the number of parameters in ecosystem models that can be constrained is limited by conventional inverse analysis. This study aims to increase the number of parameters that can be constrained in parameter inversions by considering the internal relationships among ecosystem processes. Our previous study has reported thermal adaptation of net ecosystem exchange (NEE). Ecosystems tend to transfer from a carbon source to sink when the air temperature exceeds the mean annual temperature, and attain their maximum uptake when the temperature reaches the long-term growing season mean. Because NEE is the difference between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), the adaptation of NEE indirectly indicates the coupling relationship between GPP and ER. Five assimilation experiments were conducted with (1) estimated GPP based on eddy flux measurements, (2) estimated GPP and coupling relationship between GPP and ER, (3) observed NEE measurements, (4) observed NEE measurements and internal relationship between GPP and ER and (5) observed NEE, estimated ER and GPP. The results show that the inversion method, using only estimated GPP based on eddy covariance towers, constrained 4 of 16 parameters in the terrestrial ecosystem carbon model, and the improved method using both GPP data and the internal relationship between GPP and ER allowed us to constrain 10 of 16 parameters. The improved method constrained the parameters for ER without additional ER observations, and accordingly improved the model performance substantially for simulating ER. Overall, our method enhances our ability to extract information from ecosystem observations and potentially reduces uncertainty for simulating carbon dynamics across the regional and global scales. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian inversion; Ecosystem respiration; Eddy covariance; Gross primary production; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Parameter estimation","Bayesian inversion; Ecosystem respiration; Eddy covariance; Gross primary production; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Carbon; Parameter estimation; Plants (botany); Ecosystems; air temperature; Bayesian analysis; data assimilation; ecosystem modeling; eddy covariance; estimation method; flux measurement; growing season; Markov chain; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; parameterization; primary production; terrestrial ecosystem; vegetation structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861823697

In fact, the imbalance of economic development leads to diversity in GHG emissions profiles in different areas of China. This paper employs a common methodology, consistent with the Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) approved by the Covenant of Mayors (CoM), to estimate CO 2 emissions of four Chinese cities in highly urbanized areas from 2004 to 2010. The results show that the CO 2 emissions of all four cities are still rising and that secondary industries emit the most CO 2 in these cities. By comparing these data with the inventory results of two European cities, this paper further reveals that Chinese cities in highly urbanized areas contribute much higher per-capita emissions than their European competitors. Furthermore, the per-capita CO 2 emissions of the residential sector and private transport in these Chinese cities are growing rapidly, some of them approaching the levels of European cities. According to these findings, several policy suggestions considering regional disparities are provided that aim to reduce the CO 2 emissions of highly urbanized areas in China. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Comparison analysis; Emission inventory; Highly urbanized area","Action plan; Chinese cities; CO2 emissions; Comparison analysis; Economic development; Emission inventories; GHG emission; Policy suggestions; Private transport; Regional disparities; Residential sectors; Sustainable energy; Urbanized area; Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; comparative study; economic development; emission inventory; emissions trading; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; policy approach; policy development; pollution tax; sustainability; urbanization; China; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862244740

Previous investigations on BSCs mainly focused on the taxonomic or genetic diversity of their components and physical properties, while little attention was given to the functional diversity of microbial community, which plays crucial roles in carbon cycling. In order to distinguish between microbial functional diversity in BSCs with different developmental levels, MicroResp™ plates were used to determine the utilization rate of fifteen added carbon sources. Five types of crusts, A-E, were taken from the western Negev Desert (Israel) during the morning hours of March 2011. Abiotic and biotic variables were measured. The well-developed high-biomass BSCs exhibited pronounced increases in their chlorophyll a and organic-matter content. Higher activity and biomass of microbial communities, as well as higher density of viable microfungi, were also found in the well-developed BSCs. Marked increases in the utilization rates of aromatic acid, carbohydrates and carboxylic acid were consistent with the well-developed crusts. Although the utilization rates of the four carbon groups followed the order: carboxylic acid > amino acid > carbohydrates and aromatic acid, the redundancy analysis revealed that crust A preferred consuming amino acids while crusts C and E preferred carboxylic acids and carbohydrates. No significant differences in functional diversity were observed between BSCs with different developmental levels. More carbon sources, as well as molecular and stable isotopic approaches, should be used in further studies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Community-level physiological profile; Functional diversity; MicroResp™ plate; Negev Desert; Sole-carbon induced respiration","Biological soil crusts; Carbon cycling; Carbon source; Chlorophyll a; Community level physiological profiles; Development stages; Ecological functions; Functional diversity; Genetic diversity; Micro-fungi; Microbial communities; Negev desert; Open space; Redundancy analysis; Sole-carbon induced respiration; Utilization rates; Amino acids; Arid regions; Aromatic compounds; Carbohydrates; Carboxylic acids; Chlorophyll; Ecology; Microorganisms; Carbon; biomass; carbon cycle; chlorophyll a; dune; functional group; microbial activity; microbial community; open space; physiology; soil crust; soil ecosystem; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; soil respiration; stable isotope; Israel; Negev; Southern District",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860851663

Air quality regulations distinguish criteria air pollutants (CAPs) (e.g., ozone, PM2.5) from hazardous air pollutants (HAPs)-187 chemicals which include carcinogens and others that are associated with respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological and numerous other non-cancer health effects. Evidence of the public's cumulative exposure and the health effects of HAPs are quite limited. A multilevel model is used to assess differential exposure to HAP respiratory, neurological, and cancer hazards (2005) related to the Townsend Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation (TSI), after adjustment for regional population size and economic activity, and local population density. We found significant positive associations between tract TSI and respiratory and cancer HAP exposure hazards, and smaller effects for neurological HAPs. Tracts in the top quintile of TSI have between 38%-60% higher HAP exposure than the bottom quintile; increasing population size from the bottom quintile to the top quintile modifies HAP exposure hazard related to TSI, increasing cancer HAP exposure hazard by 6% to 20% and increasing respiratory HAP exposure hazard by 12% to 27%.

Among terrestrial ecosystems, grassland productivity IAV is greatest. Relationships between grassland productivity IAV and climate drivers are poorly explained by traditional multiple-regression approaches. We propose a novel method, the perfect-deficit approach, to identify climate drivers of grassland IAV from observational data. The maximum daily value of each ecological or meteorological variable for each day of the year, over the period of record, defines the perfect annual curve. Deficits of these variables can be identified by comparing daily observational data for a given year against the perfect curve. Links between large deficits of ecosystem activity and extreme climate events are readily identified. We applied this approach to five grassland sites with 26 site-years of observational data. Large deficits of canopy photosynthetic capacity and evapotranspiration derived from eddy-covariance measurements, and leaf area index derived from satellite data occur together and are driven by a local-dryness index during the growing season. This new method shows great promise in using observational evidence to demonstrate how extreme climate events alter yearly dynamics of ecosystem potential productivity and exchanges with atmosphere, and shine a new light on climate-carbon feedback mechanisms. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Climate extremes; Dryness; Grasslands; Gross photosynthetic production (GPP); Perfect-deficit approach","Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Water supply; Climate extremes; Dryness; Grasslands; Perfect-deficit approach; Photosynthetic production; Productivity; annual variation; carbon dioxide; data set; eddy covariance; evapotranspiration; extreme event; grassland; leaf area index; meteorology; primary production; satellite data; terrestrial ecosystem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867040972

The BFG can be used as the cooling gas flowing through the annulus of coaxial lance. To stabilize the operation in the lower zone of blast furnace, the combustion characteristics of PC with/without BFG cooling gas within the blowpipe-tuyere-raceway region of a blast furnace are numerically investigated. The simulations focus on the effects of the lance configuration, the cooling gas type, and the cooling gas flow rate. The results show that a significant flow-induced pressure drop occurs at the blowpipe and tuyere part because of the gaseous combustion of the oxygen within the blast and the BFG injected via the lance. Moreover, the burnout of injected coal is significantly decreased with an increasing BFG cooling flow rates due to the additional oxygen consumption by the BFG. Finally, it is shown that a stronger swirling flow was formed when the lance configuration with bigger diameter was employed.

A 3-year field study was conducted to measure methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2O) fluxes simultaneously in a sandy loam paddy field under three nitrogen application rates (0, 150 and 250kgNha -1) in the Yangtze River Delta from 2005 through 2007. The rice paddies were under a typical Chinese water regime, characterized by intermittent irrigation with midseason drainage. The results revealed a trade-off between CH 4 and N 2O emissions as influenced by the application of urea-based fertilizers, i.e., the nitrogen fertilization reduced CH 4 emissions from rice paddies but increased N 2O emissions. The seasonal CH 4 emissions averaged 155.9kgCha -1 in the absence of nitrogen amendment. Compared to no nitrogen addition, the seasonal CH 4 emissions were decreased by 27% and 53% in the fertilized plots at rates of 150 and 250kgNha -1, respectively. It was most likely that the sandy loam texture combined with the addition of urea-based fertilizers stimulated growth and activity of methane oxidizers. In contrast, nitrogen addition increased N 2O emissions 2.5 times for an application rate of 150kgNha -1 and 6.0 times at 250kgNha -1, compared to no nitrogen addition (0.38kgNha -1). The direct emission factor of fertilizer N for N 2O was estimated to be 0.39-1.22% for rice fields, with a mean value of 0.77%. The overall emissions of CH 4 and N 2O, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents were affected by the nitrogen addition rate, with the minimum emissions occurring at 250kgNha -1. This result indicated that the commonly applied nitrogen rate in this region might be an effective option for mitigating the combined impacts of rice production. Our results also demonstrate the presence of large interannual variations in the CH 4 and N 2O fluxes. It is probable that these variations resulted from differences in the amount and distribution of precipitation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Global warming potential; Methane; Nitrogen fertilizer; Nitrous oxide; Rice paddy","cultivation; fertilizer application; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; paddy field; rice; sandy loam; soil emission; urea; China; Yangtze Delta; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862831742

This paper proposes a holistic method (HMEEB) for assessing and certifying energy efficiency of buildings based on the D-S (Dempster-Shafer) theory of evidence and the Evidential Reasoning (ER) approach. HMEEB has three main features: (i) it provides both a method to assess and certify building energy efficiency, and exists as an analytical tool to identify improvement opportunities; (ii) it combines a wealth of information on building energy efficiency assessment, including identification of indicators and a weighting mechanism; and (iii) it provides a method to identify and deal with inherent uncertainties within the assessment procedure.

Fascinating effects such as Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation, transition radiation and the Smith-Purcell effect were discovered and studied in depth. In this paper we study the radiation of a line charge moving with relativistic constant velocity within an average zero index metamaterial consisting of periodically alternating layers with negative and positive refractive index. We observe a strong radiation enhancement, ∼3 orders of magnitude, for specific combinations of velocities and radiation frequencies. This surprising finding is attributed to a gigantic increase in the density of states at the positive/negative index boundary. Furthermore, we shed light on radiation effects of such a line charge propagating within the more ""traditional"" structure of periodically alternating layers consisting of positive and different refractive index with focus on frequencies satisfying the quarter wave stack and the half wave stack conditions. We show that the quarter-wave-stack case results in emission propagating vertically to the line charge trajectory, while the half-wave-stack results in negligible radiation. All these findings were obtained using a computationally efficient and conceptually intuitive computation method, based on eigenmode expansion of specific frequency components.

The result shows that energy requirement per capita has increased by 159% for urban residents and 147% for rural residents from 1995 to 2004. Growth in household consumption driven by income growth and urbanization may induce a successive increase in energy requirements in future. Per capita energy requirements of urban residents will increase by 240% during 2002–2015 and 330% during 2002–2020. Urbanization might lead to 0.75 billion ton of increment of energy requirements in 2020. About 45%–48% of total energy requirements in China might be a consequence of residents’ life styles and the economic activities to support consumption demands in 2020. Under low-carbon life style scenario, per capita energy requirements of urban residents may decline to 97% in 2015 and 92% in 2020 in contrast with baseline scenario.

The SSMIS data were preprocessed by the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) using its Unified Preprocessor Package (UPP) and then distributed to the numerical weather prediction centers by the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC). This dataset was assimilated into the Global Forecast System (GFS) using gridpoint statistical interpolation (GSI). The initial assimilation of the SSMIS data into the GFS did not improve the mediumrange (5-7 days) forecast skill. The SSMIS bias (O-B) still changes with location and time after the GSI biascorrection scheme is implemented. This bias characteristic is related to residual calibration errors in the correction of the SSMIS antenna emission and warm target contamination. The large O-B standard deviation is probably due to the large instrument noise in the SSMIS UPP data. The large O-B and its standard deviation for several surface sensitive channels are also caused by uncertainty in surface emissivity. In this study, a new scheme is developed to remove regionally dependent bias using a weekly composite O-B. The SSMIS noise is reduced through a Gaussian function filter. A new emissivity database for snow and sea ice is developed for the SSMIS surface sensitive channels. After applying these algorithms, the quality of the SSMIS lowatmospheric sounding (LAS) data is improved; the surface-sensitive channels can be effectively assimilated, and the impacts of SSMISLAS data on the medium-range forecast in the GFS are positive and similar to those from Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A) data. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.",,"Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A; Bias correction; Calibration error; Data sets; Defense Meteorological Satellite Programs; Fleet numerical meteorology and oceanography centers; Gaussian functions; Global forecast systems; Instrument noise; Naval Research Laboratory; Numerical weather prediction; Special sensor microwave imagers; Standard deviation; Statistical interpolation; Surface emissivity; Water vapor profile; Electromagnetic wave emission; Fleet operations; Forecasting; Research laboratories; Sea ice; Sounding apparatus; Statistics; Microwave sensors; data assimilation; database; forecasting method; microwave imagery; SSM-I; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84868336953

During the PETM, deep-sea benthic foraminifers decreased their body-size and increased their productivity, metabolic rates, and food consumption in response to abruptly increasing temperature and changing surface water productivity. Here we find that three species of marine ostracodes - part of the multicellular benthos - also experienced a reduction in body-size in response to PETM warming in the Northeast Atlantic. Positive correlations between ostracode body-size and benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope data indicate that reduced body-sizes were caused by high temperature during the PETM. Dwarfing of ostracodes during the PETM interval suggests that their food consumption rates, and lifetimes, were less than those of ostracodes in the pre-PETM interval. This interpretation is based upon previous studies that show that food consumption and ostracode lifetimes both decrease as ostracodes increase their growth rates under higher temperatures. Estimates of body volume, temperature, and individual abundance suggest a decline in lifetime metabolic rate in ostracode individuals during the core of the PETM. In addition there is also a decrease in biomass flux in the whole ostracode community at this time. The decline in biomass flux at the community level suggests major changes in the energy flow and carbon cycling in deep-sea benthic ecosystem and the reduction of organic carbon flux between the ostracode community and sediments during the PETM. The decline in ostracode carbon flux stands in contrast with previous interpretations that carbon cycling by benthic foraminifera increased during the PETM. Hence, our data suggest that the benthic community response to the PETM was not uniform between different taxonomic groups. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Body size; Deep sea; Metabolic rate; Organic carbon cycle; Ostracoda; Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum; Respiration","abundance; benthic foraminifera; body size; body temperature; carbon cycle; deep sea; Deep Sea Drilling Project; deep-sea benthos; energy flux; environmental change; growth rate; marine ecosystem; organic carbon; ostracod; oxygen isotope; Paleocene-Eocene boundary; respiration; taxonomy; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); Bay of Biscay; Foraminifera; Ostracoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863433487

To reduce uncertainties from upscaling spatial processes of the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model for improving the definition of China's paddy soils SOC stocks (0-30cm) and their changes from 1980 to 2008, a soil polygon-based modeling method was developed by integrating DNDC with the latest 1:1,000,000 soil database, derived from 1490 paddy soil profiles collected during the Second National Soil Survey of China. The simulations demonstrated that Chinese paddy soils (0-30cm), which cover 45.0Mha, storaged 2.51Pg in 1980 and 2.65Pg in 2008 with an average sequestration rate of 5.0TgCyear -1. Approximately 83.3% of the paddy soils sequestrated C, while 16.1% lost C and only 0.6% were balanced over the past 28years. There were, however, large regional differences in sequestration outcomes. Increases in paddy soil SOC stocks were found predominantly in South, Eastern and Southwest China, where topsoil SOC increased by 59.6, 56.4 and 28.3Tg, respectively. SOC stock in Northwest and North China increased only 0.6 and 0.3Tg, respectively, while that in Northeast China lost 0.5Tg.

This paper examines energy saving and environmental impacts reduction from the penetration of eco-friendly technology passenger cars in this region. Three vehicle technologies are considered: (i) conventional hybrid electric vehicles, (ii) battery electric vehicles and (iii) fuel cell electric vehicles. The influence of the driving cycle is examined through the comparison of two different cycles, the New European Driving Cycle (a regulatory driving cycle) and the Athens Driving Cycle, based on actual driving data. Two alternative scenarios are formulated. The first involves the substitution of all the passenger cars that were registered during the last year (2010) with hybrid and battery electric vehicles that already exist in the Greek market.

Distinct point mutations in CcpA abolish the regulation of some but not all target genes, suggesting additional interactions of CcpA. Therefore, in vivo crosslinking and MS were applied to identify CcpA complexes active in repression and activation. To compensate for an excess of promoters only repressed by CcpA, this experiment was accomplished with cells using multiple copies of the activated ackA promoter. Among the identified proteins HPr, RNA polymerase subunits and the global regulator transcriptional pleiotropic repressor (CodY) were observed. Bacterial two-hybrid assays combining each RNA polymerase subunit with CcpA localized CcpA binding at the α-subunit of the RNA polymerase (RpoA). In vivo crosslinking combined with immunoblot analyses revealed CcpA-RpoA complexes in cultures with or without glucose, whereas CcpA-HPr and CcpA-CodY complexes occurred only or predominantly in cultures with glucose. Surface plasmon resonance analyses confirmed the binding of CcpA to the N-terminal domain (αNTD) and C-terminal domain (αCTD) of RpoA, as well as to CodY. Furthermore, interactions of CodY with the αNTD and the αCTD were detected by surface plasmon resonance. The K D values of complexes of CcpA or CodY with the αNTD or the αCTD are in the range 5-8 μm. CcpA and CodY form a loose complex with a K D of 60 μm. These data were combined to propose a model for a transcription initiation complex at the ackA promoter. © 2012 FEBS.","bacterial two-hybrid assay; carbon catabolite regulation; in vivo crosslinking; SPINE; surface plasmon resonance","bacterial protein; carbon; catabolite control protein A; CodY protein; glucose; histidine; phosphoprotein; RNA polymerase; RpoA protein; unclassified drug; amino terminal sequence; article; Bacillus subtilis; carbon source; carboxy terminal sequence; controlled study; cross linking; gene targeting; immunoblotting; in vivo study; molecular weight; nonhuman; pleiotropy; point mutation; priority journal; promoter region; protein analysis; protein binding; protein domain; protein protein interaction; surface plasmon resonance; transcription initiation; two hybrid system; Bacillus subtilis; Bacterial Proteins; Immunoblotting; Protein Binding; Transcription Factors; Bacillus subtilis; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861903420

Utilization of biomass in iron ore roasting process as heating agent and reducing agent contributes to energy conservation and emission reduction, and can partially replace for coal and coke. The biomass instead of coke was mixed together with iron ore powder from the north of Hainan province into ball roasting process to investigate the effects of mixture composition, reduction temperature, reaction time, the thermal reduction and magnetic properties of the mixture. The results show that the reduction temperature, reaction time and dosage of the biomass are correlated to the quality of the reduction and the magnetism of the iron ore, within the experimental conditions. The mechanism of the biomass reducing the weakly magnetic goethite into stronger magnetic iron oxide has been discussed. The results show that the goethite ores is dramatically reduced and magnetized by about 20 wt.% biomass at low roasting temperature.

Consequently, their quantification is protocol dependent. IMPROVE and NIOSH are the two widely used thermal/optical protocols for OCEC analysis, differing in temperature programs and in the optical method for charring correction. The IMPROVE protocol is often implemented on a DRI analyzer while the NIOSH protocol is often implemented on a Sunset Laboratory Analyzer. Evaluation of the implementation of the IMPROVE protocol on the Sunset Laboratory analyzer or implementation of the NIOSH or NIOSHderived protocols on the DRI analyzer has rarely been reported. We analyzed OC and EC in about 100 ambient samples collected in the Pearl River Delta in China by implementing the IMPROVE protocol and a NIOSH-derived (ACE-Asia) protocol on both a DRI Model 2001 analyzer and a Sunset Laboratory analyzer. The total carbon (TC) and EC filter loading as determined by the ACE-Asia protocol on the Sunset analyzer varied from 2.6 to 67.0 and 0.2 to 7.4 μg cm -2, respectively. Inter-instrument comparison indicates that the implementation of the IMPROVE protocol on the Sunset analyzer reports TC, EC, and OC measurements to be in good agreement with those made on the DRI analyzer. EC and OC analyzed using the ACE-Asia protocol are also in good agreements for measurements implemented on the Sunset and DRI analyzers. Inter-protocol comparison indicates consistency in TC determination but discrepancies in OC and EC, with the IMPROVE protocol reporting much higher EC than the ACE-Asia protocol. An analysis of different comparison scenarios reveals that the cause of the EC difference could be quantitatively attributed to temperature protocol (thermal effect) and optical pyrolysis correction method (reflectance vs. transmittance). The variation in EC concentrations was more pronounced in samples that produced more charred OC during thermal analysis.

An early stage in evaporite replacement by carbonates may be observed inmodern salterns in Eilat, where gypsum crusts are colonized by stratified, endoevaporitic,microbial communities including sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Here, BSRcan be associated with gypsum dissolution and replacive carbonate formation. Rapidconsumption of aqueous sulphate by SRB is illustrated in the ephemeral Coorong lakesof South Australia, where extremely high concentrations are completely removed byintense BSR during evaporation, so that no solid sulphate precipitates. Here, carbonatesform as the consequence of mediation of ambient waters by BSR, with sedimentarypyrite providing the only indication of the former presence of dissolved sulphate in thelake waters.Pyrite patches in the patterned dolomite facies of the largely evaporitic Jurassic ArabFormation have been interpreted as 'birds eyes' or fenestrae, but show no signs of visibleporosity. A hostile environment mitigates against their interpretation as burrows,although some form of root pseudomorph is not ruled out. However, it is possible thatthe pyrite is related to BSR operating in a hypersaline, microbially-dominated environmentin which solid sulphate removal and sulphide formation is followed by dolomiteformation.Field, petrographic, and stable-isotopic evidence from bedded strata and thin sectionsof the Neoarchaean Gamohaan and Kogelbeen carbonate formations of South Africaargue for the former existence of evaporites, and suggest deposition in mainly shallowsubtidal and marine sabkha environments. On the macroscale, cross-stratified grainstonesshowing multiple directions of sediment transport, together with abundantmicrobialites and rare, well-preserved cyanobacterial fossils, indicate shallow-waterdeposition and microbial growth in the photic zone. Large tepee-like fold structures,intrastratal karst, pseudomorphs after evaporites, replacive calcite after selenite, solutioncollapse breccias, autobrecciation, corrosion surfaces, nucleation cones, irregularbedding contacts and flowage structures are all indicative of evaporites, their dissolutionand their replacement by carbonate.Evaporite replacement in the Neoarchaean carbonates was largely fabric destructive,leaving few obvious clues at the microscale to the former presence of vanished evaporites.Nonetheless, diagenetic recrystallization, deformation, disruption, and crosscuttingrelationships point to their previous existence, and the occurrence of lengthslowchalcedony in silicified stromatolite heads may suggest the former presence ofsulphates. Fold shapes indicative of enterolithic gypsum, picked out by trails ofdegraded organic matter and dolomitized clusters of folded filaments preserved withinreplacive calcite, are evident in thin sections of contorted microbialites.

Simultaneously, organizations are squeezing their overhead budgets (where security initiatives fall) and are focusing more on revenue generation given current economic climates. Thus, in both governmental sectors and in commercial settings, there are reasons to believe that strategic security initiatives are being sacrificed, and those that survive must be compelling. To assist organizational leaders with these difficult choices, it is critical to understand biases that affect decisions about strategic security initiatives. The purpose of this paper is to validate and empirically test the predictability of a theoretical model, from which implications can be made for research and practice. Using behavioral decision theory, a randomized longitudinal study was conducted over three years with a multinational corporation with headquarter-offices in the UK and the USA, and regional offices in India, Germany and France. From these data, a model was developed and tested for fit with a confirmatory factor analysis and its predictive ability was tested using structured equation modeling. It was found that risk aversion, overconfidence, adjustment of cognitive anchors, and expected utility biases affected whether managers and other stakeholders continued or terminated strategic security initiatives. Prematurely terminating or over commitment to a strategic initiative can be costly if not significantly damaging to an organization or government military or intelligence agency. Understanding how biases factor into these decisions can help strategic initiative decision makers improve their decisions and assist them in recognizing normative rules or optimal (straddle point) solutions. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Decision making; Decision support systems; Management strategy; Security and decision biases; Security initiative theoretical model validation; State security; Strategic security decisions","Management strategies; Security and decision biases; State security; Strategic security decisions; Theoretical models; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Factor analysis; Security systems; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861882131

Explanations of this effect have focused on atmospheric dynamics. However, in contrast to storm tracks in other regions, the North Atlantic storm track responds by strengthening and extending farther east, in particular on its southern flank. These adjustments are associated with an intensification and extension of the eddy-driven jet towards western Europe and are expected to have considerable societal impacts related to a rise in storminess in Europe. Here, we apply a regression analysis to an ensemble of coupled climate model simulations to show that the coupling between ocean and atmosphere shapes the distinct storm-track response to greenhouse-gas forcing in the North Atlantic region. In the ensemble of simulations we analyse, at least half of the differences between the storm-track responses of different models are associated with uncertainties in ocean circulation changes. We compare the fully coupled simulations with both the associated slab model simulations and an ocean-forced experiment with one climate model to establish causality.

However, long-term records linking climate variability to methane availability in Arctic wetlands are lacking. We present a multi-proxy ~12,000 year paleoecological reconstruction of intermittent methane availability from a radiocarbon-dated sediment core (LQ-West) taken from a shallow tundra lake (Qalluuraq Lake) in Arctic Alaska. Specifically, stable carbon isotopic values of photosynthetic biomarkers and methane are utilized to estimate the proportional contribution of methane-derived carbon to lake-sediment-preserved benthic (chironomids) and pelagic (cladocerans) components over the last ~12,000 years. These results were compared to temperature, hydrologic, and habitat reconstructions from the same site using chironomid assemblage data, oxygen isotopes of chironomid head capsules, and radiocarbon ages of plant macrofossils. Cladoceran ephippia from ~4,000 cal year BP sediments have δ 13C values that range from ~-39 to -31‰, suggesting peak methane carbon assimilation at that time. These low δ 13C values coincide with an apparent decrease in effective moisture and development of a wetland that included Sphagnum subsecundum. Incorporation of methane-derived carbon by chironomids and cladocerans decreased from ~2,500 to 1,500 cal year BP, coinciding with a temperature decrease. Live-collected chironomids with a radiocarbon age of 1,640 cal year BP, and fossil chironomids from 1,500 cal year BP in the core illustrate that 'old' carbon has also contributed to the development of the aquatic ecosystem since ~1,500 cal year BP. The relatively low δ 13C values of aquatic invertebrates (as low as -40. 5‰) provide evidence of methane incorporation by lake invertebrates, and suggest intermittent climate-linked methane release from the lake throughout the Holocene. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Biomarkers; Carbon; Chironomids; Isotopes; Oxygen; Temperature","biomarker; carbon isotope; climate effect; climate variation; crustacean; fly; fossil record; grass; Holocene; lake ecosystem; methane; paleoatmosphere; paleoclimate; paleoecology; paleolimnology; photosynthesis; reconstruction; sediment core; temperature effect; wetland; Alaska; Arctic; United States; Chironomidae; Invertebrata; Sphagnum; Sphagnum subsecundum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861609580

Total solids (TS) content is an indicator of substrate availability for CH4 and N2O production and NH3 emissions and is related to crust formation, which can affect these gas emissions. The effect of TS on these emissions from pilot-scale slurry storages was quantified from 20 May through 16 Nov. 2010 in Nova Scotia, Canada. Emissions from six dairy slurries with TS ranging from 0.3 to 9.5% were continuously measured using flow-through steady-state chambers. Methane emissions modeled using the USEPA methodology were compared with measured data focusing on emissions when empty storages were filled, and retention times were &gt;30 d with undegraded volatile solids (VS) remaining in the system considered available for CH4 production (VS carry-over). Surface crusts formed on all the slurries. Only the slurries with TS of 3.2 and 5.8% were covered completely for ~3 mo. Nitrous oxide contributed &lt;5% of total greenhouse gas emissions for all TS levels. Ammonia and CH4 emissions increased linearly with TS despite variable crusting, suggesting substrate availability for gas production was more important than crust formation in regulating emissions over long-term storage. Modeled CH4 emissions were substantially higher than measured data in the first month, and accounting for this could improve overall model performance. Carried-over VS were a CH4 source in months 2 through 6. The results of this study suggest that substrate availability regulates emissions over long-term storage and that modifying the USEPA model to better describe carbon cycling is warranted. © 2012 by the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.",,"Carbon cycling; Crust formations; Dairy slurry; Flowthrough; Gas productions; Livestock slurry; Long-term storage; Methane emissions; Nitrous oxide; Nova Scotia; Overall-model; Pilot scale; Retention time; Slurry storages; Total solids; Volatile solid; Ammonia; Anesthetics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Substrates; Slurries; ammonia; methane; nitrous oxide; agricultural slurry; article; carbon cycling; carbon footprint; concentration (parameters); environmental parameters; gas; gas analysis; gas waste; mathematical model; quantitative analysis; storage; surface crust; surface property; total solid content; air pollutant; animal; Canada; cattle; chemistry; dairying; environmental monitoring; methodology; sewage; temperature; time; Air Pollutants; Ammonia; Animals; Canada; Cattle; Dairying; Environmental Monitoring; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Temperature; Time Factors; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862250031

In addition, a reduction of respiratory symptoms and an improvement in bronchial hyperresponsiveness in children were observed (Peters et al. 1996; Wong et al. 1998). A recent time-series study (Hedley et al. 2002) found an immediate reduction in mortality during the cool season at six months after the intervention, followed by an increase in cool-season mortality in the second and third years, suggesting that the reduction in pollution was associated with a delay in mortality. Proportional changes in mortality trends between the 5-year periods before and after the intervention were measured as relative risks and used to assess gains in life expectancy using the life table method (Hedley et al. 2002). To further explore the relation between changes in pollution-related mortality before and after the intervention, our study had three objectives: (1) to evaluate the short-term effects on mortality of changes in the pollutant mix after the Hong Kong sulfur intervention, particularly with changes in the particulate matter (PM) chemical species; (2) to improve the methodology for assessment of the health impact in terms of changes in life expectancy using linear regression models; and (3) to develop an approach for analyzing changes in life expectancy from Poisson regression models. A fourth overarching objective was to determine the relation between short- and long-term benefits due to an improvement in air quality. For an assessment of the short-term effects on mortality due to changes in the pollutant mix, we developed Poisson regression Core Models with natural spline smoothers to control for long-term and seasonal confounding variations in the mortality counts and with covariates to adjust for temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH). We assessed the adequacy of the Core Models by evaluating the results against the Akaike Information Criterion, which stipulates that, at a minimum, partial autocorrelation plots should be between -0.1 and 0.1, and by examining the residual plots to make sure they were free from patterns. We assessed the effects for gaseous pollutants (NO2, SO2, and O3), PM with an aerodynamic diameter < or = 10 microm (PM10), and its chemical species (aluminum [Al], iron [Fe], manganese [Mn], nickel [Ni], vanadium [V], lead [Pb], and zinc [Zn]) using the Core Models, which were developed for the periods 5 years (or 2 years in the case of the sensitivity analysis) before and 5 years after the intervention, as well as in the10-year (or 7-year in the case of the sensitivity analysis) period pre- and post-intervention. We also included an indicator to separate the pre- and post-intervention periods, as well as the product of the indicator with an air pollution concentration variable. The health outcomes were mortality for all natural causes and for cardiovascular and respiratory causes, at all ages and in the 65 years or older age group. To assess the short- and long-term effects, we developed two methods: one using linear regression models reflecting the age-standardized mortality rate D(j) at day j, divided by a reference D(ref); and the other using Poisson regression models with daily mortality counts as the outcome variables. We also used both models to evaluate the relation between outcome variables and daily air pollution concentrations in the current day up to all previous days in the past 3 to 4 years. In the linear regression approach, we adjusted the data for temperature and relative humidity. We then removed season as a potential confounder, or deseasonalized them, by calculating a standard seasonal mortality rate profile, normalized to an annual average of unity, and dividing the mortality rates by this profile. Finally, to correct for long-term trends, we calculated a reference mortality rate D(ref)(j) as a moving average of the corrected and deseasonalized D(j) over the observation window. Then we regressed the outcome variable D(j)/D(ref) on an entire exposure sequence {c(i)} with lags up to 4 years in order to obtain impact coefficient f(i) from the regression model shown below: deltaD(j)/D (ref) = i(max)sigma f(i) c(j - i)(i = 0). The change in life expectancy (LE) for a change of units (deltac) in the concentration of pollutants on T(day)--representing the short interval (i.e., a day)--was calculated from the following equation (deltaL(pop) = average loss in life expectancy of an entire population): deltaL(pop) = -deltac T(day) infinity sigma (j = 0) infinity sigma f(i) (i = 0). In the Poisson regression approach, we fitted a distributed-lag model for exposure to previous days of up to 4 years in order to obtain the cumulative lag effect sigma beta(i). We fit the linear regression model of log(LE*/LE) = gamma(SMR - 1) + alpha to estimate the parameter gamma by gamma, where LE* and LE are life expectancy for an exposed and an unexposed population, respectively, and SMR represents the standardized mortality ratio. The life expectancy change per Ac increase in concentration is LE {exp[gamma delta c(sigma beta(i))]-1}. In our assessment of the changes in pollutant levels, the mean levels of SO2, Ni, and V showed a statistically significant decline, particularly in industrial areas. Ni and V showed the greatest impact on mortality, especially for respiratory diseases in the 5-year pre-intervention period for both the all-ages and 65+ groups among all chemical species. There were decreases in excess risks associated with Ni and V after the intervention, but they were nonsignificant. Using the linear regression approach, with a window of 1095 days (3 years), the losses in life expectancy with a 10-microg/m3 increase in concentrations, using two methods of estimation (one with adjustment for temperature and RH before the regression against pollutants, the other with adjustment for temperature and RH within the regression against pollutants), were 19.2 days (95% CI, 12.5 to 25.9) and 31.4 days (95% CI, 25.6 to 37.2) for PM10; and 19.7 days (95% CI, 15.2 to 24.2) and 12.8 days (95% CI, 8.9 to 16.8) for SO2. The losses in life expectancy in the current study were smaller than the ones implied by Elliott and colleagues (2007) and Pope and colleagues (2002) as expected since the observation window in our study was only 3 years whereas these other studies had windows of 16 years. In particular, the coefficients used by Elliott and colleagues (2007) for windows of 12 and 16 years were non-zero, which suggests that our window of at most 3 years cannot capture the full life expectancy loss and the effects were most likely underestimated. Using the Poisson regression approach, with a window of 1461 days (4 years), we found that a 10-microg/m3 increase in concentration of PM10 was associated with a change in life expectancy of -69 days (95% CI, -140 to 1) and a change of -133 days (95% CI, -172 to -94) for the same increase in SO2. The effect estimates varied as expected according to most variations in the sensitivity analysis model, specifically in terms of the Core Model definition, exposure windows, constraint of the lag effect pattern, and adjustment for smoking prevalence or socioeconomic status. Our results on the excess risks of mortality showed exposure to chemical species to be a health hazard. However, the statistical power was not sufficient to detect the differences between the pre- and post-intervention periods in Hong Kong due to the data limitations (specifically, the chemical species data were available only once every 6 days, and data were not available from some monitoring stations). Further work is needed to develop methods for maximizing the information from the data in order to assess any changes in effects due to the intervention. With complete daily air pollution and mortality data over a long period, time-series analysis methods can be applied to assess the short- and long-term effects of air pollution, in terms of changes in life expectancy. Further work is warranted to assess the duration and pattern of the health effects from an air pollution pulse (i.e., an episode of a rapid rise in air pollution) so as to determine an appropriate length and constraint on the distributed-lag assessment model.",,"fossil fuel; sulfur; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollutant; air pollution; article; breathing disorder; cardiovascular disease; chemically induced disorder; chemistry; child; environmental monitoring; female; Hong Kong; human; humidity; infant; legal aspect; life expectancy; male; middle aged; mortality; newborn; particulate matter; Poisson distribution; preschool child; season; statistical model; temperature; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child; Child, Preschool; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Fossil Fuels; Hong Kong; Humans; Humidity; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Life Expectancy; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Particulate Matter; Poisson Distribution; Respiration Disorders; Seasons; Sulfur; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874134246

The EU currently pursues a dual approach through an Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) at the EU level and also via national targets in sectors not covered by the ETS. The latter include the buildings sector, transportation, agriculture, and waste. Emissions from these sectors are mainly subject to policies at provincial and local levels. A method is presented for elaborating and implementing a long-term climate policy process up to 2030 for the regional (provincial) level. Building on regional GHG inventory data, a set of indicators for each sector is developed in order to arrive at a target path consistent with the deduced regional GHG reduction requirement. Policy measures and their implementation are then settled subsequent to this process. Quantitative regional targets are found to be a prerequisite for the formation of regional climate policy as they increase participant responsibility and commitment. A five-step process of stakeholder participation ensures effective implementation of regional climate action plans. Insights from an exemplary European region are drawn upon, and policy issues are discussed in both quantitative and institutional terms. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","climate targets; GHG reductions; indicators; low-carbon society; policy options; stakeholder participation/engagement","action plan; emission control; emissions trading; environmental policy; European Union; greenhouse gas; institutional framework; participatory approach; policy implementation; regional policy; stakeholder; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864688023

Nitrogen-doping levels of 5 wt% and sulfur-doping levels of 1 wt% (using TCA) to 4 wt% (using TC) were obtained.

We explored the diet of one feeding aggregation of humpback whales near Kodiak Island, Alaska, through analysis of the stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope ratios of their skin and regional prey sources. Humpback whales were sampled during the summer feeding season over 3 yr (n= 93; 2004-2006). Prey samples were collected from the same region during trawl surveys conducted between 2003 and 2005. Isotope values of humpback whale skin and prey were entered into a Bayesian dietary mixing model to estimate feasible contributions of prey to humpback diets. Diet results indicated that humpbacks feed heavily on euphausiids, but also consume juvenile walleye pollock, capelin, and Pacific sand lance. The diet of humpback whales in 2004 was the most diverse, while diets in 2005 and 2006 showed a higher proportion of euphausiids. Our results reveal annual differences in humpback diets from the Kodiak region due to either individual prey preferences or prey availability.

The potential for future observations and intervention impacts heavily on optimal policy for today and this is handled within our approach. We show how deriving policy dependent system uncertainty using computer models leads to an intractable backwards induction problem for the resulting decision tree. We introduce an algorithm for emulating an upper bound on our expected loss surface for all possible policies and discuss how this might be used in policy support.

A methodology is presented that allows estimation of building lifecycle GHG emissions (both embodied and operational) at the early design stage, accounting for the changing weather conditions produced by climate models (specifically the probabilistic projections provided by the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) Weather Generator). Annual heating and cooling demands are estimated from projected future temperatures using a model 'calibrated' to building performance through dynamic thermal modelling of a selection of example years. A worked example assessing lifecycle GHG emissions of a UK mixed-use development is presented. This shows annual GHG emissions due to space cooling could increase by between 26 and 70% from 2020 to 2080 depending on the future emissions scenario applied. Over the same period, emissions due to heating may decrease by between 12 and 42%, giving an overall net increase in GHG emissions from these systems. Improvements to building cooling systems and reduction to heat gains, particularly lighting, are recommended to reduce risk of increasing GHG emissions over time. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Tackling a challenge of this magnitude demands more than action in fits and starts; it hinges on complementary efforts at an unprecedented scale from individuals, the institutions in which we live, work, and play, and our varied levels of government. Despite environmentalists' best efforts, the necessary political will and public engagement to fuel robust action on climate change remain in short supply. Meanwhile, skepticism lingers and a partisan divide deepens. Contrary to popular expectations, faith-based efforts are emerging and strengthening to address this gap. In the US today, perhaps none is more significant than evangelical climate care. Drawing on interview, focus group, and textual research, this book explores the phenomenon of climate care-its historical roots, theological grounding, visionary leaders, and advocacy initiatives. It tracks the burgeoning movement's reception within the broader evangelical community-from pew to pulpit-at times winning allies but also provoking resistance. Engaging with climate change as a matter of private faith and public life, these leaders challenge traditional boundaries around the evangelical agenda, partisan politics, and established alliances and hostilities. They view sea-level rise as a moral calamity, lobby for legislation written on both sides of the aisle, and partner with atheist scientists. While others countdown the rapture, their hope is for a renewal of God's creation. Through their efforts, evangelical climate advocates are reshaping not only the landscape of American climate action but also the contours of their own religious community. Though the movement faces dynamic and complex challenges-some of which test its own fabric-climate care leaders continue to leverage evangelicalism's size, dominance, cultural position, ethical resources, and mechanisms of communication to further their cause. © 2012 by Oxford University Press, Inc.

The ecosystems where they have key roles range from the warmer oceans to many Antarctic sites. They also include dense nuisance growths in nutrient-rich lakes and nitrogen-fixers which aid the fertility of rice-fields and many soils, especially the biological soil crusts of arid regions. Molecular biology has in recent years provided major advances in our understanding of cyanobacterial ecology. Perhaps for more than any other group of organisms, it is possible to see how the ecology, physiology, biochemistry, ultrastructure and molecular biology interact. This all helps to deal with practical problems such as the control of nuisance blooms and the use of cyanobacterial inocula to manage semi-desert soils. Large-scale culture of several organisms, especially ""Spirulina"" (Arthrospira), for health food and specialist products is increasingly being expanded for a much wider range of uses. In view of their probable contribution to past oil deposits, much attention is currently focused on their potential as a source of biofuel.

REAP Tourism can calculate direct and indirect supply chain emissions related to accommodation, travel, food, shopping, services, attractions, activities and events. This paper demonstrates the tool at a range of different geographic levels in South West England. Initial results show overseas visitors to have an impact of 196 kg CO 2e per day, domestic overnight visitors having 49 kg and day visitors 48 kg. Further exploration shows the tool's ability to show the impact of different marketing/development scenarios on CO 2e emissions including holidaying locally strategies, encouraging longer stays, buying local goods and encouraging low meat diets. Comparisons show that luxury weekend visitors have five times the daily impact of family holiday visitors and ten times those of back-packers.

The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model and the NOAH land surface scheme are selected and a case study is performed on the Olifants River Basin in the Limpopo region of South Africa. Accurate knowledge of water availability in this water-stressed region is of great importance for adaptation and future water policy. Results of a simulation forced by ERA40 re-analysis show that the standard land surface scheme is unable to reproduce the observed runoff despite rainfall and atmospheric conditions similar to observed. This version of the model over-estimates mean annual runoff by 120%. The tightly bound water scheme shows a significant improvement, reducing the bias to 22%.The inclusion of the tightly bound water scheme has little effect on the basin average annual rainfall despite increasing annual evapotranspiration. The tightly bound water physics dampens the response of runoff to precipitation and provides additional de-coupling between precipitation and runoff, increasing the variability in this relationship. Simulations with the WRF model forced with both 1980s and 2040s CCSM3 data show that the tightly bound water scheme significantly reduces runoff in different climates and projects a greater relative future decrease in runoff, from 4% to 10% for the same precipitation decrease of 2.5%. The scheme also affects the projected changes in spatially averaged 100-year return precipitation and runoff with significance at the 0.9 confidence level. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Atmosphere land-surface model; Catchment runoff; Evapotranspiration; Soil water storage; Tightly bound soil water; WRF regional climate modelling","Annual rainfall; Annual runoff; Atmospheric conditions; Bound waters; Confidence levels; De-coupling; Fully-coupled; Land surface models; Land surface scheme; Precipitation and runoff; Reanalysis; Regional climate modelling; Regional climate models; River basins; Soil pores; Soil water; Soil water storage; South Africa; Surface models; Water availability; Water policies; Weather research and forecasting; WRF Model; Catchments; Climate models; Computer simulation; Evapotranspiration; Geologic models; Rain; Runoff; Soil moisture; Surface measurement; Water management; Water supply; Weather forecasting; Reservoirs (water); climate modeling; evapotranspiration; land surface; numerical model; precipitation (climatology); runoff; soil water; water stress; Olifants Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863110211

An increasing transference of competence to EU level institutions, and hence ""vertical integration,"" has taken place, most clearly in the case of the ETS. The main reasons for the differing increase in vertical integration are, first, that more member states were dissatisfied with the pre-existing system in the case of the ETS than in the two other cases. Second, the European Commission and Parliament were comparatively more united in pushing for changes in the case of the ETS. And, third, although RES and IEM policies were influenced by regional energy security concerns, they were less structurally linked to and influenced by the global climate regime than the ETS. © 2012 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"emissions trading; energy market; energy policy; environmental policy; environmental politics; European Commission; European Union; global climate; regional security; renewable resource; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860290469

Two policy instruments are considered - targeted biofuel support and a CO2 cost. The results show that over 3% of the total transport fuel demand can be met by second generation biofuels at a cost of approximately 65-73 EUR/MWh. With current energy prices, this demands biofuel support comparable to existing tax exemptions (around 30 EUR/MWh), or a CO2 cost of around 60 EUR/tCO2. Parameters having large effect on biofuel production include feedstock availability, fossil fuel price and capital costs. It is concluded that in order to avoid suboptimal energy systems, heat and electricity applications should also be included when evaluating optimal bioenergy use. It is also concluded that while forceful policies promoting biofuels may lead to a high biofuel share at reasonable costs, this is not a certain path towards maximised CO2 emission mitigation. Policies aiming to promote the use of bioenergy thus need to be carefully designed in order to avoid conflicts between different parts of the EU targets for renewable energy and CO2 emission mitigation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioenergy; Biofuels; Energy policy; Energy system optimisation","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Taxation; Bio-energy; Biofuel production; Capital costs; Current energy; Emission mitigation; Energy systems; Heat and electricity; Localisation; Optimisation models; Optimisations; Policy instruments; Renewable energies; Second generation; Tax exemptions; Transport fuel; Biofuels; bioenergy; biofuel; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy policy; energy use; European Union; fossil fuel; optimization; power generation; renewable resource; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859958732

By covering a wide range of ULIRG types, including many systems that have received very little previous attention, this data set provides an important set of templates for comparison with high-redshift galaxies. We employed an automated Gaussian line-fitting programme to decompose the emission-line profiles of Hα, [Nii], [Sii] and [Oi] into individual components, and chart the Hα kinematics, and the ionized gas excitations and densities. 11 out of 18 of our galaxies show evidence for outflowing warm ionized gas with speeds between 500 and a few 1000kms -1, with the fastest outflows associated with systems that contain an active galactic nucleus. Our spatially resolved spectroscopy has allowed us to map the outflows, and in some cases determine for the first time to which nucleus the wind is associated. In three of our targets we find line components with widths &gt;2000kms -1 over spatially extended regions in both the recombination and forbidden lines; in two of these three, they are associated with a known Sy2 nucleus. Eight galaxies have clear rotating gaseous discs, and for these we measure rotation velocities, virial masses, and calculate Toomre Q parameters. We find radial gradients in the emission-line ratios in a significant number of systems in our study. We attribute these gradients to changes in ionizing radiation field strength, most likely due to an increasing contribution of shocks with radius. We conclude with a detailed discussion of the results for each individual system, with reference to the existing literature. Our observations demonstrate that the complexity of the kinematics and gas properties in ULIRGs can only be disentangled with high sensitivity, spatially resolved IFU observations.

We use bivariate extreme value theory to model the tail dependence of this quantity as seen in observational data and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model driven by reanalysis, and we find tail dependence between the two. To link to synoptic-scale processes, we use daily mean sea-level pressure fields from the reanalysis product to develop a daily ""PE index"" for extreme precipitation that exhibits tail dependence with our observational quantity. Other models from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program ensemble are used to estimate the future marginal distributions of reanalysis-driven WRF output and observational precipitation. Finally, we employ the fitted tail dependence model to simulate observational precipitation measurements in the future, given output from a future run of WRF.

The challenge of communicating the science of climate change will be reduced if climate change researchers consider the links between personality types, communication tendencies and learning preferences. Jungian personality type is one of many factors related to an individual's preferred style of taking in and processing information, i. e., preferred communication style. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Jungian personality type profile of interdisciplinary, early career climate researchers is significantly different from that of the general population in the United States. In particular, Ph. D. climate researchers tend towards Intuition and focus on theories and the ""big picture"", while the U. S. general population tends towards Sensing and focuses on concrete examples and experience. There are other differences as well in the way the general public as a group prefers to take in information, make decisions, and deal with the outer world, compared with the average interdisciplinary climate scientist. These differences have important implications for communication between these two groups. We suggest that climate researchers will be more effective in conveying their messages if they are aware of their own personality type and potential differences in preferred learning and communication styles between themselves and the general public (and other specific audiences), and use this knowledge to more effectively target their audience. © 2011 The Author(s).",,"Biographies; Climate scientists; Communication styles; Effective communication; General population; Learning preferences; Personality types; Potential difference; Research communities; Climate change; climate change; communication behavior; decision making; higher education; interdisciplinary approach; learning; occupation; public attitude; research work; United States; Jungia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859216449

However, at the stage of utilization, high-functional steel products prove more environment friendly than their conventional counterparts in many cases. Therefore, evaluation on contribution of steel products to environmental improvement requires an integrated approach that considers the product over its entire life cycle - life cycle assessment (LCA). This paper discusses the relationship between the improvement of steel products performance and environmental impact from the entire life cycle perspectives. The LCA method to calculate and assess contribution of high-functional steel products during the life cycle to environmental improvement is explained. Two case studies of Baoshan Iron & Steel Co., Ltd. (Baosteel for short) are given to show that LCA is a scientific and systematic method for eco-materials evaluation or eco-design: (Mathematical Equation Presented) in a power transformer, using silicon steel B30P110 to replace B30G130 can reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the region of 15.1% over the life cycle of the power transformer; (Mathematical Equation Presented) tinplate steel of Baosteel for two-piece steel cans experienced six times thickness reduction from 0.280 to 0.225 mm, which results in 14.5% emission reduction over the life cycle of two-piece steel cans.

The PCR products were also inserted into vectors and then ligated with competent cells for gene sequencing. Based on the obtained gene sequences, bacterial and archaeal libraries were constructed and microbiological phylogeny graphs were obtained for the samples to understand the structure of microbial community and deduce the possible pathways of methanogenesis. The result indicates that there are only a few types of microbes in the samples of the two wells. Pseudomonas and Methanobacterium are the dominant species in the microbial and archaeal libraries, respectively. It is concluded that the indigenous microbial community in Well Du 6-3 probably mainly generated methane by CO 2 reduction, but methanogenesis of acetic acid could not be completely excluded. The methane from Well Ao-7 is shown to have been definitely converted from CO 2. Therefore, methane generation via indigenous microbial metabolism may be ultimately realized by using the right method under favourable conditions in the two fields. © 2012 Research Institute of Petroleum Exploration &amp; Development, PetroChina.","16S rRNA clone library; Biogas reservoir; Methane bio-pathway; Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)","biogas; formation water; gas field; geomicrobiology; hydrocarbon reservoir; methane; methanogenesis; microbial community; polymerase chain reaction; China; Songliao Basin; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Methanobacterium; Pseudomonas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865334646

The aim of this study was to examine the volatile organic compound (VOC)- or nitrogen oxide (NO x =NO+NO 2)-limited conditions at present and when surface temperature is increasing due to global warming, thus to make recommendations for future ozone abatement policies for the PRD region. The model used for this application is the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) third-generation air-quality modeling system; it consists of the mesoscale meteorological model MM5 and the chemical transport model named Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ). A series of sensitivity tests were conducted to assess the influence of VOC and NO x variations on ozone production. Tropical cyclone was shown to be one of the important synoptic weather patterns leading to ozone pollution. The simulations were based on a tropicalcyclone-related episode that occurred during 14-16 September 2004. The results show that, in the future, the control strategy for emissions should be tightened. To reduce the current level of ozone to meet the Hong Kong Environmental Protection Department (EPD) air-quality objective (hourly average of 120 ppb), emphasis should be put on restricting the increase of NO x emissions. Furthermore, for a wide range of possible changes in precursor emissions, temperature increase will increase the ozone peak in the PRD region; the areas affected by photochemical smog are growing wider, but the locations of the ozone plume are rather invariant. © 2012 Chinese National Committee for International Association of Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences, Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Science Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","chemical transport models; global warming; NO x/VOC-limited conditions; photochemical reactivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859826213

They recognized that long-term future warming is primarily constrained by cumulative anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, that deep cuts in global emissions are required, and that action based on equity must be taken to meet this objective. However, negotiations on emission reduction among countries are increasingly fraught with difficulty, partly because of arguments about the responsibility for the ongoing temperature rise. Simulations with two earth-system models (NCAR/CESM and BNU-ESM) demonstrate that developed countries had contributed about 60-80%, developing countries about 20-40%, to the global temperature rise, upper ocean warming, and sea-ice reduction by 2005. Enacting pledges made at Cancun with continuation to 2100 leads to a reduction in global temperature rise relative to business as usual with a 1/3-2/3 (CESM 33-67%, BNU-ESM 35-65%) contribution from developed and developing countries, respectively. To prevent a temperature rise by 2°C or more in 2100, it is necessary to fill the gap with more ambitious mitigation efforts.","Cancun pledge; Climate ethics; Climate modeling; Coupled model intercomparison project phase 5; Geoengineering","carbon dioxide; article; climate change; commercial phenomena; controlled study; developed country; developing country; greenhouse effect; priority journal; sea; sea ice; warming; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Conservation of Natural Resources; Developed Countries; Developing Countries; Models, Theoretical; Public Policy; United Nations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864682078

However, this optical sectioning capability breaks down eventually when imaging much deeper, as the out-of-focus fluorescence gradually overwhelms the in-focal signal in the scattering samples. The resulting loss of image contrast defines a fundamental imaging-depth limit, which cannot be overcome by increasing excitation efficiency. Herein we propose to extend this depth limit by performing stimulated emission reduced fluorescence (SERF) microscopy in which the two-photon excited fluorescence at the focus is preferentially switched on and off by a modulated and focused laser beam that is capable of inducing stimulated emission of the fluorophores from the excited states. The resulting image, constructed from the reduced fluorescence signal, is found to exhibit a significantly improved signal-to-background contrast owing to its overall higher-order nonlinear dependence on the incident laser intensity. We demonstrate this new concept by both analytical theory and numerical simulations. For brain tissues, SERF is expected to extend the imaging depth limit of two-photon fluorescence microscopy by a factor of more than 1.8. © 2012 Optical Society of America.",,"Fluorescence; Fluorescence microscopy; Photons; Stimulated emission; Analytical theory; Biological samples; Brain tissue; Excitation efficiency; Fluorescence signals; Focused laser beams; Image contrasts; Imaging-depth limit; Incident laser; Indispensable tools; Nonlinear dependence; Optical sectioning; Out-of-focus; Two-photon excited fluorescence; Two-photon fluorescence imaging; Two-photon fluorescence microscopy; Fluorophores",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863956554

For over a century, rinded spheroidal structures that exhibit an Fe(III) oxide-rich exterior and Fe-poor core have been described as oxidation products of Fe(II) carbonate concretions. However, mechanisms governing Fe(III) oxide precipitation within these structures remain an enigma. Here we present chemical and morphological evidence of microbial biosignatures in association with Fe(III) oxides in the Fe(III) oxide-rich rind of spheroidal concretions collected from the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone (southwest United States), implicating a microbial role in Fe biomineralization. The amount of total organic carbon in the exterior Fe(III) oxides exceeded measured values in the friable interior. The mean δ 13C value of organic carbon from the Fe(III) oxide-cemented exterior, δ 13C of -20.55‰, is consistent with a biogenic signature from autotrophic bacteria. Scanning electron micrographs reveal microstructures consistent with bacterial size and morphology, including a twisted-stalk morphotype that resembled an Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganism, Gallionella sp. Nanoscale associations of Fe, O, C, and N with bacterial morphotypes demonstrate microorganisms associated with Fe(III) oxides. Together these results indicate that autotrophic microorganisms were present during Fe(III) oxide precipitation and present microbial catalysis as a mechanism of Fe(III) oxide concretion formation. Microbial biosignatures in rinded Fe(III) oxide-rich concretions within an exhumed, Quaternary aquifer has broad implications for detection of life within the geological record on Earth as well as other Fe-rich rocky planets such as Mars, where both Fe(II) carbonate and Fe(III) oxide-rich concretions have been identified. © 2012 Geological Society of America.",,"Autotrophic bacteria; Biosignatures; Carbonate concretion; Jurassic; Microbial catalysis; Morphotypes; Nano scale; Oxidation products; Pore-water chemistry; Scanning electron micrographs; Total Organic Carbon; Aquifers; Biomineralization; Iron compounds; Microbiology; Organic carbon; Planets; Scanning electron microscopy; Sedimentology; Bacteria; aquifer; autotrophy; bacterium; biogenic structure; carbon isotope; catalysis; concretion; diagenesis; iron oxide; microorganism; mineralization; morphology; morphotype; oxidation; porewater; precipitation (chemistry); Quaternary; total organic carbon; tracer; water chemistry; United States; Bacteria (microorganisms); Gallionella; Streptopus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866165711

Shale gas may have important climate benefits if it displaces more carbon-intensive oil or coal, but recent attention has discussed the potential for upstream methane emissions to counteract this reduced combustion greenhouse gas emissions. We examine six recent studies to produce a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis of the carbon footprint of both shale and conventional natural gas production. The results show that the most likely upstream carbon footprints of these types of natural gas production are largely similar, with overlapping 95% uncertainty ranges of 11.0-21.0 g CO2e/MJLHV for shale gas and 12.4-19.5 g CO2e/MJLHV for conventional gas. However, because this upstream footprint represents less than 25% of the total carbon footprint of gas, the efficiency of producing heat, electricity, transportation services, or other function is of equal or greater importance when identifying emission reduction opportunities. Better data are needed to reduce the uncertainty in natural gas's carbon footprint, but understanding system-level climate impacts of shale gas, through shifts in national and global energy markets, may be more important and requires more detailed energy and economic systems assessments. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Climate impacts; Economic system; Emission reduction; Energy outlook; Global energy market; Methane emissions; MONTE CARLO; Natural-gas production; Shale gas; System levels; Transportation services; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Coal combustion; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Natural gas; Natural gas well production; Oil shale; Shale; Shale oil; Uncertainty analysis; Gas emissions; carbon; carbon dioxide; natural gas; economic analysis; energy market; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; Monte Carlo analysis; natural gas; shale; article; biofuel production; carbon cycling; carbon footprint; climate; controlled study; economic aspect; electricity; environmental impact assessment; environmental protection; heat; Monte Carlo method; oil shale; traffic and transport; Air Pollutants; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Footprint; Gas, Natural; Geologic Sediments; Oil and Gas Fields; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861883168

The correlation factors r 2 are bigger than 0.981. The universal quasi-Chemical activity coefficient (UNIQUAC) and the nonrandom two liquids equation (NRTL) were used to calculate the phase equilibrium data of the system with the interaction parameters fitted from the experimental data.

This study investigated the decomposition characteristics of wheat and maize straw under cold temperate, warm temperate, and midsubtropic climate conditions, and examined whether the chemical structures of straw residues became similar during decomposition under different climate conditions. Straws were put in 0.074-mm-mesh size litter bags to exclude soil fauna and buried in black soil plots at three experimental stations located in the aforementioned climate regions to rule out the impact of soil type. The decomposition rate constants of wheat straw and maize straw increased linearly with temperature, and the former was more sensitive to temperature. Climate conditions and straw quality had marked effects on the residual material structure in the first half year of decomposition, but then decreased. Wheat and maize straw showed common decomposition characteristics with a decrease of O/N-alkyl carbons and di-O-alkyls, and a simultaneous increase of alkyl carbons, aromatic carbons, aromatic C-O groups, and COO/N-C=O groups.

Changes in both climate and hydrological conditions can modify thermal regimes. Liuxihe Reservoir (23°45'50'N; 113°46'52'E) is a large, stratified and deep reservoir in Guangdong Province, located at the Tropic of Cancer of southern China. The reservoir is a warm monomictic water body with a long period of summer stratification and a short period of mixing in winter. The vertical distribution of suspended particulate material and nutrients are influenced strongly by the thermal structure and the associated flow fields. The hypolimnion becomes anoxic in the stratified period, increasing the release of nutrients from the bottom sediments. Fifty-one years of climate and reservoir operational observations are used here to show the marked changes in local climate and reservoir operational schemes. The data show increasing air temperature and more violent oscillations in inflow volumes in the last decade, while the inter-annual water level fluctuations tend to be more moderate. To quantify the effects of changes in climate and hydrological conditions on thermal structure, we used a numerical simulation model to create scenarios incorporating different air temperatures, inflow volumes, and water levels. The simulations indicate that water column stability, the duration of the mixing period, and surface and outflow temperatures are influenced by both natural factors and by anthropogenic factors such as climate change and reservoir operation schemes. Under continuous warming and more stable storage in recent years, the simulations indicate greater water column stability and increased duration of stratification, while irregular large discharge events may reduce stability and lead to early mixing in autumn. Our results strongly suggest that more attention should be focused on water quality in years of extreme climate variation and hydrological conditions, and selective withdrawal of deep water may provide an efficient means to reduce internal loading in warm years. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Hydrodynamic processes; Numerical simulation; Stratification; Thermal regime; Water quality","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Climate models; Computer simulation; Digital storage; Diseases; Hydrodynamics; Mixing; Numerical models; Nutrients; Open hearth furnaces; Surface waters; Thermal stratification; Water levels; Water quality; Anthropogenic factors; Hydrodynamic process; Hydrological condition; Stratified reservoirs; Suspended particulate material; Thermal regimes; Vertical distributions; Water-level fluctuation; Reservoirs (water); surface water; air temperature; anoxic conditions; anthropogenic effect; climate change; global warming; hydrodynamics; hydrological cycle; numerical model; reservoir; succession; suspended particulate matter; temperature effect; water level; water quality; air temperature; article; autumn; China; climate change; high temperature; hydrodynamics; low temperature; molecular stability; oscillation; priority journal; seasonal variation; sediment; simulation; summer; suspended particulate matter; thermocline; thermostability; turbidity; validation process; warming; water flow; water quality; water supply; water temperature; winter; China; Guangdong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862793103

A new BC emission inventory (PKU-BC(China)) has been developed with the following improvements: (1) The emission factor database was updated; (2) a 0.1° × 0.1° gridded map was produced for 2007 based on county-level proxies; (3) time trends were derived for 1949-2007 and predicted for 2008-2050; and (4) the uncertainties associated with the inventory were quantified. It was estimated that 1957 Gg of BC were emitted in China in 2007, which is greater than previously reported. Residential coal combustion was the largest source, followed by residential biofuel burning, coke production, diesel vehicles, and brick kilns. By using a county-level disaggregation method, spatial bias in province-level disaggregation, mainly due to uneven per capita emissions within provinces, was reduced by 42.5%. Emissions increased steadily since 1949 until leveling off in the mid-1990s, due to a series of technological advances and to socioeconomic progress. BC emissions in China in 2050 are predicted to be 920-2183 Gg/yr under various scenarios; and the industrial and transportation sectors stand to benefit the most from technological improvements. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Black carbon; Black carbon emission; Coke production; Diesel vehicles; Disaggregation; Emission factors; Emission inventories; Leveling offs; Per capita; Residential coals; Technological advances; Technological improvements; Time trends; Transportation sector; Brickmaking; Coal combustion; Particulate emissions; Industrial emissions; biofuel; black carbon; coal; coke; atmospheric pollution; biofuel; black carbon; coal; combustion; database; economic development; emission inventory; industrial emission; pollutant source; social development; spatiotemporal analysis; technological development; traffic emission; transportation system; trend analysis; article; biomass production; black carbon emission; carbon footprint; China; combustion; diesel engine; energy consumption; exhaust gas; gross national product; Air Pollutants; China; Geography; Human Activities; Humans; Soot; Time Factors; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863953483

Other properties that were evaluated were the clinker composition, compression strength of the clinker, and setting time of the clinker. Results indicated that the carbonation process was highly efficient for the release of chloride and that the process had a high efficiency for amphoteric heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd) solidified in the fly ash. The leached amount of Pb, Cu, and Zn in the wastewater effluent after the carbonation process was reduced to 20, 110, and 470 mg/kg compared with the amounts in the wastewater effluent after the single washing process.

Besides, it can be adopted as an alternative fuel for petroleum fuel of internal combustion engine. However, due to its unique physical and chemical characteristics, hydrogen often leads to abnormal combustion and decay of power, which can be effectively dealt with by optimal control. In this paper, thermodynamic analysis methods, like mass transfer and energy transfer, is combined with state space analysis methods of nonlinear control system, so that an optimal control model of nonlinear combustion control system for hydrogen fueled engines can be established. Through illustrating the inner relations between combustion and energy transfer of hydrogen fueled engines and operating parameter, state parameter and performance index, this paper provides theoretical analysis and found experimental research for promoting abnormal combustion and performance index after controlling operating parameters optimally and changing state parameters of the cylinder. Based on nonlinear programming theory and multi-objective genetic algorithm, the methods of establishing the optimal control model and carrying out the optimal value of operating parameters are shown in this paper. What's more, some new ways are proposed to integrate the optimal control aspects of multi-variate, multiple targets and multiple constraints for hydrogen fueled engines by changing the multi-objective and multi-constraint optimal control into the single-target integrated optimal control. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In this paper, a suboptimal EMS is developed for the real-time control of a series-parallel hybrid electric bus. It is then investigated and verified in a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation system constructed on PT-LABCAR, a commercial real-time simulator. First, an optimal EMS is obtained via iterative dynamic programming (IDP) by defining a cost function over a specific drive cycle to minimize fuel consumption, as well as to achieve zero battery state-of-charge (SOC) change and to avoid frequent clutch operation. The IDP method can lower the computational burden and improve the accuracy. Second, the suboptimal EMS for real-time control is developed by constructing an Elman neural network (NN) based on the aforementioned optimal EMS, so the real-time suboptimal EMS can be used in the vehicle control unit (VCU) of the hybrid bus. The real VCU is investigated and verified utilizing a HIL simulator in a virtual forward-facing HEV environment consisting of vehicle, driver and driving environment. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed real-time suboptimal EMS by the neural network can coordinate the overall hybrid powertrain of the hybrid bus to optimize fuel economy over different drive cycles, and the given drive cycles can be tracked while sustaining the battery SOC level. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Energy management strategy; Hardware-in-the-loop simulation; Iterative dynamic programming (IDP); Real-time simulation model; Series-parallel hybrid electric city-bus","Energy management strategies; Hardware in-the-loop simulation; Iterative Dynamic Programming; Real time simulations; Series-parallel; Automobile drivers; Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Control system synthesis; Dynamic programming; Energy management; Fuel economy; Hardware; Neural networks; Optimization; Real time control; Hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860568222

This study utilizes several data envelopment analysis (DEA) based models to evaluate the total-factor energy and emission performance of China's 30 regions within a joint production framework of considering desirable and undesirable outputs as well as separated energy and non-energy inputs. DEA window analysis is applied in this study to deal with cross-sectional and time-varying data, so as to measure the performance during the period of 2000-2009. Two treatments for undesirable outputs are combined with DEA models and the associated indicators for simplex energy performance and unified energy and emission performance measurement are proposed and compared. The evaluation results indicate that the treatment of undesirable outputs transformation is more appropriate for China's regional energy and emission performance evaluation because it has stronger discriminating power and can provide more reasonable evaluation results that characterize China's regions.

In particular, we examined the impact of a planned adaptation strategy to climate change -""Double-Delay"" technology, i. e., delay both the sowing time of wheat and the harvesting time of maize, on both wheat and maize yield. The results show that improved crop varieties and management options not only compensated some negative impact of reduced crop growth period on crop yield due to the increase in temperature, they have contributed significantly to crop yield increase. The increase in temperature before over-wintering stage enabled late sowing of winter wheat and late harvesting of maize, leading to overall 4-6% increase in total grain yield of the wheat-maize system. Increased use of farming machines and minimum tillage technology also shortened the time for field preparation from harvest time of summer maize to sowing time of winter wheat, which facilitated the later harvest of summer maize. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Adaptation strategies; Climate change adaptation; Crop growth; Crop yield; Cropping systems; Field data; Grain yield; Harvest time; Maize yield; Management options; Minimum tillage; North China Plain; Sowing time; Summer maize; Warming climate; Winter wheat; Yield potential; Climate change; Crops; Harvesting; Grain (agricultural product); adaptive management; climate change; crop yield; harvesting; maize; sowing date; temperature effect; warming; wheat; yield response; China; North China Plain; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864288091

This study was designed to assess the neuroprotective effects of lavender oil against ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury in mice. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced by the intraluminal occlusion method with a nylon string. The neurodysfuntion was evaluated by neurological deficit and the infarct area was showed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. The histopathological changes were observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. The levels of mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) and carbonyl, the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH)/glutathione disulfide (GSSG), the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathion peroxidase (GSH-Px) in brain tissue were measured to estimate the oxidative stress state. Neurological deficit, infarct size, histopathology changes and oxidative stress markers were evaluated after 22 h of reperfusion. In comparison with the model group, treatment with lavender oil significantly decreased neurological deficit scores, infarct size, the levels of MDA, carbonyl and ROS, and attenuated neuronal damage, upregulated SOD, CAT, GSH-Px activities and GSH/GSSG ratio. These results suggested that the neuroprotective effects of lavender oil against cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury may be attributed to its antioxidant effects.","Antioxidant; Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion; Lavender oil; Oxidative damage; ROS","antioxidant; catalase; essential oil; glutathione peroxidase; lavender oil; malonaldehyde; neuroprotective agent; plant extract; reactive oxygen metabolite; superoxide dismutase; vegetable oil; animal; article; brain; chemistry; disease model; drug effect; genetics; lavender; male; metabolism; mitochondrion; mouse; pathology; transient ischemic attack; Animals; Antioxidants; Brain; Catalase; Disease Models, Animal; Glutathione Peroxidase; Ischemic Attack, Transient; Lavandula; Male; Malondialdehyde; Mice; Mitochondria; Neuroprotective Agents; Oils, Volatile; Plant Extracts; Plant Oils; Reactive Oxygen Species; Superoxide Dismutase",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865497923

The proposed load control scheme balances device- and grid-level objectives simultaneously, and is demonstrated for a system comprising a distributed responsive population of 14,000 residential-sized buildings integrated in a transmission system network consisting of six buses. Air-source heat pumps are implemented as the primary heating source in the responsive building population, and are introduced as a dispatchable grid-side energy resource, where aggregated output can be objectively ramped up or down through the use of an optimal centralized control strategy. A two step multi-objective optimization procedure is implemented to simultaneously satisfy balancing of the power system and customer objectives across a multi-scalar system. At the power system-level, the optimal preventive control scheme is obtained based on steady-state voltage stability constraints. At the customer-level, an optimal demand response strategy is proposed, wherein the aggregate power demand from a population of heat pumps is controlled to follow load-shedding requirements. The customer comfort is continuously maintained by constrained regulation of the thermal set-point governing operation of the heat pump device.The proposed demand-side strategy achieves similar goals to conventional approaches to regulation and spinning reserve ancillary services, but with the significant benefit of higher efficiencies. Under the proposed scheme, ancillary services provided by the electric loads effectively become virtual generators that enhance the voltage stability in power systems operating under increased uncertainty, and replace severe or multiple contingency reserves typically supplied by conventional generators. The proposed demand response control scheme can be extended to other potentially responsive end-use appliances, and opens avenues for increased exploitation of intermittent renewable energy resources while reducing operating costs and emissions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Demand-side management; Distributed energy resources; Electric load modeling; Power systems analysis; Renewable energy integration; Voltage stability","Aggregates; Customer satisfaction; Electric loads; Electric power transmission; Electric utilities; Heat pump systems; Multiobjective optimization; Renewable energy resources; Sales; Standby power systems; Systems analysis; Textile industry; Voltage stabilizing circuits; Aggregated output; Ancillary service; Building population; Centralized control; Control schemes; Conventional approach; Demand response; Demand side managements; Demand-side; Distributed Energy Resources; End-uses; Heat pumps; Heating source; Higher efficiency; Load-shedding; Maintaining voltage; Multi objective optimizations (MOO); Multiple contingencies; Power demands; Preventive control; Renewable energies; Spinning reserves; Stability in power systems; Steady state voltage; System levels; Transmission systems; Virtual generators; Voltage security assessment; Voltage control; building; demand-side management; exploitation; heating; pump; renewable resource; steady-state equilibrium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862817633

Here a new dust dataset with the record extending back to the 1950s is used to show a multidecadal covariability of North Atlantic SST and aerosol, Sahel rainfall, and Atlantic hurricanes. When the North Atlantic Ocean was cold from the late 1960s to the early 1990s, the Sahel received less rainfall and the tropical North Atlantic experienced a high concentration of dust. The opposite was true when the North Atlantic Ocean was warm before the late 1960s and after the early 1990s. This suggests a novel mechanism for North Atlantic SST variability-a positive feedback between North Atlantic SST, African dust, and Sahel rainfall on multidecadal time scales. That is, a warm (cold) North Atlantic Ocean produces a wet (dry) condition in the Sahel and thus leads to low (high) concentration of dust in the tropical North Atlantic, which in turn warms (cools) the North Atlantic Ocean. An implication of this study is that coupled climate models need to be able to simulate this aerosolrelated feedback in order to correctly simulate climate variability in the North Atlantic. Additionally, it is found that dust in the tropical North Atlantic varies inversely with the number of Atlantic hurricanes on multidecadal time scales because of the multidecadal variability of both direct and indirect influences of dust on vertical wind shear in the hurricane main development region. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.","Atmosphere-ocean interaction; Climate variability; Multidecadal variability; Oceanic variability; Sea surface temperature; Tropical variabilty","Atmosphere-ocean interactions; Climate variability; Multidecadal variability; Oceanic variability; Sea surface temperature (SST); Tropical variabilty; Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Dust; Feedback; Hurricanes; Rain; Time measurement; Tropics; Oceanography; aerosol; air-sea interaction; climate modeling; climate variation; concentration (composition); dust; hurricane; rainfall; sea surface temperature; wind shear; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865089120

This is a summary and critical review of the Autism Strategy and its implementation. This includes discussion of the political context, reactions to the strategy by stakeholders, economic considerations, equity, integration across health and social care and the role of diagnostic services and specialist interventions. The Autism Strategy Fulfilling and Rewarding Lives was published in 2010. It aimed to increase awareness of autism, establish clear pathways for diagnosis and needs assessment, promote independent living and access to work, and help the development of local services. It focuses on intended outcomes, is not prescriptive about how those aims are achieved, and relies on existing legislation such as the Disability Discrimination Act. The emphasis on accessing mainstream services may limit the development of appropriate specialist services, especially in the current economic climate. Specialist interventions that may follow diagnosis are not prioritised, even though the economic case for them has been well made by the Audit Commission. Although the Department of Health has produced “outcomes and ambitions” to measure implementation of the Strategy, local authorities are not required to measure themselves against these targets or publish their results. However, organisations such as the National Autistic Society have already developed training materials to help with implementation, and the NICE guidelines for adults with autism due in 2012 may help the development of better services. This article provides new insights into the implications of the strategy for service users, service managers and healthcare professionals. Although the strategy applies to England only, the principles are of interest to stakeholders in other countries. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Autism; Health policy; Health services; Service development; United Kingdom",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862599943

The number of countries adopting some form of regulation has grown dramatically. Moreover, the form of the standard is starting to shift away from a mass based approach toward a footprint based approach, which will open up additional opportunities to take advantage of lightweighting as a key element of a control strategy. This chapter describes the history and most recent developments (up to the beginning of 2011) on greenhouse gas emission and/or fuel economy standards from non-EU OECD countries around the world, namely in Canada, Japan, South Korea and the United States. Other OECD countries such as Australia and Mexico are also considering the implementation of similar standards. While command and control standards are expected to remain the backbone of control efforts, economic incentives or disincentives including fuel taxes are expected to play an even more important role in the future than they do today. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

To address this challenge, the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) and The Observing System Research and Predictability Experiment (THORPEX) of the World Weather Research Programme (WWRP) are conducting a joint research activity consisting of a focus period approach along with an integrated research framework tailored to exploit the vast amounts of existing observations, expanding computational resources, and the development of new, high-resolution modeling frameworks. The objective of the Year of Tropical Convection (YOTC) is to use these constructs to advance the characterization, modeling, parameterization, and prediction of multiscale tropical convection, including relevant two-way interactions between tropical and extratropical systems. This article highlights the diverse array of scientifically interesting and socially important weather and climate events associated with the WCRP-WWRP/THORPEX YOTC period of interest: May 2008-April 2010. Notable during this 2-yr period was the change from cool to warm El Niño- Southern Oscillation (ENSO) states and the associated modulation of a wide range of smaller time- and space-scale tropical convection features. This period included a near-record-setting wet North American monsoon in 2008 and a very severe monsoon drought in India in 2009. There was also a plethora of tropical wave activity, including easterly waves, the Madden-Julian oscillation, and convectively coupled equatorial wave interactions. Numerous cases of high-impact rainfall events occurred along with notable features in the tropical cyclone record. The intent of this article is to highlight these features and phenomena, and in turn promote their interrogation via theory, observations, and models in concert with the YOTC program so that improved understanding and pre- dictions of tropical convection can be afforded. ©2012 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climate event; Climate prediction; Climate research; Climate variability; Computational resources; Easterly wave; Equatorial waves; Extratropical; High resolution; Integrated research; Madden-Julian oscillation; Modeling frameworks; Multiscales; North American; Observing systems; Rainfall event; Research activities; Southern oscillation; Tropical convection; Tropical cyclone; Two-way interaction; Wave activity; Weather research; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climatology; Nickel compounds; Research; Tropical engineering",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865357602

We argue that a regional scalar politics shapes the framing of emissions in the Illawarra Mercury. A key question organising this article concerns the way in which geographical scale is invoked, and reproduced, in this newspaper to structure a certain rationale in reporting on emissions from one of Australia's largest greenhouse gas emitters, the Port Kembla Steelworks.

In 2007, there were an estimated 5550 ha with the production of premium quality olive oil predicted to triple by 2011. Very little historical information is available about olive oil production in California. Since premium oils rely primarily on sensory characteristics to determine price and popularity, a long term program was started to evaluate and characterize flavors of some of the world's most popular cultivars grown in different regions of California. In 1996, fifteen cultivars from the same nursery source were planted in five different climatic zones in northern California. Over the last three years, fruit from each cultivar was harvested at approximately the same maturity index and made into oil using the Abencor system. Evaluation of the oils was conducted by trained tasters of the University of California Taste Panel. A 15-point profile sheet and data base were developed and used to rate oils by their specific flavor intensities and characteristics such as bitterness, pungency, aroma, complexity, and balance. Fruitiness undertone flavor characteristics such as nutty, buttery, floral, tropical, grassy, herbaceous, mint, eucalyptus, and spice were also noted in three different intensity levels (slight, moderate, or strong). Another six-seven growing seasons will be needed to sufficiently classify the cultivars with statistical reliability due to extensive variability from yearly climatic changes, alternate bearing, and fruit maturity influences. A general trend, however, has been that oils made from olives grown in cooler climates have higher flavor intensities. This evaluation process for olive oils has the potential to help farmers select cultivars, determine harvest dates, and blend oils to produce specific oil styles and flavors specific to targeted consumer groups.","Evaluation; Flavor; Organoleptic; Profile; Sensory; Taste; Terroir; Typicity","Eucalyptus; Mentha; Oleaceae",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864508859

Here we describe wood anatomy-based proxies for spring temperatures in central North America from modern bur oaks (Quercus macrocarpa Michx.). The strong coherence of temperature signals across the species range supports the use of these proxies across thousands of years of climatic change. We also used 79 subfossil oak log cross sections from northern Missouri, 14C-dated to 9.9-13.63 ka (ka is 1000 cal yr BP), to assess the frequency of oak deposition into alluvial sediments and a subset of these oaks for a wood anatomy-based reconstruction of spring paleotemperatures. Temperatures during the Younger Dryas cold period (YD) were up to 3.5°C lower than modern temperatures for that region, equivalent to or lower than those experienced at the northern edge of the modern species range. Compared to extant oaks growing at much higher [CO2], subfossil oaks had greater vessel frequencies. Besides very low theoretical (or estimated) xylem conductivity near the beginning of the oak record near 13.6 ka, vessel frequencies greater than modern trees compensated for reduced vessel dimensions so that theoretical xylem conductivity was consistently above that of modern trees at the cold northern sites. Significant correlations were found between the frequency of 14C-dated oaks and either δ18O from the NGRIP (North Greenland Ice Core Project) ice core or from the Cariaco grayscale marine-sediment record from the southern Caribbean sea. Oak deposition into alluvial sediments during the YD was significantly lower than expected given the average sample depth of oaks from 9.9 to 13.6 ka. Reduced oak deposition during the YD suggests that an abrupt shift in climate reduced oak populations across the region and/or changed the rates of channel movement across drainages. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","Bølling-Allerød; Bur oak; Great Plains, USA; Holocene; Phenology; Pleistocene; Pre-Boreal; Quercus macrocarpa; Radiocarbon; Wood anatomy; Xylem; Younger Dryas","alluvial deposit; anatomy; channel; climate variation; conductivity; deciduous forest; depositional environment; GRIP; ice core; last deglaciation; marine sediment; paleoclimate; paleoecology; paleotemperature; proxy climate record; radiocarbon dating; spring (season); subfossil; synchrony; temperature effect; vegetation history; xylem; Younger Dryas; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Caribbean Sea; Great Plains; Missouri; United States; Quercus; Quercus macrocarpa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861588459

Restricting food containing elevated AGEs improves these risk factors in diabeticCKD. Because diet adherence can be problematic, this study aimed to remove cytotoxic AGEs from food already ingested and to determine whether sevelamer carbonate sequesters cytotoxic AGEs in the gut, preventing their uptake and thereby reducing AGE-induced abnormalities. Design, setting, participants, &amp;measurements This single-center, randomized, 2-month, open-label, intention-totreat, crossover study compared sevelamer carbonate with calcium carbonate treatment in stage 2-4 diabetic CKD. Participants received 2 months of treatment with one drug, had a 1-week washout, and then received the opposite drug for 2 months. Results: Sevelamer carbonate reduced HbA1c, serum methylglyoxal, serum εN-carboxymethyl-lysine, triglycerides, and 8-isoprostanes. Total cholesterol and fibroblast growth factor 23 were reduced by sevelamer carbonate, relative to calcium carbonate. AGE receptor 1 and sirtuin 1 mRNA were increased and PMNC TNFa levels were decreased by sevelamer carbonate, but not calciumcarbonate. Medications and caloric andAGE intake remained unchanged. Sevelamer carbonate reversibly bound AGE-BSA at intestinal, but not stomach, pH. Conclusions: Sevelamer carbonate significantly reducesHbA1c, fibroblast growth factor 23, lipids, andmarkers of inflammation and oxidative stress, and markedly increases antioxidantmarkers, independently of phosphorus in patients with diabetes and early kidney disease. These novel actions of sevelamer carbonate on metabolic and inflammatory abnormalities in type 2 diabetes mellitus may affect progression of early diabetic CKD. © 2012 by the American Society of Nephrology.",,"6 n carboxymethyllysine; 8 isoprostane; advanced glycation end product; advanced glycation end product receptor; bicarbonate; calcium carbonate; chloride; cystatin C; fibroblast growth factor 23; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; methylglyoxal; phosphate; potassium; sevelamer carbonate; sirtuin 1; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adult; antiinflammatory activity; article; caloric intake; cholesterol blood level; chronic kidney disease; clinical article; controlled study; crossover procedure; female; human; kidney function; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; oxidative stress; pH; randomized controlled trial; Aged; Biological Markers; Calcium; Calcium Carbonate; Chelating Agents; Cross-Over Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Nephropathies; Dinoprost; Female; Fibroblast Growth Factors; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Glycosylation End Products, Advanced; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Kidney; Leukocytes; Lipids; Male; Middle Aged; New York City; Oxidative Stress; Phosphorus; Polyamines; Severity of Illness Index; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862223183

The detection of this species in the Cauca Valley in 2007 generated a series of investigations to confront this problem. One of them was the search for host plant resistance to this pest. Therefore we sought to adapt a methodology for evaluating the attack of spittlebugs on sugar cane. Due to the pest's quarantine situation, Zulia carbonaria, another spittlebug species present in the region, was used instead. For customizing the methodology we used the sugar cane varieties CC 84 - 75 and CC 85 - 92. Three experiments were carried out in a factorial arrangement under a completely randomized design, to determine basic aspects such as: type of container for the development of secondary surface roots necessary for the first nymphal stages; age of the plant to infest with spittlebug nymphs; and optimal infestation density per plant. The results indicated that the best expression of damage was when infestation was with eight eggs of Z. carbonaria on plants that were 12 weeks old since transplanting, with a root development index of at least three, this using a PVC container as a pot, an adjustable cap of the same material, and a base of polystyrene. The resultant methodology, with a few adjustments in terms of the density of infestation, could be used with A. varia and other spittlebugs in sugar cane.","Aeneolamia varia; Spittlebug; Sugar cane; Zulia carbonaria",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878228801

Combustion standards generally assess total PM at the chimney stack, with variable levels depending on local legislation, industrial activity, population density, etc. (e.g. 100-200mg/m 3 in Massachusetts, 150mg/m 3 in Québec, and 600mg/m 3 in New York). Some areas mandate relatively low PM levels from boilers (50mg/m 3 in Europe, 20mg/m 3 in Germany starting in 2015).

Elderly subjects show increased cardiac morbidity and mortality associated with air pollution exposure. Mexico City (MC) residents are chronically exposed to high concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) and PM-associated lipopolysaccharides (PM-LPS). To test the hypothesis that chronic exposure to urban pollution produces myocardial inflammation, female Balb-c mice age 4 weeks were exposed for 16 months to two distinctly different polluted areas within MC: southwest (SW) and northwest (NW). SW mice were given either no treatment or chocolate 2g/9.5mg polyphenols/3 times per week. Results were compared to mice kept in clean air. Key inflammatory mediator genes: cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and the LPS receptor CD14 (cluster of differentiation antigen 14) were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Also explored were target NFκB (nuclear factor κB), oxidative stress and antioxidant defense genes.TNF-α, IL-6, and COX-2 were significantly increased in both NW and SWMC mice (p=. 0.0001). CD14 was up-regulated in SW mice in keeping with the high exposures to particulate matter associated endotoxin. Chocolate administration resulted in a significant down-regulation of TNF-α (p&lt;. 0.0001), IL-6 (p=. 0.01), and IL-1β (p=. 0.02). The up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes and the down-regulation of potent oxidases, toll-like receptors, and pro-apoptotic signaling genes completed the protective profile.Exposure to air pollution produces up-regulation of inflammatory myocardial genes and endotoxin plays a key role in the inflammatory response. Regular consumption of dark chocolate may reduce myocardial inflammation and have cardioprotective properties in the setting of air pollution exposures. © 2010 Elsevier GmbH.","Air pollution; Cardioprotection; CD14; Dark chocolate; Endotoxin; IL-1β; IL-6; Myocardial inflammation; Particulate matter; TNF-α","CD14 antigen; cyclooxygenase 2; endotoxin; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; lipopolysaccharide; oxidoreductase; polyphenol; toll like receptor; tumor necrosis factor alpha; air pollution; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; Bagg albino mouse; cacao; controlled study; dark chocolate; environmental exposure; enzyme induction; female; food intake; gene control; gene upregulation; heart disease; heart protection; inflammation; long term exposure; Mexico; mortality; mouse; myocarditis; nonhuman; oxidative stress; particulate matter; real time polymerase chain reaction; urban area; Air Pollutants; Animals; Antioxidants; Cacao; Cardiotonic Agents; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Gene Expression; Heart; Inflammation Mediators; Mexico; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Myocarditis; Myocardium; Oxidoreductases; Particulate Matter; Polyphenols; Up-Regulation; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859426029

Little analysis investigating these interactions exists, in part because it requires a broad interdisciplinary approach. Using a new integrated city model, we provide a first quantification of these trade-offs and synergies, going beyond the qualitative statements that have been published so far. We undertake a multicriteria analysis of three urban policies: a greenbelt policy, a zoning policy to reduce flood risk and a transportation subsidy. Separately, each of these policies seems to be undesirable because each one negatively affects at least one of the different policy goals; however, in a policy mix, the consequences of each policy are not simply additive. This nonlinearity permits building policy combinations that are win-win strategies. In particular, flood zoning and greenbelt policies can only be accepted if combined with transportation policies. Our results show that stand-alone adaptation and mitigation policies are unlikely to be politically acceptable and emphasize the need to mainstream climate policy within urban planning. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

However, because of the increasing pressure brought by the public opinion, the attempts to assign an economic, yet volatile, valuation to ecosystems assets has multiplied in recent years, and policy communities are increasingly compelled to incorporate them into land use planning initiatives. Based on contributions to this special issue, we discuss how the perspective of ecosystem services can contribute to develop sound land-use policies and planning actions. Beyond valuation, several practical implications emerge from the contributions. A myriad of potential tradeoffs must be analyzed because since the provision of some services can be accompanied by the emergence of unexpected dis-services. For example, carbon accumulation based on increasing net primary production rates may simultaneously cut water yields and, hence, water provision. Various existing mechanisms ranging from state-controlled to market-controlled for rewarding the provision of ecosystem services are analyzed and discussed in terms of their capacity to connect nature to land-use planning. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Economic and biophysical views; Evaluation methods; Tradeoffs","carbon budget; contingent valuation; economic activity; ecosystem service; environmental economics; land use planning; net primary production; policy approach; public attitude; sustainable development; trade-environment relations; trade-off; water yield",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859722642

To define suitable areas within the state to each species in both scenarios (present and future), we used the climate envelope approach with the software Maxent. To select the planning units, we used two target sets: (i) species representation in 17% and 40% of the suitable area for the species within the state, and (ii) species representation in 17% and 40% within the state's area. Patterns of species richness predicted to the current and the future scenarios were similar, however, it was possible to observe a future increase in species richness for the north part of the state. When the representation target was more ambitious, to maintain 40% of the suitable area to the state, we observed the need to add new areas close to the current protected areas.

Due to potential energy security benefits, it has also been considered as an alternate source for gasoline and diesel production. Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies have previously estimated the greenhouse gas emissions associated with coal combustion as well as upstream activities such as mining and transport, to compare its environmental impact with other fuels. Until recent years, LCA studies predominantly ignored the uncertainty and variability inherent in life cycle assessment. More recent work has estimated the uncertainty in the life cycle inventories of fossil fuels, but the use of these uncertainty ranges to model system-wide impacts has been limited. As shown by previous studies, uncertainty often affects the conclusions of comparative life cycle assessments, especially when differences in average environmental impacts between two competing fuels/products are small. This study builds upon an existing deterministic life cycle framework for coal and develops uncertainty estimates of associated greenhouse gas emissions, with the objective of supporting more robust decision-making in comparative energy systems analyses involving coal. Greenhouse gas emissions from fuel use and methane releases at coal mines, fuel use for coal transport and combustion of coal, based on publicly available data are included in the life cycle framework. Mean life cycle GHG emissions from coal are estimated to be 96 g CO 2e/MJ, while the 90% confidence interval ranged between 89 and 106 g CO 2e/MJ. Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions from Fischer-Tropsch (FT) coal-based gasoline are stochastically compared to emissions from petroleum-based gasoline. In the base case modeled, emissions from coal-based FT gasoline were found to be higher than emissions from petroleum-based gasoline with a probability of 80%, while they are lower with a probability of 20%. Results suggest that incorporating uncertainty in life cycle estimates is important, especially if these estimates are to be used within policy frameworks. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Alternate Source; Combustion of coal; Comparative life cycle assessment; Confidence interval; Diesel production; Energy systems analysis; Fischer Tropsch; Fuel use; GHG emission; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life Cycle Inventory; Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions; Policy framework; Uncertainty and variability; Uncertainty estimates; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal mines; Energy resources; Environmental impact; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Systems analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Life cycle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865137458

This study applies standards-based life cycle assessment to compare the cradle-to-farm gate greenhouse gas emissions of 12 crop products grown in California using both organic and conventional methods. In addition to analyzing steady-state scenarios in which the soil organic carbon stocks are at equilibrium, this study models a hypothetical scenario of converting each conventional farming system to a corresponding organic system and examines the impact of soil carbon sequestration during the transition. The results show that steady-state organic production has higher emissions per kilogram than conventional production in seven out of the 12 cases (10.6% higher overall, excluding one outlier). Transitional organic production performs better, generating lower emissions than conventional production in seven cases (17.7% lower overall) and 22.3% lower emissions than steady-state organic. The results demonstrate that converting additional cropland to organic production may offer significant GHG reduction opportunities over the next few decades by way of increasing the soil organic carbon stocks during the transition. Nonorganic systems could also improve their environmental performance by adopting management practices to increase soil organic carbon stocks. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","conventional farming; greenhouse gas emissions; life cycle assessment; organic farming; soil carbon sequestration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864665097

Accessible data on air quality indicates that all criteria pollutants satisfy both U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and World Health Organization (WHO) air quality standards and guidelines, respectively. The exception is PM2.5 (particles with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm), which is not currently considered a criteria pollutant in Singapore but may potentially be the major local air pollution problem and cause for health concern. Levels of other airborne pollutants as well as their physical and chemical processes associated with local formation, transformation, dispersion, and deposition are not known. According to available emission inventories, Singapore's contribution to the total atmospheric pollution and carbon budget at the regional and global scales is small. Emissions per unit gross domestic product (GDP) are low compared with other countries, although Singapore's per-capita GDP and per-capita emissions are among the highest in the world. Some information is available on health effects, but the impacts on the ecosystem and the complex interactions of air pollution and climate change at a regional level are also unknown. This article reviews existing available information on atmospheric pollution and greenhouse gas emissions and proposes a multipollutant approach to greenhouse gas mitigation and local air quality. Singapore, by reducing its per-capita emissions, increasing the availability of information (e.g., through regularly publishing hourly and/or daily PM2.5 concentrations) and developing a research agenda in this area, would likely be seen to be a model of a high-density, livable, and sustainable city in Southeast Asia and other tropical regions worldwide. Singapore is widely recognized for its environmental achievements and often cited as a model of a high-density, livable, and sustainable city. This article reviews available information with the aim to provide a reference for future scientific research of strategic relevance for Singapore's air quality and greenhouse gas mitigation management under a multipollutant framework. However, the limited publicly accessible data and little scientific information prevent a comprehensive assessment of the local air quality and greenhouse gas emissions. Singapore's dynamic economy and strong profile in advanced science and technological innovation have the potential to enhance the research agenda in this area, which is not yet well developed in tropical cities. © Copyright 2012 A&amp;WMA.",,"Air quality standards; Atmospheric chemistry; Budget control; Climate change; Environmental Protection Agency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Health; Reviews; Sustainable development; Tropics; Atmospheric pollution; Comprehensive assessment; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Gross domestic products; Scientific information; Technological innovation; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; World Health Organization; Air quality; carbon; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; carbon footprint; climate change; environmental monitoring; gas; geography; gross national product; human; meteorology; particulate matter; priority journal; public health; review; Singapore",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861947647

We focus on small-scale portions within the observed solar active region and discover the appearance of very distinctive small-scale and short-lived dark features in Ca ii H chromospheric filtergrams and Stokes I images. The features appear in regions with close-to-zero longitudinal magnetic field, and are observed to increase in length before they eventually disappear. Energy release in the low chromospheric line is detected while the dark features are fading. Three complete series of these events are detected with remarkably similar properties, i. e. lifetime of ≈ 12 min, maximum length and area of 2 - 4 Mm and 1.6 - 4 Mm 2, respectively, and all with associated brightenings. In time series of magnetograms a diverging bipolar configuration is observed accompanying the appearance of the dark features and the brightenings. The observed phenomena are explained as evidencing elementary flux emergence in the solar atmosphere, i. e. small-scale arch filament systems rising up from the photosphere to the lower chromosphere with a length scale of a few solar granules. Brightenings are explained as being the signatures of chromospheric heating triggered by reconnection of the rising loops (once they have reached chromospheric heights) with pre-existing magnetic fields, as well as being due to reconnection/cancellation events in U-loop segments of emerging serpentine fields. The characteristic length scale, area and lifetime of these elementary flux emergence events agree well with those of the serpentine field observed in emerging active regions. We study the temporal evolution and dynamics of the events and compare them with the emergence of magnetic loops detected in quiet Sun regions and serpentine flux emergence signatures in active regions. The physical processes of the emergence of granular-scale magnetic loops seem to be the same in the quiet Sun and active regions. The difference is the reduced chromospheric emission in the quiet Sun attributed to the fact that loops are emerging in a region of lower ambient magnetic field density, making interactions and reconnection less likely to occur. Incorporating the novel features of granular-scale flux emergence presented in this study, we advance the scenario for serpentine flux emergence. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Active regions; Emerging flux; Sunspots",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859986723

Methanol can be renewably produced from hydrogen in combination with biomass or CO 2 from the atmosphere and flue gases. From well to tank studies it appears that hydrogen derived methanol compares favourably with liquid or compressed hydrogen both in terms of production cost and energy efficiency. Since existing well to wheel studies are based on outdated technology, this paper tries to provide efficiency figures for state-of-the-art hydrogen and methanol engines using published data and measurements on our own flex-fuel engine. Both fuels offer a great potential for efficiency improvements compared to gasoline engines thanks to a variety of favourable properties. However, there is a clear distinction between engines specifically designed for hydrogen or methanol operation and flex-fuel engines, which should also run on gasoline. For dedicated engines, the literature indicates that peak brake thermal efficiencies up to 45% and 42% are possible on hydrogen and methanol respectively. The ability to employ qualitative load control instead of throttling enables relative efficiency improvements compared to gasoline between 10 and 20% due to reduced pumping losses in part load. On our flex-fuel engine, operation on hydrogen using qualitative load control enabled the highest efficiencies, especially at low loads, where improvements up to 40% relative to gasoline were possible. At elevated loads, rising NO x emissions necessitated a switch to throttled stoichiometric operation, resulting in efficiencies comparable to those on gasoline. The efficiency benefit of methanol is more modest (5-10% relative to gasoline), but can be retained over the entire load range. These improvements are mostly due to reduced pumping losses, increased burning velocities and a slight decrease in cooling losses. Future well-to-wheel studies should take this considerable potential for efficiency improvements into consideration and should also distinguish between dedicated and flex-fuel engines. © 2012, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In some systems, cellular quiescence is associated with a low metabolic state characterized by a decrease in glucose uptake and glycolysis, reduced translation rates and activation of autophagy as a means to provide nutrients for survival. For cells in multiple different quiescence model systems, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mammalian lymphocytes and hematopoietic stem cells, the PI3Kinase/TOR signaling pathway helps to integrate information about nutrient availability with cell growth rates. Quiescence signals often inactivate the TOR kinase, resulting in reduced cell growth and biosynthesis. However, quiescence is not always associated with reduced metabolism; it is also possible to achieve a state of cellular quiescence in which glucose uptake, glycolysis and flux through central carbon metabolism are not reduced. In this review, we compare and contrast the metabolic changes that occur with quiescence in different model systems. © 2012 Landes Bioscience.","Autophagy; Glucose uptake; Metabolism; Quiescence; TOR","autophagy protein 5; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; initiation factor 4E; mammalian target of rapamycin; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1; mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2; manganese superoxide dismutase; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate; phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A; protein kinase B; protein kinase LKB1; rapamycin; small interfering RNA; target of rapamycin kinase; trehalose; tuberin; anaerobic glycolysis; autophagy; biosynthesis; cancer cell; carbon metabolism; catabolism; cell cycle arrest; cell death; cell differentiation; cell energy; cell growth; cell proliferation; DNA damage; endoplasmic reticulum stress; Escherichia coli; fibroblast; gene expression; gene expression regulation; glucose metabolism; glucose transport; glycolysis; growth rate; heat shock; hematopoietic stem cell; human; lymphocyte; macroautophagy; mammal cell; metabolism; mitochondrial respiration; neuroblast; nonhuman; nuclear localization signal; osmotic stress; oxidative phosphorylation; protein binding; protein dephosphorylation; protein phosphorylation; protein synthesis; review; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; signal transduction; starvation; temperature stress; Mammalia; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860778451

However, in places where high temperatures occur during the main cultivation period, special application of the CO2 enrichment is needed due to the fact of high ventilation needs which reduce the available time for CO2 application leading to a lower crop yield. This work examines the effect of artificial CO2 application on the optimum increase of pepper plants productivity under high temperature conditions. This study was performed in two identical greenhouses (experimental and control greenhouse) and was repeated three times, twice in the spring cultivation period and once in the autumn. During this study, a characteristic property of plant physiology was exploited. It is known that increasing the CO2 concentration at levels higher than normal the optimum temperature of the C 3 plants growth is also increased. This results in a reduction of time needed for ventilation of greenhouses allowing the application of CO 2 for longer period. The results showed that the CO2 enrichment technique used under high temperatures confers beneficial outcomes, like all the other known enrichment techniques. In the experimental greenhouse, where the enrichment was applied, plants were absorbing CO2 at high rates and showed an improved growth and production of about 27% compared to those in the control greenhouse regardless of higher than optimum temperature levels in the experimental greenhouse.","Improved growth and production; Spring and autumn cultivation period","Capsicum annuum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863645636

However, forest transition theory predicts that trajectories of change can be modified by economic factors, leading to spatial and temporal heterogeneity in rates of change that may take the form of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). This study aimed to assess the evidence regarding potential forest transition in Southern Mexico by classifying regional forest cover change using Landsat imagery from 1990 through to 2006. Patterns of forest cover change were found to be complex and non-linear. When rates of forest loss were averaged over 342 municipalities using mixed-effects modelling the results showed a significant (p<0.001) overall reduction of the mean rate of forest loss from 0.85% per year in the 1990-2000 period to 0.67% in the 2000-2006 period. The overall regional annual rate of deforestation has fallen from 0.33% to 0.28% from the 1990s to 2000s. A high proportion of the spatial variability in forest cover change cannot be explained statistically. However analysis using spline based general additive models detected underlying relationships between forest cover and income or population density of a form consistent with the EKC. The incipient forest transition has not, as yet, resulted in widespread reforestation. Forest recovery remains below 0.20% per year. Reforestation is mostly the result of passive processes associated with reductions in the intensity of land use. Deforestation continues to occur at high rates in some focal areas. A transition could be accelerated if there were a broader recognition among policy makers that the regional rate of forest loss has now begun to fall. The changing trajectory provides an opportunity to actively restore forest cover through stimulating afforestation and stimulating more sustainable land use practices. The results have clear implications for policy aimed at carbon sequestration through reducing deforestation and enhancing forest growth. © 2012 Vaca et al.",,"article; deforestation; forest loss; forest structure; forestry; geographic distribution; land use; Mexico; nonhuman; population density; reforestation; Agriculture; Animals; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecology; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Forestry; Geography; Mexico; Models, Statistical; Models, Theoretical; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864657199

Most community housing providers rely on rental income as their major source of recurrent funding and the rents are often set to a low percentage of the tenants' income. Therefore, these not-for-profit organizations have to operate within very stringent budgets. Tenants in community housing may also have special needs. Their energy consumption are relatively high, as they spend long hours in their homes. They are therefore particularly vulnerable to increasing energy prices, and in need of the most assistance in reducing these living costs. This paper researches the status of energy use and the needs of the community housing to reduce the energy and water consumption. There appear to be ample opportunities for water and energy efficiency improvement in community housing, e.g. insulation, more energy efficient hot water systems, etc. However, the organizations lack of time, knowledge, fund and expertise to improve energy efficiency makes it hard and thus create a room for the Government to take initiates to reduce carbon from this sector. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to avoid biases of culture-based approaches, stable isotope probing was applied in combination with sequence analysis of 16 S rRNA gene pyrotags amplified from 13C-enriched DNA fractions. Special attention was paid to pyrosequencing data analysis in order to eliminate the errors caused by either generation of amplicons (random errors caused by DNA polymerase, formation of chimeric sequences) or sequencing itself. Therefore, sample DNA was amplified, sequenced, and analyzed along with the DNA of a mock community constructed out of 8 bacterial strains. This warranted that appropriate tools and parameters were chosen for sequence data processing. 13C-labeled metagenomes isolated after the incubation of soil samples with all three studied aromatics were largely dominated by Proteobacteria, namely sequences clustering with the genera Rhodanobacter Burkholderia, Pandoraea, Dyella as well as some Rudaea- and Skermanella-related ones. Pseudomonads were mostly labeled by 13C from naphthalene and benzoate. The results of this study show that many biphenyl/benzoate-assimilating bacteria derive carbon also from naphthalene, pointing out broader biodegradation abilities of some soil microbiota. The results also demonstrate that, in addition to traditionally isolated genera of degradative bacteria, yet-to-be cultured bacteria are important players in bioremediation. Overall, the study contributes to our understanding of biodegradation processes in contaminated soil.

The free-living and protozoa-associated communities were composed of the same three genera [namely Methanobrevibacter, Methanomicrobium and rumen cluster C (RCC), which is distantly related to Thermoplasma]; however, the distribution of the methanogen genera differed between the two communities. Despite previous reports of potential bias for the degenerate mcrA primer set, the 16S rRNA (n5100 clones) and mcrA (n592 clones) gene libraries exhibited a similar distribution pattern for the three methanogenic genera. RCC was more abundant in the free-living community and represented 72 and 42% of the 16S rRNA and mrcA gene sequences, respectively, versus 54 and 13% of the 16S rRNA and mrcA gene sequences from the PAM community, respectively. The majority of RCC sequences from the free-living and protozoa-associated communities belonged to different species-level operational taxonomic units. Methanobrevibacter species were more abundant in the PAM community and represented 42 and 79% of clones for the 16S rRNA and mrcA gene libraries, respectively, versus 9 and 27% of 16S rRNA and mrcA gene clones from the free-living community, respectively. Methanomicrobium species were predominantly free-living. Primers for quantitative PCR were designed to target specific methanogen groups and used to assess the effect of a high-grain diet on methanogen species composition. Switching the ruminant diet from forage to high-grain resulted in reduced protozoal diversity, along with a profound overall reduction in the relative abundance of RCC and an increase in the relative abundance of free-living Methanobrevibacter spp. It was unclear whether the reduced abundance of RCC in grain-fed animals was due to the loss of symbiotic protozoa species or due to broader changes in the rumen environment that affected both RCC and protozoa. Importantly, results from this study emphasize the need to consider the different methanogen communities when developing strategies for mitigating methane emissions in ruminants. © 2012 Crown.",,"methyl coenzyme m reductase; oxidoreductase; RNA 16S; unclassified drug; article; cattle; comparative study; gene library; gene sequence; Methanobrevibacter; methanogen; Methanomicrobium; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protozoa associated methanogen; protozoon; sequence analysis; Thermoplasma; Animals; Biota; Cattle; Cluster Analysis; DNA, Archaeal; DNA, Ribosomal; Methane; Methanobrevibacter; Methanomicrobiaceae; Molecular Sequence Data; Oxidoreductases; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Rumen; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Animalia; Bos; Bovinae; Methanobrevibacter; Methanomicrobium; Protozoa; Thermoplasma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863696680

An inherent design feature of cap-and-trade schemes is that, once the cap on emissions has been set, no additional reductions beyond this level can be provided by the actions of those individuals, organizations and governments within the covered sectors. Thus, the emissions cap constitutes an emissions floor. This feature has been claimed by some to have undesirable implications, in that it discourages ethically motivated mitigation actions and preempts the possibility that local, state and national governments can take additional mitigation action in the context of weak national or regional targets. These criticisms have become prominent in Australia and the US within the public debate regarding the adoption of an emissions trading scheme (ETS). These criticisms and their potential solutions are reviewed. A set-aside reserve is proposed to automatically retire ETS permits, which would correspond to verified and additional emissions reductions. This minimizes the possibility that ethically motivated mitigation actions are discouraged, allows for additional action by other levels of government, while providing transparency to other market participants on the level of permit retirements. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","cap-and-trade; climate change; emissions caps; moral responsibility; policy interactions; public perception; public policies; voluntary action","climate change; emission control; emissions trading; greenhouse gas; local government; perception; social policy; state role; voluntary approach; Australia; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861563434

Time-series of carbon isotopes in one salmon stock, thought to feed in the Faroes/Iceland Basin area, show Subpolar Gyre (SPG) modal variability, which is not seen in fish feeding in the Norwegian Sea. At times of weak SPG circulation, when waters in the Iceland Basin are relatively warm, carbon isotope values are somewhat negative, suggesting possible changes in phytoplankton community structure. The fluctuations in plankton community dynamics suggested by the stable isotope values are coincident with fluctuations in the estimates of marine mortality in one sea-winter fish feeding in the Norwegian Sea, but not in those feeding in the Iceland Basin. Marine mortality in salmon feeding in the Iceland Basin is therefore likely to be more strongly influenced by factors other than bottomup control.

The meridionally oriented configuration of this circulation pattern favours the intrusion of warm air over the northeastern Mediterranean during one mode and over northwestern Europe during its opposite mode. We present a summer temperature reconstruction (1768-2008) for the southeastern node of this teleconnection pattern. This reconstruction is based on maximum latewood density (MXD) measurements of 23 Pinus heldreichii trees from a high-elevation stand in the Pirin Mountains in Bulgaria. The temperature signal in trees from high-elevation, summer-dry regions is stronger in MXD measurements compared with tree-ring width data and our reconstruction reflects well interannual- to decadal-scale summer temperature fluctuations in the Balkans as instrumentally recorded over the twentieth century. Fluctuations in our Bulgarian reconstruction correspond to summer temperature variability in the Balkans, Italy, and the southern Carpathians, but opposing temperature variability patterns are manifested over the British Isles and southern Scandinavia. The strong and consistent anti-phase relationship between our reconstruction and a reconstruction of the summer North Atlantic Oscillation (sNAO) suggests that the sNAO pattern is a main driver of the teleconnection between summer temperatures in southeastern versus northwestern Europe. This teleconnection is most pronounced on interannual timescales and has been stable over the last two centuries. © The Author(s) 2012.","Balkan; Bulgaria; climate reconstruction; climate response; dendroclimatology; east Atlantic pattern; eastern Mediterranean; maximum latewood density; North Atlantic Oscillation; Pinus heldreichii; teleconnection; tree-ring","climate change; dendrochronology; North Atlantic Oscillation; reconstruction; summer; teleconnection; temperature effect; timescale; tree ring; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (East); Europe; Mediterranean Sea; Mediterranean Sea (Northeast); Pinus heldreichii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860137187

This index is a function of the ratios between pollutant concentration values and their standards; it aims at identifying all situations in which there is a possible environmental risk even when several pollutants are below their limit values but air quality is reduced. AQBI is evaluated by using a high-resolution three-dimensional dispersion model: the air concentration for each substance is computed starting from detailed emissions sources: point, line and area emissions hourly modulated. This model is driven with accurate meteorological data from ground stations and remote sensing systems providing vertical profiles of temperature and wind; these data are integrated with wind and temperature profiles at higher altitudes obtained by a Local Area Model. The outputs of the dispersion model are compared with pollutant concentrations provided by measuring stations, in order to recalibrate emission data. A three-dimensional high resolution grid of AQBI data is evaluated for an industrial area close to Alessandria (Northern Italy), assessing air quality and environmental conditions. Performance of AQBI is compared with the Air Quality Index (AQI) developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. AQBI, computed taking into account all pollutants, is able to point out situations not evidenced by AQI, based on a preset limited number of substances; therefore, AQBI is a good tool for evaluating the air quality either in urban and in industrial areas. The AQBI values at ground level, in selected points, are in agreement with in situ observations. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","Air pollution; Air quality index; Environmental monitoring; Pollution dispersion model","Air concentrations; Air pollutants; Dispersion models; Emission data; Environmental conditions; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental risks; Ground level; Ground stations; High resolution; High-resolution grids; In-situ observations; Industrial area; Limit values; Measuring stations; Meteorological data; New indices; Northern Italy; Pollutant concentration; Pollution dispersion; Pollution level; Quality indices; Remote sensing system; Temperature profiles; Three-dimensional dispersion; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Vertical profile; Air pollution; Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Meteorology; Pollution; Remote sensing; Three dimensional; air quality; atmospheric pollution; environmental monitoring; ground-based measurement; index method; industrial district; modeling; remote sensing; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air pollution indicator; air quality; Air Quality Balance Index; Air Quality Index; analytic method; article; environmental impact assessment; environmental parameters; Italy; meteorological phenomena; pollution monitoring; temperature; wind; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Automobiles; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Industry; Italy; Models, Chemical; Vehicle Emissions; Alessandria; Italy; Piedmont [Italy]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864834141

The study demonstrates use of the formulation for six different policy scenarios and explores sensitivity of the results to ranges of certain technical parameters as found in existing literature. The study shows that details of the GHG emissions regulations have large impact on the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) of WTE and that GHG regulations can either increase or decrease the LCOE of WTE depending on policy choices regarding biogenic fractions from combusted waste and emissions from landfills. Important policy considerations are the fraction of the carbon emissions that are priced (i.e. all emissions versus only non-biogenic emissions), whether emissions credits are allowed due to reducing fugitive landfill gas emissions, whether biogenic carbon sequestration in landfills is credited against landfill emissions, and the effectiveness of the landfill gas recovery system where waste would otherwise have been buried. The default landfill gas recovery system effectiveness assumed by much of the industry yields GHG offsets that are very close to the direct non-biogenic GHG emissions from a WTE facility, meaning that small changes in the recovery effectiveness cause relatively larger changes in the emissions factor of the WTE facility. Finally, the economics of WTE are dependent on the MSW stream composition, with paper and wood being advantageous, metal and glass being disadvantageous, and plastics, food, and yard waste being either advantageous or disadvantageous depending upon the avoided tipping fee and the GHG emissions price. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Electricity; Energy economics; Energy policy; Greenhouse gas; LCOE; MSW; Waste-to-energy","Carbon emissions; Carbon sequestration; Economic characteristics; Emissions factors; Energy economics; GHG emission; Integrated method; Landfill gas emissions; Landfill gas recovery system; LCOE; MSW; Policy choices; Policy scenario; Technical factors; Waste to energy; Yard wastes; Biogas; Economics; Electricity; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Land fill; Municipal solid waste; Recovery; Greenhouse gases; glass; metal; plastic; analytical framework; biogenic emission; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; electricity; energy policy; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; landfill; municipal solid waste; article; carbon footprint; combustion; economics; energy cost; food; landfill; levelized cost of energy; municipal solid waste; paper; policy; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; solid waste management; United States; waste to energy facility; wood; Air Pollutants; Carbon; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Refuse Disposal; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861579271

In order to assess climate impacts concerning precipitation over Turkey, expected spatio-temporal changes are examined by considering precipitation time series at 165 stations across the country covering the period from 1961 to 2008 for almost 5 decades. Methodologically, homogeneity and Mann-Kendall rank correlation trend tests are applied at each station for the identification of statistically significant trends. Long-term annual precipitation averages indicate a decreasing trend with some oscillations during the last 5 decades. However, in more refined periods, average precipitation decreased during 1968-1973 and 1998-2008, whereas it increased during 1973-1981 and 1989-1998. As a result, there is a significant decrease of about 12, 13, and 35% at all stations in annual, rainy period, and winter season total precipitations, respectively.

It would be desirable if such bistable characteristics were available in robust solid state materials, such as diamond, which benefit from outstanding physical properties. A bistable current with reversible switching effect from surface transfer doped ultrananocrystalline diamond thin films measured by electron field emission is reported. This switching is manifested by the appearance of huge jumps in the current emission, up to four orders of magnitude, that occur at specific extracting electric field values. Persistent hysteresis is exhibited whenever the field is ramped down. It is proposed that these phenomena are the result of resonant-tunneling through a double barrier junction composed of tetrahedral amorphous carbon (ta-C)/nanodiamond/adsorbent/ vacuum. This finding may pave the way for the realization of novel types of memory switch devices with unprecedented performance. Copyright © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Peace and Populus euramericana cv. I-55, respectively. Stomata of cv. Peace barely respond to changes in photosynthetic photon flux density (PFD), whereas those of cv. I-55 show a normal response to variations in PFD at ambient CO 2. The plants were grown under three CO 2 regimes (380, 700, and 1,020 μmol CO 2 mol -1 in air) for approximately 2 months. CO 2 gas exchange was measured in situ in the three CO 2 regimes under a sudden PFD increase from 20 to 800 μmol m -2 s -1. In both genotypes, plants grown under higher CO 2 conditions had a higher photosynthetic induction state, shorter induction time, and reduced induction limitation to photosynthetic carbon gain. Plants of cv. I-55 showed a much larger increase in induction state and decrease in induction time under high CO 2 regimes than did plants of cv. Peace. These showed that, throughout the whole induction process, genotype cv. I-55 had a much smaller reduction of leaf carbon gain under the two high CO 2 regimes than under the ambient CO 2 regime, while the high CO 2 effect was smaller in genotype cv. Peace. The results suggest that a high CO 2 environment can reduce both biochemical and stomatal limitations of leaf carbon gain during the photosynthetic induction process, and that a rapid stomatal response can further enhance the high CO 2 effect. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Carbon gain; High CO 2; Induction state; Lightflecks; Stomatal conductance","carbon dioxide; deciduous tree; gas exchange; genotype; light effect; photon flux density; photosynthesis; physiological response; stomatal conductance; Populus; Populus koreana; Populus x canadensis; carbon; carbon dioxide; article; drug effect; genetics; light; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; plant stoma; Populus; species difference; time; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Light; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plant Stomata; Populus; Species Specificity; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864281076

This study describes levels and predictors of community attitudes towards alcohol, support for structural alterations to the drinking context, and intention to increase participation in community sports clubs. Design and Methods. Cross-sectional data were obtained from the VicHealth Community Attitudes Survey on Healthy Sporting Environments, administered to a random sample of Victorian adults. Descriptive and multivariate logistic regression analysis was undertaken. Results. Very high support for removing alcohol sponsorship of community sport and for a levy on alcohol advertising was found. The groups most supportive of breaking the nexus between alcohol and community sport were female, older-aged and non-English-speaking citizens and those not involved in sport clubs. If alcohol sales at community sports clubs were reduced, participation may increase among population groups currently identified as least engaged with community sport. Discussion and Conclusions. An optimal climate exists for policy reforms to make community sporting environments healthier by reducing the ties with alcohol. If implemented, these reforms may lead to an increase and diversification of participants in community sport. © 2011 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.","Alcohol drinking; Public opinion; Sports","adolescent; adult; aged; alcohol intoxication; article; attitude to health; Australia; cross-sectional study; drinking behavior; female; health behavior; health promotion; human; information processing; male; middle aged; psychological aspect; public opinion; social environment; sport; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alcohol Drinking; Alcoholic Intoxication; Attitude to Health; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data Collection; Female; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Public Opinion; Social Environment; Sports; Victoria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861863012

In metropolitans such as Hong Kong and other Asian cities, the surge of electricity consumption has been phenomenal over the past decades. This paper presents a historical review about electricity consumption, population, and change in economic structure in Hong Kong. It is hypothesized that the growth of electricity consumption and change in gross domestic product can be modeled by 4-parameter logistic functions. The accuracy of the functions was assessed by Pearson's correlation coefficient, mean absolute percent error, and root mean squared percent error. The paper also applies the life cycle approach to determine carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide emissions for the electricity consumption of Hong Kong.

As a large country with great disparities in economic development and industrial structure among its regions, it is essential to understand the carbon emission characteristics of regions and industrial sectors in order to formulate effective and targeted policies to achieve domestic carbon emission reduction targets. For this reason, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis in this article of the carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions structure and major responsible sectors for 19 provincial regions of mainland China. Great disparities in direct CO 2 emissions and intensities are identified across regions. We show that the direct CO 2 intensities in regions are affected by not only the economic development level, but also by the structure of the carbon-intensive sectors and sectoral CO 2 emissions intensities. A region-by-region fine-scale breakdown analysis demonstrates that both the direct CO 2 emissions and total CO 2 emissions are highly concentrated in a minority of sectors: the construction sector is the major contributor to the total CO 2 emissions in all regions, followed by the services sectors as a whole. Moreover, the petroleum and chemicals sector, nonmetallic mineral products sector, metal products sector and electricity and steam production sector should also receive more attention, as they are identified as ""highly carbon intensive"" in most of the regions studied, especially through the close linkage with the construction sector. Based on these results, we discuss and propose policy implications for controlling the rising CO 2 emissions in regions of mainland China. © 2012 by Yale University.","Contributing sector; Direct and indirect CO 2 emissions; Greenhouse gas emissions; Industrial ecology; Key sector; Regional analysis","Breakdown analysis; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emissions; Chemicals sectors; Comprehensive analysis; Construction sectors; Contributing sector; Economic development; Emissions intensity; Energy consumer; Industrial ecology; Industrial sector; Industrial structures; Key sector; Metal products; Nonmetallic minerals; Policy implications; Regional analysis; Regional disparities; Sectoral impacts; Services sectors; Steam production; Carbon; Construction industry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Regional planning; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; chemical industry; construction industry; economic development; electricity industry; emission control; energy use; greenhouse gas; industrial ecology; industrial structure; minerals industry; policy strategy; regional planning; service sector; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865311260

Here, we test if: (1) Archaea provide a food source sufficient to allow metazoan fauna to complete their life cycle; (2) neutral lipid biomarkers (including crocetane) can be used to identify Archaea consumers; and (3) archaeal aggregates are a dietary source for methane seep metazoans. In the laboratory, we demonstrated that a dorvilleid polychaete, Ophryotrocha labronica, can complete its life cycle on two strains of Euryarchaeota with the same growth rate as when fed bacterial and eukaryotic food. Archaea were therefore confirmed as a digestible and nutritious food source sufficient to sustain metazoan populations. Both strains of Euryarchaeota used as food sources had unique lipids that were not incorporated into O. labronica tissues. At methane seeps, sulfate-reducing bacteria that form aggregations and live syntrophically with anaerobic-methane oxidizing Archaea contain isotopically and structurally unique fatty acids (FAs). These biomarkers were incorporated into tissues of an endolithofaunal dorvilleid polychaete species from Costa Rica (mean bulk 13 C924; polar lipids 116) documenting consumption of archaeal-bacterial aggregates. FA composition of additional soft-sediment methane seep species from Oregon and California provided evidence that consumption of archaeal-bacterial aggregates is widespread at methane seeps.

Health consequences of climate change will occur through direct and indirect routes, and as a result of interactions with other environmental exposures. Heatwaves will become more common and are associated with higher mortality particularly in the elderly and those with pre-existing cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses. Warmer ambient temperatures will result in more dehydration episodes and increased risks of renal disease and, through effects on pollen seasons, there may be an increase in allergic disease such as asthma and hayfever. Other adverse effects including on air quality, food safety and security and an expanding distribution of some infectious diseases, including vector-borne diseases, are postulated. A related but separate environmental exposure is that of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Interactions between climate change and stratospheric ozone (and the causes of ozone depletion) will cause changes to levels of ambient UVR in the future and warmer temperatures are likely to change sun exposure behaviour. Co-occurring effects on aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems have potential consequences for food safety, quality and supply. Climate change-related exposures are likely to affect the incidence and distribution of diseases usually considered as caused by UVR exposure; and changes in UVR exposure will modulate the climate change effects on human health. For example, in some regions warmer temperatures due to climate change will encourage more outdoor behaviour, with likely consequences for increasing skin cancer incidence. Although many of the health outcomes of both climate change and the interaction of climate change and UVR exposure are somewhat speculative, there are risks to over- or under-estimations of health risks if synergistic and antagonistic effects of co-occurring environmental changes are not considered. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Adaptation; Air quality; Cataracts; Climate change; Food quality and safety; Heat; Human health; Infectious diseases; Mitigation; Skin cancer; Skin cancers; Ultraviolet radiation","air quality; asthma; cardiovascular disease; climate change; climate effect; disease incidence; disease prevalence; environmental change; environmental factor; food safety; food security; health risk; mortality risk; public health; respiratory disease; temperature effect; terrestrial ecosystem; ultraviolet radiation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863626025

In this study, an integrated assessment for solid waste treatment practices, especially household solid waste, was undertaken to evaluate the impact contribution of household solid waste treatment alternatives towards the sustainable development by using Life Cycle Inventory Assessment method. A case study has been investigated under various possible scenarios, such as (1) landfill without landfill gas recovery, (2) landfill with landfill gas recovery and flaring, (3) landfill with landfill gas recovery and electric generation, (4) composting, and (5) incineration. The evaluation utilized the Life Cycle Inventory Assessment method for multiple assessments based on various aspects, such as greenhouse gas emission/ reduction, energy generation/consumption, economic benefit, investment and operating cost, and land use burden. The results showed that incineration was the most efficient alternative for greenhouse gas emission reduction, economic benefit, energy recovery, and land use reduction, although it was identified as the most expensive for investment and operating cost, while composting scenario was also an efficient alternative with quite economic benefit, low investment and operating cost, and high reduction of land use, although it was identified as existing greenhouse gas emission and no energy generation. Furthermore, the aim of this study was also to establish localized assessment methods that waste management agencies, environmental engineers, and environmental policy decision makers can use to quantify and compare the contribution to the impacts from different waste treatment options. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","Greenhousegas(GHG)emission; Household solid waste; Life Cycle Inventory Assessment (LCIA); Scenario analysis; Waste treatment practice","Assessment methods; Economic benefits; Electric generation; Energy generations; Energy recovery; Environmental burdens; Environmental engineers; Environmental policy; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Household solid waste; Integrated assessment; Landfill gas; Life Cycle Inventory; Life cycle stages; Scenario analysis; Using life; Biogas; Decision making; Economics; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Incineration; Investments; Land fill; Land use; Life cycle; Municipal solid waste; Operating costs; Recovery; Waste disposal; Waste treatment; composting; domestic waste; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; incineration; life cycle analysis; solid waste; sustainable development; waste treatment; article; biodegradation; carbon footprint; composting; cost benefit analysis; decomposition; domestic waste; dumping; environmental sustainability; greenhouse effect; incineration; landfill; life cycle assessment; practice guideline; solid waste management; Viet Nam; air pollution; environmental monitoring; methodology; pollution; statistics; waste disposal; Air Pollution; Carbon Footprint; Environmental Monitoring; Refuse Disposal; Waste Products",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863759444

A quasi-experimental approach is used to examine whether 'not in my back yard' (NIMBY) sentiments can be anticipated at the initial stage when CO2 storage locations have been selected and communicated to the public. Furthermore, the psychological structure of initial reactions to CO2 storage plans is studied to ascertain the differences between people living in the direct vicinity of a proposed CO2 storage location (i.e. onsite residents) and people who do not (i.e. offsite residents). The results indicate that initial reactions to local CCS plans are not necessarily dominated by NIMBY sentiments. For onsite residents as well as offsite residents, trust in government affects their judgements of the risks and benefits associated with CCS, which in turn affects their inclination to protest against CCS plans. Onsite residents' inclination to protest is affected by their perceptions of local safety risks, but this is less of a concern for offsite residents.

Cluster analysis of 1971-2000 temperature and precipitation normals grouped weather stations according to similarities in seasonal patterns. Principal Components Analysis (PCAs) of 1895-2008 monthly data grouped stations by similarities in long-term variability. Finally, an analysis of snow data further subdivided the zones defined by the other two analyses. The climate zones produced by the cluster analysis and the PCAs were roughly similar to each other, but the differences were significant. The two sets of zones may be useful for different applications. For example, studies that analyze links between climate patterns and the demography of threatened species should focus on the results of the PCAs. The broad similarity among results produced by the different approaches supported the application of these zones in climate- related monitoring and analysis.

Another aim of this study was to identify the most common sources of fever in patients with FSs and to determine whether the occurrence of FSs correlates with the seasons of the year. METHODS: This is a retrospective study that included all patients diagnosed with simple or complex FSs who were seen in the emergency room or inpatient unit from January 2004 to December 2009. RESULTS: Of the 219 patients included in the study, 135 (61.4%) cases had the etiology of the FS diagnosed. Upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, urinary infection, and pneumonia were the most common diagnoses attributed to the fever. Leukocytosis was present in 48 (24%) of 219, and neutrophilia in 199 (91%) of 219 cases. Low bicarbonate levels were common among every age group. Only 1 blood culture was positive for Salmonella. The incidence of FS was higher during the winter (49.3% of the cases), and it closely paralleled the seasonal variation of viral infections. CONCLUSIONS: Even though laboratory tests, taking cultures, and imaging are performed in daily practice when approaching FSs, the association of FSs with serious infectious disease is rare and usually overestimated. The diagnostic approach should be individualized to each case and correlated with available data like that shown in this study. Parents should be educated with the knowledge that the occurrence of FSs tends to be higher in winter.

Activation of AhR mediates the expression of target genes (e.g., CYP1A1) by binding to dioxin response element (DRE) sequences in their promoter region. To understand the multiple mechanisms of AhR-mediated gene regulation, a microarray analysis on liver isolated from ligand-treated transgenic mice expressing a wild-type (WT) Ahr or a DRE-binding mutant Ahr (A78D) on an ahr-null background was performed. Results revealed that AhR DRE binding is not required for the suppression of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis. Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction performed on both mouse liver and primary human hepatocyte RNA demonstrated a coordinated repression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, namely, HMGCR, FDFT1, SQLE, and LSS after receptor activation. An additional transgenic mouse line was established expressing a liver-specific Ahr-A78D on a Cre Alb/Ahr flox/flox background. These mice displayed a similar repression of cholesterol biosynthetic genes, compared to Ahr flox/flox mice, further indicating that the observed modulation is AhR specific and occurs in a DRE-independent manner. Elevated hepatic transcriptional levels of the genes of interest were noted in congenic C57BL/6J-Ah d allele mice, when compared to the WT C57BL/6J mice, which carry the Ah b allele. Down-regulation of AhR nuclear translocator levels using short interfering RNA in a human cell line revealed no effect on the expression of cholesterol biosynthetic genes. Finally, cholesterol secretion was shown to be significantly decreased in human cells after AhR activation. Conclusion: These data firmly establish an endogenous role for AhR as a regulator of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway independent of its DRE-binding ability, and suggest that AhR may be a previously unrecognized therapeutic target. © 2012 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",,"aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; digoxin; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase; lanosterol synthase; small interfering RNA; squalene monooxygenase; squalene synthase; allele; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; cholesterol synthesis; controlled study; down regulation; gene control; gene expression; gene repression; human; human cell; liver; liver cell; microarray analysis; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA transport; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cholesterol; Dioxins; Gene Expression Regulation; Hepatocytes; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Response Elements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861539479

Spectral analysis of gamma-ray logs of four wells has shown consistent evidence of a short eccentricity orbital frequency (100 ka) influence on sedimentation. The spectral analysis points to a time span from 2.95 to 3 Ma (depending on the method employed) for the deposition of the interval studied in the most complete section (Well 1), and from 1.84 to 2.1 Ma in the least complete section (Well 4), owing to partial erosion. These figures are consistent with the palynological dating of the section (2 Ma), hence showing that cyclostratigraphy can play an important role in assigning a time span for high-frequency cycles (4th and 5th orders). Climatic factors not necessarily linked to eustasy, such as the alternation of dry (carbonate deposition) and mild humid (increased siliciclastic input) climate, are supposed to have controlled the cyclical stratigraphic arrangement. Accommodation as a result of diastrophism, loading and eustatic sea-level rise would not explain such a high mean accumulation rate (29.1 cm/ka) estimated through cyclostratigraphy. Therefore, based on these assumptions and seismic data, the high preservation potential, and resulting well-preserved cyclicity, is herein assigned to halokinesis. Several pieces of evidence obtained from the analysis of seismic data, core description, stratigraphic correlation, palaeontology and spectral data have shown the importance of halokinesis to increasing accommodation, and then the excellent preservation of the cyclical nature of the geological record. This is unusual in sedimentary environments subject to recurrent erosive events such as those related to shallow-marine settings. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Cyclostratigraphy; Halokinesis and sedimentation; Milankovitch cycles; Mixed siliciclastic-carbonate; Shallow-water deposits; Spectral analysis","Albian; carbonate; cyclicity; cyclostratigraphy; deposition; eccentricity; Milankovitch cycle; paleontology; palynology; sedimentation; seismic data; siliciclastic deposit; spectral analysis; Atlantic Ocean; Brazil; Espirito Santo Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857373543

Cellular uptake was monitored by intracellular enzyme-activated fluorescence, and localization of SWCNTs within cells was further confirmed by Raman mapping. In vivo photoacoustic, fluorescence, and positron emission tomography imaging of coated SWCNTs display high tumor targeting capability while providing long-term, fluorescence molecular imaging of targeted enzyme events.

FP are degraded to a large extent in the upper 60 m, and even among large, fast-sinking FP, only a fraction reaches sediment traps deeper than 200 m. Retention mechanisms for copepod FP are still not well understood. In order to investigate the relative importance of the small (<180 μm) compartment of the plankton community versus larger filter- feeding copepods for degradation of large, fast-sinking FP, we incubated FP produced by Calanus finmarchicus (Gunnerus) in 180 μm-filtered water from the chlorophyll a maximum. From a series of experiments, we found that the degradation of large FP is time-dependent, as no degradation was apparent after 20 or 48 h of incubation, but after 72 h FP volume was reduced by 32%. We also found that large filter-feeding copepods may facilitate the degradation process, since FP degradation increased from 0 to 75% after 48 h of incubation in the presence of 5 C. finmarchicus. We conclude that ciliates and dinoflagellates are able to degrade large copepod FP, but that this process is too slow to explain observed retention of large FP in the upper 200 m of the water column due to fast sinking of large particles. Rather than looking for single-factor explanations for flux-regulating processes, we stress the importance of investigating combined effects in relevant time frames to understand the complexity of carbon flux regulation in natural systems. © Inter-Research 2012.","Calanus finmarchicus; Carbon cycling; Faecal pellet; Faecal pellet fragmentation; Faecal pellet retention; Microbial degradation","biodegradation; carbon cycle; carbon flux; chlorophyll a; ciliate; complexity; crustacean; dinoflagellate; fecal pellet; filter feeder; microbial activity; microbial community; pristine environment; retention; sediment trap; water column; zooplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865425435

Previously we applied i-Tree Eco to the Torbay area of England; in this paper we use these results to assess the extent to which these benefits justify the costs of urban trees. We combined our benefits estimates with cost data to produce a single year ""snapshot"" comparison of costs and benefits for the urban forest. We then extended the discussion by modelling the lifetime benefits of four species of tree in the Torbay context. Two were assumed to be street trees: Lime (Tilia cordata) and cherry (Prunus avium). Two were assumed to be park trees: Maritime pine (Pinus nigra var maritima) and English oak (Quercus robur). We used this to produce an illustrative, partial, cost: benefit ratio for these trees. The central estimate of the ""snapshot"" comparison significantly exceeded costs and this remained the case when we sensitivity tested by halving the air-quality benefit to account for an uncertainty in the input data. The central cost-benefit ratios for the individual trees were cherry 1:0.01, lime 1:0.07, pine 1:0.12, and oak 1:0.21. We tested these results for sensitivity to the discount rate; reanalysing with a discount rate of 2.1% as opposed to the standard 3.5%. This produced the following results: Cherry 1:0.01, lime 1:0.76, pine 1:0.97, oak 1:4.96. These results suggest that, in common with other projects, cost-benefit analysis of investment in trees is very sensitive to the discount rate used, but that whilst carbon sequestration and air pollution removal may not justify tree planting by themselves, they do add to the justification. The significance of these benefits vary by tree, location and assumptions used, but larger and longer-lived trees appear to offer the greatest carbon sequestration and air-quality benefit, with the native oak performing particularly strongly. © 2012 Taylor & Francis and Arboricultural Association.","Air quality; Carbon sequestration; Cost-benefit; Urban trees","air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon sequestration; coniferous tree; cost-benefit analysis; deciduous tree; park design; pollution control; tree planting; urban forestry; urban pollution; England; Torbay; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877793850

Their stomatal aperture therefore affects photosynthesis, water use efficiency, and agricultural crop yields. Blue light, one of the environmental signals that regulates the plant stomatal aperture, is perceived by the blue/UV-A light-absorbing cryptochromes and phototropins. The signal transduction cascades that link the perception of light to the stomatal opening response are still largely unknown. Here, we report two new players, Hypersensitive to Red and Blue 1 (HRB1) and Protein Phosphatase 7 (PP7), and their genetic and biochemical interactions in the control of stomatal aperture. Mutations in either HRB1 or PP7 lead to the misregulation of the stomatal aperture and reduce water loss under blue light. Both HRB1 and PP7 are expressed in the guard cells in response to a light-to-dark or dark-to-light transition. HRB1 interacts with PP7 through its N-terminal ZZ-type zinc finger motif and requires a functional PP7 for its stomatal opening response. HRB1 is phosphorylated in vivo, and PP7 can dephosphorylate HRB1. HRB1 is mostly dephosphorylated in a protein complex of 193 kDa in the dark, and blue light increases complex size to 285 kDa. In the pp7 mutant, this size shift is impaired, and HRB1 is predominately phosphorylated. We propose that a modification of HRB1 by PP7 under blue light is essential to acquire a proper conformation or to bring in new components for the assembly of a functional HRB1 protein complex. Guard cells control stomatal opening in response to multiple environmental or biotic stimuli. This study may furnish strategies that allow plants to enjoy the advantages of both constitutive and ABA-induced protection under water-limiting conditions. © 2012 Sun et al.",,"hypersensitive to red and blue 1 protein; protein phosphatase 7; unclassified drug; vegetable protein; Arabidopsis protein; carbon dioxide; carrier protein; cryptochrome; HRB1 protein, Arabidopsis; phosphoprotein phosphatase; phototropin; PP7 protein, Arabidopsis; water; amino terminal sequence; Arabidopsis; article; blue light; complex formation; conformational transition; controlled study; far red light; gene expression regulation; guard cell; hypersensitive to red and blue 1 gene; in vivo study; light dark cycle; molecular weight; mutation rate; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; plant gene; plant stoma; protein assembly; protein dephosphorylation; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; protein phosphatase 7 gene; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; water loss; zinc finger motif; genetics; genotype environment interaction; light; metabolism; mutation; phosphorylation; photoperiodicity; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Carbon Dioxide; Carrier Proteins; Cryptochromes; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Gene-Environment Interaction; Light; Mutation; Phosphoprotein Phosphatases; Phosphorylation; Photoperiod; Photosynthesis; Phototropins; Plant Leaves; Plant Stomata; Signal Transduction; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863703129

Conventional prescriptive emissions controls or cap-and-trade programs consider all emissions similarly regardless of when they occur, despite the fact that contributions to ozone formation may vary. In contrast, a time-differentiated approach targets emissions reductions on forecasted high ozone days without imposition of additional costs on lower ozone days.

Results from a model of day-specific NOx pricing applied to the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) portion of the northeastern U.S. electrical grid demonstrate (i) that sufficient flexibility in electricity generation is available to allow power production to be switched from high to low NOx emitting facilities, (ii) that the emission price required to induce EGUs to change their strategies for power generation are competitive with other control costs, (iii) that dispatching strategies, which can change the spatial and temporal distribution of emissions, lead to ozone concentration reductions comparable to other control technologies, and (iv) that air quality forecasting is sufficiently accurate to allow EGUs to adapt their power generation strategies. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Additional costs; Air quality forecasting; Cap-and-trade program; Control costs; Control technologies; Electrical grids; Electricity generation; Emissions control; Emissions reduction; Generating unit; High-to-low; Ozone concentration; Ozone formation; Ozone management; Ozone precursors; Power production; Spatial and temporal distribution; Air quality; Cost reduction; Electric generators; Emission control; Ozone; Reduction; nitric oxide; ozone; air quality; concentration (composition); cost-benefit analysis; electricity generation; emission control; nitrogen oxides; numerical model; ozone; power plant; spatiotemporal analysis; accuracy; air pollution control; air quality control; article; controlled study; electric power plant; electricity; simulation; United States; Air Pollutants; Costs and Cost Analysis; Decision Making; Mid-Atlantic Region; Nitrates; Nitrites; Ozone; Policy; Power Plants; Seasons; Stochastic Processes; Time Factors; United States; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861133869

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are fundamental utilities in cities, playing an important role in preventing water pollution by lowering pollution load in waste waters. However, some of the emerging organic pollutants, like PFCs cannot be efficiently removed by traditional biological technologies in WWTPs, and some even increase in effluents compared to influents due to the incomplete degradation of precursors. Hence, WWTPs are considered to be a main point source in cities for PFCs that enter the aquatic environment. However, the mass flow of PFCs from WWTPs has seldom been analyzed for a whole city. Hence, in the present study, 11 PFCs including series of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs, C4-C12) and two perfluoroalkyl sulfonates (PFASs, C6 and C8) were measured in WWTP influents and effluents and sludge samples from six municipal WWTPs in Tianjin, China. Generation and dissipation of the target PFCs during wastewater treatment process and their mass flow in effluents were discussed. Results: All the target PFCs were detected in the six WWTPs, and the total PFC concentration in different WWTPs was highly influenced by the population density and commercial activities of the corresponding catchments. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was the predominant PFC in water phase, with concentrations ranging from 20 to 170 ng/L in influents and from 30 to 145 ng/L in effluents. Concentrations of perfluoroalkyl sulfonates decreased substantially in the effluent compared to the influent, which could be attributed to the sorption onto sludge, whereas concentrations of PFOA and some other PFCAs increased in the effluent in some WWTPs due to their weaker sorption onto solids and the incomplete degradation of precursors. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was the predominant PFC in sludge samples followed by PFOA, and their concentrations ranged from 42 to 169 g/kg and from 12 to 68 g/kg, respectively. Sludge-wastewater distribution coefficients (log Kd) ranged from 0. 62 to 3. 87 L/kg, increasing with carbon chain length of the homologues. The mass flow of some PFCs in the effluent was calculated, and the total mass flow from all the six municipal WWTPs in Tianjin was 26, 47, and 3. 5 kg/year for perfluorohexanoic acid, PFOA, and PFOS, respectively. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Distribution; Mass flow; Perfluorinated compounds; WWTPs","alkanesulfonic acid; carboxylic acid; fluorocarbon; octanoic acid derivative; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; bioaccumulation; dissipation; effluent; organic pollutant; persistence; point source; pollutant removal; population density; sludge; wastewater; water pollution; water treatment; article; China; city; sewage; water pollutant; water pollution; Alkanesulfonates; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Carboxylic Acids; China; Cities; Fluorocarbons; Octanoic Acids; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution; China; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863204302

We quantified the vulnerability to climate change of plant species based on exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity and assessed the effects of including these components in complementarity-based spatial conservation prioritisation. We modelled the vulnerability of 584 native plant species under three climate change scenarios in an 11.9 million hectare fragmented agricultural region in southern Australia. We represented exposure as species' geographical range under each climate change scenario as quantified using species distribution models. We calculated sensitivity as a function of the impact of climate change on species' geographical ranges. Using a dispersal kernel, we quantified adaptive capacity as species' ability to migrate to new geographical ranges under each climate change scenario. Using Zonation, we assessed the impact of individual components of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity) on spatial conservation priorities and levels of species representation in priority areas under each climate change scenario. The full vulnerability framework proved an effective basis for identifying spatial conservation priorities under climate change. Including different dimensions of vulnerability had significant implications for spatial conservation priorities. Incorporating adaptive capacity increased the level of representation of most species. However, prioritising sensitive species reduced the representation of other species. We conclude that whilst taking an integrated approach to mitigating species vulnerability to climate change can ensure sensitive species are well-represented in a conservation network, this can come at the cost of reduced representation of other species. Conservation planning decisions aimed at reducing species vulnerability to climate change need to be made in full cognisance of the sensitivity of spatial conservation priorities to individual components of vulnerability, and the trade-offs associated with focussing on sensitive species. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Complementarity; Conservation planning; Exposure; Niche modelling; Sensitivity; Triage; Zonation","climate change; conservation planning; modeling; niche; plant; spatial distribution; species conservation; zonation; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861870318

The collapse turns the stars into compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes with the ejection of cosmic rays and heavy elements.

This is because clarification of the supernova dynamics requires the full knowledge of nuclear and neutrino physics at extreme conditions, and large-scale numerical simulations of neutrino radiation hydrodynamics in multi-dimensions. This article is a brief overview of the understanding (with difficulty) of the supernova mechanism through the recent advance of numerical modeling at supercomputing facilities.

LCI data are evaluated for the two stages of cradle-to-gate performance: battery material production and component fabrication and assembly into purchase ready batteries. Using existing production data on battery constituent materials, overall battery material production values were calculated and contrasted with published values for the five battery technologies. The comparison reveals a more prevalent absence of material production data for lithium ion batteries, though such data are also missing or dated for a few important constituent materials in nickel metal hydride, nickel cadmium, and sodium sulfur batteries (mischmetal hydrides, cadmium, β-alumina). Despite the overall availability of material production data for lead acid batteries, updated results for lead and lead peroxide are also needed. On the other hand, LCI data for the commodity materials common to most batteries (steel, aluminum, plastics) are up to date and of high quality, though there is a need for comparable quality data for copper. Further, there is an almost total absence of published LCI data on recycled battery materials, an unfortunate state of affairs given the potential benefit of battery recycling. Although battery manufacturing processes have occasionally been well described, detailed quantitative information on energy and material flows are missing. For each battery, a comparison of battery material production with its manufacturing and assembly counterpart is discussed. Combustion and process emissions for battery production have also been included in our assessment. In cases where emissions were not reported in the original literature, we estimated them using fuels data if reported. Whether on a per kilogram or per watt-hour capacity basis, lead-acid batteries have the lowest cradle-to-gate production energy, and fewest carbon dioxide and criteria pollutant emissions.

Emergency risk communication messages were broadcast to reduce community exposure to air pollution caused by the fires. The objective of this investigation was to determine residents exposure to, understanding of, and compliance with these messages. From March to June 2008, the authors surveyed San Diego County residents using a 40-question instrument and random digit dialing. The 1,802 respondents sampled were predominantly 35-64 years old (65.9%), White (65.5%), and educated past high school (79.0%). Most (82.5%) lived more than 1 mile away from the fires, although many were exposed to smoky air for 5-7 days (60.7%) inside and outside their homes. Most persons surveyed reported hearing fire-related health messages (87.9%) and nearly all (97.9%) understood the messages they heard. Respondents complied with most to all of the nontechnical health messages, including staying inside the home (58.7%), avoiding outdoor exercise (88.4%), keeping windows and doors closed (75.8%), and wetting ash before cleanup (75.6%). In contrast, few (<5%) recalled hearing technical messages to place air conditioners on recirculate, use High-Efficiency Particulate Air filters, or use N-95 respirators during ash cleanup, and less than 10% of all respondents followed these specific recommendations. The authors found that nontechnical message recall, understanding, and compliance were high during the wildfires, and reported recall and compliance with technical messages were much lower. Future disaster health communication should further explore barriers to recall and compliance with technical recommendations. © 2012 Copyright.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; article; attitude to health; comprehension; emergency; environmental exposure; female; fire; health care quality; human; male; medical information; middle aged; recall; risk assessment; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; California; Comprehension; Emergencies; Environmental Exposure; Female; Fires; Health Communication; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Mental Recall; Middle Aged; Program Evaluation; Risk Assessment; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864037511

The economies found in Chinese cities are extremely resource and energy intensive; as a result, they produce significant levels of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This article provides comprehensive and detailed emissions inventories for Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin, which were found to be responsible for 12.8, 10.7, and 11.9 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per capita (t CO 2-eq/capita), respectively, in 2006. The majority of emissions were from electricity production, heating and industrial fuel use, and ground transportation. The prevalence of coal in the energy supply mix (including up to 98% in Tianjin) was a fundamental cause of high energy emissions. Non-energy emissions from industrial processes were also significant, including emissions from cement and steel production. The GHG inventories for Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin point to sectors requiring the most attention in terms of low-carbon growth. Compared to ten other global cities, Chinese cities are among the highest per capita emitters, alluding to the important challenge China faces of reducing emissions while improving the quality of life for urban residents. Accordingly, this article concludes with a discussion of the opportunities and issues concerning low-carbon growth in China, including the potential for renewable energy and the difficulties associated with emissions relocation and policy adoption. © 2012 by Yale University.","Carbon dioxide emissions; China; Emission reduction; Global cities; Industrial ecology; Urban greenhouse gas inventory","Carbon dioxide emissions; China; Emission reduction; Global cities; Greenhouse gas inventory; Industrial ecology; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Steelmaking; Greenhouse gases; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; construction industry; economic development; electricity generation; emission control; emission inventory; fuel consumption; global change; greenhouse gas; industrial ecology; iron and steel industry; policy making; quality of life; renewable resource; road transport; urban population; urbanization; world city; Beijing [China]; China; Shanghai; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865343803

The studied area, Shoufeng Township in Hualien County, is located in eastern Taiwan, where a large amount of manure waste is generated from pig farms that are scattered throughout the county. The objective of the study is to assess the possibility of establishing an integrated manure waste treatment plant by using the generated biogas incorporated with the PV system to produce renewable energy and then feed it back to the incorporated farms. A filed investigation, geographic information system (GIS) application, empirical equations development, and RETScreen modeling were conducted in the study. The results indicate that Shoufeng Township has the highest priority in setting up an integrated treatment and renewable energy plant by using GIS mapping within a 10-km radius of the transportation range. Two scenarios were plotted in assessing the renewable energy plant and the estimated electricity generation, plus the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction was evaluated. Under the current governmental green energy scheme and from a long-term perspective, the assessment shows great potential in establishing the plant, especially in reducing environmental pollution problems, waste treatment, and developing suitable renewable energy. The livestock industry is a major point source that creates an enormous environmental pollution problem; generally, traditional treatment of manure waste can only reduce a portion of the problem without a better solution. Establishing an integrated treatment plant can lead to the development of renewable energy by using the treated waste; moreover, modeling results indicated that incorporated with the photovoltaic application, the system can achieve a win-win solution for the environment and energy utilization. Under the current governmental green energy scheme and from a long-term perspective, the assessment shows great potential and provides a better policy for the Environmental Protection Administration, Taiwan, in solving the pollution issue. © Copyright 2012 A&WMA.",,"Agriculture; Biogas; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Fertilizers; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Mammals; Manures; Pollution; Population statistics; Rural areas; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Electricity generation; Environment and energies; Environmental pollution problem; Environmental protection administrations; Long-term perspective; Photovoltaic applications; Renewable energy plants; Waste treatment plant; Waste treatment; biogas; article; electricity; energy resource; geographic information system; green energy; greenhouse gas; manure; priority journal; rural area; waste management; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861932210

Although these substrates contain photoactive metal oxides, little is known about the role that they may play in catalyzing the heterogeneous phototransformation of semivolatile organic species. In the present study, we have investigated oxalic acid photochemistry at the surface of Fe2O3, TiO2, Mauritanian sand, and Icelandic volcanic ash in the presence and absence of oxygen using a photochemical Knudsen cell reactor. Illumination of all sample types resulted in the production of gas-phase CO2. In the case of Mauritanian sand, the production of gas-phase CO2 scaled with the loss of surface oxalic acid. In the absence of oxygen, the production of CO2 by the sand and ash films scaled with the absorption spectrum of iron oxalate, which suggests that the reaction is at least in part iron-mediated. The presence of oxygen suppressed CO2 production at the Fe2O3 surface, enhanced CO2 production at the Mauritanian sand surface, and did not have a net effect upon CO2 production at the Icelandic ash surface. These different oxygen dependencies imply that oxalic acid photochemistry at the authentic surfaces under study was not solely iron-mediated. Experiments at the TiO2 surface, which showed enhanced CO2 production from oxalic acid in the presence of oxygen, suggest that Ti-mediated photochemistry played an important role. In summary, these results provide evidence that solid-phase aerosol photochemistry may influence the atmospheric lifetime of oxalic acid in arid regions, where its removal via wet deposition is insignificant. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Atmospheric lifetime; Gasphase; Icelandics; Iron oxalate; Knudsen cell; Metal oxides; Net effect; Organic species; Oxalic Acid; Phototransformations; Solid-phase; TiO; Volcanic aerosols; Volcanic ash; Wet deposition; Absorption spectroscopy; Arid regions; Atmospheric aerosols; Chemical reactions; Organic acids; Oxygen; Sand; Titanium dioxide; Volcanoes; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; iron oxalate; iron oxide; oxalic acid; oxalic acid derivative; titanium dioxide; unclassified drug; aerosol; aerosol composition; carbon dioxide; catalysis; hematite; heterogeneity; iron; oxalic acid; oxygen; photochemistry; photodegradation; sand; substrate; titanium; volcanic ash; wet deposition; aerosol; article; atmosphere; chemical composition; chemical reaction; controlled study; gas; Iceland; illumination; Mauritania; photochemistry; photooxidation; reactor; sand; solid; volcanic ash; volcano; wet deposition; X ray fluorescence; Chromatography, Liquid; Iceland; Mauritania; Oxalic Acid; Photochemistry; Spectrometry, X-Ray Emission; Volcanic Eruptions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865527117

As low-level ethanol-gasoline blends have not consistently outperformed ethanol-free gasoline in vehicle performance or tailpipe emissions, national-level economic and environmental goals could be accomplished more efficiently by concentrating consumption of gasoline containing 10% ethanol (i.e., E10) near producers to minimize freight activity. As the domestic transportation of ethanol increased 10-fold in metric ton-kilometers (t-km) from 2000 to 2009, the portion of t-km potentially justified by the E10 blend wall increased from less than 40% to 80%. However, we estimate 10 billion t-km took place annually from 2004 to 2009 for reasons other than the blend wall.

To date, the effective compression ratio has most commonly been calculated from in-cylinder pressure data, requiring reliable in-cylinder pressure sensors. These sensors are generally not found on production engines, and thus a method is needed to determine effective compression ratio without in-cylinder pressure data. The work presented here outlines an estimation scheme that combines a high-gain observer with a physically-based volumetric efficiency model to estimate effective compression ratio using only information available from stock engine sensors, including manifold pressures and temperatures and air flows. The estimation scheme is compared to experimental engine data from a unique multi-cylinder diesel engine test bed with flexible intake valve actuation.

Energy efficiency is measured by the energy intensity of an economy showing how much energy (expressed in kilograms of oil equivalent, kgoe) is used for the production of one unit (1000 EUR) of GDP. There are huge differences between EU old and new member states. Though there are some trends of energy intensity convergence between EU member states however the achieved decrease in energy intensity is attributable mostly to a loss of energy-intensive industrial capacities in the transformation process. There is a crucial difference between whether the energy intensity of a given economy decreases as a result of downscaling energy-intensive activities or because of increased energy efficiency in activities that are maintained. It is important to make sure that this distinction is made within the policy framework which at present is not the case. The aim of the paper is to assess policies targeting energy intensity decrease in Lithuania in terms of efficiency, effectiveness and efficacy and to select the best policies able to increase energy efficiency in activities that are maintained. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

A simulation model of the growth and population dynamics of winter wheat and a competing weed, Sirius 2010, was calibrated and validated for the most economically damaging weed in UK cereals, Alopecurus myosuroides. The model was run using local-scale climatic scenarios generated by the LARS-WG weather generator and based on the HadCM3 projections for the periods 2046-2065 and 2080-2099 to predict the impact of climate change on the population dynamics of the weed and its effect on wheat yields. Owing to rising CO 2 concentration and its effect on radiation use efficiency of wheat, weed-free wheat yields were predicted to increase. The distribution of the weed was predicted to remain broadly similar with a possible northward shift in range. Local-scale variation in the impact of climate change was apparent owing to variation in soil type and water holding capacity. The competitive balance was shifted in favour of the deeper rooted crop under climate change, particularly on sites with lighter soils, owing to more frequent and severe drought stress events. Although the damage niche of A. myosuroides was predicted to reduce under climate change, it is likely that weeds with contrasting physiology, such as C4 species, will be better adapted to future conditions and pose a more serious threat. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Alopecurus myosuroides; Drought stress; Resource competition; Sirius 2010; Winter wheat","annual plant; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; concentration (composition); crop yield; drought stress; environmental conditions; grass; interspecific competition; light use efficiency; modeling; niche; population dynamics; weed; wheat; Alopecurus myosuroides; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860663841

Depending on meteorological conditions, fire emissions can efficiently reduce air quality and visibility, even far away from emission sources. In 2005, an arson forest fire burned nearly 700 ha near Lançon-de-Provence, southeast France. This paper explores the impact of this Mediterranean fire on the atmospheric dynamics and chemistry downwind of the burning region. The fire smoke plume was observed by the MODIS-AQUA instrument several kilometres downwind of the burning area out of the Mediterranean coast. Signatures of the fire plume on air pollutants were measured at surface stations in southeastern France by the air quality network AtmoPACA. Ground-based measurements revealed unusually high concentrations of aerosols and a well marked depletion of ozone concentrations on the day of the fire. The Lançon-de-Provence fire propagation was successfully simulated by the semi-physical fire spread model ForeFire. ForeFire provided the burnt area at high temporal and spatial resolutions. The burnt areas were scaled to compute the fire heat and water vapour fluxes in the three-dimensional meso-scale non-hydrostatic meteorological model MesoNH. The simulated fire plume kept confined in the boundary layer with high values of turbulent kinetic energy. The plume was advected several kilometres downwind of the ignition area by the Mistral winds in accordance with the MODIS and AtmoPACA observations. The vertical plume development was found to be more sensitive to the sensible heat flux than to the fire released moisture. The burnt area information is also used to compute emissions of a fire aerosol-like tracer and gaseous pollutants, using emission factors for Mediterranean vegetation. The coupled model simulated high concentrations of the fire aerosol-like tracer downwind of the burning zone at the right timing compared to ground-based measurements. A chemical reaction mechanism was coupled on-line to the MesoNH model to account for gaseous chemistry evolution in the fire plume. High levels of ozone precursors (NO x, CO) were simulated in the smoke plume which led to the depletion of ozone levels above and downwind of the burning zone. This depletion of ozone was indeed observed at ground-based stations but with a higher impact than simulated. The difference may be explained by the simplified design of the model with no anthropogenic sources and no interaction of the smoke aerosols with the photolysis rates. Ozone production was modelled tens of kilometres downwind of the ignition zone out of the coast. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Fire spread; Injection height; Mediterranean region; Off-line coupled model; Smoke plume pollutants","Air pollutants; Air quality networks; Anthropogenic sources; Atmospheric dynamics; Burnt areas; Coupled models; Dynamic interaction; Emission factors; Emission sources; Fire emissions; Fire plume; Fire propagation; Fire smoke; Fire spread; Fire spread model; Forest fires; Gaseous pollutants; Ground based measurement; Ground-based stations; High concentration; Mediterranean region; Mediterranean vegetation; Mesoscale; Meteorological condition; Meteorological models; MODIS-Aqua; Ozone concentration; Ozone levels; Ozone precursors; Ozone production; Photolysis rates; Reaction mechanism; Regional scale; Sensible heat flux; Simulated fire; Smoke aerosols; Smoke plume; Smoke plume pollutants; Spatial resolution; Surface station; Trace-gases; Turbulent kinetic energy; Water vapour; Air quality; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospherics; Deforestation; Fog; Heat flux; Ozone; Radiometers; Thermal plumes; Three dimensional; Fires; ozone; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric plume; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); forest fire; kinetic energy; measurement method; meteorology; MODIS; moisture; numerical model; oxide; photolysis; pollutant source; smoke; spatial resolution; three-dimensional modeling; turbulence; visibility; wildfire; aerosol; air pollution; air quality; article; atmosphere; chemical interaction; chemical reaction; dynamics; exhaust gas; fire; fogo selvagem; kinetics; photolysis; plume; priority journal; smoke; water vapor; Aerosols; Air Quality; Deforestation; Fogging; Forest Fires; Impurities; Mathematical Models; Mediterranean; Plumes; Three Dimensional Design; France; Mediterranean Coast [France]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857785348

Land conversion for agricultural and urban uses has already imperiled many animal species in the state. This study investigated the potential impacts on wildlife of shifts in agricultural activity to increase biomass production for transportation fuels. We applied knowledge of the suitability of California's agricultural landscapes for wildlife species to evaluate wildlife effects associated with plausible scenarios of expanded production of three potential biofuel crops (sugar beets, bermudagrass, and canola). We also generated alternative, spatially explicit scenarios that minimized loss of habitat for the same level of biofuel production. We explored trade-offs to compare the marginal changes per unit of energy for transportation costs, wildlife, land and water-use, and total energy produced, and found that all five factors were influenced by crop choice. Sugar beet scenarios require the least land area: 3.5 times less land per liter of gasoline equivalent than bermudagrass and five times less than canola. Canola scenarios had the largest impacts on wildlife but the greatest reduction in water use. Bermudagrass scenarios resulted in a slight overall improvement for wildlife over the current situation. Relatively minor redistribution of lands converted to biofuel crops could produce the same energy yield with much less impact on wildlife and very small increases in transportation costs. This framework provides a means to systematically evaluate potential wildlife impacts of alternative production scenarios and could be a useful complement to other frameworks that assess impacts on ecosystem services and greenhouse gas emissions. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Agroecosystems; Biofuels; Biomass feedstock; California wildlife habitat relationships system; Geographic information systems; Habitat suitability; Marxan; Renewable energy; Trade-offs; Water demand","Agriculture; Animals; Commerce; Crops; Cultivation; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Sugar beets; Transportation; Agro-ecosystems; Biomass feedstock; Habitat suitability; Marxan; Renewable energies; Trade off; Water demand; Wildlife habitat relationship; Biofuels; Animalia; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Brassica napus; Brassica napus var. napus; Cynodon (angiosperm)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866539106

It poses increasing risk in the future from both direct anthropogenic sources and potential rapid release from the Arctic. A range of mitigation (emissions control) technologies have been developed for anthropogenic sources that can be developed for further application, including to Arctic sources. Significant gaps in understanding remain of the mechanisms, magnitude, and likelihood of rapid methane release from the Arctic. Methane may be released by several pathways, including lakes, wetlands, and oceans, and may be either uniform over large areas or concentrated in patches. Across Arctic sources, bubbles originating in the sediment are the most important mechanism for methane to reach the atmosphere. Most known technologies operate on confined gas streams of 0.1% methane or more, and may be applicable to limited Arctic sources where methane is concentrated in pockets. However, some mitigation strategies developed for rice paddies and agricultural soils are promising for Arctic wetlands and thawing permafrost. Other mitigation strategies specific to the Arctic have been proposed but have yet to be studied. Overall, we identify four avenues of research and development that can serve the dual purposes of addressing current methane sources and potential Arctic sources: (1) methane release detection and quantification, (2) mitigation units for small and remote methane streams, (3) mitigation methods for dilute (<1000 ppm) methane streams, and (4) understanding methanotroph and methanogen ecology.

This paper develops a case study of the shale gas industry in British Columbia (BC), Canada to evaluate this assumption. We find that the transition fuel argument for gas development in BC is unsubstantiated by the best available evidence. Emissions factors for shale gas and LNG remain poorly characterized and contested in the academic literature, and context-specific factors have significant impacts on the lifecycle emissions of shale gas but have not been evaluated. Moreover, while the province has attempted to frame natural gas development within its ambitious climate change policy, this framing misrepresents substantive policy on gas production. The ""transition fuel"" and ""climate solution"" labels applied to development by the BC provincial government risk legitimizing carbon-intensive gas development. We argue that policy makers in BC and beyond should abandon the ""transition fuel"" characterization of natural gas. Instead, decision making about natural gas development should proceed through transparent engagement with the best available evidence to ensure that natural gas lives up to its best potential in supporting a transition to a low-carbon energy system. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Liquefied natural gas; Shale gas; Transition fuel","Academic literature; British Columbia; Climate change policies; Emissions factors; Gas development; Gas productions; Life cycle emissions; Low-carbon energy systems; Policy makers; Shale gas; Significant impacts; Transition fuel; Carbon; Climate change; Decision making; Fuels; Gas industry; Liquefied natural gas; Shale; Gases; energy policy; gas production; liquefied natural gas; resource development; shale; British Columbia; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861225443

Global efforts to reach a consensus regarding the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions have so far been focused on developing Climate-Friendly Technologies (CFTs). The problem is that in order for these efforts to have an actual impact at a global level we need to be concerned with more than just promotion and info-dissemination on the already existing CFTs, but also with costs, implementation and the international intellectual property and trade system necessary for this strategy to work. Currently, almost 80% of all patent applications belong to OECD countries like Japan, US, Germany, South Korea, Great Britain and France. The obligations climate change imposes on developing countries represent a technological shift that depends on Technology Transfer (TT) and implementation of IP laws. The current IP framework, especially patent law, copyright and trade secrets produces another kind of obligations. The main question is if the conjunction of these two sets of obligations (rules) is fair from a global justice point of view. Also, it is questionable whether this conjunction helps developing countries to produce their own CFTs. When discussing the demands of global justice one cannot skip the very important distinction Pogge makes between negative and positive obligations. In the context of global warming and the measures that the world's states ought to take to prevent it, there seems to lie another conjunction between the positive obligation of preserving the natural environment that we all share and a negative obligation of allowing the less developed countries to help us all do so. Because one cannot impose regulations that cannot be put into practice, it is more and more obvious that a new framework of action and development needs to be drawn in the field of TT of CFTs. © 2012 by Public Reason.","Climate change; Climate-friendly technologies; Global justice; Institutions; Intellectual property; Patents; Public good",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877329533

Thus, a 15-yr soil fertility management experiment was conducted in the semi-arid tropical region of central India to evaluate the impact of crop residue C input on soybean (Glycine max L.)-safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) cropping sequence and SOC sequestration in soils of Vertisolic order (Vertisols). Retention of crop residues of soybean/safflower, and application of farmyard manure (FYM) at 6 Mg (t) ha-1 alone or in combination with 20 kg N and 13 kg P ha-1 supplied through chemical fertilizers or comparatively higher dose of chemical fertilizer (60 kg N and 35 kg P ha-1) either maintained or increased the SOC stock. However, the combination of FYM and chemical fertilizer increased the profile SOC stock (69.9 Mg ha-1), overall SOC build up (37.1%) and also sequestered high amount of SOC (11.9 Mg C ha-1 or 0.79 Mg C ha-1 yr-1) compared with control and chemical fertilizer alone. Higher grain yield (2.10 and 1.49 Mg ha-1 of soybean and safflower, respectively) was obtained through the application of FYM at 6 Mg ha-1+N20P13. For every Mg C ha-1 increase in the root zone, there was 0.145 and 0.059 Mg ha-1 increase in grain yield of soybean and safflower, respectively. Stabilization of the SOC stock requires a minimum input of 3.47 Mg C ha-1 yr-1. Application of 40 kg N+26 kg P ha-1 through chemical fertilizer also maintained the SOC stock at the antecedent level based on the SOC stocks in 1992. Therefore, the combined use of organic manure (crop residues and FYM) along with chemical fertilizer is essential to enhancing the SOC sequestration in a soybean-safflower sequence under rainfed conditions on Vertisols in central India.","Critical carbon inputs; Crop residue; Farmyard manure; Semiarid tropics; Sustainable yield index","agricultural production; agricultural soil; agronomy; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; crop residue; crop yield; herb; manure; organic carbon; rainfed agriculture; rhizosphere; semiarid region; soil fertility; soil management; soil organic matter; soil quality; soybean; sustainability; Vertisol; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865321788

Transgenic plants expressing higher levels of FT flowered and produced fruits in the greenhouse within 1 to 10 months. FT plums did not enter dormancy after cold or short day treatments yet field planted FT plums remained winter hardy down to at least -10°C. The plants also displayed pleiotropic phenotypes atypical for plum including shrub-type growth habit and panicle flower architecture. The flowering and fruiting phenotype was found to be continuous in the greenhouse but limited to spring and fall in the field. The pattern of flowering in the field correlated with lower daily temperatures. This apparent temperature effect was subsequently confirmed in growth chamber studies. The pleitropic phenotypes associated with FT1 expression in plum suggests a fundamental role of this gene in plant growth and development. This study demonstrates the potential for a single transgene event to markedly affect the vegetative and reproductive growth and development of an economically important temperate woody perennial crop.

This paper shows the results of a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from cultivation of sunflower for biodiesel production in Tuscany, Italy. In the five case studies, the GHG emissions of sunflower cultivation exceed the default value (18 g [CO2eq] MJ-1) indicated by the RED. This is mainly due to diesel consumption and emissions from nitrogen fertilisers that are on average 180% and 255% higher than the reference values, respectively. GHG emissions allocation among sunflower biodiesel and co-products was made according to energy content principle. Only the biodiesel from sunflower cultivated in the two most efficient farms achieved a GHG saving with respect to conventional diesel (36%) that made it possible to fulfil the RED's requirements. From these results, it seems that the observance of such requirements on GHG emissions for sunflower biodiesel cultivation phase in Tuscany will not be easy to satisfy without a significant revision of local farm practices, aimed primarily at reducing the use of nitrogen fertilisers and diesel consumption. In fact, the GHG emissions reported in the RED for sunflower cultivation were calculated using excessively low farm inputs compared with the typical amounts for sunflower cultivation practices in Tuscany. © 2012 IAgrE.",,"Artificial life; Biodiesel; Climate change; Diesel engines; Gas emissions; Life cycle; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fertilizers; Sustainable development; Biodiesel production; Climate change assessment; Default values; Diesel consumption; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Reference values; Renewable energies; Tuscany , Italy; Greenhouse gases; Helianthus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859441675

Oxygen and carbon isotopes, planktic foraminifera and calcareous nannofossil distributions suggest that Dansgaard-Oeschger (D/O) and Heinrich events (HE) are distinctly expressed in the Mediterranean climate record. Moreover, recurrent though subdued oscillations not previously identified in the Lateglacial Mediterranean sediments document a significant centennial-scale climate variability in the basin that is greater than previously thought. Alternations between climate regimes dominated by polar outbreaks during D/O stadials and warm D/O interstadials, with associated intensification of continental runoff, are well expressed in the ODP Site 963. These place the Mediterranean basin as an often overlooked recorder of the interplay between large- and regional- scale climate controls at intermediate latitudes, and of the possible interactions between different components of the climate system. Significant changes in Ba/Ca values measured in Globigerinoides ruber shells from a number of D/O stadials and interstadials suggest enhanced freshwater input from the north-eastern Mediterranean borderland during the D/O interstadials. However, the short duration of 3D stratification events never led to complete oxygen consumption along the water column, but clear effects of sluggish 3D circulation in the basin are testified to by negative excursions in δ 13C measured in selected species of planktic and benthic foraminifera. HEs are constantly associated with lightening in the δ 18O record of planktic foraminifera, possibly because of the impact of iceberg melting in the Iberian Margin on Mediterranean thermohaline circulation. Interestingly, in two cases in particular, HE2 and HE5, fresher water inputs also affected deeper horizons of intermediate waters, suggesting a basin-wide impact. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Ba/Ca ratios; Calcareous plankton; Central-eastern Mediterranean; D-O events; Heinrich events; Stable isotopes","Calcareous plankton; Central-eastern Mediterranean; D-O events; Heinrich Events; Stable isotopes; Climatology; Geochemistry; Glacial geology; Sea ice; Sedimentology; Stratigraphy; Three dimensional; Isotopes; barium; calcium; climate variation; freshwater input; ice core; iceberg; interstadial; micropaleontology; nanofossil; Ocean Drilling Program; oxygen consumption; oxygen isotope; paleoceanography; paleoclimate; paleotemperature; planktonic foraminifera; Quaternary; sediment analysis; stable isotope; temperature gradient; thermohaline circulation; trace element; water column; Arctic; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Mediterranean Sea; Foraminifera; Globigerinoides ruber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861898646

Mountain regions are expected to be particularly at risk in a warming climate, and in many upland regions land use has also changed dramatically over the past few decades, with densities of grazing livestock often decreasing. Does livestock grazing influence elevational shifts of plant communities? Location: Southern Scandes, Norway. Methods: We use a unique long-term experimental study at the landscape scale along an altitudinal gradient to study elevational shifts of plant communities and species under high and low sheep densities and in ungrazed conditions. Results: We show that elevational advance of the whole alpine grassland plant community occurred in the absence of herbivores (with a 3 m elevational advance over 8 yr), but was suppressed at low sheep density. At high sheep density there was a downward shift in plant community composition of 4 m. The average change in median altitude across species was positive in the absence of herbivores, but not significantly different from zero under both grazing treatments. There was no convincing evidence that species from lower altitudes showed a greater elevational advance than species from higher altitudes. Conclusions: This study presents evidence that grazing sheep suppressed an elevational advance of the plant community, suggesting that grazing can limit the altitude of the plant community. This implies that grazing management has the potential to buffer climate-driven shifts in plant communities. Conversely, the widespread recent changes in land use, with reductions in large herbivore densities in alpine areas, could further increase the vulnerability of alpine communities to warming. © 2012 International Association for Vegetation Science.","Climate change; Distribution; Grazing; Land use; Livestock; Mountain; Norway; Sheep; Warming","alpine environment; global warming; grazing; herbivory; mountain region; plant community; plant-herbivore interaction; population density; risk factor; sheep; vulnerability; Norway; Scandes Mountains; Ovis aries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863520626

We argue that resilient adaptation infrastructures can recover quickly from climate disruptions, resilient organizations can cope with new stresses and changes and still function, resilient communities have assets such as education or wealth that enable them to survive or even thrive in the face of climate-related challenges. Ongoing adaptation efforts in Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, and the Maldives are examples of projects that simultaneously attempt to enhance all three dimensions of adaptation. Data for these cases comes primarily from a review of country National Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPAs) supplemented with research interviews and site visits. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptation; Adaptive capacity; Asia; Least developed countries; Resilience","adaptation; article; Asia; Bangladesh; Bhutan; Cambodia; climate change; community; construction work and architectural phenomena; developing country; educational status; electricity; government; irrigation (agriculture); Maldives; organization; policy; priority journal; social adaptation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861831217

It begins by providing background information on rural energy use, environmental legislation, forestry, agriculture and the country's network of protected areas. It notes, for example, that the country's protected areas face environmental degradation caused by poverty, corruption, the expansion of agricultural land and population growth. It goes on to argue that planners in Myanmar can, however, utilize a variety of mechanisms to overcome these challenges. Policy-makers can enhance community involvement in protected areas and management schemes through ownership and engagement. They could integrate conservation efforts with income generation, provide education and awareness campaigns for those living near wildlife areas and expand the number and size of protected areas. They could, furthermore, increase penalties against illegal activities within protected areas, offer accelerated staff training and education programmes and similarly consolidate regulatory authority for environmental conservation. Even those outside of Myanmar can prevent environmental destruction. International planners could implement ecosystem payments schemes, involve Myanmar more concretely in the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) process, an international agreement launched in 2012, and expand Myanmar's participation in the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. Lastly, they could advocate international bans on exports of illegal products and strengthen capacity building efforts in the areas of forestry, land use and agriculture. © 2012 ISEAS.","Biodiversity; Deforestation; Environmental degradation; Myanmar",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870314346

In this study, we developed an inventory to estimate emissions, reductions, and projections of BC from on-road vehicles. Total emissions of on-road vehicles were 15.0 Gg in 1990 and 64.0 Gg in 2009. Diesel vehicles were the biggest contributor, emitting 83%-95% of total emissions. Results of provincial-level analysis showed that Guangdong, Shandong, and Hebei had higher emissions than other provinces. Emission standards introduced by the government to reduce particulate matter (PM) resulted in decreased BC emissions. Total reductions were up to 375.8 Gg in the period of 1999-2009, equivalent to 270 Tg CO 2 (100-year). Projections show that emissions continue to decline from 2010 but start to increase from 2015 under a BAU scenario. If EURO V/VI emission standards are implemented, emissions will decline steadily until 2025.

DSPECs are based on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) but with photoexcitation driving physically separated solar fuel half reactions. A systematic basis for DSPECs is available based on a modular approach with light absorption/excited-state electron injection, and catalyst activation assembled in integrated structures. Progress has been made on catalysts for water oxidation and CO2 reduction, dynamics of electron injection, back electron transfer, and photostability under conditions appropriate for water splitting. With added reductive scavengers, as surrogates for water oxidation, DSPECs have been investigated for hydrogen generation based on transient absorption and photocurrent measurements.

Here, we show that Car1 mRNA decreases significantly when erythroid differentiation is induced in MEL cells. The Ldb1 protein complex including GATA1/SCL/LMO2 binds to the Car1 promoter in uninduced cells and reduced enrichment of the complex during differentiation correlates with loss of Car1 expression. Knockdown of Ldb1 results in a reduction of Ser2 phosphorylated RNA Pol II and Cdk9 at the Car1 promoter region, suggesting that Ldb1 is required for recruitment of Pol II as well as the transcription regulator P-TEFb to enhance elongation of Car1 transcripts.

We conducted a field experiment to assess the potential impacts of predicted climate change on the growth and health of four common non-vascular epiphytes at three elevations in a subtropical montane moist evergreen broad-leaved forest in southwest China. Even slight changes in climate resulted in remarkably reduced rates of growth and detrimental effects on the health of the transplanted epiphyte species over 2. years. Non-vascular epiphytes in this forest type respond much more rapidly to changes in water availability than terrestrial trees. The non-vascular lichen, Nephromopsis pallescens, is highly sensitive to changes in moisture and temperature, and could be adopted as a climate change indicator. Non-vascular epiphyte species may be negatively affected or even severely damaged in the future in subtropical montane forests, as climate conditions are predicted to be warmer and drier. This experiment confirms previous model projections and implies that conservation efforts to maintain the stability and resiliency of montane forest ecosystem to climate change should include epiphyte communities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Bryophyte; Climate change; Drought; Evergreen broad-leaved forest; Global warming; Indicator; Lichen","adaptation; bryophyte; canopy; community structure; drought stress; epiphyte; evergreen forest; global warming; moisture; numerical model; physiological response; subtropical region; water availability; China; Bryophyta; bryophytes; Nephromopsis pallescens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862671065

Plant macrofossils and stem encrustations, derived mainly from the species of P. pectinatus, M. spicatum and Chara spp., were identified, and they dominated the aquatic plant community of the lake. Alternations of plant macrofossils of Chara spp. and the vascular species reflect the changing productivity of the lake over time. In such a shallow lake, the carbonate content is highly related to photosynthesis of aquatic macrophytes and thus indirectly indicates variations in productivity, consistent with a quantitative estimate of palaeoproductivity. Based on these results, the palaeoproductivity history was reconstructed over the past ca. 16 ka. The lake was formed or recharged at 15.3 cal ka BP, as indicated by aeolian sand deposits at the core base. A marked increase in palaeoproductivity occurred from 15.3 to 11.6 cal ka BP. Between 11.6 and 9.2 cal ka BP, a sharply increased water-level, modulated probably by the enhanced Asian summer monsoon, might have exceeded the optimum water depth for macrophyte vegetation, causing a marked decline in coverage of aquatic macrophytes and low palaeoproductivity. The palaeoproductivity appeared to be high in the early stage of the period from 9.2 to 7.4 cal ka BP, and then decreased at approximately 8.6 cal ka BP. The palaeoproductivity sustained an overall high level between 7.4 and 2.1 cal ka BP, and decreased gradually since 2.1 cal ka BP. Our results suggest that the variability of Genggahai Lake palaeoproductivity may be associated with fluctuations of the lake level controlled by the strength of the Asian summer monsoon, probably indicating changes in the Asian summer monsoon. © 2012 The Author(s).","Asian summer monsoon; lake sediments; palaeoproductivity; plant macrofossils; Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau","Chara; Pectinatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863425259

There are few effective interventions to prevent this relapse and none used routinely in clinical practice. A previous exploratory meta-analysis suggested that self-help booklets may be effective but requires confirmation. This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a set of self-help educational materials to prevent smoking relapse in the National Health Service (NHS) Stop Smoking Service.Methods/design: This is an open, randomized controlled trial. The target population is carbon monoxide (CO) verified quitters at four weeks in the NHS stop smoking clinic (total sample size N = 1,400). The experimental intervention tested is a set of eight revised Forever Free booklets, including an introduction booklet and more extensive information on all important issues for relapse prevention. The control intervention is a leaflet that has no evidence to suggest it is effective but is currently given to some patients using NHS stop smoking services.Two follow-up telephone interviews will be conducted at three and 12 months after the quit date. The primary outcome will be prolonged abstinence from months four to 12 with no more than five lapses, confirmed by a CO test at the 12-month assessment. The secondary outcomes will be seven-day self-report point prevalence abstinence at three months and seven-day biochemically confirmed point prevalence abstinence at 12 months.

Three canonical subtypes of C 4 exist, named after their main decarboxylating enzymes: NAD-dependent malic enzyme type, NADP-dependent malic enzyme type and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase type. Cleome gynandra is known to perform NAD-ME type C 4 photosynthesis. To further assess the mode of C 4 in C. gynandra and its manifestation in leaves of different age, total enzyme activities of eight C 4-related enzymes and the relative abundance of 31 metabolites were measured. C. spinosa was used as a C 3 control. C. gynandra was confirmed as an NAD-ME type C 4 plant in mid-aged leaves, whereas a mixed NAD-ME and PEPCK type was observed in older leaves. Young leaves showed a C 3-C 4 intermediate state with respect to enzyme activities and metabolite abundances. Comparative transcriptome analysis of mid-aged leaves of C. gynandra and C. spinosa showed that the transcript of only one aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) isoform is highly abundant in C. gynandra. However, the canonical model of the NAD-ME pathway requires two AspATs, a mitochondrial and a cytosolic isoform. Surprisingly, our results indicate the existence of only one highly abundant AspAT isoform. Using GFP-fusion, this isozyme was localised exclusively to mitochondria. We propose a revised model of NAD-ME type C 4 photosynthesis in C. gynandra, in which both AspAT catalysed reactions take place in mitochondria and PEPCK catalyses an alternative decarboxylating pathway. © 2012 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Aspartate aminotransferase; C 4 photosynthesis; Cleome; NAD-dependent malic enzyme","aspartate aminotransferase; isoenzyme; malate dehydrogenase; malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate decarboxylating) (NAD+); malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate decarboxylating) (NADP+); malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating) (NADP+); malate dehydrogenase-(oxaloacetate-decarboxylating) (NAD+); phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; age class; biochemical composition; C4 plant; catalysis; decarboxylation; dicotyledon; enzyme activity; gene expression; leaf; metabolite; numerical model; photosynthesis; phytochemistry; article; Cleome; decarboxylation; enzymology; metabolism; mitochondrion; photosynthesis; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Cleome; Decarboxylation; Isoenzymes; Malate Dehydrogenase; Mitochondria; Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase; Photosynthesis; Cleome; Cleome spinosa; Gynandropsis gynandra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862169798

As cores are often embedded in filaments, it is important to understand how line profiles from such systems differ from those of isolated cores. We perform radiative transfer calculations on a hydrodynamic simulation of a molecular cloud in order to model line emission from collapsing cores embedded in filaments. We model two optically thick lines, CS(2-1) and HCN(1-0), and one optically thin line, N2H+(1-0), from three embedded cores. In the hydrodynamic simulation, gas self-gravity, turbulence, and bulk flows create filamentary regions within which cores form. Though the filaments have large dispersions, the N2H+(1-0) lines indicate subsonic velocities within the cores. We find that the observed optically thick line profiles of CS(2-1) and HCN(1-0) vary drastically with viewing angle. In over 50% of viewing angles, there is no sign of a blue asymmetry, an idealized signature of infall motions in an isolated spherical collapsing core. Profiles that primarily trace the cores, with little contribution from the surrounding filament, are characterized by a systematically higher HCN(1-0) peak intensity. The N2H +(1-0) lines do not follow this trend. We demonstrate that red asymmetric profiles are also feasible in the optically thick lines, due to emission from the filament or one-sided accretion flows onto the core. We conclude that embedded cores may frequently undergo collapse without showing a blue asymmetric profile, and that observational surveys including filamentary regions may underestimate the number of collapsing cores if based solely on profile shapes of optically thick lines. © 2012.

To make more informed decisions within volatile socio-political climates, resource managers and planners need an understanding of the benefits local community members would like the resource to produce, and an understanding of the social and psychological factors that influence those preferences. In this research, we focused on two increasingly important factors - social capital and place-based social-psychological attachments - that influence public preferences for management outcomes. We conducted a stated preference field experiment on residents living in three forest related communities within Southern Appalachia in the Southeastern United States. The experiment elucidated responses to hypothetical management plans designed to produce distinctly different outcomes. The results reveal ecologically focused management plans were the most preferred, much more so than plans designed to produce aesthetic, recreational, or economic outcomes. The data also reveal both individuals' stocks of social capital as well as their place-based social-psychological attachments influence evaluation of competing management outcomes.

While general public and political support for wind energy is often high, siting wind farms frequently raises concerns in local communities, and individual projects often fail because of effective public opposition. This paper presents the results of a postal and online survey questionnaire that explores public perceptions of wind energy in two of the most important states for wind development, Texas and Iowa. The goal is a better understanding of public reactions to large-scale wind developments as a prerequisite of more widespread use of renewable energy resources. We found a high level of public support for wind energy, with more than two-thirds of respondents being in favor of building more wind farms either in their community or within the U.S. as a whole. Given that the majority of respondents had a very high level of concern for the general environment, we also found that almost two-thirds of respondents counter-intuitively indicated that producing electricity using fossil fuels is not detrimental to the environment, and that they had little concern for global climate change. Our results suggest that arguing for more renewable sources of energy based on reducing our carbon footprint is less persuasive in these communities than simply approaching it from the perspective of wind being a clean and safe source of energy. More than two-thirds of respondents felt their county had benefited economically from the wind farms and that they were a source of job creation in the county. Support for wind power in these communities is associated far more with socioeconomic factors than foundational aesthetic or moral values, with wind farms perceived as the vehicle that will reverse economic decline. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Most of the studies considered in this review were performed at bench scale; there is no description of real industrial applications in the literature and almost no pilot cases have been described. Anaerobic membrane bioreactors were fitted with flat sheet, hollow fibre or tubular membranes operating either in the microfiltration or in the ultrafiltration region, but the use of ceramic membranes has not been widely reported. Even though, under normal conditions, there should not be any difference in transmembrane pressure between hollow fibre and flat sheet membranes, hollow fibre membranes may lead to higher transmembrane pressures due to insufficient hydraulic shear on each of their fibres. Bioreactors were mainly tested under mesophilic or thermophilic conditions. The application of thermophilic conditions allowed treating higher organic loading rates. Chemical oxygen demand removal efficiencies up to 99%, total suspended solids removal efficiencies up to 100%, and complete removal of pathogens were reported. Therefore, treated waters may be directly discharged into water bodies or re-used for unrestricted crop irrigation if they meet the effluent discharge or irrigation standard of the area. The renewable energy produced within the plants (i.e. from methane production) was reported to cover the energy required for membrane filtration and the excess energy could be further used. Anaerobic membrane bioreactors are an attractive technology that needs further research efforts and industrialisation. However, membrane fouling, which still remains a major problem for all membrane bioreactors, seems much more severe under anaerobic conditions than aerobic ones. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Anaerobic membrane bioreactor; Membrane fouling; Microbiology; Wastewater treatment","Anaerobic conditions; Anaerobic membrane bioreactor; Chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency; Effluent discharge; Excess energy; Flat sheet membranes; Flat sheets; Hollow fibre; Hollow-fibre membrane; Industrial scale; Industrialisation; Membrane bioreactor; Membrane filtrations; Mesophilic; Methane production; Normal condition; Organic loading rates; Present situation; Renewable energies; Research efforts; Thermophilic conditions; Total suspended solids; Transmembrane pressures; Tubular membranes; Waterbodies; Ceramic membranes; Chemical oxygen demand; Effluents; Fibers; Industrial applications; Irrigation; Loading; Membrane fouling; Methane; Microbiology; Microfiltration; Ultrafiltration; Wastewater treatment; Bioreactors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864304663

Nonindustrial charcoal production generates large emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the form of CO 2 from forest degradation and methane from oxidation in traditional kilns. On a global scale, the GHG emissions from cement production are of considerable magnitude and are increasing rapidly. In this study, the impact of converting sawmill residues into charcoal briquettes and charcoal powder in Tanzania was assessed, using a cradle-to-grave approach. Furthermore, the net effects on GHG of substituting more GHG-intensive fuels with these charcoal products were evaluated. Replacing coal in cement manufacturing with this sawmill charcoal powder may reduce GHG emissions by 455-495 kg of CO 2eq MWh -1, corresponding to an 83-91% decrease. The net GHG emission reduction when replacing charcoal from miombo woodlands with these sawmill charcoal briquettes is 78-557 kg of CO 2eq MWh -1, or 42-84%, depending on whether the substituted charcoal can be considered carbon neutral or not. These replacements may considerably reduce the GHG emissions from the cement industry and in charcoal-dependent households in Tanzania. Due to the significant problems related to energy supply and forest deterioration in sub-Saharan countries, as well as the global growth of GHG emissions from the cement industry, this study might of relevance also outside Tanzania. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, we also implement the seventh order accurate weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO7) scheme for the cube sphere grid. For the finite difference approximation, we prove a stability estimate, derived from projection boundary conditions. For the finite volume method, we develop the implementational details by working in a local coordinate system at each cell.

Mass-limited targets such as small tin droplets are considered among the best choices for cleaner operation of the optical system because of lower mass of atomic debris produced by the laser beam. The small diameter of droplets, however, decreases the conversion efficiency (CE) of EUV photons emission, especially in the case of CO 2 laser, where laser wavelength has high reflectivity from the tin surface. We investigated ways of improving CE in mass-limited targets. We considered in our modeling various possible target phases and lasers configurations: from solid/liquid droplets subjected to laser beam energy with different intensities and laser wavelength to dual-beam lasers, i.e., a pre-pulse followed by a main pulse with adjusted delay time in between. We studied the dependence of vapor expansion rate, which can be produced as a result of droplet heating by pre-pulse laser energy, on target configuration, size, and laser beam parameters. As a consequence, we studied the influence of these conditions and parameters on the CE and debris mass accumulation. For better understanding and more accurate modeling of all physical processes occurred during various phases of laser beam/target interactions, plasma plume formation and evolution, EUV photons emission and collection, we have implemented in our heights package state-of-the art models and methods, verified, and benchmarked against laboratory experiments in our CMUXE center as well as various worldwide experimental results. © 2012 American Institute of Physics.",,"Accurate modeling; Advanced lithography; Best choice; Delay Time; Droplet heating; Dual-beam; Expansion rate; Extreme Ultraviolet; High reflectivity; Laboratory experiments; Laser beam energy; Laser beam parameters; Laser energies; Laser wavelength; Main pulse; Mass accumulations; Mass-limited target; Physical process; Plasma plumes; Prepulses; Reducing costs; Solid/liquid; State of the art; Target configurations; Target phasis; Tin droplets; Carbon dioxide; Conversion efficiency; Debris; Drops; Extreme ultraviolet lithography; Laser beams; Models; Optical systems; Photons; Tin; Vapors; Laser produced plasmas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865740853

This case study analyses the situation for Tata Power Delhi Distribution (TPDD) which needs to realign its strategy to meet the emerging sustainability challenges of inclusive growth and combating the climate change. The case covers the field of strategic management, strategy formulation and performance management system deployment using the balanced scorecard. It touches upon the emerging need for corporates to look beyond economic signals and take social and environmental impacts into strategy planning process. Study level/applicability: The case can be used in the following courses; post graduate program in public administration; MBA/Post graduate program in management in strategic management; executive training program for Government executives in public sector organizations to highlight the concept of performance management system in PPP companies. Case overview: After the initial tumultuous years, TPDD emerged as one of the efficient power distribution companies in Delhi region. One of the major management tools that was helpful to achieve this was the balanced scorecard. TPDD's general manager for corporate strategy & planning reviewed the process and the due diligence that went into designing and implementing the balanced scorecard. Now, after the balanced scorecard success story, he along with Dr Ganesh Das, Head of Group – Strategy wants to take it to a next level and integrate their strategies related to inclusive growth of community and combating the ill effects of climate change. They believe that the balanced scorecard method that had helped them to achieve their strategic goals will help them to achieve future objectives too. But whether the existing four perspectives: financial, customer, internal process and learning and growth would adequately address the emerging challenges or whether there was a need to introduce a new perspective – “The Social Perspective” – is what they contemplate in the case. Expected learning outcomes: The case can be used to teach the following: the importance of strategy in an organization and how it helps the firms to realize their stated vision; to highlight the process of strategy formulation and its deployment; to help students realize the difficulties in realizing a strategic goal through performance management system; use the balanced scorecard as an effective tool for strategy deployment and organizational alignment; to introduce students the concept of sustainability in the organization and emerging global challenges; and to illustrate the complexities involved in a strategic planning process Supplementary materials: Teaching notes. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Balanced scorecard; Partnership; Performance management systems; Strategic alignment; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081024979

The focus of the LCA is on the potential locations in Switzerland and France in the year 2030. Environmental burdens from the EPR are also compared to those from current pressurized water reactor (PWR) technology in Switzerland. The entire fuel cycle is analysed and includes improved modelling of natural uranium mining. The indicators employed in the impact assessment characterize a broad range of burdens to the environment and human health at both the global and the regional/local level and includes an analysis on the basis of external costs. The LCA shows a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by around just 7 per cent for the EPR in Switzerland in 2030 compared to the current PWR cycle emitting just above 5 g CO2-eq/kWh. Due to differences in cooling strategies, which cause slightly different output capacities, the French EPR is expected to achieve marginally better reductions of almost 16 per cent. The processing of natural uranium to yellowcake was shown to be the stage in the nuclear fuel cycle having the highest burdens and potential impacts across a majority of indicators, accounting for between 25 per cent and 60 per cent of burdens and potential impacts. External costs of normal operation are shown to be around just 2 per cent of estimated internal (production) costs and similar to those of hydro and offshore wind.

Renewable energy, energy efficiency, and energy conservation are all commonly suggested solutions. Both supply- and demand-side interventions will displace energy-and emissions-from conventional generators. Marginal emissions factors (MEFs) give a consistent metric for assessing the avoided emissions resulting from such interventions. This paper presents the first systematic calculation of MEFs for the U.S. electricity system. Using regressions of hourly generation and emissions data from 2006 through 2011, we estimate regional MEFs for CO2, NOx, and SO2, as well as the share of marginal generation from coal-, gas-, and oil-fired generators. Trends in MEFs with respect to system load, time of day, and month are explored. We compare marginal and average emissions factors (AEFs), finding that AEFs may grossly misestimate the avoided emissions resulting from an intervention. We find significant regional differences in the emissions benefits of avoiding one megawatt-hour of electricity: compared to the West, an equivalent energy efficiency measure in the Midwest is expected to avoid roughly 70% more CO2, 12 times more SO2, and 3 times more NO x emissions. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Avoided emissions; Demand-side; Efficiency measure; Electricity generation; Electricity system; Emissions factors; Equivalent energy; Renewable energies; System loads; Time of day; Carbon dioxide; Electric generators; Electricity; Energy efficiency; Sulfur dioxide; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; coal; nitric oxide; oil; sulfur dioxide; carbon dioxide; demand-side management; electricity generation; emission control; energy efficiency; nitrogen oxides; regression analysis; renewable resource; sulfur dioxide; air pollution; article; electricity; energy conservation; energy resource; gas; generator; marginal emission factor; measurement; renewable energy; United States; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Nitrogen Oxides; Power Plants; Sulfur Dioxide; Time Factors; United States; Midwest; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860496003

Among its diverse ecosystems are deep-sea brine pools - water bodies characterized by a unique combination of extreme conditions. The 'polyextremophiles' that constitute the microbial assemblage of these deep hot brines have not been comprehensively studied. We report a comparative taxonomic analysis of the prokaryotic communities of the sediments directly below the Red Sea brine pools, namely, Atlantis II, Discovery, Chain Deep, and an adjacent brine-influenced site. Analyses of sediment samples and high-throughput pyrosequencing of PCR-amplified environmental 16S ribosomal RNA genes (16S rDNA) revealed that one sulfur (S)-rich Atlantis II and one nitrogen (N)-rich Discovery Deep section contained distinct microbial populations that differed from those found in the other sediment samples examined. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Deferribacteres, and Euryarchaeota were the most abundant bacterial and archaeal phyla in both the S- and N-rich sections. Relative abundance-based hierarchical clustering of the 16S rDNA pyrotags assigned to major taxonomic groups allowed us to categorize the archaeal and bacterial communities into three major and distinct groups; group I was unique to the S-rich Atlantis II section (ATII-1), group II was characteristic for the N-rich Discovery sample (DD-1), and group III reflected the composition of the remaining sediments. Many of the groups detected in the S-rich Atlantis II section are likely to play a dominant role in the cycling of methane and sulfur due to their phylogenetic affiliations with bacteria and archaea involved in anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfate reduction. © 2012 Siam et al.",,"methane; nitrogen; ribosome RNA; sulfur; Actinobacteria; article; bacterium; bacterium identification; brine pool; community dynamics; community structure; concentration (parameters); cyanobacterium; Deferribacteres; Euryarchaeota; gene amplification; geochemical analysis; geographic and geological phenomena; geographical variation (species); high throughput pyrosequencing; microbial community; nonhuman; organism community; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; prokaryote; Proteobacteria; pyrosequencing; sediment; sedimentology; species composition; taxonomy; Archaea; Bacteria; Geologic Sediments; Seawater; Species Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865180394

Such warming and drying has a great impact on ecosystem processes on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. To determine their combined effects on CO 2 and N 2O emission rates, we conducted a field manipulative experiment in an alpine meadow of the eastern Tibetan Plateau during the growing season of 2009. The experiment showed that warming manipulation increased soil temperature by 1 °C, and drying manipulation decreased soil water content by 6.8 %. We found that by counteracting the effect of low temperature in the area, experimental warming significantly increased soil microbial biomass, the number of bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, ammonifying bacteria, nitrobacteria and denitrifying bacteria, and facilitated the emission rates of CO 2 and N 2O by 33.4 and 31.5 %, respectively. However, decreased precipitation further aggravated soil water stress and inhibited the numbers of these organisms, and reduced the emission rates of CO 2 and N 2O by 47.4 and 37.9 %, respectively. So decreased soil water content tended to offset the positive effect of warming. Compared to the positive effects of warming, decreased soil water content was shown in our study to have even greater impact on the eastern Tibetan Plateau during the growing season. Therefore, inhibition of CO 2 and N 2O emission rates (32.3 and 29.3 %, respectively) by warming and drying will intensify if the combined effects of these climatic trends persist in the region. © 2012 The Ecological Society of Japan.","CO 2; Drying; Eastern Tibetan Plateau; N 2O; Warming","alpine environment; carbon dioxide; global warming; inhibition; low temperature; meadow; nitrous oxide; precipitation (climatology); soil emission; soil microorganism; soil temperature; soil water; water stress; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Actinobacteria; Actinobacteria (class); Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Nitrobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864392874

We established communities of European meadow species, which were subjected to warming and extreme event (drought and deluge) treatments in a factorial design at an experimental garden in Zurich, Switzerland. Phylogenetically matched pairs of native and alien species (Bromus erectus, B. inermis, Trifolium pratense, T. hybridum, Lactuca serriola, and Conyza canadensis) were introduced into the communities to test if invader performance is favored by warming and extreme events, and if alien invaders perform better than native colonizers. With a warming of on average 0.3 °C, a higher cover of native plant communities was observed, while drought decreased cover in the short-term and lowered biomass. Germination, survival, and growth of the introduced species were lower under elevated temperature. Survival of all pairs and growth of Trifolium was greater in drought pots, while deluge had no effect. While the alien species showed a faster rate of increase in the number of leaves, mortality of alien species was greater than of native species. Overall, the performance of the focal species varied much more among taxonomic groups than native/alien provenances. The results suggest that with climate change, different types of extreme events will differ in the severity of their effects on native plant communities.

While the benefits of electrification on urban air quality have been studied quite widely, financial assessments of the various alternative vehicle forms are less common, particularly for Australian driving conditions. The aim of this paper is therefore to identify the scenarios under which different vehicle configurations are attractive to the vehicle owner. A Class-E conventional vehicle is compared with full-electric, plug-in hybrid, parallel hybrid, series hybrid and mild hybrid electric vehicle configurations. A simulation model of a conventional internal combustion engine based large sized car is developed and validated against experimental data. The conventional vehicle model is then systematically altered to obtain its increasingly electric variants. The fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions are simulated on the legislative NEDC drive cycle and the more representative Australian Urban Drive Cycle (AUDC). The outcomes of these tests are used to estimate the total cost of ownership and in-service emissions, thus allowing the cost of emissions mitigation to be approximated for the different vehicles. Different scenarios are considered for the pricing of energy and major powertrain components. This provides a baseline assessment based on current prices and projections, as well as 'electrification favorable' and 'electrification unfavorable' scenarios. The impact on vehicle emissions of significant penetration of renewable energy into the Australian electricity grid is also considered. © 2012 SAE International.",,"Alternative vehicles; Baseline assessment; Class E; Drive cycles; Driving conditions; Electricity grids; Emissions mitigation; Fuel prices; On currents; Plug-in hybrids; Powertrain components; Renewable energies; Simulation model; Total cost of ownership; Urban air quality; Vehicle configuration; Vehicle emission; Vehicle model; Computer simulation; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Digital storage; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Internal combustion engines; Plug-in hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871259347

This change in personal behavior is desired in order to reduce congestion and air pollutant emissions in city centers. This paper focuses on evaluating the impact of fare integration on transit ridership and travel behavior, using the city of Haifa, Israel, as a case study. The city's new, integrated, fare policy changed the historically complex per-boarding system to a simple five-zone fare system with free transfers, reducing fares for many passengers. Using fare-box data, on-board surveys and travel-behavior model estimation, we show that the new fare policy managed to negate the downward trend in transit ridership. Fare-box data showed a significant increase in single ticket sales of up to 25% over the first year following the launch of the reform; the survey's results pointed to an increase of 7.7% in passenger trips and 18.6% in boarding. The number of passenger boarding per trip increased from 1.38 to 1.52, implying that people were utilizing the free transfer option and enjoying a wider range of routes. The model results showed that fare reduction was a significant factor in attracting transit users, and that the public transport reform had three important contributions: first, it encouraged travelers to shift from private cars or taxi to buses; second, it created new trips, offering more opportunities for activity participation; and third, it increased travel options by allowing travelers to choose a better route. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Fare integration; Survey; Transit ridership; Travel behavior","atmospheric pollution; numerical model; traffic congestion; traffic emission; transportation system; travel behavior; Haifa [Israel]; Israel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857125325

However, their effect on the soil microbial community and their subsequent influence on soil function is still difficult to quantify. Recent applications of molecular techniques to soil biology, especially the use of 16S rRNA, are helping to bridge this gap. In this study, the influence of three land-use systems within a demonstration farm were evaluated with a view to further understand how these practices may impact observed soil bacterial communities. Replicate soil samples collected from the three land-use systems (grazed pine forest, cultivated crop, and grazed pasture) on a single soil type. High throughput 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing was used to generate sequence datasets. The different land use systems showed distinction in the structure of their bacterial communities with respect to the differences detected in cluster analysis as well as diversity indices. Specific taxa, particularly Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, and classes of Proteobacteria, showed significant shifts across the land-use strata. Families belonging to these taxa broke with notions of copio- and oligotrphy at the class level, as many of the less abundant groups of families of Actinobacteria showed a propensity for soil environments with reduced carbon/nutrient availability. Orders Actinomycetales and Solirubrobacterales showed their highest abundance in the heavily disturbed cultivated system despite the lowest soil organic carbon (SOC) values across the site. Selected soil properties ([SOC], total nitrogen [TN], soil texture, phosphodiesterase [PD], alkaline phosphatase [APA], acid phosphatase [ACP] activity, and pH) also differed significantly across land-use regimes, with SOM, PD, and pH showing variation consistent with shifts in community structure and composition. These results suggest that use of pyrosequencing along with traditional analysis of soil physiochemical properties may provide insight into the ecology of descending taxonomic groups in bacterial communities.",,"acid phosphatase; alkaline phosphatase; nitrogen; organic carbon; phosphodiesterase; RNA 16S; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Actinomycetales; agroecosystem; article; bacterium; carbon metabolism; cluster analysis; community structure; environmental management; enzyme activity; gene cluster; genetic variability; land use; microbial activity; microbial community; microbial diversity; nitrogen availability; nonhuman; pH measurement; physical chemistry; population abundance; Proteobacteria; pyrosequencing; sequence database; soil analysis; soil microflora; soil property; soil texture; Solirubrobacterales; species cultivation; taxonomic rank; Agriculture; Bacteria; Biodiversity; DNA, Bacterial; Ecosystem; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Soil Microbiology; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Actinomycetales; Bacteria (microorganisms); Proteobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864241592

X-band (910GHz) EPR spectra of DySND, in addition to the main intensive singlet Lorentzian-like EPR signal, reveal a low intensity doublet pattern within the half-field (HF) region (g4). On transferring spectra to the Q-band (34GHz) the shape of the HF pattern changes and splitting between doublet components is reduced from 10.4 to 2.6mT. The HF patterns observed are attributed to the forbidden ΔM S=2 transitions between the Zeeman levels of some spin-triplet (S=1) centers.

Vulnerability or livelihood insecurity emerges when poor people as individuals or social units have to face harmful threats or shocks with inadequate capacity to respond effectively. In such situations, people often have no choice but to turn to their immediate environment for support. Evidence suggests that rising levels of human vulnerability are driving increased dependency on biodiversity and ecosystem services, which in turn, and along with other threats, is rendering ecosystems more vulnerable. This paper explores the dynamic and complex linkages and feedbacks between human vulnerability and ecosystem vulnerability, drawing on data from the southern African region. Human vulnerability is conceptualized as a threat to ecosystem health, as driven by the interplay between a number of current and emerging factors. We focus on poverty, HIV/AIDS and more intense climate extremes as examples of stressors on livelihoods and direct and indirect drivers of ecosystem change. We discuss how some of the responses to increased vulnerability may pose threats to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem management and sustainable development, whilst considering potential solutions that rely on a thorough understanding of coupled social-ecological systems and the interplay between multiple stressors and responses at different scales. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","climate change; ecosystem services; HIV/AIDS; livelihoods; southern Africa; vulnerability","acquired immune deficiency syndrome; climate change; conceptual framework; ecosystem health; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; food security; governance approach; human immunodeficiency virus; land degradation; poverty; sustainable development; vulnerability; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861428710

To identify the dynamics and identity of bacterial species involved in decomposition of potato tissue as well as the assimilation of carbon from fresh plant material, 13C-labeled green potato tissues ( 13C 99.2%) were incorporated in soil microcosm for 39 days at the level of 2.5% (w/dry weight soil). The DNA was extracted from the soil after 1, 6, 15, 25 and 39 days. The heavy ( 13C) and light ( 12C) fractions of DNA were separated by ultracentrifugation and the structures of the bacterial and fungal communities were characterized by DGGE. Primary and secondary 13C-sequestrators were identified by sequencing DGGE bands that had appeared only in the heavy DNA fractions. Over the course of the experiment, the most dominant 13C-labeled phylogenetic group (class or phylum) was γ-Proteobacteria (51.4%), followed by Actinobacteria (27%), β-Proteobacteria (8.1%) and α-Proteobacteria (5.4%). Two taxa, namely Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia, were represented by just one sequence type. These bacterial taxa were differentiated into primary (Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas) and secondary sequestrators (Actinobacteria, Dyella, Mesorhizobium and Sphingomonas). The latter were possibly involved in either the redistribution of previously consumed carbon or in a possible degradation of the more complex plant compounds.

The ethanol was blended with unleaded gasoline in at percentages (10, 15, and 20% v/v). The regulated pollutants and the particulate matter emissions were evaluated over the European ECE R47 driving cycle on the chassis dynamometer bench. Particulate matter was characterized in terms of total mass collected on filters and total number of particles in the range 7 nm-10 μm measured by electrical low-pressure impactor (ELPI). In addition, particle-phase polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emissions were evaluated to assess the health impact of the emitted particulate. Finally, an accurate morphological analysis was performed on the particulate by high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with a digital image-processing/data-acquisition system. In general, CO emission reductions of 60-70% were obtained with 15 and 20% v/v ethanol blends, while the ethanol use did not reduce hydrocarbon (HC) and NOx emissions. No evident effect of ethanol on the particulate mass emissions and associated PAHs emissions was observed. Twenty-one PAHs were quantified in the particulate phase with emissions ranging from 26 to 35 μg/km and benzo[a]pyrene equivalent (BaPeq) emission factors from 2.2 to 4.1 μg/km. Both particulate matter and associated PAHs with higher carcinogenic risk were mainly emitted in the submicrometer size range (&lt;0.1 μm). On the basis of the TEM observations, no relevant effect of the ethanol use on the particulate morphology was evidenced, showing aggregates composed of primary particles with mean diameters in the range 17.5-32.5 nm.Implications: Mopeds may contribute in a large share to air pollution in some major urban areas; therefore, efforts may be taken to reduce their emissions. The addition of ethanol into gasoline (up 20% v/v) leads to a significant reduction of CO emission at the exhaust of a catalyzed 4-S moped, whereas this does not reduce HC and NOx. No clear effects on particulate matter and associated PAHs emissions have been observed with ethanol addition, but particulate-phase PAHs were mainly found on submicrometer-size particles (&lt;;0.1 μm), which penetrate deeply into the human respiratory tract. © 2012 Copyright 2012 A&amp;WMA.",,"Dynamometers; Emission control; Engines; Ethanol; Gasoline; Hydrocarbon refining; Image processing; Motorcycles; Nitrogen oxides; Particle size analysis; Particles (particulate matter); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Electrical low-pressure impactor; Gasoline ethanol blends; Human respiratory tract; Morphological analysis; Morphological characterization; Particulate matter emissions; Particulate morphology; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Particulate emissions; alcohol; carbon dioxide; gasoline; nitrogen oxide; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; accuracy; air pollutant; air pollution; article; electron microscope; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; transmission electron microscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864802545

Yet, in the Southern Ocean the role of water masses in the uptake of anthropogenic carbon is still debated. Here, a methodology is applied that tracks the carbon flux of each Southern Ocean water mass in response to climate change. A global marine biogeochemical model was coupled to a climate model, making 140-yr Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5)-type simulations, where atmospheric CO 2 increased by 1% yr -1 to 4 times the preindustrial concentration (4 × CO 2). Impacts of atmospheric CO 2 (carbon-induced sensitivity) and climate change (climate-induced sensitivity) on the water mass carbon fluxes have been isolated performing two sensitivity simulations. In the first simulation, the atmospheric CO 2 influences solely the marine carbon cycle, while in the second simulation, it influences both the marine carbon cycle and earth's climate. At 4 × CO 2, the cumulative carbon uptake by the Southern Ocean reaches 278 PgC, 53% of which is taken up by modal and intermediate water masses. The carbon-induced and climate-induced sensitivities vary significantly between the water masses. The carbon-induced sensitivities enhance the carbon uptake of the water masses, particularly for the denser classes. But, enhancement strongly depends on the water mass structure. The climate-induced sensitivities either strengthen or weaken the carbon uptake and are influenced by local processes through changes in CO 2 solubility and stratification, and by large-scale changes in outcrop surface (OS) areas. Changes in OS areas account for 45% of the climateinduced reduction in the Southern Ocean carbon uptake and are a key factor in understanding the future carbon uptake of the Southern Ocean. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.","Atmosphere-ocean interaction; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate sensitivity; Feedback; Ocean dynamics","Anthropogenic carbon; Atmosphere-ocean interactions; Atmospheric CO; Biogeochemical models; Carbon fluxes; Carbon uptake; Climate sensitivity; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; Earth's climate; Global marines; Key factors; Marine carbon cycle; Ocean dynamics; Pre-industrial; Role of water; Sensitivity Simulation; Southern ocean; Water mass; Water mass analysis; Water mass structure; Carbon; Climate change; Computer simulation; Feedback; Forestry; Ocean habitats; Oceanography; Carbon dioxide; atmosphere-hydrosphere interaction; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; climate change; climate effect; climate feedback; climate modeling; intermediate water; sensitivity analysis; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862739892

This article analyzes and compares smallholder land use and livelihood strategies at the forest-farm frontier in the Peruvian Amazon to draw out locally contextualized REDD+ strategies. Results: Data were collected through household surveys and interviews. The results point to four central REDD+ strategies: payments for ecosystems services, reduced forest degradation, enhanced carbon production and income diversification. Conclusion: Local REDD+ strategies should be contextually informed and allow for the widest conception of potential strategies under the mechanism to maximize implementation flexibility and, thus, participative equity. © 2012 Future Science Ltd.",,"Carbon production; Comparative analysis; Forest degradation; Household surveys; Livelihood strategies; Local populations; Specific activity; Developing countries; Farms; Land use; Forestry; Biological Populations; Decision Making; Forestry; Land Use; Peru; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861819953

This research adopts a political ecology approach to examine forest governance in Peru's Central Selva region. Semi-structured key informant interviews were carried out in Lima, Oxapampa, and communities across the western buffer zone of the Yanachaga-Chemillen National Park. The region's history highlights the nature of the exploitative activities which lead to the present institutional and floristic conditions, while a geopolitical dichotomy has played an important role in preventing the formation of a common vision for regional development. The state authorities are found to be critically under-capacitated for their remit, while NGO efforts in the area appear disperse and uncoordinated. National market forces, along with national Amazonian settlement policy, are found to have the greatest influence on land use. The relative lack of state presence, inappropriate institutions, and extractive economy suggest that the region is currently institutionally unequipped to undertake and govern a REDD initiative. Through studies like the one presented here it is possible to gain a thorough understanding of local governance workings to ground and contextualize REDD in local realities. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","governance; institutional capacity; political ecology; reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD)","Buffer zones; Contextualize; Forest degradation; Forest governance; governance; institutional capacity; National markets; National parks; Political ecology; Regional development; Semi-structured; Tropical deforestation; Deforestation; Ecology; Economics; Parks; Regional planning; Societies and institutions; anthropogenic effect; buffer zone; deforestation; environmental research; forest management; geopolitics; governance approach; institutional framework; national park; regional development; state role; tropical forest; Deforestation; Degradation; Ecology; Economics; Emission; Forest Management; Governments; Peru; Research; Amazonas [Peru]; Lima [Peru]; Peru",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861801634

Tourism is recognized as a highly climate-sensitive sector, one that is also strongly influenced by environmental and socioeconomic change influenced by climate change, and is also a growing contributor to anthropogenic climate change. This article outlines the complex interrelationships between climate change and the multiple components of the international tourism system. Five focal themes that have developed within the literature on the consequences of climate change for tourism are then critically reviewed: climatic change and temporal and geographic shifts in tourism demand, climate-induced environmental change and destination competitiveness within three major market segments (winter sports tourism, coastal tourism, and nature-based tourism), and mitigation policy developments and future tourist mobility. The review highlights the differential vulnerability of tourism destinations and that the resultant changes in competitiveness and sustainability will transform some international tourism markets. Feedbacks throughout the tourism system mean that all destinations will need to adapt to the risks and opportunities posed by climate change and climate policy. While notable progress has been made in the last decade, a number of important knowledge gaps in each of the major impact areas, key regional knowledge gaps, and both tourist and tourism operator perceptions of climate change risks and adaptive capacity indicate that the tourism sector is not currently well prepared for the challenges of climate change. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Commerce; Competition; Developing countries; Economics; Risk perception; Sustainable development; Anthropogenic climate changes; Climate change risks; Environmental change; International tourisms; Multiple components; Nature-based tourism; Poverty alleviation; Socio-economic change; Climate change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862109376

Year-to-year variations in this carbon sink are linked to variations in hydroclimate that affect net ecosystem productivity 3,4. The severity and incidence of climatic extremes, including drought, have increased as a result of climate warming 5-8. Here, we examine the effect of the turn of the century drought in western North America on carbon uptake in the region, using reanalysis data, remote sensing observations and data from global monitoring networks. We show that the area-integrated strength of the western North American carbon sink declined by 30-298 Tg C yr -1 during the 2000-2004 drought. We further document a pronounced drying of the terrestrial biosphere during this period, together with a reduction in river discharge and a loss of cropland productivity. We compare our findings with previous palaeoclimate reconstructions and show that the last drought of this magnitude occurred more than 800 years ago. Based on projected changes in precipitation and drought severity, we estimate that the present mid-latitude carbon sink of 177-623 Tg C yr -1 in western North America could disappear by the end of the century. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Increasing threats on NTFP-providing tree species, due to land-use intensification, require ecological studies as well as additional information about species' uses and management provided by local people. The objectives of our study were to (i) document uses and management of the baobab (Adansonia digitata L.), (ii) investigate knowledge distribution among genders and different villages, and (iii) assess the population status of the baobab in eastern Burkina Faso. We conducted an ethnobotanical survey among Gulimanceba people and performed a quantitative analysis using different measures of knowledge. Interviews reveal that the baobab is harvested by local people for 25 use-types. The fruits are the most important plant part and baobab products are of special importance for nutritional uses. Local management of baobab seems to be so far sufficient to maintain baobab populations. The fact that we found some differences in uses and management of baobab between genders and villages emphasizes the importance of gender- and region-related management recommendation. People are able to use and manage the baobab in a relative sustainable way as human population density is relatively low and as they have relatively good access to the forest compared to other regions of Burkina Faso.

The Olweus Bullying Prevention Program (OBPP) has been identified as an effective means to reduce bullying behavior in schools. The goal of this large population-based initiative was to reduce bullying by producing a quantifiable change in school climate using an established program and standardized measurement tool. Program participants over a 2-year period included 56,137 students and more than 2,400 teachers from 107 schools in 49 counties across Pennsylvania. An age cohorts design was used, and data from two equivalent age cohorts of students were compared at two or more points in time. After 1 to 2 years of program implementation, across cohorts, there were reductions in student self-reports of bullying others, and improvements in student perceptions of adults' responsiveness, and students' attitudes about bullying. This study is the largest bullying prevention initiative to date in the United States. This initiative reaffirms the efficacy of the OBPP, emphasizes the importance of an identified coalition, and highlights several positive outcomes. It is recommended that the OBPP be implemented through the establishment of community partnerships and coalitions as consistent with the public health model. © 2012 Society for Public Health Education.","bullying; coalition; community networks; health promotion; school health services","adolescent; article; attitude; bullying; child; cohort analysis; community care; evaluation; female; health promotion; human; intervention study; male; organization; school; United States; violence; Adolescent; Attitude; Bullying; Child; Cohort Studies; Community Networks; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Intervention Studies; Male; Organizational Culture; Pennsylvania; Schools; Violence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864766204

In order to assess GHG burdens and to identify options of climate-optimized livestock farming, GHG emissions of sheep grazing in Inner Mongolia steppe were analyzed. Carbon sequestration and field-fluxes of methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2O) were measured at a range of steppe sites differing in grazing intensity and management, i. e. ungrazed (UG), ungrazed with hay cutting (HC), lightly grazed (LG), moderately grazed (MG), and heavily grazed (HG). In addition, GHG emissions from enteric fermentation, manure management, and farming inputs (i. e. fossil fuels) were quantified for LG, MG, and HG. Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate uncertainty. Sheep grazing changed the net GHG balance of the steppe from a significant sink at UG (-1476 ± 2481 kg CO 2eq ha -1 year -1) to a significant source at MG (2350 ± 1723 kg CO 2eq ha -1 year -1) and HG (3115 ± 2327 kg CO 2eq ha -1 year -1). In a similar way, the GHG intensity increased from 8.6 ± 79.2 kg CO 2eq kg -1 liveweight gain at LG up to 62.2 ± 45.8 and 62.6 ± 46.7 kg CO 2eq kg -1 liveweight gain at MG and HG, respectively. GHG balances were predominantly determined by CO 2 from changes in topsoil organic carbon. In grazing systems, CH 4 from enteric fermentation was the second most important component. The results suggest that sheep grazing under the current management changes this steppe ecosystem from a sink to a source of GHGs and that grazing exclusion holds large potential to restore soil organic carbon stocks and thus to sequester atmospheric CO 2. The balance between grazing intensity and grazing exclusion predominantly determines GHG balances of grass-based sheep farming in this region. Therefore, a high proportion of ungrazed land is most important for reducing GHG balances of sheep farms. This can be either achieved by high grazing intensity on the remaining grazed land or by confined hay feeding of sheep. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon footprint; Global warming potential; Grazing intensity; Greenhouse gas; Life cycle assessment; Sheep meat production","agricultural emission; air-soil interaction; biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; feeding; global warming; grazing; grazing management; greenhouse gas; hay; life cycle analysis; livestock farming; management practice; manure; meat; methane; Monte Carlo analysis; nature-society relations; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; semiarid region; sheep; soil organic matter; source-sink dynamics; steppe; temperate environment; topsoil; Mongolia; Ovis aries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865481794

S. Corn Belt are evaluated for impacts of past (1992-2001) and projected (2001-2030) urban expansion on ecosystem goods and services, with a specific focus on changes in energy balance, hydrology, and productivity. Scenarios for high-, medium- and low-density urban areas are simulated using a dynamic agro-ecosystem model (Agro-IBIS), by incorporating new parameterizations for impervious surfaces and turf grass. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 500-m albedo data and remote sensing-derived 30-m resolution maps from the U. S. National Land Cover Database are used as model input to simulate biogeochemical, thermodynamic, and hydrological cycles for a range of land-cover types in each region. The results show that the expanding urban areas have a significant impact on each city's capacity to regulate climate and flooding. High-density urban areas, for instance, have soil surface temperatures up to 6°C higher than soils within natural and managed ecosystems. Expansion of turf grass in residential areas could require an additional 8-105 million m 3 of water use annually, which increases runoff by 15-48% and reduces the capacity to respond/adapt to flooding. Finally, the analysis shows that net primary productivity (NPP) decreases as expected due to the removal of cropland, forests, and grasslands in favor of development, but increased urban turf grass provides an annual offset of 40-210 g C m -2. Urban expansion through 2030 is estimated to lower total annual crop production by 8. 1, 8. 6, and 16. 7% for the Madison, Peoria, and Indianapolis regions, respectively. Given current projections for city growth to exceed 2-3% per year in the north-central U. S., urban expansion across a nine-state region in the Corn Belt could potentially take an additional 210,000-310,000 ha of farmland out of production annually at a time when demand for food, fuel, and fiber is increasing. Because conversion of cropland to urban uses is nearly always unidirectional, any changes to ecosystem goods and services due to urbanization are likely to be permanent and irreversible. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","cities; ecosystem services; land use; modeling; sprawl; urbanization","agricultural ecosystem; albedo; crop production; database; ecosystem service; energy balance; environmental impact assessment; hydrological change; hydrological cycle; land cover; land use change; MODIS; net ecosystem production; parameterization; remote sensing; soil surface; soil temperature; thermodynamics; urban development; urban growth; urbanization; water use; Corn Belt; Illinois; Indiana; Indianapolis; Madison; Peoria County; United States; Wisconsin; Peoria; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860669280

Total suspended particles (TSP) and fine particles (PM 2.5 and PM 1) were collected continuously from October 2007 to February 2009 and were analyzed in detail with regard to mass and element concentrations, water-soluble ions, and black carbon (BC). Mass as well as element concentrations during the Olympic air quality control period were lower than the respective concentrations during the time directly before and after the Olympic Games. The results showed that the applied aerosol source control measures, such as shutting down industries and reducing traffic, had a huge impact on the reduction of aerosol pollution in Beijing. However, the meteorological conditions, especially rainfall, certainly also contributed to the successful reduction of particulate air pollution.Coarse particles were reduced more efficiently than finer particles, which indicates that long-range transport of atmospheric particles is difficult to control and that presumably the established mitigation area was not large enough. The study further showed that elements from predominantly anthropogenic sources, such as S, Cu, As, Cd, and Pb, as well as BC, were reduced more efficiently during the Olympic Games than elements for which geogenic sources are more significant, such as Al, Fe, Rb or Sr. Furthermore, the mentioned anthropogenic element concentrations were reduced more in the finer PM 2.5 samples whereas geogenic ones were reduced stronger in TSP samples including the coarser fraction.

In thinking about the future of the automobile it is tempting to blame the car for its contribution to climate change. Yet it is us the drivers who have chosen to create a world of large cars and in most Western nations established a very automobile-dependent lifestyle. The automobile has given many of its owners and users greater choices on where and how to live. But it is clear that those choices increasingly impinge on all drivers, and, more important, on all others trying to move in increasingly crowded cities or between urban areas on crowded motorways. The situation in developing countries is dire at a tenth or less of the motorization rate industrialized countries. People are frozen in most large cities. It is thus hard to foresee expansion in car ownership to high levels forecast by some international organizations and analysts. Does this mean the future of the automobile is grim? Yes, if individuals, their elected officials and stakeholders in fuel and vehicle companies continue as if there are not profound problems confronting the choices automobiles give their users. In any case, CO2 is not the deciding factor over the future of the automobile, rather more fundamental issues such as the difficulty of fitting in so many individual vehicles to so little space. Technology can help somewhat, but the larger issues are what people decide to do with technology. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

We jointly investigate climate projections, vulnerability, impacts, and options for adaptation. Precipitation in North Africa is likely to decrease between 10 and 20%, while temperatures are likely to rise between 2 and 3. °C by 2050. This trend is most pronounced in the north-western parts of northern Africa as our own model results suggest. The combination of decreasing supply and strong population growth aggravates the stressed water situation in the region. We further compare the vulnerabilities, adaptive capacities and conflict implications of climate change in Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, and Tunisia. Climate change will likely have the strongest effect on Morocco where the agricultural sector is of high importance for the country's economy and particularly for poor people. Our analysis of climate impacts and adaptation options in Morocco suggests that the agricultural incentives used in the past are inadequate to buffer drought effects. To increase resilience against climate change, agricultural policies should shift from maximizing agricultural output to stabilizing it. Our bio-economic model results further suggest a considerable potential of replacing firewood by electric energy to sustain pastoral productivity. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change; Morocco; North africa; Vulnerability","adaptation; agricultural development; agricultural policy; agricultural production; climate change; drought; ecosystem resilience; electrical power; environmental impact; fuelwood; pastoralism; population growth; socioeconomic impact; temperature effect; vulnerability; water stress; Algeria; Egypt; Libyan Arab Jamahiriya; Morocco; Tunisia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861214729

Our concept is based on the formulation of an inverse scattering problem (ISP) to recover deviations in compressibility in a specified region from measurements of the scattered sound. For its derivation, we utilize the Born approximation and assume the emission of a single broadband plane sound wave. We employ CS to regularize this ill-posed ISP, assuming the existence of a sparse representation of the deviations in compressibility in a suitable basis or tight frame. We validate our concept experimentally and compare the recovered images to those generated by synthetic aperture (SA; 128 wave emissions), filtered backpropagation (FBP; single plane wave emission), and delay-and-sum (DAS; single plane wave emission) algorithms. For a sparse wire phantom, our concept outperformed SA, FBP and DAS in terms of sidelobe reduction and lateral -6 dB-widths. Axial -6 dB-widths were comparable. Using wave atoms or curvelets for sparse representation, our concept recovered a commercial multi-tissue phantom with fewer image artifacts and smaller lateral -6 dB-widths than FBP and DAS. Moreover, the achieved contrast was comparable to SA. © 2012 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin Boston.",,"Backpropagation algorithms; Compressibility; Elastic waves; Recovery; Signal reconstruction; Ultrasonic imaging; Wave propagation; Compressive sensing; Diagnostic ultrasound; Filtered backpropagation; Inverse scattering problems; Measurements of; Pulse echo ultrasound; Side-lobe reduction; Sparse representation; Image acquisition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881633985

At an agricultural field site cropped with maize or wheat, plant carbon input to soil was experimentally manipulated by amendment with maize litter. The community structure of dominant micro-food web components, the bacteria, fungi, protozoa and nematodes, was investigated across a depth gradient comprising plough layer, rooted soil below plough horizon, and deeper root free soil. The community composition and diversity within micro-food webs, and the response to resource supply, were assessed in summer, the vegetation period with highest root exudation. In the plough layer amendment with plant residues increased microbial biomass as well as density of fan shaped amoeba morphotypes and of bacterial- and fungal-feeding nematodes. Diversity of food web assemblages was assessed by operational taxonomic units (OTU) for bacteria and fungi, protozoa morphotypes and nematode families. Changes in diversity were either not apparent (fungi, protozoa), negatively related to litter (bacteria) or positively linked to the presence of a specific crop plant (bacteria, nematodes). Based on nematode functional guilds and the related enrichment and structure index, general food web conditions were assigned as nutrient enriched, with a high degree of disturbance, and a dominance of the bacterial energy channel. In sum, litter amendment fostered the abundance but not the diversity of organisms as food webs remained bottom heavy with only small amounts of carbon conserved at higher trophic levels. Food web structure was more affected by the abiotic (soil profile) and biotic (crop plant) environment than by the supply with litter resources. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Depth transect; Litter; Microorganisms; Nematodes; Protozoa; Trophic interactions","Agricultural fields; Arable soils; Carbon flow; Community composition; Community structures; Crop plants; Depth gradient; Depth transect; Energy channels; Food webs; Functional guilds; General foods; Litter; Litter amendments; Microbial biomass; Morphotypes; Nematodes; Operational taxonomic units; Plant residues; Processing plants; Resource availability; Root exudation; Soil food web; Soil profiles; Structure index; Terrestrial systems; Trophic interactions; Trophic level; Trophic network; Vegetation periods; Web components; Agricultural machinery; Carbon; Crops; Ecology; Fungi; Microorganisms; Protozoa; Soils; Bacteria; agricultural soil; biomass; carbon flux; cereal; community composition; community structure; disturbance; exudation; food web; litter; microbial community; microbial ecology; morphotype; resource availability; soil depth; soil fauna; soil microorganism; soil profile; trophic level; vegetation; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Nematoda; Protozoa; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860504140

However, a change from conventional solventborne (SB) to WB technologies should not compromise the protective function of the coatings and the used raw materials. The use of light stabilizers, such as UV absorbers (UVA) and hindered amine light stabilizers (HALS) are state-of-The-Art and largely improve the coating durability and service lifetime. Today in the case of UVA one has to differentiate between inorganic and organic products: the most widely used organic UVA for coating applications are 2-(2- hydroxyphenyl)- benzotriazole (BTZ) and 2-hydroxyphenyl- s-Triazine (HPT) derivatives. Inorganic products are ideally nano particulate materials-socalled mineral screeners (MS)-comprised of titanium dioxide (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO), or cerium oxide (CeO2). The challenge here is to convert existing products which are in general hydrophobic substances into product forms that enable easy incorporation and unproblematic dispersion into WB systems. This article describes UV absorbers which are commercially available for waterborne coatings. Different classes are tested with regard to their protective function in joinery coatings as well as with regard to their influence on coatings color and transparency.

However, the relative importance of construction phase emissions is quickly increasing as the energy efficiency of buildings increases. In addition, the significance of construction may actually be much higher when the temporal perspective of the emissions is taken into account. The construction phase carbon spike, i.e.high GHG emissions in a short time associated with the beginning of the buildings life cycle, may be high enough to question whether new construction, no matter how energy efficient the buildings are, can contribute to reaching the greenhouse gas mitigation goals of the near future. Furthermore, the construction of energy efficient buildings causes more GHG emissions than the construction of conventional buildings. On the other hand, renovating the current building stock together with making energy efficiency improvements might lead to a smaller construction phase carbon spike and still to the same reduced energy consumption in the use phase as the new energy efficient buildings. The study uses a new residential development project in Northern Europe to assess the overall life cycle GHG emissions of a new residential area and to evaluate the influence of including the temporal allocation of the life cycle GHG emissions in the assessment. In the study, buildings with different energy efficiency levels are compared with a similar hypothetical area of buildings of the average existing building stock, as well as with a renovation of an area with average buildings from the 1960s. The GHG emissions are modeled with a hybrid life cycle assessment. The study suggests that the carbon payback time of constructing new residential areas is several decades long even when using very energy efficient buildings compared to utilizing the current building stock. Thus, while increasing the overall energy efficiency is important in the long term, the construction of new energy efficient buildings cannot be used as a means to achieve the short term and medium term climate change mitigation goals as cities and governments often suggest. Furthermore, given the magnitude of the carbon spike from construction and its implications, the climate change mitigation strategies should set reduction targets for the construction phase emissions alongside the ones for the use phase, which currently receives almost all of the attention from policy-makers. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.","Carbon spike; Construction; GHG; Greenhouse gas; Life cycle assessment; Residential development","Carbon; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Life cycle; Energy efficiency improvements; Energy efficient building; GHG; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions; Overall energy efficiency; Residential development; Construction; building construction; emission; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; policy making; residential development; residential location; Northern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867054756

This concept of selectivity features prominently in a number of recent cases and plays a controversial role in Commission and Court practice in the application of art.107(1) to seemingly general schemes. In this recent appeal from a judgment of the General Court, the highest EU Court examined the Netherlands scheme for NOx emissions trading from a State aid perspective and, notably, the selectivity criterion. The ECJ found for the Commission on the ground that the measure was selective because only the largest polluters had been granted (tradable, and hence valuable) emission rights free of charge. However, the largest polluters were also the only ones caught by the scheme and it would have been impossible to determine the value of the rights up-front in a dynamic cap scheme. The approach chosen by the Court casts doubt on the ability of Member States to design national schemes that avoid the State aid rules even if they are in line with EU environmental policy.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that there are differences in CBF responses to physiological stimuli (i.e. dynamic exercise and orthostatic stress) between arteries in humans. These findings suggest that dynamic CBF regulation and cerebral CO2 reactivity may be different in the anterior and posterior cerebral circulation. The aim of this study was to identify cerebral CO2 reactivity by measuring blood flow and examine potential differences in CO2 reactivity between the internal carotid artery (ICA), external carotid artery (ECA) and vertebral artery (VA). In 10 healthy young subjects, we evaluated the ICA, ECA, and VA blood flow responses by duplex ultrasonography (Vivid-e, GE Healthcare), and mean blood flow velocity in middle cerebral artery (MCA) and basilar artery (BA) by transcranial Doppler (Vivid-7, GE healthcare) during two levels of hypercapnia (3% and 6% CO2), normocapnia and hypocapnia to estimate CO2 reactivity. To characterize cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2, we used both exponential and linear regression analysis between CBF and estimated partial pressure of arterial CO2, calculated by end-tidal partial pressure of CO2. CO2 reactivity in VA was significantly lower than in ICA (coefficient of exponential regression 0.021 ± 0.008 vs. 0.030 ± 0.008; slope of linear regression 2.11 ± 0.84 vs. 3.18 ± 1.09% mmHg-1: VA vs. ICA, P &lt; 0.01). Lower CO2 reactivity in the posterior cerebral circulation was persistent in distal intracranial arteries (exponent 0.023 ± 0.006 vs. 0.037 ± 0.009; linear 2.29 ± 0.56 vs. 3.31 ± 0.87% mmHg-1: BA vs. MCA). In contrast, CO2 reactivity in ECA was markedly lower than in the intra-cerebral circulation (exponent 0.006 ± 0.007; linear 0.63 ± 0.64% mmHg-1, P &lt; 0.01). These findings indicate that vertebro-basilar circulation has lower CO2 reactivity than internal carotid circulation, and that CO2 reactivity of the external carotid circulation is markedly diminished compared to that of the cerebral circulation, which may explain different CBF responses to physiological stress. © 2012 The Authors.

The simulations are conducted with the Polyphemus air quality modeling system over July and August 2006. Prior to the sensitivity study on the impact of biogenic emissions on air quality, the modeling results are compared to observational data, as well as to the concentrations obtained by other modeling teams of the Air Quality Model Evaluation International Initiative (AQMEII) study.Over Europe, three distinct emission inventories are used. Model performance is satisfactory for O 3, PM 10 and PM 2.5 with all inventories with respect to the criteria described in the literature. Furthermore, the rmse and errors are lower than the average rmse and errors of the AQMEII simulations. Over North America, the model performance satisfies the criteria described in the literature for O 3, PM 10 and PM 2.5. Polyphemus results are within the range of the AQMEII model results. Although the rmse and errors are higher than the average of the AQMEII simulations for O 3, they are lower for PM 10 and PM 2.5.The impact of biogenic and anthropogenic emissions on O 3 and PM concentrations is studied by removing alternatively biogenic and anthropogenic emissions in distinct simulations. Because biogenic species interact strongly with NO x, the impact of biogenic emissions on O 3 concentrations varies with variations of the Volatile Organic Compound (VOC)/NO x ratio. This impact is larger over NA than Europe. O 3 decreases by 10-11% on average over Europe and 20% over NA. Locally, the relative impact is also higher in NA (60% maximum) than in Europe (35% maximum). O 3 decreases near large urban centers where biogenic emissions are large (e.g. Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston in NA, Milan in Europe).Most of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) formed at the continental scale over Europe and NA are biogenic aerosols. Eliminating biogenic emissions reduces SOA by 72-88% over Europe and by 90% over NA. However, biogenic SOA are not only impacted by biogenic but also by anthropogenic emissions: eliminating all anthropogenic emissions affects oxidant levels and the absorbing carbon mass, reducing the formation of SOA by 15-16% over Europe and by about 10% over NA; Furthermore, locally, the reduction may be as large as 50%, especially over large urban centers in Europe and NA. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Anthropogenic; Biogenic; Emission; Ozone; Particles; PM","Air quality modeling; Air quality models; Anthropogenic; Anthropogenic emissions; Biogenic; Biogenic emission; Biogenic species; Carbon mass; Chicago; Continental scale; Emission inventories; Houston; Los angeles; Model performance; Model results; Modeling results; Modeling team; Observational data; Particulate Matter; Relative impact; Secondary organic aerosols; Sensitivity studies; Urban centers; Atmospheric aerosols; Elementary particles; Errors; Neutron emission; Ozone; Promethium; Quality assurance; Volatile organic compounds; Air quality; carbon; volatile organic compound; air quality; anthropogenic source; biogenic emission; carbon emission; emission inventory; error analysis; literature review; numerical model; ozone; particulate matter; urban site; volatile organic compound; air quality; article; biogenic emission; Europe; North America; ozone layer; particulate matter; priority journal; secondary organic aerosol; urban area; California; Chicago; Houston; Illinois; Italy; Lombardy; Los Angeles [California]; Milan; Milano [Lombardy]; Texas; United States; Polyphemus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860561467

Drastically change in land use pattern of the region has been observed during last few decades. In this paper, an effort was made to track the seasonal as well as annual changes of vegetation pattern in Jaisalmer district using MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products. Apart from this, ground data on vegetation were also collected under vegetation carbon pool assessment programme of ISRO-IGBP. It was found that during the hot summer month of May, the area under NDVI class 0-0.1 is reduced from 98% during 2003 to 95% during 2009 with a simultaneous increase in area under NDVI class 0.1-0.2 from 2 to 5%. During the month of September, area under NDVI class 0.2-0.3 increased from almost negligible during May to 34-39% during normal or surplus rainfall year but only to 3% during a deficit year. From the ground data on vegetation biomass, it was found that Prosopis juliflora and Acacia senegal are the most abundant trees in Jaisalmer region of the desert. The sites with NDVI value ≥ 0.2 were mostly found with Prosopis juliflora tree. Among shrubs, the most abundant species was Calotropis procera and Zizyphus numularia. From this study, it has been found that MODIS NDVI products may be used to quickly assess the vegetation changes in response to rainfall as well as due to anthroprogenic interventions in desert.","16-day composite MODIS products (MOD13Q1); Arid western India; Biomass; Jaisalmer; NDVI","Biomass; Forestry; Land use; Landforms; Radiometers; Rain; Trees (mathematics); 16-day composite MODIS products (MOD13Q1); Arid western India; Change in land use; Jaisalmer; NDVI; Normalized difference vegetation index; Vegetation biomass; Vegetation pattern; Vegetation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924427684

Today, large-scale forest decline is observed at the rear edge of Mediterranean forests, with drought identified as the most likely driver. The vulnerability of Mediterranean mountain plantations to regional climatic variations; however, is poorly understood. In this paper, we analyze the impact of biotic and abiotic factors on the growth and vigor of two pine species in drought-prone areas. We assess the main factors influencing crown defoliation and radial growth to develop a predictive model of forest decline risk for pine plantations at the dry edge of the species range. Dendrochronological data were collected on 50 plots for Pinus nigra subsp. salzmanii and 40 plots for Pinus sylvestris. We examined tree size, competition, site characteristics and climate variables related to decline of pine plantations. Correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to identify the correlates of decline with crown condition and growth, separately. Logistic regression and generalized linear models were used to study the relationship between canopy defoliation and growth, respectively, for P. nigra and P. sylvestris. Explanatory variables were introduced in a stepwise selection. The PCA revealed three main axes, associated with climate, competition and physiographic variables. Those three axes were associated with crown damage and basal area growth, respectively. Probability of crown damage was associated with tree size, competition and climate conditions. P. sylvestris was more sensitive than P. nigra to summer potential evapotranspiration effects. Also, climate and competition were the two main drivers affecting basal area growth. Unlike crown defoliation, physiography had an important effect. Within each species, there was a divergence between healthy and damaged trees, mainly related to competition factors. On the other hand, growth trends as an independent variable were not included in the crown damage probability model in a stepwise selection. However, declining growth found in trees at higher crown defoliation and drier sites may imply a greater vulnerability to decline, suggesting an enhanced die-off risk. The sharp growth reduction and widespread defoliation in declining pine plantations make their future persistence in xeric sites subject to frequent and severe droughts unlikely under expected warmer and drier conditions in the future. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Crown defoliation; Forest decline; Mediterranean pines; Plantations; Rear edge; Tree rings","Crown defoliation; Forest decline; Mediterranean pines; Plantations; Rear edge; Tree rings; Drought; Ecology; Logistics; Principal component analysis; Water supply; Forestry; basal area; biotic factor; canopy architecture; coniferous tree; correlation; defoliation; dendrochronology; drought; forest edge; Mediterranean environment; mountain region; persistence; plantation forestry; population decline; principal component analysis; risk factor; tree ring; vigor; vulnerability; Crowns; Defoliation; Drought; Ecology; Materials Handling; Pinus; Plantations; Rings; Water Supply; Iberian Basin; Pinus nigra; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857969688

Insights can be used to maximize the benefits of alternative fuels or to avoid potential problems that stem from differing ignition and combustion characteristics of particular fuels. In this work, biodiesel (20%, 50%, and 100% biodiesel blends), jet fuel JP8, and synthetic jet fuel S8 are compared to diesel #2 (ULSD). Comparisons are made on ignition, combustion, particulate matter, particulate size spectra, and NO X emission at steady state under harmonized operating conditions, that is, with equalized fuel energy input. All experiments are conducted using the same baseline calibration originally developed for diesel fuel. Ignition delay and combustion phasing trends suggest the need for possible adaptation of ECU calibration. The impact of alternative fuels on particulate emission depended strongly on fuel aromatic content and oxygenation. NO X emission was correlated to multiple physical and chemical fuel properties. While the significance of different properties on NO X emission varied with engine condition, the CA50 location was strongly correlated at all conditions. This paper also includes detailed insight into particulate spectra obtained for all six fuels. Transient engine operation over a driving schedule was characterized with the engine-in-the-loop setup. The use of alternative fuels caused more aggressive cyber-driver behavior as a reaction to their lower energy densities. Different fueling histories were recorded with the alternative fuels and led to marked changes in instantaneous emissions traces. In particular, spikes of particulate emission in the exhaust that typically occur at accelerator tip-in were reduced with biodiesel, while extended high load operation was observed in order to follow the demanded vehicle velocity trace and led to higher NO. Cumulative results over the complete FTP 75 driving schedule indicate that transient engine operation reduces the particulate matter benefits of the alternative fuels. JP8 and S8 show slight NO emission benefits with biodiesel showing slightly worse NO emission when compared to steady state. The more aggressive driver behavior led to worse fuel economy. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Aromatic contents; Baseline calibration; Biodiesel blends; Combustion characteristics; Combustion phasing; Driver behavior; Engine conditions; Engine operations; Fuel energy; Fuel properties; High load; Ignition delays; Lower energies; NO emissions; Operating condition; Particulate Matter; Particulate size; Physical and chemical properties; Potential problems; Steady and transient; Steady state; Synthetic jets; Vehicle velocity; Aromatic compounds; Biodiesel; Calibration; Chemical properties; Diesel fuels; Engines; Fuel economy; Ignition; Jet fuel; Oxygenation; Alternative fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863938149

In 2008/2009, we surveyed Nevada ranchers and farmers to assess their climate change-related beliefs, and risk perceptions, political orientations, and socioeconomic characteristics. Ranchers' and farmers' sensitivity to climate change was measured through estimating the proportion of their household income originating from highly scarce water-dependent agriculture to the total income. Adaptive capacity was measured as a combination of the Social Status Index and the Poverty Index. Utilizing water availability and use, and population distribution GIS databases; we assessed water resource vulnerability in Nevada by zip code as an indicator of physical vulnerability to climate change. We performed correlation tests and multiple regression analyses to examine the impact of vulnerability and its three distinct components on risk perception. We find that vulnerability is not a significant determinant of risk perception. Physical vulnerability alone also does not impact risk perception. Both sensitivity and adaptive capacity increase risk perception. While age is not a significant determinant of it, gender plays an important role in shaping risk perception. Yet, general beliefs such as political orientations and climate change-specific beliefs such as believing in the anthropogenic causes of climate change and connecting the locally observed impacts (in this case drought) to climate change are the most prominent determinants of risk perception. © 2012 Society for Risk Analysis.","Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Drought; Nevada; Physical vulnerability; Ranchers and farmers; Risk perception; Sensitivity; Vulnerability","Adaptive capacity; Nevada; Physical vulnerability; Ranchers and farmers; Sensitivity; Vulnerability; Agriculture; Climate change; Drought; Economic and social effects; Regression analysis; Water resources; Risk perception; anthropogenic effect; climate change; database; drought; GIS; household income; nature-society relations; ranching; regression analysis; risk perception; sensitivity analysis; socioeconomic impact; vulnerability; water availability; water use; adult; aged; agriculture; article; climate change; cultural anthropology; drought; female; greenhouse effect; human; male; methodology; middle aged; perception; policy; politics; public opinion; regression analysis; risk; rural population; United States; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Agriculture; Climate Change; Culture; Droughts; Female; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nevada; Perception; Politics; Public Opinion; Public Policy; Regression Analysis; Risk; Rural Population; Nevada; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862605515

Focusing on images obtained by stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, we discuss how the new high-resolution data influence the ways in which we use and interpret images in cell biology. Super-resolution images have lent support to some of our current hypotheses. But, more significantly, they have revealed unexpectedly complex processes that cannot be accounted for by the simpler models based on diffraction-limited imaging. The super-resolution imaging data challenge cell biologists to change their theoretical framework, by including, for instance, interpretations that describe multiple functions, functional errors or lack of function for cellular elements. In this context, we argue that descriptive research using super-resolution microscopy is now as necessary as hypothesis-driven research. © 2012 WILEY Periodicals, Inc..","Image interpretation; Neuroimaging; Protein cluster; STED microscopy; Super-resolution","synaptophysin; synaptosomal associated protein 25; synaptotagmin; syntaxin 1; accuracy; article; cell function; cell membrane; conceptual framework; confocal microscopy; cytology; descriptive research; electron microscopy; fluorescence microscopy; gene mutation; microscopy; molecular size; neurotransmitter release; nonhuman; protein folding; protein function; protein interaction; protein localization; protein protein interaction; stimulated emission depletion microscopy; synapse vesicle; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Microscopy; Molecular Imaging; Physical Processes; R-SNARE Proteins; Synaptosomal-Associated Protein 25; Syntaxin 1",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859856039

BHP Rod and Bar was recognized as the most important source of particulate matter (PM 10, bsp), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and sulphur dioxide (SO 2) in Newcastle before it closed in October 1999. Objective: This study investigated the impacts of the closure of a major industry, a steel works in Newcastle, on air quality in the Lower Hunter Region, New South Wales. Method: A combined three-station data set for these pollutants for 3.5 years before and after closure allowed a comparison of daily and data set averages, using both the measured data, and a Mixed Model to calculate significant changes in the time series by month. Result: PM 10 increased after BHP closure by 13.2%, an unexpected result, but the post closure data set was influenced by summer bushfires. bsp decreased by 10.2%, reflecting the reduction is emissions due to industrial burning processes. This result was verified by a separate PM 2.5 data set which showed significant reductions in elemental carbon and soil source components. SO 2 concentrations dropped by 40.2% after closure, a change which verified the importance of BHP as a source. Despite the industry being a major source of NO 2, there was no significant change of this pollutant after closure, suggesting dominance of other sources. Conclusion: Air pollution in the region is caused by different sources. Further research into the role of meteorology and quantifying changes in the range of sources is recommended.","BHP; Industry; Lower hunter; No x; Particulate matter; So 2","carbon; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; air monitoring; air pollutant; air quality; article; Australia; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental impact assessment; iron and steel industry; particulate matter; seasonal variation; soil property; summer; transition temperature; winter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865306316

Climate transition regions were observed in high cluster solutions when the matrix created from the correlation coefficients was used as input. Consequently, "" sub-precipitation regime regions"" and "" sub-climate regions"" of Turkey were demonstrated for the first time. Unlike the studies conducted in Turkey, relative humidity data was employed for cluster analysis in this study. According to the results, Turkey is composed of seven main precipitation regime regions and 16 "" sub-precipitation regime regions"" and seven main climate regions and 15 "" sub-climate regions"" . For the determination of sub-precipitation regime regions and sub-climate regions in Turkey, cluster analysis methods including Ward's Method and a neuro-fuzzy method (NFM) developed for this study were applied. The NFM was applied on iris data which is commonly used in the literature to test the performance of the cluster analysis methods. With a performance of 95.33%, the method proved to be applicable to cluster analysis problems. Moreover, stability tests performed with different number of stations revealed that the NFM developed in this study is applicable for the cluster analysis. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Climate regions; Hierarchical cluster analysis; Neuro-fuzzy clustering; Precipitation regime regions; Turkey","Analysis problems; Classical approach; Climate regions; Climate transition; Correlation coefficient; Hierarchical cluster analysis; IRIS data; Meteorological data; Neuro-fuzzy clustering; Neuro-fuzzy methods; Stability tests; Turkey; Ward's method; Hierarchical systems; Matrix algebra; Meteorology; Cluster analysis; climatic region; cluster analysis; correlation; fuzzy mathematics; hierarchical system; meteorology; precipitation (climatology); relative humidity; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862643678

Although such context-aware analysis can potentially enable a more holistic understanding of spatio-temporal processes, it is rarely documented in the scientific literature yet. In this paper we analyzed the collective human behavior in the context of the weather. We therefore explored the complex relationships between these two spatio-temporal phenomena to provide novel insights into the dynamics of urban systems. Aggregated mobile phone data, which served as a proxy for collective human behavior, was linked with the weather data from climate stations in the case study area, the city of Udine, Northern Italy. To identify and characterize potential patterns within the weather-human relationships, we developed a hybrid approach which integrates several spatio-temporal statistical analysis methods. Thereby we show that explanatory factor analysis, when applied to a number of meteorological variables, can be used to differentiate between normal and adverse weather conditions. Further, we measured the strength of the relationship between the 'global' adverse weather conditions and the spatially explicit effective variations in user-generated mobile network traffic for three distinct periods using the Maximal Information Coefficient (MIC). The analyses result in three spatially referenced maps of MICs which reveal interesting insights into collective human dynamics in the context of weather, but also initiate several new scientific challenges. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Collective sensing; Context awareness; Environmental monitoring; Geographic information science; Human-environmental interaction; Maximal information coefficient; Sensor data; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Ubiquitous sensing; Urban dynamics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864353445

Two types of geoengineering activities that have been proposed are: carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR), which removes CO2 from the atmosphere, and solar radiation management (SRM, or sunlight reflection methods), which reflects a small percentage of sunlight back into space to offset warming from greenhouse gases (GHGs). Current research suggests that SRM or CDR might diminish the impacts of climate change on ecosystems by reducing changes in temperature and precipitation. However, sudden cessation of SRM would exacerbate the climate effects on ecosystems, and some CDR might interfere with oceanic and terrestrial ecosystem processes. The many risks and uncertainties associated with these new kinds of purposeful perturbations to the Earth system are not well understood and require cautious and comprehensive research. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2012.","Carbon dioxide removal; Climate change; Ecosystems; Geoengineering; Solar radiation management","carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; ecological impact; ecosystem function; ecosystem structure; literature review; risk assessment; solar radiation; uncertainty analysis; warming; chemistry; climate change; ecosystem; environment; environmental protection; methodology; review; sunlight; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environment; Sunlight",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863664137

The local structure of graphene is modeled by a planar hydrocarbon cluster (C 24H 12). Systematic treatment of the electron correlations and the possibility to study excited states allow us to reproduce the potential energy curves for different electronic configurations of Co. We find that upon approaching the surface, the ground-state configuration of Co undergoes several transitions, giving rise to two stable states. The first corresponds to the physisorption of the adatom in the high-spin 3d74s2 (S=3/2) configuration, while the second results from the chemical bonding formed by strong orbital hybridization, leading to the low-spin 3d9 (S=1/2) state. Due to the instability of the 3d9 configuration, the adsorption energy of Co is small in both cases and does not exceed 0.35 eV. We analyze the obtained results in terms of a simple model Hamiltonian that involves Coulomb repulsion (U) and exchange coupling (J) parameters for the 3d shell of Co, which we estimate from first-principles calculations. We show that while the exchange interaction remains constant upon adsorption (1.1 eV), the Coulomb repulsion significantly reduces for decreasing distances (from 5.3 to 2.6±0.2 eV). The screening of U favors higher occupations of the 3d shell and thus is largely responsible for the interconfigurational transitions of Co. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the approaches that are based on density functional theory with respect to transition metal atoms on graphene, and we conclude that a proper account of the electron correlations is crucial for the description of adsorption in such systems. © 2012 American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865079302

We quantified plant and soil carbon (C) responses to this new fire regime and assessed interactions between changes in fire regime and changes in precipitation regime predicted by some climate models (specifically, an earlier monsoon rain season). We hypothesized that soil C pools and carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux rates would decrease initially following stand-replacing fires (due to low plant C inputs and the loss of the soil surficial organic (O) horizon), but then increase with time-after-fire (as plant C inputs increase). Water availability often limits soil biological activity in these forests, but we predicted that low soil C availability following fire would constrain soil CO2 efflux responses to precipitation. In a series of sites with histories of stand-replacing fires that burned between 2 and 34 years prior to sampling, burned patches had lower soil C pools and fluxes than adjacent unburned patches, but there was no evidence of a trend with time-after-fire. Burned forests had 7,500 g C m-2 less live plant biomass C (P &lt; 0. 001), 1,600 g C m-2 less soil total C (P &lt; 0. 001) and 90 g C m-2 less soil labile C (P &lt; 0. 001) than unburned forests. Lower soil labile C in burned patches was due to both a loss of O horizon mass with fire and lower labile C concentrations (g labile C kg-1 soil total C) in the mineral soil. During the annual drought that precedes summer monsoon rains, both burned and unburned patches had soil CO2 efflux rates ranging from 0. 9 to 1. 1 g CO2-C m-2 day-1. During the monsoon season, soil CO2 efflux in unburned patches increased to approximately 4. 8 g CO2-C m-2 day-1 and rates in paired burned patches (3. 4 g CO2-C m-2 day-1) were lower (P &lt; 0. 001). We also used field irrigation to experimentally create an earlier and longer monsoon season, and soil CO2 efflux rates at both burned and unburned plots increased initially in response to watering, but decreased to below control (plots without irrigation) rates within weeks.

Up to now the BEV's bottleneck is the battery system which is able to store only a very limited amount of energy on board. Hence, it is necessary to use the rare energy in the most efficient way. In this work a simple method is presented to reduce the electric losses during operation through an adaptive control of the HVAC power input, depending on the driving situation. It is shown that the proposed method enables an energy saving and therefore a range extension about more than 1% without any additional hardware effort. This basically does not seem to be much but can be an important step contributing to BEVs' final breakthrough. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

We developed a direct method to follow RNA synthesis in real time based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with a fluorophore labeled hairpin-DNA, i.e. gold-nanobeacon (Au-nanobeacon). Under hairpin configuration, proximity to gold nanoparticles leads to fluorescence quenching; hybridization to a complementary target restores fluorescence emission due to the Au-nanobeacons' conformational reorganization that causes the fluorophore and the AuNP to part from each other, yielding a quantitative response. With this reporter Au-nanobeacon we were able to measure the rate of in vitro RNA synthesis (~10.3. fmol of RNA per minute). Then, we designed a second Au-nanobeacon targeting the promoter sequence (inhibitor) so as to inhibit transcription whilst simultaneously monitor the number of promoters being silenced. Using the two Au-nanobeacons in the same reaction mixture, we are capable of quantitatively assess in real time the synthesis of RNA and the level of inhibition.The biosensor concept can easily be extended and adapted to situations when real-time quantitative assessment of RNA synthesis and determination of the level of inhibition are required. In fact, this biosensor may assist the in vitro evaluation of silencing potential of a given sequence to be later used for in vivo gene silencing. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Fluorophore labeled hairpin-DNA; Gold nanoparticles; Gold-nanobecons; Inhibition of transcription; RNA synthesis","Direct method; Fluorescence emission; Fluorescence quenching; Functionalized; Gene silencing; Gold nanoparticle; Gold Nanoparticles; Gold-nanobecons; In-vitro; In-vitro evaluation; In-vivo; Promoter sequences; Quantitative assessments; Reaction mixture; Real time; Real time monitoring; RNA synthesis; Biosensors; Fluorescence; Fluorophores; Genetic engineering; Gold; Metal nanoparticles; Synthesis (chemical); Transcription; RNA; gold nanoparticle; article; biosensor; controlled study; DNA hairpin; DNA hybridization; enzyme inhibition; gene silencing; gold nanobeacon; in vitro study; molecular beacon; promoter region; quantitative analysis; RNA sequence; RNA synthesis; Biosensing Techniques; Fluorescence; Gene Silencing; Gold; Metal Nanoparticles; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; RNA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861653867

The Indian state promotes projects on plants such as Jatropha for biodiesel. In these policies, mitigation of climate change is only one aim of the Indian state. Supply with Indian-made fuel is supposed to enhance economic growth, air pollution should be diminished and poor rural women should be given income opportunities. The national policy for biodiesel from 2008 states that till 2017 20% of the diesel used in India should come from plants, grown and transesterized in India. Enormous efforts from the Indian states and private companies will be necessary. The resources needed for this kind of production - land, water and human work - are limited. NGOs as well as state institutions debate whether the production and use of biofuel can ever be sustainable. The contested policies on biofuel in India are therefore one example of debates on sustainability and the underlying values and ideas about a satisfying livelihood for the Indian people. From a feminist-environmentalist perspective the questions to be asked are not only in which ways men and women are effected differently by, for example, Jatropha plantations. Rather it is important to ask in what ways sustainability is conceptualized and how nature as well as gender features in these concepts. The way we think about material resources such as land, water and human resources, e.g. female reproductive work, show some parallels. Both kinds of resources are seldom thought of as valuable just because they sustain human life, but rather, only if and when they can be monetarized as commodity. In order to figure out ways to provide sustainable livelihoods for everyone, we need to change the way nature and gender are conceptualized in strategies to cope with the ecological crisis. This includes a change of ethics towards a focus on what is necessary for the 'Good Life'. The paper will analyze the concepts of sustainability in Indian biofuel policies from a feminist-environmentalist perspective as well as show an alternative way of thinking about ecology and gender. © 2012 Wageningen Academic Publishers.

This study evaluates the environmental damages attributed to different alternatives for screenhouse as well as open-field cropping systems for green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) during their life cycle by applying the life cycle analysis (LCA) in an inland area of the province of Granada, Spain, during two spring-autumn crop cycles (2008 and 2009). The aim of this evaluation was to select and improve the cultivation techniques, equipment, and structures by trying to minimize their impact on the surroundings and natural resources. The green bean cropping systems analysed were: a screenhouse (S), a screenhouse equipped with a misting system (SM), and a control (open-field, OF). The stages considered in the LCA study were the infrastructure and the crop cycle. The OF treatment showed the greatest environmental impact in most categories due to its lower yields. Under our experimental conditions, the misting system was justified (from the environmental standpoint) providing the yields were higher than those obtained without the misting (S). All the treatments in 2009 produced a greater impact than in 2008 due to climatic conditions that sharply reduced production. The LCA study has shown the importance of reaching a minimum yield to justify the environmental impact of different treatments. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A better understanding of problems related to fuel cells applied to aeronautics is sought by the European Commission (EC) funded project Environmentally Friendly Inter-City Aircraft Powered by Fuel Cells (ENFlCA-FC). The main objective of the ENFICA-FC project was to develop and validate the use of a fuel cell-based power system for the propulsion of more-electric/all-electric aircraft. The fuel cell system was installed in the light sport aircraft Rapid 200, which was flight and performance tested. One of the key items under investigation is the simulation of the cooling system and the evaluation of fuel cell temperature. The polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) is considered to be the best candidate for the fuel cell vehicle because it has high power density, solid membrane electrolyte, and as it operates at low temperatures, it has a fast start-up. However, to generate a reliable and efficient power response and to prevent membrane degradation or damage with hydrogen and oxygen depletion, a sophisticated control technique becomes vitally important. In particular, as the ionic conduction of the polymeric membrane is a function of its degree of humidification, the stack temperature has to be carefully controlled to avoid phenomena of water evaporation, causing an increase of ohmic drop and a decrease of stack performances. The output voltage and hence the power of the fuel cell system is affected considerably by the change of the stack temperature. A simplified fluid-dynamic model has been developed and validated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis and it is used to compute the air flow to the fuel cell heat-exchanger inlet. Propeller effects are included referring to an optimal propeller specifically designed for the ENFICA-FC project.

It starts off from two emerging strands in the international climate policy debate - i.e. (1) the notion that climate change action may be driven by other development priorities; and (2) the growing skepticism regarding the UN system's capacity to deliver effective climate policies - and raises the broader question as to whether development-driven climate action could be incentivized through an internationally agreed upon mechanism within UNFCCC. The concrete objective of the project is to identify the opportunities and challenges of a future Sustainable Development - Policies and Measures (SD-PAM) mechanism, the latter being a precursor for National Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMA). To achieve this objective the project holds the following traits. First, it introduces intervention theory as the guiding theoretical framework for all empirical studies. Second, it combines an analysis of the suggested SD-PAM mechanism with selected case studies of potential national SD-PAM projects in Brazil (bio-energy), China (transportation and biogas production) and Mozambique (agriculture).

Box 56, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand","Ocean Acidification (OA) has been an important research topic for a decade. Scientists have focused on how the predicted 56% decline in the seawater carbonate ion (CO 3 2-) concentration will dramatically impair the ability of calcifiers, ranging from coccolithophores to shellfish, to form calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) structures, and the implications of the reduced carbonate saturation state (Ω) for increased dissolution of such structures. However, many published OA studies have overlooked a fundamental issue: most calcifying organisms do not rely on carbonate from seawater to calcify; they use either bicarbonate (HCO 3 -) or metabolically-produced CO 2. The ability of important primary (corals, coralline seaweeds, and coccolithophores) and secondary (mollusks) producers to modify their local carbonate chemistry suggests that the primary threat to them from OA is by dissolution rather than impaired calcification. Here, we draw on calcification research from an era before OA and combine it with recent studies that question the source of the carbonate ion, to provide new insights into how OA might affect calcifying organisms. Organismal modification of local carbonate chemistry may enable some calcifiers to successfully form calcareous structures despite OA. © 2012 Phycological Society of America.","Calcification; Carbonate chemistry; Carbonic anhydrase; Coccolithophores; Coralline macroalgae; Corals; Invertebrate; Molluscs; Ocean acidification; Physiological chemistry","Anthozoa; Haptophyceae; Invertebrata; Mollusca",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864522607

It aims to develop a spatial planning framework in which the properties of climate adaptation and spatial planning are unified. Design/methodology/approach – Adaptive and dynamical approaches in spatial planning literature are studied and climate adaptation properties are defined in a way they can be used in a spatial planning framework. The climate adaptation properties and spatial planning features are aggregated in coherent groups and used to construct the spatial planning framework, which subsequently has been tested to design a climate adaptive region. Findings – The paper concludes that the majority of spatial planning methods do not include adaptive or dynamic strategies derived from complex adaptive systems theory, such as adaptive capacity or vulnerability. If these complex adaptive systems properties are spatially defined and aggregated in a coherent set of spatial groups, they can form a spatial planning framework for climate adaptation. Each of these groups has a specific time dimension and can be linked to a specific spatial planning “layer”. The set of (five) layers form the spatial planning framework, which can be used as a methodology to design a climate adaptive region. Originality/value – Previous research did not connect the complex issue of climate change with spatial planning. Many frameworks are developed in climate change research but are generally not aiming to meet the needs of spatial planning. This article forms the first attempt to develop a spatial planning framework, in which non-linear and dynamical processes, such as climate adaptation, is included. © 2012, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Adaptive planning; Climate adaptation; Climate change; Climatology; Design; Layer approach","adaptive management; climate change; design; planning method; research work; spatial planning; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84872607613

To assess the relevance of the modifying areal unit problem (MAUP), we investigated as to how a change in the data resolution regarding both soil and land use data influences the results obtained for different land use indicators. For the assessment we use the example of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculturally used organic soils (mainly fens and bogs). Although less than 5 % of the German agricultural area in use is located on organic soils, the drainage of these areas to enable their agricultural utilization causes roughly 37 % of the GHG emissions of the German agricultural sector. The abandonment of the cultivation and rewetting of organic soils would be an effective policy to reduce national GHG emissions. To assess the abatement costs, it is essential to know which commodities, and at what quantities, are actually produced on this land. Furthermore, in order to limit windfall profits, information on the differences of the profitability among farms are needed. However, high-resolution data regarding land use and soil characteristics are often not available, and their generation is costly or the access is strictly limited because of legal constraints. Therefore, in this paper, we analyse how indicators for land use on organic soils respond to changes in the spatial aggregation of the data. In Germany, organic soils are predominantly used for forage cropping. Marked differences between the various regions of Germany are apparent with respect to the dynamics and the intensity of land use. Data resolution mainly impairs the derived extent of agriculturally used peatland and the observed intensity gradient, while its impact on the average value for the investigated set of land-use indicators is generally minor. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","Agriculture; Land use intensity; Modifiable areal unit problem; Peatland","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Cultivation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Profitability; Soils; Wetlands; Agricultural land use; Agricultural sector; High resolution data; Intensity gradients; Modifiable areal unit problem; Peatland; Soil characteristics; Spatial aggregation; Land use; soil organic matter; carbon dioxide; abatement cost; agricultural soil; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; land use; peatland; soil organic matter; agricultural land; arable land; Article; carbon footprint; forage; forest; Germany; grassland; greenhouse gas; land use; peatland; rural area; soil; stocking density; swamp; wetland; agriculture; article; audiovisual equipment; carbon footprint; chemistry; environmental monitoring; methodology; soil; standard; Germany; Agriculture; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Footprint; Environmental Monitoring; Germany; Maps as Topic; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866786592

The concurrent steady-state generation of radical ions in the microgap formed between a SECM probe and a transparent microsubstrate provides a distance-dependent ECL signal that can provide information about the kinetics, stability, and mechanism of the light emission process. In the present study, the ECL emission from rubrene and [Ru(bpy) 3] 2+ was used to model the system by carrying out experiments with the SECM and light-detecting apparatus inside an inert atmosphere box. We studied the influence of the distance between the two electrodes, d, and the annihilation kinetics on the ECL light emission profiles under steady-state conditions, as well as the ECL profiles when carrying out cyclic voltammetry (CV) at a fixed d. Experimental results are compared to simulated results obtained through commercial finite element method software. The light produced by annihilation of the ions was a function of d; stronger light was observed at smaller d. The distance dependence of the ECL emission allows the construction of light approach curves in a similar fashion as with the tip currents in the feedback mode of SECM. These ECL approach curves provide an additional channel to describe the reaction kinetics that lead to ECL; good agreement was found between the ECL approach curve emission profile and the simulated results for a fast, diffusion-limited second-order annihilation process (k ann &gt; 10 7 M -1 s -1). In the CV mode at fixed distance, the ECL emission of rubrene showed two distinct signals at different potentials when fixing the substrate to generate the radical cation and scanning the tip to generate the radical anion. The first signal (pre-emission) corresponded to an emission well before reaching the generation of the radical anion and was more intense on Au than on Pt. The second ECL signal showed the expected steady-state behavior from the second-order annihilation reaction and agreed well with the simulation. A comparison of the emission obtained with rubrene and [Ru(bpy) 3] 2+ to test the direct formation of lower energy triplets directly at the electrode showed that triplets are not the cause of the pre-emission observed. Wavelength selection experiments for the rubrene system showed that the pre-emission ECL signal also appeared slightly red-shifted with respect to the main luminophore emission; a possible explanation for this phenomenon is inverse photoemission, where the injection of highly energetic holes by the oxidized species into the negatively biased tip electrode causes emission of states in the metal that appear at a different wavelength than the singlet emission from the ECL luminophore. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Annihilation kinetics; Annihilation process; Annihilation reactions; Approach curve; C-V mode; Commercial finite element method software; Diffusion limited; Electrogenerated chemiluminescence; Emission process; Emission profile; Energetic hole; Feedback mode; Inert atmospheres; Inverse photoemission; Lower energies; Luminophores; Micro gaps; Radical anions; Radical cations; Radical ions; Red-shifted; Ru(bpy); Rubrenes; Scanning electrochemical microscopy; Second orders; Simulated results; Steady-state behaviors; Steady-state condition; Wavelength selection; Chemiluminescence; Cyclic voltammetry; Experiments; Free radical reactions; Ions; Kinetics; Light emission; Platinum; Reaction kinetics; Scanning electron microscopy; Scanning probe microscopy; Analytic equipment; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative; rubrene; tris(2,2' bipyridine)ruthenium; unclassified drug; article; chemical analysis; chemical reaction kinetics; chemoluminescence; cyclic potentiometry; electrochemistry; electrode; energy transfer; finite element analysis; scanning electrochemical microscopy; Ions; Luminescence; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Naphthacenes; Organometallic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861890016

Thus, the effects of two commercial soil additives (CSA), a hydrophilic polymer mixed with volcanic rock flour and bentonite (a-CSA), and digester solids from biogas plants enriched with humic acids and bentonite (b-CSA), on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, plant yields and root biomass were assessed after cultivating perennial crops (Dactylis glomerata L.) in monoculture and Helianthus annuus L.- Brassica napus L. in crop rotation systems. The CSA were incorporated into the top 20 cm soil depth using a rotary spader. The results indicated that a-CSA led to a significant increase in plant yield during the first year, and improved root biomass in the following year. As a result, SOC stocks increased, especially in the 0-10 cm soil layer. No significant sequestration of additional SOC was observed on b-CSA-amended plots at the end of both years. Bulk density values decreased in all treatments under the monoculture system. It can be concluded that application of a-CSA enhanced soil water availability for plant uptake and consequently promoted plant growth and organic carbon sequestration. The relative enrichment of organic matter without effects on water-holding capacities of b-CSA treatments suggested that it was not suitable for rapid land reclamation. © 2012 Soil Science Society of China.","Bulk density; Organic C inputs; Polyacrylate; Soil organic carbon; Water-holding capacity","bulk density; carbon sequestration; crop rotation; crop yield; cultivation; disturbance; environmental restoration; grass; growth; land reclamation; lignite; mine; monoculture; organic carbon; phytomass; polymer; soil nutrient; soil organic matter; soil water; substrate; volcanic rock; water availability; water uptake; Germany; Lusatia; Brassica napus; Dactylis; Dactylis glomerata; Helianthus annuus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860457420

It makes an attempt to assess the order of magnitude of the increased consumptive water use involved and analyses the implications as seen from two parallel perspectives; the global perspective of human development within a ""safe operating space"" with regard to the definition of the Planetary Boundary for freshwater; and the social-ecological implications at the regional river basin scale in terms of sharpening water shortages and threats to aquatic ecosystems. The paper shows that the consumptive water use involved in the dual task would both transgress the proposed planetary boundary range for global consumptive freshwater use and would further exacerbate already severe river depletion, causing societal problems related to water shortage and water allocation. Thus, strategies to rely on sequestration of CO2 as a mitigation strategy must recognize the high freshwater costs involved, implying that the key climate mitigation strategy must be to reduce emissions.

Methodology is presented relevant to VOI CBCT image acquisition and reconstruction. Sample image data are given to demonstrate and compare two approaches to minimizing artifacts arising from reconstruction with truncated projections. Dosimetric measurements quantify the potential dose reduction of VOI acquisition relative to full-field CBCT. The dependence of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) on VOI dimension is investigated. Methods: A paradigm is presented linking the treatment planning process with the imaging technique, allowing definition of an imaging VOI to be tailored to the geometry of the patient. Missing data in truncated projection images are completed using a priori information in the form of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) generated from the planning CT set. This method is compared to a simpler technique of extrapolating truncated projection data prior to reconstruction. The utility of these approaches is shown through imaging of a geometric phantom and the head-and-neck section of a lamb. The total scatter factor of the 2.35 MVcarbon beam on field size is measured and compared to a standard therapeutic beam to estimate the comparative dose reduction inside the VOI. Thermoluminescent dosimeters and Gafchromic film measurements are used to compare the imaging dose distributions for the 2.35 MVcarbon beam between VOI and full-field techniques. The dependence of CNR on VOI dimension is measured for VOIs ranging from 4 to 15 cm diameter. Results: Without compensating for missing data outside of truncated projections prior to reconstruction, pronounced boundary artifacts are present, in three dimensions, within 2-3 cm of the edges of the VOI. These artifacts, as well as cupping inside the VOI, can be reduced substantially using either the DRR filling or extrapolation techniques presented. Compared to 6 MV, the 2.35 MVcarbon beam shows a substantially greater dependence of total scatter factor on field size, indicating a comparative advantage of the VOI approach when combined with the low-Z target beam. Dosimetric measurements in the anthropomorphic head phantom demonstrate a dose reduction by up to 15 and 75 inside and outside of the VOI, respectively, compared to full-field imaging. For the 2.35 MVcarbon beam, CNR was shown to be approximately invariant with VOI dimension for bone and lung objects. Conclusions: The low-Z target, VOI CBCT technique appears to be feasible and combines the desirable characteristics of the low-Z target beam with regard to CNR, with the capacity to localize the imaging dose to the anatomy relevant to the image guidance task. © 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.","carbon; cone beam CT; low-Z target; region-of-interest; volume-of-interest","Carbon; Dosimetry; Extrapolation; Image reconstruction; Image segmentation; Patient treatment; Phantoms; Comparative advantage; Cone-beam CT; Contrast to noise ratio; Digitally reconstructed radiographs; Extrapolation techniques; Region of interest; Thermoluminescent dosimeters; Volume of interest; Computerized tomography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864184347

Methods: The electron beam energy was reduced to 2.35 MeV in a Varian 21EX linear accelerator containing a 7.6 mm thick carbon x‐ray target. Arbitrary imaging volumes were defined in the planning system to produce dynamic MLC sequences capable of tracking off‐axis VOIs in phantoms. To reduce truncation artefacts, missing data in projection images were completed using a priori DRR information from the planning CT set. The feasibility of the approach was shown through imaging of an anthropomorphic phantom and the head‐and‐neck section of a lamb. TLD800 and EBT2 radiochromic film measurements were used to compare the VOI dose distributions with those for full‐field techniques. CNR was measured for VOIs ranging from 4 to 15 cm diameter. Results: The 2.35 MV/Carbon beam provides favorable CNR characteristics, although marked boundary and cupping artefacts arise due to truncation of projection data. These artefacts are largely eliminated using the DRR filling technique. Imaging dose was reduced by 5–10% and 75% inside and outside of the VOI, respectively, compared to full‐field imaging for a cranial VOI. For the 2.35 MV/Carbon beam, CNR was shown to be approximately invariant with VOI dimension for bone and lung objects. This indicates that the advantage of the VOI approach with the low‐Z target beam is substantial imaging dose reduction, not improvement of image quality. Conclusions: VOI CBCT using a 2.35 MV/Carbon beam is a feasible technique whereby a chosen imaging volume can be defined in the planning system and tracked during acquisition. The novel x‐ray beam affords good CNR characteristics while imaging dose is localized to the chosen VOI.

The effectiveness of climate mitigation through forest carbon sequestration depends on understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of land-cover and land-use change (LCLUC). Few studies project future LCLUC effects on forest carbon sequestration, and even fewer examine the resulting consequences for forest connectivity and wildlife habitat. First, we asked what forest-relevant climate mitigation strategies have been identified in US state climate mitigation plans, and do they consider implications for wildlife habitat and forest connectivity? Second, for Wisconsin, a partially forested state, what are the effects of three future LCLUC scenarios on afforestation, forest loss, carbon sequestration and storage, forest connectivity, and wildlife habitat? The 35 US states with climate mitigation plans recommended woody biomass for biofuels or energy production (27 states), forest loss prevention (24 states), and afforestation (17 states). Most plans (24 states) anticipated positive wildlife impacts while 7 plans indicated potential negative wildlife impacts from biomass energy; only 3 plans anticipated tradeoffs among afforestation and energy production. A LCLUC model for Wisconsin revealed substantial local variation in potential afforestation and forest loss, carbon sequestration, and wildlife habitat across LCLUC scenarios that range from no change in current conditions (Static Forest) to maximum afforestation potential (All Forest). Projected increases in forest cover under the Dynamic Forest scenario equated to 0.41. TgC sequestered per year, or 1.3% of Wisconsin's emissions of 33. TgC per year. Potential increases in core forest area and connectivity would increase habitat for 60 forest-associated species of greatest conservation need, but may decrease habitat for 48 grassland-associated species of greatest conservation need. These results indicate the importance of synergistic evaluation of multiple policy goals and LCLUC scenarios to examine tradeoffs and spatial dynamics of climate change mitigation strategies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon sequestration; Climate mitigation; Environmental policy; Land-cover change","afforestation; article; biofuel production; biomass; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; climate; climate change; energy resource; environmental planning; forest; forest connectivity; forest cover; forest dynamics; forest loss; forest management; forest structure; government; grassland; habitat; land use; land use change; policy; priority journal; species conservation; theoretical model; United States; wildlife conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861815509

While the per-hectare carbon capture potential of rangelands is less than either cropland or forests, existing research suggests modest changes in carbon storage on rangelands can potentially alter the global carbon cycle. This paper examines the potential firm-level revenues from voluntary carbon offset programs, such as the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) Rangeland Soil Carbon Offset program. We estimate revenues for short-term voluntary offsets given historical prices and prices projected with potential cap-and-trade legislation. We also estimate revenues assuming 100-yr offsets are required to meet international sequestration standards. Simulation results indicate a relatively wide range of modest revenues from recent CCX contracts and carbon prices. The analysis suggests that recent carbon prices or low-end projected prices from cap-and-trade legislation are not likely to encourage producer participation. Medium and high carbon price projections for cap-and-trade legislation may make carbon sequestration a more attractive option for rangeland managers, but given potential requirements for projects to meet international guidelines for greenhouse gas offset projects, many issues remain before range managers may be interested in carbon sequestration as an enterprise.","cap-and-trade; carbon storage; economic incentives; revenue","agricultural land; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; climate change; forest ecosystem; greenhouse gas; legislative implementation; numerical model; price dynamics; rangeland; soil carbon; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865244113

The adjustment in international trade will mitigate the impact on coal industry employment but will also reverse some of the reduction in global emissions. This paper quantifies the impact of restrictions on coal consumption in the United States and several other large countries on global coal consumption, trade, and industry employment. The impact calculations are based on an econometric model of the international coal market. The parameters of the model are fitted to panel data on coal consumption and production in 53 countries. © 2011.","Coal; Econometric analysis; Environmental policy; International trade","Air pollutants; Coal consumption; Coal exports; Coal markets; Coal trade; Econometric analysis; Econometric model; Environmental policy; Foreign markets; Global emissions; Panel data; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Environmental protection; International trade; Coal industry; carbon dioxide; coal; coal industry; coal production; econometrics; economic impact; emission control; employment; energy use; international trade; mitigation; panel data; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862210996

The ATP-dependent Lon protease is a key component of protein quality control that is highly conserved across the kingdoms of living organisms. Major advancements have been made in bacteria and in non-plant organisms to understand the role of Lon in protection against protein oxidation, ageing and neurodegenerative diseases. This review presents the progress currently made in plants. The Lon gene family in Arabidopsis consists of four members that produce distinct protein isoforms localized in several organelles. Lon1 and Lon4 that potentially originate from a recent gene duplication event are dual-targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts through distinct mechanisms revealing divergent evolution. Arabidopsis mutant analysis showed that mitochondria and peroxisomes biogenesis or maintenance of function is modulated by Lon1 and Lon2, respectively. Consequently, the lack of Lon selective proteolysis leading to growth retardation and impaired seedling establishment can be attributed to defects in the oil reserve mobilization pathway. The current progress in Arabidopsis research uncovers the role of Lon in the proteome homeostasis of plant organelles and stimulates biotechnology scenarios of plant tolerance against harsh abiotic conditions because of climate instability. © Physiologia Plantarum 2011.",,"Arabidopsis protein; endopeptidase La; Lon4 protein, Arabidopsis; serine proteinase; Arabidopsis; chloroplast; enzymology; genetics; germination; metabolism; mitochondrion; molecular evolution; oxidation reduction reaction; peroxisome; physiology; plant physiology; plant seed; protein degradation; protein transport; review; seedling; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Chloroplasts; Evolution, Molecular; Germination; Mitochondria; Oxidation-Reduction; Peroxisomes; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Protease La; Protein Transport; Proteolysis; Seedling; Seeds; Serine Endopeptidases; Arabidopsis; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859875666

The hybrid model represented the dynamics of substrates and enzymes using a continuum representation and the dynamics of the cells were modeled individually. Individual-based biological model allowed us to explicitly simulate microbial diversity, and to model cell physiology as regulated via optimal allocation of cellular resources to enzyme synthesis, control of growth rate by protein synthesis capacity, and shifts to dormancy. This model was developed to study how microbial community functioning is influenced by local environmental conditions in heterogeneous media such as soil and by the functional attributes of individual microbes. Microbial community dynamics were simulated at two spatial scales: micro-pores that resemble 6-20-μm size portions of the soil physical structure and in 111-μm size soil aggregates with a random pore structure. Different strategies for acquisition of carbon from polymeric cellulose were investigated. Bacteria that express membrane-associated hydrolase had different growth and survival dynamics in soil pores than bacteria that release extracellular hydrolases. The kinetic differences suggested different functional niches for these two microbe types in cellulose utilization. Our model predicted an emergent behavior in which co-existence of membrane-associated hydrolase and extracellular hydrolases releasing organisms led to higher cellulose utilization efficiency and reduced stochasticity. Our analysis indicated that their co-existence mutually benefits these organisms, where basal cellulose degradation activity by membrane-associated hydrolase-expressing cells shortened the soluble hydrolase buildup time and, when enzyme buildup allowed for cellulose degradation to be fast enough to sustain exponential growth, all the organisms in the community shared the soluble carbon product and grew together. Although pore geometry affected the kinetics of cellulose degradation, the patterns observed for the bacterial community dynamics in the 6-20 μm-sized micro-pores were relevant to the dynamics in the more complex 111-μm-sized porous soil aggregates, implying that micro-scale studies can be useful approximations to aggregate scale studies when local effects on microbial dynamics are studied. As shown with examples in this study, various functional niches of the bacterial communities can be investigated using complex predictive mathematical models where the role of key environmental aspects such as the heterogeneous three-dimensional structure, functional niches of the community members, and environmental biochemical processes are directly connected to microbial metabolism and maintenance in an integrated model. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"carbon; cellulose; hydrolase; article; bacterium; biological model; chemistry; enzyme specificity; growth, development and aging; hydrolysis; kinetics; metabolism; microbiology; soil; Bacteria; Carbon; Cellulose; Hydrolases; Hydrolysis; Kinetics; Models, Biological; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Substrate Specificity; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864377231

Much of the research in this area has focused on predicting the areas where conditions will be suitable for the species in future, and thus the potential distribution of the species. However, it is equally important to predict the relative abilities of species to migrate into new suitable areas as conditions shift, while accounting for dynamic processes, such as dispersal, maturation, mortality, and reproduction, as well as landscape characteristics, such as level of habitat fragmentation and connectivity. In this study, we developed a spatially explicit individual-based model that addresses these factors. As a motivating case study, we based aspects of the model on southwest Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot, but stress that the results obtained are generalizable beyond this region. Using the model, we enhanced current understanding of climate change impacts by investigating how and to what extent the functional traits of plant species affect their ability to move with climate change across landscapes with various levels of fragmentation. We also tested the efficacy of strategic restoration, such as planting corridors to increase connectivity among fragments. We found that even if the landscape is fully intact, only an average of 34.2% of all simulated functional groups had a good chance of successfully tracking climate change. However, our study highlights the power of strategic restoration as a tool for increasing species persistence. Corridors linking fragments increased species persistence rates by up to 24%. The lowest persistence rates were found for trees, a functional group with high dispersal but also long generation times. Our results indicate that for trees intervention techniques, such as assisted migration might be required to prevent species losses. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Assisted migration; Corridors; Dynamic model; Functional traits; Individual-based; Intervention ecology; Spatially-explicit; Species distribution","climate change; functional group; habitat corridor; habitat fragmentation; habitat restoration; modeling; spatial distribution; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860672161

In these areas, livestock performance is generally lower than those obtained in Western Europe and North America. Although many factors can be involved, climatic factors are among the first and crucial limiting factors of the development of animal production in warm regions. In addition, global warming will further accentuate heat stress-related problems. The objective of this paper was to review the effective strategies to alleviate heat stress in the context of tropical livestock production systems. These strategies can be classified into three groups: those increasing feed intake or decreasing metabolic heat production, those enhancing heat-loss capacities, and those involving genetic selection for heat tolerance. Under heat stress, improved production should be possible through modifications of diet composition that either promotes a higher intake or compensates the low feed consumption. In addition, altering feeding management such as a change in feeding time and/or frequency, are efficient tools to avoid excessive heat load and improve survival rate, especially in poultry. Methods to enhance heat exchange between the environment and the animal and those changing the environment to prevent or limit heat stress can be used to improve performance under hot climatic conditions. Although differences in thermal tolerance exist between livestock species (ruminants > monogastrics), there are also large differences between breeds of a species and within each breed. Consequently, the opportunity may exist to improve thermal tolerance of the animals using genetic tools. However, further research is required to quantify the genetic antagonism between adaptation and production traits to evaluate the potential selection response. With the development of molecular biotechnologies, new opportunities are available to characterize gene expression and identify key cellular responses to heat stress. These new tools will enable scientists to improve the accuracy and the efficiency of selection for heat tolerance. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression and thermal imprinting of the genome could also be an efficient method to improve thermal tolerance. Such techniques (e.g. perinatal heat acclimation) are currently being experimented in chicken. © 2012 The Animal Consortium.","cooling; genetic; heat stress; livestock animals; nutrition","adaptation; animal; animal husbandry; climate; conference paper; developing country; food intake; genetic selection; genetics; heat; heat injury; livestock; methodology; physiology; poultry; species difference; thermoregulation; Adaptation, Biological; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Appetite Regulation; Body Temperature Regulation; Climate; Developing Countries; Heat Stress Disorders; Hot Temperature; Livestock; Poultry; Selection, Genetic; Species Specificity; Animalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859347573

Oversupply in the Amsterdam office market makes conversion to residential use viable. In examining converted buildings in Amsterdam and the Melbourne CBD typical attributes of converted stock can be identified to target retrofit measures. This paper seeks to focus on these initiatives. In Amsterdam five case studies were undertaken to reveal and define building attributes that explain the viability of these conversions. On the other hand, the Melbourne study was based on a database assembled containing all Melbourne CBD office building adaptations carried out between 1998 and 2008. The research analysed the conversion of office buildings and the scope for sustainable retrofit evaluating a limited number of attributes known to be important in adaptation. The outcomes of this research showed similarities and differences in scope, which are relevant to all urban areas where adaptation of office buildings can mitigate the impacts of climate change and enhance a city for another generation of citizens and users. The outcomes highlight the property attributes that explain conversion viability and that are most strongly associated with conversions. In addition the research identifies some sustainability measures that are possible with this type of stock. The paper compares and contrasts qualitative data from a small sample of buildings in Amsterdam with quantitative data from a census of all change of use adaptations in Melbourne from 1998 to 2008.

Using an integrated global system model, we explore the roles that these land-use options can play in a global mitigation strategy to stabilize Earth's average temperature within 2°C of the preindustrial level and their impacts on agriculture. We show that an ambitious global Energy-Only climate policy that includes biofuels would likely not achieve the 2°C target. A thought-experiment where the world ideally prices land carbon fluxes combined with biofuels (Energy+Land policy) gets the world much closer. Land could become a large net carbon sink of about 178 Pg C over the 21st century with price incentives in the Energy+Land scenario. With land carbon pricing but without biofuels (a No-Biofuel scenario) the carbon sink is nearly identical to the case with biofuels, but emissions from energy are somewhat higher, thereby results in more warming. Absent such incentives, land is either a much smaller net carbon sink (+37 Pg C - Energy-Only policy) or a net source (-21 Pg C - No-Policy). The significant trade-off with this integrated land-use approach is that prices for agricultural products rise substantially because of mitigation costs borne by the sector and higher land prices. Share of income spent on food for wealthier regions continues to fall, but for the poorest regions, higher food prices lead to a rising share of income spent on food. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon fluxes; Carbon pricing; Carbon sink; Climate policy; Environmental conditions; Food prices; Global system models; Land prices; Mitigation costs; Mitigation strategy; Pre-industrial levels; Price incentives; Agricultural products; Carbon; Chemical contamination; Climate change; Costs; Economic and social effects; Land use; Biofuels; biofuel; carbon; biofuel; carbon flux; carbon sink; environmental policy; global warming; income distribution; land use change; trade-off; twentieth century; agriculture; article; climate change; environmental temperature; greenhouse effect; income; land biome; land use; reimbursement; Agriculture; Atmosphere; Biofuels; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Conservation of Energy Resources; Conservation of Natural Resources; Internationality; Models, Theoretical; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861847096

Biodiesel, produced through the transesterification of vegetable oils or animal fats, seems to be an excellent support nowadays, new raw materials to produce biodiesel are under study, provided that the production of biodiesel from edible oils is controversial for some social organizations. Olive pomace oil derives from the oil left in the olive fruit pulp (once olive oil has been extracted) and may be an option to considerer since it exhibits high neutral flavor that makes it undesirable for consumption, unless it is treated and further blended with virgin olive oil. Therefore, other uses for this oil could be soap production or its recycling to produce biodiesel. In this paper, noise emissions of a direct injection diesel engine Perkins fueled with olive pomace oil methyl ester (OPME) at several steady-state engine operating conditions were studied. This study proposes the use of different approaches for sound prediction of a diesel engine, based on artificial neural network (such as Evolutionary Product Unit Neural Networks (PUNNs) and Radial Basic Function Neural Networks (RBFNNs)) and response surface models. Their accuracies are compared in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Standard Error of Prediction (SEP). It can be concluded that the use of PUNN improves the accuracy achieving acceptable values for both MSE and SEP by means of a simpler model than the combined PU and RBF NN proposed model. Moreover, it was found that the variable power does not explain the noise value prediction, the noise emitted by the engine is inversely related to the 1/3rd octave band of the frequency value and diesel fuel noise plays the most important role and influence in the PUNN model. Response surface models are rejected, due to their unacceptable accuracy in terms of noise prediction. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To extract olive pomace oil, the pulp is treated with solvents. The resultant oil contains impurities and may undergo several heating and filtering processes to refine it to an acceptable standard. To make it satisfactory to consumers, it must be blended with virgin olive oil before use. Therefore, another uses for this oil could be soap production or its recycling to produce biodiesel. Exhaust emissions, noise and sound quality of a direct injection diesel engine fueled with olive pomace oil methyl ester (OPME) blends were studied at several steady-state engine operating conditions. Results showed that the higher the content of OPME in the blends, the lower the CO emissions, whereas NO x increased, keeping fuel consumption constant. Moreover, it was found that cetane number exhibited a stronger effect over noise production than bulk modulus, whereas the reverse effect was found concerning NO x emissions. Biodiesel blends reduced air and noise pollution, while improving sound quality. Therefore, the higher the percentage of biodiesel in blends, the lower the pollution emitted by the engine. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It is at the heart of debates over the efficacy of biofuels, the climate-forcing impact of population growth, and the extent to which mitigation of non-CO2 emissions can help avoid dangerous climate change. Here we examine some of the major debates surrounding estimation of agricultural N2O sources, and the challenges of projecting and mitigating emissions in coming decades. We find that current flux estimates - using either top-down or bottom-up methods - are reasonably consistent at the global scale, but that a dearth of direct measurements in some areas makes national and sub-national estimates highly uncertain. We also highlight key uncertainties in projected emissions and demonstrate the potential for dietary choice and supply-chain mitigation. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Understanding the response of forest carbon (C) dynamics to increases in fire will help quantify limits on the contribution of forest C storage to climate change mitigation and prioritize forest types for monitoring C storage and fire management to minimize C loss. In this study, we used projections of 21st century area burned to explore the consequences of changes in fire regimes on C dynamics in forests of Washington State. We used a novel empirical approach that takes advantage of chronosequences of C pools and fluxes and statistical properties of fire regimes to explore the effects of shifting age class distributions on C dynamics. Forests of the western Cascades are projected to be more sensitive to climate-driven increases in fire, and thus projected changes in C dynamics, than forests of the eastern Cascades. In the western Cascades, mean live biomass C is projected to decrease by 24-37%, and coarse woody debris (CWD) biomass C by 15-25% for the 2040s. Loss of live biomass C is projected to be lower for forests of the eastern Cascades and Okanogan Highlands (17-26%), and CWD biomass is projected to increase. Landscape mean net primary productivity is projected to increase in wet low-elevation forests of the western Cascades, but decrease elsewhere. These forests, and moist forests of the Okanogan Highlands, are projected to have the greatest percentage increases in consumption of live biomass. Percentage increases in consumption of CWD biomass are greater than 50% for all regions and up to four times greater than increases in consumption of live biomass. Carbon sequestration in PNW forests will be highly sensitive to increases in fire, suggesting a cautious approach to managing these forests for C sequestration to mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","Carbon; Climate change; Fire regime; Forest; Mitigation; Pacific Northwest, USA","biogeochemistry; biomass; carbon cycle; chronosequence; climate effect; fire behavior; fire management; forest management; human activity; mitigation; primary production; twenty first century; Cascade Range; Okanagan Highlands; Pacific Northwest; United States; Washington [United States]",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864123306

Data from baseline assessment of a longitudinal intervention study to promote smoke-free policy in rural Kentucky communities; key informants (n = 144) and elected officials (n = 83) from 29 counties participated in cross-sectional telephone interviews. Controlling for population size and county-level smoking rate, the following factors predicted elected officials' perception of the likelihood of a local smoke-free law passing in the next 12 months: (1) support from the local board of health; (2) support from local leaders; and (3) smoke-free hospitals. Communities with lower adult smoking prevalence were more ready for smoke-free laws. Rural health advocates can increase political readiness for smoke-free laws by educating and engaging Board of Health members and local leaders, promoting the voluntary adoption of smoke-free policies in rural hospitals, and investing in effective population-based approaches to evidence-based tobacco treatment in rural communities. © The Author(s) 2012.","advocacy; elected officials; environmental tobacco smoke; public policy","adult; aged; article; comparative study; evaluation; female; government regulation; health; health promotion; human; intervention study; legal aspect; longitudinal study; male; management; middle aged; organization and management; passive smoking; policy; politics; rural population; smoking; smoking ban; United States; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Government Regulation; Health Promotion; Humans; Intervention Studies; Kentucky; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Policy Making; Politics; Public Policy; Rural Health; Rural Population; Smoke-Free Policy; Smoking; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867278922

Both the pathogen and the vector are native to the Americas, and H.vitripennis has demonstrated high invasive ability but to date neither has been detected in Australia. The Australian wine grape, table grape, peach, plum, nectarine and citrus industries are particularly concerned about the arrival of X.fastidiosa and H.vitripennis because of the potential economic impact on these important commodities. Other commodity producers in Australia should also be concerned about this vector-pathogen, in particular the ornamental plant, avocado and olive industries. Past interceptions of H.vitripennis and the potential for X.fastidiosa to be moved in live plant material or within live vectors indicate the need for rapid detection of an incursion in areas considered at high risk. This requires identification of regions that have climatic and environmental conditions conducive to X.fastidiosa and H.vitripennis establishment as well as a detailed knowledge of their respective potential host plant ranges in new areas. These climatic regions and host plant species can then be targeted for monitoring in order to detect an incursion at an early stage. CLIMEX modelling has shown that much of coastal Australia has temperatures suitable for survival of both the vector and pathogen. A range of other requirements in addition to suitable climate must, however, be satisfied for an incursion to lead to establishment, proliferation and spread. This review article provides information that shows that the Australian environment is suitable for the establishment of H.vitripennis and that Australian native plant species are likely to serve as X.fastidiosa hosts and subsequent pathogen sources, and highlights future research directions. © 2011 Australian Entomological Society.","Alternative host; Biosecurity; Insect pest; Pathogen transmission; Pierce's disease","Cicadellidae; Citrus; Hemiptera; Hexapoda; Homalodisca; Homalodisca coagulata; Persea americana; Proteobacteria; Prunus domestica; Prunus persica; Prunus persica nucipersica; Vitaceae; Vitis vinifera; Xanthomonadaceae; Xylella fastidiosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866318162

This creates challenges for adaptation planning in exposed coastal communities. We present a framework to support the interpretation of current long-term tropical cyclone projections, which accommodates the nature of the uncertainty and aims to facilitate robust decision making using the information that is available today. The framework is populated with projections taken from the recent literature to develop a set of scenarios of long-term hurricane hazard. Hazard scenarios are then used to generate risk scenarios for Florida using a coupled climate-catastrophe modeling approach. The scenarios represent a broad range of plausible futures; from wind-related hurricane losses in Florida halving by the end of the century to more than a four-fold increase due to climate change alone. We suggest that it is not possible, based on current evidence, to meaningfully quantify the relative confidence of each scenario. The analyses also suggest that natural variability is likely to be the dominant driver of the level and volatility of wind-related risk over the coming decade; however, under the highest scenario, the superposition of this natural variability and anthropogenic climate change could mean notably increased levels of risk within the decade. Finally, we present a series of analyses to better understand the relative adequacy of the different models that underpin the scenarios and draw conclusions for the design of future climate science and modeling experiments to be most informative for adaptation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptation; Climate change; Climate modeling; Hurricane; Risk; Uncertainty","anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate modeling; decision making; hazard assessment; hurricane; numerical model; risk factor; uncertainty analysis; Atlantic Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865794995

Shortwave aerosol radiative forcing (ARF) at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) is &lt; -12 W m-2 over Kanpur and Gandhi College. ARF at the surface is ≥ -30 W m-2. Atmospheric warming is maximum during premonsoon (&gt;30 W m-2). Shortwave atmospheric heating due to aerosols is &gt;0.4 K/day over IGP and peaks during premonsoon at &gt;0.6 K/day due to lower single scattering albedo (SSA) and higher surface albedo. TOA forcing is always less negative over Kanpur when compared to Gandhi College due to lower surface albedo except in postmonsoon owing to higher SSA. This happens as TOA forcing depends on SSA and surface albedo in addition to aerosol optical depth. The magnitude of longwave forcing and atmospheric cooling in an absolute sense is significantly small and contributes only about 20% or less to the net (shortwave + longwave) forcing. Aerosol radiative effects over these two locations, despite differences in aerosol characteristics, are similar, thus confirming that aerosols and their radiative influence get transported due to circulation. ARF over Kanpur and Gandhi College is an order of magnitude higher when compared to greenhouse gas forcing. A large reduction in surface reaching solar irradiance accompanied by large atmospheric warming can have implications on precipitation and hydrological cycle, and these aerosol radiative effects should be included while performing regional-scale aerosol climate assessments. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Aerosol forcing; Comparison; Indo-Gangetic plain; Longwave; Seasonal; Shortwave; Urban vs. Rural; Variations","albedo; environmental change; greenhouse gas; hydrological cycle; irradiance; optical depth; precipitation (climatology); radiative forcing; radiative transfer; scattering; seasonal variation; aerosol; air pollutant; article; atmosphere; chemistry; city; environmental monitoring; greenhouse effect; India; season; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Atmosphere; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; India; Seasons; Gangetic Plain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864102368

In parallel, for many countries, emission control legislation becomes increasingly stringent to accommodate both public health and climate change imperatives. Effective gas biofiltration in biofilters and biotrickling filters depends on three key bioreactor variables: the support medium; gas molecule solubilization; and the catabolic population. Organic and inorganic support media, singly or in combination, have been employed and their key criteria are considered by critical appraisal of one, char. Catabolic species have included fungal and bacterial monocultures and, to a lesser extent, microbial communities. In the absence of organic support medium (soil, compost, sewage sludge, etc.) inoculum provision, a targeted enrichment and isolation program must be undertaken followed, possibly, by culture efficacy improvement. Microbial community process enhancement can then be gained by comprehensive characterization of the culturable and total populations. For all species, support medium attachment is critical and this is considered prior to filtration optimization by water content, pH, temperature, loadings, and nutrients manipulation.

This article argues that in the first three decades of environmental diplomacy, from 1972 to 2002, the international community witnessed an exponential growth in the number and range of multilateral environmental agreements, an array of tools, techniques and practices, and a rapid expansion of differential treatment in favour of developing countries. Differential treatment in central obligations, albeit disputed from its inception, found pride of place in the Kyoto Protocol negotiated in 1997. The decade that followed, 2002 to 2012, witnessed heightened popular and political mobilization around the climate change issue. But, in response to seemingly intractable difficulties across the North-South and North-North spectrum, it was accompanied by a retreat from differential treatment in central obligations. The battle over the future (or lack thereof) of the Kyoto Protocol, and the recent developments in the climate regime-in particular the 2011 Durban Platform Decision-testify to this retreat from certain variants of differential treatment, and interpretations of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities. An analysis of these developments and the politics that gave rise to them, reveal that while the international regime can survive the erosion of certain limited forms of differential treatment, a wholesale rejection of differential treatment, and of the 'equity' concerns that animate it, would destabilize the normative core of the regime as well as render the climate regime unattractive to key players like India. © 2012 The Author(s).

The trade-off between environmental and economic parameters represents a challenge for governments. The objectives of this study are: firstly, to review studies in relation to the use of PV systems in the Gulf region and secondly, to assess the trade-off between environmental and economic parameters that influence the value of building integrated photovoltaic (BiPV) technology applied into the UAE building sector. This work examines residential buildings and concludes that the economic viability of BiPV systems is subject to capital cost, system efficiency and electricity tariff. To be a cost-effective option in the UAE, subsidies for PV investments and reasonable electricity tariff must be implemented. It is suggested that BiPV systems offer cost reductions in both energy and economic terms over centralised PV plants, especially if the costs of saved operating energy and avoided building materials are taken into account. Each square meter of BiPV is capable of making a significant reduction in CO 2 emissions generated by conventional power plants.

Suitable plant species were selected based on the Air pollution tolerance index (APTI) calculated by analyzing ascorbic acid (AA), pH, relative water content (RWC) and total chlorophyll (TChl) of the plants occuring in the locality. Plants were selected within a 6 km radius from the industry and were graded as per their tolerance levels by analyzing the biochemical parameters. From the statistical analysis at 0.05 level of significance a difference in the APTI values among the 27 plant species was observed, but they showed homogenous results when analysed zone wise using one-way analyses of variance. Analyses of individual parameters showed variation in the different zones surrounding the cement industry, whereas the APTI value (which is a combination of the parameter viz. AA, RWC, TChl, pH) showed more or less same gradation. Significant variation in individual parameters and APTI was seen with in the species. All the plants surrounding the cement industry are indicative of high pollution exposure comparable to the results obtain for control plants. Based on the APTI value, it was observed that about 37% of the plant species were tolerant. Among them Mangifera indica, Bougainvillea species, Psidum quajava showed high APTI values. 33% of the species were highly susceptible to the adverse effects of SPM, among which Thevetia neriifolia, Saraca indica, Phyllanthus emblica and Cercocarpus ledifolius showed low APTI values.15% each of the species were at the intermediary and moderate tolerance levels. © 2012 Triveni Enterprises.","Air pollution tolerance index; Cement industry; Suspended particulate matter","ascorbic acid; atmospheric pollution; cement; chlorophyll; greenbelt; industrial location; manufacturing; plant community; pollution effect; pollution exposure; pollution tolerance; suspended particulate matter; variance analysis; water content; Coimbatore; India; Tamil Nadu; Bougainvillea; Cercocarpus ledifolius; Mangifera indica; Phyllanthus emblica; Saraca indica; Thevetia peruviana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863817663

To support policy-making, a study examined possible future strategies for these meadows in the west of the Netherlands. Future scenarios with different water level strategies and climate scenarios were modelled with the SIMGRO regional hydrological model. The analysis focused on water level control strategies, in combination with subsurface drains, with the aim of reducing subsidence and minimising the water supply in dry periods. Subsurface drains were found to be a good measure to reduce subsidence, but more water had to be supplied. Based on the simulated water level control strategies an optimal scenario was found; it minimises the negative effects of the increased water supply. A scenario simulating the anticipated climate change appeared to have a great impact on the peat meadows.

The study revealed that between 12,700 and 7150 yr BP, tree savanna vegetation existed with the dominance of grasses, Cheno/Am, Asteraceae as well as scattered Acacia, Ailanthus excelsa, Madhuca indica, and Bombax ceiba under a cool and dry climate with reduced monsoonal precipitation. A moderate-sized lake existed in the region prior to the Holocene. Human activity in the form of incipient cereal-based agriculture practice was also present. Between 7150 and 4657 yr BP, the tree savanna vegetation was transformed into an open mixed tropical deciduous forest as a result of expansion of prominent deciduous trees under warm and moderately humid climate, which could be attributed to an increase in monsoon precipitation. The lake size increased comparatively, and acceleration in agriculture practice took place. Later, between 4657 and 2807 yr BP with more or less similar floristic composition, the open mixed tropical deciduous forest continued in the region under a warm and less humid climate owing to weak monsoon precipitation. The lake became smaller in size while agriculture practice continued at the same pace. Subsequently, between 2807 and 1125 yr BP, mixed deciduous forest succeeded the open mixed tropical deciduous forest, which is indicated by the enhancement of M. indica, Acacia, Grewia, Symplocos, Shorea robusta, etc. and the debut of Tectona grandis around 1965 yr BP under a warm and more humid climate owing to an increase in monsoon precipitation. The lake-level remained unchanged but agricultural practice intensified. From 1125 yr BP to the present day, the mixed tropical deciduous forest became sparser and less diversified in composition, and consequently was transformed into open vegetation under a warm and comparatively less humid climate, equivalent to present.

The Soviet legacy has left the five countries (Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan) with a highly integrated system but they are facing great challenges with tensions that hinder regional coordination of food and water resources. With increasing climate variability and warming trend in the region, food and water security issues become even more crucial now and, if not addressed properly, could affect the regional stability. The long-term drivers of these two most critical elements, food and water, are climate change; the immediate and probably more drastic factors affecting the food and water security are land uses driven by institutional change and economic incentives. As a feedback, changes in land use and land cover have directly implications on water uses, food production, and lifestyles of the rural community in the region. Regional and international efforts have been made to holistically understand the cause, extent, rate and societal implications of land use changes in the region. Much of these have been understood, or under investigation by various projects, but solutions or research effort to develop solutions, to these urgent regional issues are lacking.

Dynamic Global Vegetation Models(DGVM) have the capacity and scope to develop understanding in this regard, due to their ability in simulating plant-vegetation-climate processes incorporating bioclimatic variables. However, prior to take up modelling using a spatially explicit DGVM, it may be imminent to prioritize the area for vulnerable contexts, so as to calibrate and validate the model optimally. Spatially explicit DGVMs require site level observations at canopy and leaf level/soil strata level for parametrization and implementation. Satellite data in VNIR and thermal regimes provide scope to understand the responses of various vegetation categories and enable to set up baseline addressing the foci of change as regions of vulnerability. Study carried out Western Himalayan transect using MODIS enhanced vegetation index and land surface temperature illustrates potential to differentiate areas that can be vulnerable due to warming trends disturbing cold to warm season energy level transition. Relations of these indices were studied in different vegetation categories and modelled spatially to derive potential vulnerable zones. Many sites showed high vulnerability while some sites showed distinct resilient behaviour by showing increase in EVI during warming periods. Potential zones were studied further using a spatially explicit Dynamic Global Vegetation Model for site level understanding. DGVM results in terms of biomass and carbon were studied to understand the trends in the vulnerable and resilient sites. Detailed characterisation of DGVM based modelling is underway to further diagnose the vulnerability contexts.","Global-environmental-databases; Modelling and retrieval; Multitemporal; Temperature; Vegetation","Climate models; Forestry; Land surface temperature; Planning; Sustainable development; Temperature; Adaptation strategies; Bioclimatic variables; Energy level transitions; Enhanced vegetation index; Environmental database; Multi-temporal; Regions of vulnerability; Vegetation categories; Vegetation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84924351843

Concentrations can be reduced by controlling emissions, increasing dispersion, or increasing deposition rates, but little attention has been paid to the latter as a pollution control method. Both NO2 and PM are deposited onto surfaces at rates that vary according to the nature of the surface; deposition rates to vegetation are much higher than those to hard, built surfaces. Previously, city-scale studies have suggested that deposition to vegetation can make a very modest improvement (&lt;5%) to urban air quality. However, few studies take full account of the interplay between urban form and vegetation, specifically the enhanced residence time of air in street canyons. This study shows that increasing deposition by the planting of vegetation in street canyons can reduce street-level concentrations in those canyons by as much as 40% for NO2 and 60% for PM. Substantial street-level air quality improvements can be gained through action at the scale of a single street canyon or across city-sized areas of canyons. Moreover, vegetation will continue to offer benefits in the reduction of pollution even if the traffic source is removed from city centers. Thus, judicious use of vegetation can create an efficient urban pollutant filter, yielding rapid and sustained improvements in street-level air quality in dense urban areas. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality improvement; Dense urban areas; Green infrastructure; Health standards; Nitrogen dioxides; Particulate Matter; Residence time; Street canyon; Traffic sources; Urban air quality; Urban form; Urban street canyon; Air quality; Deposition rates; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Vegetation; Computer integrated manufacturing; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; atmospheric deposition; concentration (composition); emission control; greenspace; morbidity; mortality; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; public health; roadside environment; street canyon; traffic emission; transplantation; urban atmosphere; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality; air quality control; article; controlled study; morbidity; mortality; particulate matter; pollution control; urban area; vegetation; Air Pollution; Cities; London; Meteorological Concepts; Models, Theoretical; Particulate Matter; Plant Development; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863955860

However, for several reasons, there is still a significant uncertainty in the climate sensitivity parameter, which relates greenhouse gas concentration (or other forcings) to steady-state temperature. One key source of uncertainty is the disagreement about the appropriate prior for Bayesian estimation. A common choice is the uniform distribution, often thought to contain no information. However, when used to estimate sensitivity it leads to paradoxical results, which have been interpreted as revealing an inherent indeterminacy in the prior of choice. If this were the case, part of the uncertainty would be irreducible. Here I develop an objective Bayesian approach to this problem. I show that both Jaynes' invariant groups criterion and a new criterion based on information theory lead to the conclusion that there is a uniquely defined non-informative prior of climate sensitivity, which is distinct from the uniform and solves the paradox. This prior distribution is the log-uniform. Furthermore, this result is supported empirically by the observation that other comparable non-equilibrium parameters display a scale-invariant, log-uniform-like frequency distribution. Rather than advocating a direct use of this prior, I recommend to refine it with a limited use of expert elicitation or other methods.

In Canada, changes in precipitation, the appearance of new pests and poor soil quality are threatening the prosperity of small farmers. What human competencies could facilitate citizens adaptation to climate change? The competencies displayed by six Canadian farmers were observed as they tried to improve the quality of their soil in order to increase its climate resilience. The farmers in the case study demonstrated a wide array of skills while adapting to climate change. Used to adjusting their farming practices to bad weather, the participants predicted that their already declining soil was very vulnerable to extreme events. They implemented some adaptations: planting forage radish and practicing more crop rotations. During the adaptation process, the farmers showed in-depth local and agricultural knowledge, critical thinking (which they used to assess the solutions), futures thinking and hindsight, identification and control of the variables affecting the crops, openness to novelty, collaboration, optimism and self-efficacy. The research, which results in the identification of competencies conducive to adaptation, leads to the recommendation of a few educational strategies to strengthen adaptive competencies when supporting citizens in a climate change adaptation process. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","adaptation to climate change; competencies; environmental education; farmers","adaptation; climate change; crop rotation; environmental education; population growth; precipitation (climatology); resource use; soil quality; traditional knowledge; Canada; Raphanus sativus",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863962140

We examine the effects of a range of policies across 39 states. We find significant and robust decreases in carbon emissions associated with the introduction of public benefit funds, a form of ""carbon tax"" adopted by 19 states to date.

Dual emission observed in nonpolar solvents suggested that the energy of the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state is lower than that of the locally excited state. The normal Stokes-shifted band originated from the locally excited state, and the large Stokes-shifted band was due to the emission from a planar intramolecular charge transfer (PICT) state. The ratio of the PICT emission to the normal emission increased with β-CD concentration, whereas it was constant upon addition of α-CD. This behavior is in accordance with CD-dependent decay times of PICT and normal emissions, indicating the formation of different 1:1 FBRR/CD inclusion complexes. The rise time for the PICT emission increased with β-CD concentration, whereas no rise time was observed in the case of the α-CD complex. The size of the dimethoxyaniline ring suggested that the orientation of FBRR in the β-CD complex was different from that in the α-CD complex. The benzamido moiety of FBRR is deeply encapsulated in the CD cavity, whereas the aniline ring is exposed to the hydrophilic part.

In many other areas there is no consensus among models on the sign of the projected change. This is often assumed to indicate that precipitation projections in these regions are highly uncertain. Here, twenty-first century precipitation projections under the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario using 24 World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)/Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) climate models are examined. In areas with no consensus on the sign of projected change there are extensive subregions where the projected change is ""very likely"" (i.e., probability. 0.90) to be small (relative to, e.g., the size of interannual variability during the late twentieth century) or zero. The statistical significance of and interrelationships between methods used to identify model consensus on projected change in the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report are examined, and the impact of interdependency among model projections on statistical significance is investigated. Interdependency among projections is shown to be much weaker than interdependency among simulations of climatology. The results show that there ismore widespread consistency among the model projections than one might infer from the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment report. This discovery highlights the broader need to identify regions, variables, and phenomena that are expected to be little affected by anthropogenic climate change and to communicate this information to the wider community. This is especially important for projections of climate for the next 1-3 decades. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.","Climate change; Climate models; Climate variability; General circulation models; Rainfall; Subtropics","A1B scenarios; Anthropogenic climate changes; Climate research; Climate variability; Convergence zones; General circulation model; High Latitudes; Interannual variability; Intercomparisons; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Midlatitudes; Project phase; Special report on emissions scenarios; Statistical significance; Subtropics; Twentieth century; Climate change; Climatology; Global warming; Rain; Tropics; Climate models; climate change; climate modeling; climate variation; climatology; general circulation model; global warming; intertropical convergence zone; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; twenty first century",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861438870

Interestingly there is often co-pyrolysis synergy, commonly enhancing tar and gas yields. To explore the synergy mechanisms requires the ability to predict yields and explore thermolysis of coal and biomass chemistry. The current state-of-knowledge allows individual yield predictions through mathematical modeling, and creation of large-scale molecular representations of lignin (as a biomass simplification) and coal. Yet there is no means of coupling these molecular representations and predicted yields. Here a reactive coarse-grained simulation is used to generate 2D lattice representations from complex large-scale subbituminous coal and generic hardwood lignin structural representations. The chemical percolation devolatilization (CPD) model was used to predict yields of chars and tars/gases during pyrolysis. Scripting within a molecular modeling environment generates the reactive 2D lattice in molecular modeling space and also simulates the primary thermolysis within the lattice to achieve the desired yields through a breaking of labile cross-links between ""un-reactive"" structural nodes. The approach is used to visualize the dynamic yield differentials between lignin and a subbituminous coal and to generate radical fragments that can be used to explore synergistic interactions.

However, the accounting methods have considered greenhouse gas emissions only during the industrial era, neglecting the fact that land use changes (LUC) have caused emissions long before the Industrial Revolution. Here, we hypothesize that considering preindustrial LUC affects the attribution because the geographic pattern of preindustrial LUC emissions differs significantly from that of industrial-era emissions and because preindustrial emissions have legacy effects on todays atmospheric CO2 concentrations and temperatures. We test this hypothesis by estimating CO 2 and temperature increases based on carbon cycle simulations of the last millennium. We find that accounting for preindustrial LUC emissions results in a shift of attribution of global temperature increase from the industrialized countries to less industrialized countries, in particular South Asia and China, by up to 2-3%, a level that may be relevant for political discussions. While further studies are needed to span the range of plausible quantifications, our study demonstrates the importance of including preindustrial emissions for the most scientifically defensible attribution. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.","attribution; climate change; land use change/land cover change; preindustrial emissions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864400871

We assembled monthly time-series of phytoplankton and zooplankton taxonomic richness, phytoplankton functional groups (species with similar functional traits) and physico-chemical environmental descriptors (temperature, conductivity, pH, P-PO 4 3-, N-NO 3 -, light absorption). We used multiple linear regression to test: 1) the effect of environmental variability over time and depth on the accrual of plankton richness; and 2) the relative effect of richness and environmental variability on the stability of plankton. Environmental change was characterised by increase in temperature, decrease in phosphorus levels, reduced temporal variability of both, and higher heterogeneity of phosphorus over depth (spatial heterogeneity). These conditions occurred concurrently with accrual in plankton taxonomic and functional richness. Increase in temperature and spatial heterogeneity were the best predictors of phytoplankton richness, while phytoplankton richness and spatial heterogeneity had the strongest effects on zooplankton richness. Temporal stability in phytoplankton biovolume was mainly affected by variability in phosphorus and temperature, while zooplankton abundance levels were more strongly linked to fluctuations in nitrogen, temperature and phytoplankton biovolumes. Our analysis highlights that climate warming and re-oligotrophication may favour an increase in spatial (depth) heterogeneity in the water column of deep lakes, enhancing the potential for phytoplankton species co-existence and an increase in plankton richness. Our analysis also suggests that the intensity of fluctuations in key environmental variables can be a better predictor of plankton community stability then average richness. © 2011 The Authors.

Design: Cross-sectional, mixed methods; mailed survey to nurses who handle chemotherapy and telephone interviews with managers. Setting: Mailed invitation to oncology centers across the United States. Sample: 165 nurses who reported handling chemotherapy and 20 managers of nurses handling chemotherapy. Methods: Instruments measured the use of HD precautions and individual and organizational factors believed to influence precaution use. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and hierarchical regression. Manager interview data were analyzed using content analysis. Main Research Variables: Chemotherapy exposure knowledge, self-efficacy, perceived barriers, perceived risk, interpersonal influences, and workplace safety climate. Findings: Nurses were well educated, experienced, and certified in oncology nursing. The majority worked in outpatient settings and administered chemotherapy to an average of 6.8 patients per day. Exposure knowledge, self-efficacy for using personal protective equipment, and perceived risk of harm from HD exposure were high; total precaution use was low. Nurse characteristics did not predict HD precaution use. Fewer barriers, better workplace safety climate, and fewer patients per day were independent predictors of higher HD precaution use. HD handling policies were present, but many did not reflect current recommendations. Few managers formally monitored nurses' HD precaution use. Conclusions: Circumstances in the workplace interfere with nurses' use of HD precautions. Implications for Nursing: Interventions should include fostering a positive workplace safety climate, reducing barriers, and providing appropriate nurse-patient ratios. © 2012 by the Oncology Nursing Society.",,"antineoplastic agent; adult; aged; article; cross-sectional study; dangerous goods; female; health care survey; human; male; middle aged; neoplasm; nursing; occupational health; oncology nursing; risk factor; safety; standard; statistics; waste disposal; workplace; Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hazardous Substances; Health Care Surveys; Humans; Male; Medical Waste Disposal; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Occupational Health; Oncologic Nursing; Risk Factors; Safety Management; Workplace; Young Adult",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865575588

Nuclear fragmentation processes are relevant in several fields of basic research and applied physics and are of particular interest for tumor therapy and for space radiation protection applications. The start of the scientific program of the FIRST experiment was on summer 2011 and was focused on the measurement of 400 MeV/nucleon 12C beam fragmentation on thin (8 mm) graphite target. The detector is partly based on an already existing setup made of a dipole magnet (ALADiN), a time projection chamber (TP-MUSIC IV), a neutron detector (LAND) and a time of flight scintillator system (TOFWALL). This pre-existing setup has been integrated with newly designed detectors in the Interaction Region, around the carbon target placed in a sample changer. The new detectors are a scintillator Start Counter, a Beam Monitor drift chamber, a silicon Vertex Detector and a Proton Tagger scintillator system optimized for the detection of light fragments emitted at large angles. In this paper we review the experimental setup, then we present the simulation software, the data acquisition system and finally the trigger strategy of the experiment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

However, the task is a challenging one as numerous factors may interact and drive the spread of a disease, specifically when vector-borne diseases are involved. We advocate the use of simultaneous autoregressive models to identify environmental features that significantly impact the velocity of disease spread. We illustrate this approach by exploring several environmental factors influencing the velocity of bluetongue (BT) spread in France during the 2007-2008 epizootic wave to determine which ones were the most important drivers. We used velocities of BT spread estimated in 4,495 municipalities and tested sixteen covariates defining five thematic groups of related variables: elevation, meteorological-related variables, landscape-related variables, host availability, and vaccination. We found that ecological factors associated with vector abundance and activity (elevation and meteorological-related variables), as well as with host availability, were important drivers of the spread of the disease. Specifically, the disease spread more slowly in areas with high elevation and when heavy rainfall associated with extreme temperature events occurred one or two months prior to the first clinical case. Moreover, the density of dairy cattle was correlated negatively with the velocity of BT spread. These findings add substantially to our understanding of BT spread in a temperate climate. Finally, the approach presented in this paper can be used with other infectious diseases, and provides a powerful tool to identify environmental features driving the velocity of disease spread. © 2012 Pioz et al.",,"rain; article; Bluetongue orbivirus; climate; controlled study; dairy cattle; environmental factor; environmental temperature; epizootiology; France; geographic distribution; geographic elevation; host range; landscape; meteorological phenomena; nonhuman; serotype; vaccination; velocity; virus carrier; virus transmission; Animals; Bluetongue; Bluetongue virus; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Ecology; France; Insect Vectors; Rain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865057255

The climate effects can be short-lived, by impacting the chemistry of the atmosphere, or long-lived, by altering ecosystem greenhouse gas fluxes. Here we develop a coherent framework for assessing the climate change impacts of US reactive nitrogen emissions, including oxides of nitrogen, ammonia, and nitrous oxide (N2O). We use the global temperature potential (GTP), calculated at 20 and 100 y, in units of CO2 equivalents (CO 2e), as a common metric. The largest cooling effects are due to combustionsources of oxides of nitrogen altering tropospheric ozone and methane concentrations and enhancing carbon sequestration in forests. The combined cooling effects are estimated at -290 to -510 Tg CO2e on a GTP 20 basis. However, these effects are largely short-lived. On a GTP100 basis, combustion contributes just-16 to-95 Tg CO 2e.Agriculture contributes to warming on both the 20-y and 100-y timescales, primarily through N2O emissions from soils. Under current conditions, these warming and cooling effects partially offset each other. However, recent trends show decreasing emissions from combustion sources. To prevent warming from US reactive nitrogen, reductions in agricultural N 2O emissions are needed. Substantial progress toward this goal is possible using current technology.Without such actions, even greater CO 2 emission reductions will be required to avoid dangerous climate change.",,"ammonia; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrogen oxide; nitrous oxide; reactive nitrogen species; agriculture; article; atmospheric dispersion; carbon sequestration; climate change; combustion; cooling; environmental impact; forest; priority journal; troposphere; United States; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Fires; Models, Theoretical; Nitrogen Cycle; Nitrogen Oxides; Ozone; Temperature; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861206959

Our approach is based on the standard assumption that Hii regions with similar intensities of strong emission lines have similar physical properties and abundances. A 'counterpart' for a studied Hii region may be chosen among Hii regions with well-measured abundances (reference Hii regions) by comparison of carefully chosen combinations of strong-line intensities. Then the abundances in the investigated Hii region can be assumed to be the same as those in its counterpart. In other words, we suggest to determine the abundances in Hii regions 'by precedent'. To get more reliable abundances for the considered Hii region, a number of reference Hii regions are selected and then the abundances in the target Hii region are estimated through extrapolation/interpolation. We will refer to this method of abundance determination as the counterpart method or, for brevity, the C method. We define a sample of reference Hii regions and verify the validity of the C method. We find that this method produces reliable abundances.

However, adaptation is being increasingly recognized as a necessary action to respond to changes in the climate as societies concurrently mitigate to minimize future anthropogenic climatic forcing. Environmental planners will play a leading role in assisting communities as they face the challenge of preparing for a changing and uncertain future. This research uses a self-assessment survey and workshop to provide a perspective of planner knowledge of climate change adaptation. It also explores climate impacts in communities across the province of British Columbia, Canada, and barriers to effective adaptation. The results indicate that planners do not have a high level of knowledge regarding climate change adaptation. The top impacts that planners believe will affect British Columbia are related to forests, agriculture and river flooding. Planners want adaptation incorporated into existing documents (such as community, regional and provincial plans) rather than separate adaptation plans. The findings of this study demonstrate the need to promote capacity building related to climate change adaptation among planners. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","adaptation; British Columbia; Climate change; community; impacts; knowledge; self-assessment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861961170

The EPA has approved a testing protocol under this program to verify the performance of commercially available filtration products for pulse-jet baghouses in removing fine particulate matter (aerodynamic diameter &lt;2.5 μm; PM2.5). This verification testing protocol was later used as a basis for the development of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) Method D6830-02 and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Method 11057. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) in California and the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) highly encourage the use of ETV/ASTM-verified filtration media. This paper highlights the evolution of the standard test methods, the EPA's and SCAQMD's regulatory activities, the benefits of using verified filtration media, and the importance of including the filter performance testing in future consideration of baghouse permitting, baghouse operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) plans, quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC), and bag monitoring plans.Implications: Environmental engineers, managers, and the public will benefit from the information related to the PM2.5 emissions documented in the EPA's Environmental Technology Verification (ETV) program for baghouse filtration products. The South Coast Air Quality Management District and the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards are in support of the ETV program. Baghouse users are recommended to use the ETV-verified filtration products and incorporate the performance testing in their baghouse monitoring program.

Protected Areas (PAs) are intended to conserve habitats and species. Variability in PA effectiveness and 'leakage' (here defined as displacement of deforestation) may lead to different trends in forest loss within, and adjacent to, existing PAs. Here, we quantify spatial variation in trends of evergreen forest coverage in East Africa between 2001 and 2009, and test for correlations with forest accessibility and environmental drivers. We investigate PA effectiveness at local, landscape and national scales, comparing rates of deforestation within park boundaries with those detected in park buffer zones and in unprotected land more generally. Background forest loss (BFL) was estimated at -9.3% (17,167 km2), but varied between countries (range: -0.9% to -85.7%; note: no BFL in South Sudan). We document high variability in PA effectiveness within and between PA categories. The most successful PAs were National Parks, although only 26 out of 48 parks increased or maintained their forest area (i.e. Effective parks). Forest Reserves (Ineffective parks, i.e. parks that lose forest from within boundaries: 204 out of 337), Nature Reserves (six out of 12) and Game Parks (24 out of 26) were more likely to lose forest cover. Forest loss in buffer zones around PAs exceeded background forest loss, in some areas indicating leakage driven by Effective National Parks. Human pressure, forest accessibility, protection status, distance to fires and long-term annual rainfall were highly significant drivers of forest loss in East Africa. Some of these factors can be addressed by adjusting park management. However, addressing close links between livelihoods, natural capital and poverty remains a fundamental challenge in East Africa's forest conservation efforts. © 2012 Pfeifer et al.",,"Africa; article; conservation biology; deforestation; evergreen rain forest; fire; forest management; national park; population density; Sudan; Africa, Eastern; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forestry; Humans; Linear Models; Population Density; Satellite Communications; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863110371

Mitigating its effects on living organisms and societies will be at the heart of most environmental management strategies, which will need to be informed by integrative scientific approaches. This Issue's Special Profile provides examples of such approaches. 2.Responses of species to change in climatic conditions will range from thriving (i.e. species capable of living under the new set of conditions) to adapting (i.e. species capable of surviving a change in global conditions by changing their ecology and/or distribution) and going extinct. Yet there is a need to identify which species will fall into which categories, as well as a need to understand how to facilitate species' ability to adapt to change. 3.Landscape management will be key to ensuring that functional, resilient ecosystems are maintained. Preserving the complexity and function of ecosystems can help mitigate the impact of extreme climatic conditions on the delivery of vital services such as climate regulation, primary production and water retention. 4.To mitigate further biodiversity loss, healthy habitats will also need to be better connected. In many situations, developing ecological networks will require costly habitat restoration at large spatial scales: to maximise opportunities for these networks to be created and be successful, landscape-scale assessments of the provision and value of multiple ecosystem services under alternative management regimes will need to inform decisions as to where and how to implement their creation. 5.Synthesis and applications. Climate change is only starting to shape the ecological research agenda, as the complexity of the impact of this phenomenon on biodiversity and ecosystem services slowly unveils. Because changes in climatic conditions are expected to hit everyone everywhere, effective solutions for climate change mitigation will require science to truly engage with society and support decision-making processes at local, national and international scales. © 2012 The Author.

Due to its aromatic structure, biochar is a highly stable form of carbon in the soil that may contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, such as CO2, N2O and CH4, and act as a soil conditioner, improving the physical and chemical properties of the soil. Biochar may also result in increased productivity due to the improvement of soil attributes or a possible electrophysiological effect.

For this purpose remote sensing was utilized for mapping surficial rock alterations, and geochemical tools were used to understand the alteration processes. The key area chosen for this type of work were altered and unaltered Wingate Sandstone outcrops in Lisbon Valley, Utah. The Spectral Angle Mapper method was applied on HyMap hyperspectral data to classify the extent of altered and unaltered outcrops, as well as to map the changes in mineral content within the outcrops. The Spectral Feature Fitting method was used to identify lithological changes in the area. Reflectance spectroscopy, thin section studies, major, minor, and trace element analyses, and stable carbon and oxygen studies on both bleached (altered) and unbleached (unaltered) samples were successfully used to delineate areas of similar rock composition and relate changes due to hydrocarbons leaking from underlying petroleum reservoirs. Unbleached Wingate Sandstone samples had higher hematite and feldspar content than bleached Wingate samples, which were characterized by larger amounts of clay, calcite, and pyrite. Some bleached samples also had higher concentrations of elements (U, Mo) characteristic of hydrocarbon-related reducing environments, and were depleted in 13C when compared to the unbleached samples. Based on these results, the following model of chemical reactions is suggested for diagnostic changes within Wingate Sandstone. Hydrocarbon-induced reducing environment caused the transformation of sulfate ion (obtained from groundwater or from oxidation of H 2S) to sulfide ion, resulting in the reduction of hematite to pyrite. The released hydrogen ion from this reaction reacted with available feldspars in the rock, leading to precipitation of kaolinite. These conditions favor the reaction between bicarbonate ion and Ca 2+ ions that can be obtained from the groundwater, leading to precipitation of calcite in pore spaces left open after the reduction and removal of hematite. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon isotopes; Geochemistry; Hydrocarbon-induced rock alteration; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Petroleum exploration; Wingate sandstone","Carbon isotopes; Chemical change; Hydrocarbon microseepages; Hydrogen ions; Hyperspectral Data; Hyperspectral remote sensing; If there are; Isotopic study; Lisbon Valley; Lithological changes; Mineral assemblage; Mineral content; Oxidation of H; Petroleum exploration; Pore space; Reducing environment; Reflectance spectroscopy; Rock alterations; Rock composition; Sandstone samples; Spectral angle mappers; Spectral feature fitting; Stable carbon; Sulfate ion; Sulfide ions; Thin section; Trace element analysis; Bleaching; Calcite; Carbon; Carbonate minerals; Cleaning; Feldspar; Geochemistry; Groundwater; Groundwater geochemistry; Hematite; Hydrogen; Ions; Iron ores; Isotopes; Kaolinite; Lithology; Petroleum reservoirs; Reduction; Remote sensing; Rocks; Sandstone; Structural geology; Hydrocarbons; carbon isotope; geochemistry; hydrocarbon exploration; hydrocarbon reservoir; hydrocarbon seep; isotopic analysis; mapping; outcrop; remote sensing; sandstone; Lisbon Valley; United States; Utah",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861690489

We have assessed the effects of acute and extended administration of guanosine (GUA) on brain oxidative stress parameters and cognitive impairment in rats submitted to sepsis by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP). To achieve this goal, male Wistar rats underwent either sham operation or CLP with GUA. Rats subjected to CLP were treated with intraperitoneal injection of GUA (8. mg/kg after CLP) or vehicle. Twelve and 24. h after CLP, the rats were sacrificed, and samples from brain (hippocampus, striatum, cerebellum, prefrontal cortex and cortex) were obtained and assayed for thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) formation and protein carbonyls. On the 10th day, another group of rats was submitted to the behavioral tasks. GUA administration reduced TBARS and carbonyl levels in some brain regions between 12 and 24. h after CLP, and ameliorated cognitive impairment evaluated 10. days after CLP. Our data provide the first experimental demonstration that GUA was able to reduce the consequences of CLP-induced sepsis in rats, by decreasing oxidative stress parameters in the brain and recovering the memory impairment. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Cognitive impairment; Guanosine; Oxidative stress; Sepsis","carbonyl derivative; guanosine; thiobarbituric acid reactive substance; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; brain cortex; brain damage; cecum disease; cerebellum; cognitive defect; controlled study; corpus striatum; drug effect; hippocampus; male; neuroprotection; nonhuman; oxidative stress; prefrontal cortex; priority journal; protein carbonylation; rat; sepsis; task performance; Animals; Avoidance Learning; Brain; Cecum; Cognition Disorders; Guanosine; Habituation, Psychophysiologic; Ligation; Male; Memory; Neuroprotective Agents; Oxidative Stress; Protein Carbonylation; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Recognition (Psychology); Sepsis; Swimming; Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863874046

In the case of the BOF, a compressible oxygen jet reacts with a carbon-rich iron bath to reduce carbon levels and produce steel. The intensity of the process is governed by the speed of the jet and by the size and shape of the depression created in the metal and slag by the force of the jet, i.e. by the corresponding free surface. This is a difficult CFD problem, since there are compressible and incompressible regions in the flow domain, which need to be handled differently in a finitevolume (FV) pressure-correction scheme. Also, standard turbulence models do not account for compressibility, or the large difference in density between the cold oxygen jet and the hot reacting surroundings. Corrections are introduced to the k-ε model to remedy this deficiency and the results are validated against experimental data.

However, many local government units (LGUs) and the people themselves are not aware of the climate change phenomenon and do not have the capacity to undertake appropriate climate change adaptation measures. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the climate change adaptation strategies of communities and LGUs and the barriers and recommendations to enhance their adaptive capacity. Design/methodology/approach: The study covered five communities vulnerable to climate change impacts. Information on extreme climatic events and their impacts and adaptation strategies undertaken were gathered through focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews. LGU staff members were assisted in the preparation of their climate change adaptation plan (CCAP). Findings: The LGUs and communities have low adaptive capacity and employed temporary adaptation strategies. Strong social cohesion and spontaneous collective action are factors that could enhance the communities' adaptive capacity. The pursuit of awareness raising and capacity building activities on climate change phenomena, alternative livelihood, preparedness and adaptation possibilities, technology and infrastructure development and collective action, which are critical adaptive capacity enhancement factors were laid-out in the CCAP.

Due to a high water-level (WL) in pristine peatlands the decomposition process is retarded and therefore, northern peatlands contain about 30% of the global soil carbon (C) pool. Global warming will decrease the WL of these soil C hotspots and therefore, the responses of the decomposition process of plant litter to shifts in WL regime is of interest. Two important decomposer communities, fungi and actinobacteria, were studied in a diverse set of litters incubated over two years in a boreal peatland. The experimental design involved a non-treatment control and plots experiencing short-term (ca 4 yrs) and long-term (ca 40 yrs) WL drawdown. The responses of litter-inhabiting fungal and actinobacterial decomposers to environmental variables (WL regime, site type, litter quality) were evaluated using PCR-DGGE fingerprinting and direct sequencing of regions within the 16S and 18S ribosomal RNA genes after reverse transcription of RNA into its complementary DNA. The fungal sequences found in the decomposing litters represented organisms from a variety of fungal taxa, whereas most of the actinobacterial sequences were only distantly similar to known actinobacteria. Our results indicated that: (1) WL regime and site type had minor impacts on the litter-inhabiting microbial community composition, (2) litter quality had the strongest impact on the communities, especially on fungi; (3) decomposition stage had an impact on the fungal community composition, showing a possible change from mycorrhizal to saprotrophic fungi and (4) mass loss of the litters after the two-year-decomposition period was not related to the variation in fungal community composition and only to a negligible extent to the actinobacterial community composition. In relation to the decomposition process these results align with the idea of functional redundancy in microbial communities, which does not seem to be modified by moderate WL drawdown. Overall, our results indicate that the WL regime modifies the litter-inhabiting microbial communities largely indirectly via litter quality. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Actinobacterial community; CCA; DGGE; Fungal community; Litter quality; Peatlands; Water-level drawdown","Actinobacterial community; CCA; DGGE; Fungal community; Litter quality; Peat land; Water-level drawdown; Carbon dioxide; Decomposition; Forestry; Gene encoding; Global warming; Microorganisms; Polymerase chain reaction; RNA; Transcription; Vehicles; Water levels; Wetlands; Fungi; bacterium; community composition; decomposition; drawdown; experimental design; fungus; global warming; litter; microbial activity; microbial community; organic carbon; peatland; pristine environment; saprotrophy; soil carbon; soil microorganism; water level; Actinobacteria; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860877872

We study periodically gated graphene in a tight-binding model and find that, contrary to predictions based on the Dirac equation, it is possible to open a band gap at the Fermi level using electrostatic gating of graphene. However, comparing to other methods of periodically modulating graphene, namely, perforated graphene structures, we find that the resulting band gap is significantly smaller. We discuss the intricate dependence of the band gap on the magnitude of the gate potential as well as the exact geometry of the edge of the gate region. The role of the overlap of the eigenstates with the gate region is elucidated. Considering more realistic gate potentials, we find that introducing smoothing in the potential distribution, even over a range of little more than a single carbon atom, reduces the attainable band gap significantly.

Two of these, carbon sequestration and wood production, are often portrayed as conflicting. Currently, carbon management and biofuel policies are being developed to reduce atmospheric CO 2 and national dependence on foreign oil, and increase carbon storage in ecosystems. However, the biological and industrial forest carbon cycles are rarely studied in a whole-system structure. The forest system carbon balance is the difference between the biological (net ecosystem production) and industrial (net emissions from forest industry) forest carbon cycles, but to date this critical whole system analysis is lacking. This study presents a model of the forest system, uses it to compute the carbon balance, and outlines a methodology to maximize future carbon uptake in a managed forest region.Results: We used a coupled forest ecosystem process and forest products life cycle inventory model for a regional temperate forest in the Midwestern U.S., and found the net system carbon balance for this 615,000 ha forest was positive (2.29 t C ha -1 yr -1). The industrial carbon budget was typically less than 10% of the biological system annually, and averaged averaged 0.082 t C ha -1 yr -1. Net C uptake over the next 100-years increased by 22% or 0.33 t C ha -1 yr -1 relative to the current harvest rate in the study region under the optized harvest regime.Conclusions: The forest's biological ecosystem current and future carbon uptake capacity is largely determined by forest harvest practices that occurred over a century ago, but we show an optimized harvesting strategy would increase future carbon sequestration, or wood production, by 20-30%, reduce long transportation chain emissions, and maintain many desirable stand structural attributes that are correlated to biodiversity. Our results for this forest region suggest that increasing harvest over the next 100 years increases the strength of the carbon sink, and that carbon sequestration and wood production are not conflicting for this particular forest ecosystem. The optimal harvest strategy found here may not be the same for all forests, but the methodology is applicable anywhere sufficient forest inventory data exist. © 2012 Peckham et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Biome-BGC; Carbon budget; Carbon sequestration; Forest harvest; Forest products; Life cycle inventory; Temperate forest","biofuel; biome; carbon budget; carbon sequestration; data set; ecosystem service; emission inventory; forest ecosystem; forest inventory; forest management; harvesting; life cycle analysis; net ecosystem production; nutrient uptake; stand structure; sustainability; sustainable forestry; temperate forest; Midwest; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862270017

These volcanic impacts may be important for many reasons, in particular sulphur deposition has been shown to suppress peatland methane flux, potentially reinforcing climatic cooling. Experiments have shown that sulphur deposition also forces changes in testate amoeba communities, potentially relating to the reduced methane flux. Large volcanic eruptions in regions with extensive peatlands are relatively rare so it is difficult to assess the extent to which volcanic eruptions affect peatland microbial communities; palaeoecological analyses across tephra layers provide a means to resolve this uncertainty. In this study, testate amoebae were analysed across multiple monoliths from a peatland in southern Alaska containing two tephras, probably representing the 1883 eruption of Augustine Volcano and a 20th Century eruption of Redoubt Volcano. Results showed relatively distinct and often statistically significant changes in testate amoeba community coincident with tephra layers which largely matched the response found in experimental studies of sulphur deposition. The results suggest volcanic impacts on peatland microbial communities which might relate to changes in methane flux. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"deposition; methane; microbial community; paleoecology; peatland; sulfur; tephrochronology; volcanic eruption; volcanism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863858764

In-situ observations of many chemical components are rather sparse, and thus neither can accurately characterize the distribution of pollutants nor predict the effectiveness of emission control. Understanding (and controlling) the formation regimes for these components is important for the achievement of the reduction objectives established in the European legislation for PM2.5 (20% of PM2.5 triennial for the mean of urban background levels between 2018 and 2020). For this purpose, the present work uses the CALIOPE high-resolution air quality modeling system (12km×12km, 1h) to investigate the formation of SIA (SO 4 2-, NO 3 - and NH 4 +, which involve an important part of PM) and their gaseous precursors (SO 2, HNO 3 and NH 3) over Europe during the year 2004. The CALIOPE system performs well at estimating SIAs when compared to the measurements from EMEP monitoring network, but errors are larger for gaseous precursors. NH 3 is underestimated in the warmest months, HNO 3 tends to be overestimated in the summer months, and SO 2 appears to be systematically overestimated. The temporal treatment of ammonia emission is a probable source of uncertainty in the model representation of SIA. Furthermore, we discuss the annual pattern for each inorganic aerosol and gas precursor species over Europe estimated with the EMEP data and CALIOPE outputs, comparing the performance with other European studies. Spatial distribution of key indicators is used to characterize chemical regimes and understand the sensitivity of SIA components to their emission precursors. Results indicate that SO 4 2- is not usually fully neutralized to ammonium sulfate in ambient measurements and is usually fully neutralized in model estimates. CALIOPE and EMEP observations agree that the continental regions in Europe tend to be HNO 3-limited for nitrate formation. Regulatory strategies in such regions should focus on reductions in NO x (NO+NO 2) rather than NH 3 to control ammonium nitrate. This work assesses how well the CALIOPE system reproduces the spatial and temporal variability of SIAs and their gaseous precursors over Europe and complements the measurement findings. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Aerosol precursors; Air quality; Ammonia; Geochemistry; Model evaluation; Nitrate; Sulfate","Air quality modeling; Ambient measurement; Ammonia emissions; Ammonium nitrate; Ammonium Sulfate; Chemical component; Chemical regimes; European legislation; Gas precursors; Gaseous precursors; High resolution; In-situ observations; Inorganic aerosol; Key indicator; Model estimates; Model evaluation; Model representation; Modeling systems; Monitoring network; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Spatial and temporal variability; Sulfate; Summer months; Urban background; Air quality; Ammonia; Ammonium compounds; Atmospheric aerosols; Emission control; Geochemistry; Indicators (chemical); Nitrates; Nitric acid; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Reduction; ammonia; ammonium nitrate; inorganic compound; nitrate; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; aerosol composition; air quality; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; emission control; geochemistry; in situ measurement; nitrate; nitrogen; spatiotemporal analysis; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; accuracy; aerosol; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality; air quality standard; ambient air; article; CALIOPE system; chemical composition; climate change; controlled study; Europe; exhaust gas; field emission; flow measurement; gas; particulate matter; priority journal; reduction; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; summer; uncertainty; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857909013

The high sensitivity of the oxbow lakes, fens, fauna, and flora remains to climate variations - especially to changes in water level connected with the ag-gradation-erosion cycle of rivers - allows the reconstruction of the palaeoecological changes that oc-curred in the mire. The frequency and timing of hydroclimatic oscillations at Kopanicha show strong similarities to records from other sites in Poland. Changes in Cladocera frequency and plant assem-blages were mostly influenced by the Rawka River which controlled the hydrological regime of the mire. The main factors controlling the presence of Cladocera taxa were the water level and the pres-ence of favourable conditions in the mire (e.g. pH, vegetation). Most of the changes occurred in re-sponse to climate changes, but some of them were connected with local factors. © 2011 Silesian University of Technology, Gliwice, Poland.

The structural and morphological studies were performed by the measurements of X-ray diffraction profiles and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. The pure phase of SrY 2O 4 appeared after annealing at 1300°C and the doping of RE ions did not show any effect on the structural properties. From the SEM images, the closely packed particles were observed due to the roughness of each particle tip. The photoluminescence (PL) analysis of individual RE ions activated SrY 2O 4 phosphors exhibits excellent emission properties in their respective regions. The Eu 3+ co-activated SrY 2O 4:Tb 3+ phosphor creates different emissions by controlling the energy transfer from Tb 3+ to Eu 3+ ions. Based on the excitation wavelengths, multiple (green, orange and white) emissions were obtained by Sm 3+ ions co-activated with SrY 2O 4:Tb 3+ phosphors. The decay measurements were carried out for analyzing the energy transfer efficiency and the possible ways of energy transfer from donor to acceptor. The cathodoluminescence properties of these phosphors show similar behavior as PL properties except the energy transfer process. The obtained results indicated that the energy transfer process was quite opposite to the PL properties.

This overview addresses the need for review of this burgeoning literature by summarizing opinions of previous reviews and trends in recent studies on the impacts of climate change on plant health. Sudden Oak Death is used as an introductory case study: Californian forests could become even more susceptible to this emerging plant disease, if spring precipitations will be accompanied by warmer temperatures, although climate shifts may also affect the current synchronicity between host cambium activity and pathogen colonization rate. A summary of observed and predicted climate changes, as well as of direct effects of climate change on pathosystems, is provided. Prediction and management of climate change effects on plant health are complicated by indirect effects and the interactions with global change drivers. Uncertainty in models of plant disease development under climate change calls for a diversity of management strategies, from more participatory approaches to interdisciplinary science. Involvement of stakeholders and scientists from outside plant pathology shows the importance of trade-offs, for example in the land-sharing vs. sparing debate. Further research is needed on climate change and plant health in mountain, boreal, Mediterranean and tropical regions, with multiple climate change factors and scenarios (including our responses to it, e. g. the assisted migration of plants), in relation to endophytes, viruses and mycorrhiza, using long-term and large-scale datasets and considering various plant disease control methods. © 2012 KNPV.","Adaptive ecosystem management; Biotic interactions; Landscape pathology; Phytophthora ramorum; Plant disease epidemiology; Tree fungal pathogens","adaptive management; boreal forest; climate change; climate effect; colonization; data set; deciduous forest; disease control; ecosystem management; endophyte; epidemiology; fungal disease; Mediterranean environment; mycorrhiza; pathogen; precipitation (climatology); spring (season); stakeholder; synchrony; trade-off; tropical region; virus; California; United States; Phytophthora; Phytophthora ramorum",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859100603

All the EOs significantly reduced methane production with increasing doses, with reductions by 34.4%, 17.6%, 42.3%, 87%, and 25.7% for CLO, EUO, GAO, ORO, and PEO, respectively, at 1.0 g/liter compared with the control.

The concentrations of total volatile fatty acids were not affected by GAO, EUO, or PEO but altered linearly and quadratically by CLO and ORO, respectively. All the EOs also differed in altering the molar proportions of acetate, propionate, and butyrate. As determined by quantitative real-time PCR, all the EOs decreased the abundance of archaea, protozoa, and major cellulolytic bacteria (i.e., Fibrobacter succinogenes, Ruminococcus flavefaciens, and R. albus) linearly with increasing EO doses. On the basis of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis, different EOs changed the composition of both archaeal and bacterial communities to different extents. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') was reduced for archaea by all EOs in a dose-dependent manner but increased for bacteria at low and medium doses (0.25 and 0.50 g/liter) for all EOs except ORO.

The aim of this paper is to evaluate the response of these two rivers to changes that took place in Polish economy during the transition period (1988-2008). The economic changes encompassed: construction of nearly 900 waste water treatment plants in 1999-2008, modernization or closure of obsolete factories, economizing in water consumption, closure or change of ownership of State-owned farms, a drop in fertilizer application, and a decline in livestock stocking. More intensive agriculture and higher point source emissions in the Oder than in the Vistula basin resulted in higher concentrations of TN, nitrate (NO 3-N), and TP in the Oder waters in the entire period of our studies. In both rivers, nutrient concentrations and loads showed significant declining trends in the period 1988-2008. TN loads decreased by ca. 20% and 25% in the Vistula and Oder; TP loads dropped by ca. 15% and 65% in the Vistula and Oder. The reduction in phosphorus loads was particularly pronounced in the Oder basin, which was characterized by efficient management systems aiming at mitigation of nutrient emission from the point sources and greater extent of structural changes in agricultural sector during the transition period.

Expression of Mxr1-dependent genes is regulated in response to various carbon sources by an unknown mechanism. We show here that this mechanism involves the highly conserved 14-3-3 proteins. 14-3-3 proteins participate in many biological processes in different eukaryotes. We have characterized a putative 14-3-3 binding region at Mxr1 residues 212-225 and mapped the major activation domain of Mxr1 to residues 246-280, and showed that phenylalanine residues in this region are critical for its function. Furthermore, we report that a unique and previously uncharacterized 14-3-3 family protein in P. pastoris complements Saccharomyces cerevisiae 14-3-3 functions and interacts with Mxr1 through its 14-3-3 binding region via phosphorylation of Ser215 in a carbon source-dependent manner. Indeed, our in vivo results suggest a carbon source-dependent regulation of expression of Mxr1-activated genes by 14-3-3 in P. pastoris. Interestingly, we observed 14-3-3-independent binding of Mxr1 to the promoters, suggesting a post-DNA binding function of 14-3-3 in regulating transcription.

Using local resources such as agricultural crop remains, municipal solid wastes, market wastes and animal waste, energy (biogas), and manure are derived by anaerobic digestion. The hydrolysis process, where the complex insoluble organic materials are hydrolysed by extracellular enzymes, is a rate-limiting step for anaerobic digestion of high-solid organic solid wastes. Biomass pretreatment and hydrolysis are areas in need of drastic improvement for economic production of biogas from complex organic matter such as lignocellulosic material and sewage sludge. Despite development of pretreatment techniques, sugar release from complex biomass still remains an expensive and slow step, perhaps the most critical in the overall process. This paper gives an updated review of the biotechnological advances to improve biogas production by microbial enzymatic hydrolysis of different complex organic matter for converting them into fermentable structures. A number of authors have reported significant improvement in biogas production when crude and commercial enzymes are used in the pretreatment of complex organic matter. There have been studies on the improvement of biogas production from lignocellulolytic materials, one of the largest and renewable sources of energy on earth, after pretreatment with cellulases and cellulase-producing microorganisms. Lipids (characterised as oil, grease, fat, and free long chain fatty acids, LCFA) are a major organic compound in wastewater generated from the food processing industries and have been considered very difficult to convert into biogas. Improved methane yield has been reported in the literature when these lipid-rich wastewaters are pretreated with lipases and lipase-producing microorganisms. The enzymatic treatment of mixed sludge by added enzymes prior to anaerobic digestion has been shown to result in improved degradation of the sludge and an increase in methane production. Strategies for enzyme dosing to enhance anaerobic digestion of the different complex organic rich materials have been investigated. This review also highlights the various challenges and opportunities that exist to improve enzymatic hydrolysis of complex organic matter for biogas production. The arguments in favor of enzymes to pretreat complex biomass are compelling. The high cost of commercial enzyme production, however, still limits application of enzymatic hydrolysis in full-scale biogas production plants, although production of low-cost enzymes and genetic engineering are addressing this issue. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.","Anaerobic digestion; Complex organic matter; Enzymes; Hydrolysis; Improved biogas production","Agricultural crops; Alternative source; Animal wastes; Biogas production; Commercial enzymes; Economic production; Enzymatic treatments; Extracellular enzymes; Food processing industry; High costs; High-solids; Lignocellulosic material; Long chain fatty acid; Methane production; Methane Yield; Organic materials; Organic solid wastes; Pre-Treatment; Pretreatment technique; Rate-limiting steps; Renewable sources; Research and application; Anaerobic digestion; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Biomass; Degradation; Enzymatic hydrolysis; Enzymes; Food processing; Fossil fuels; Genetic engineering; Hydrolysis; Lipases; Manures; Methane; Microorganisms; Organic compounds; Sewage sludge; Sugars; Biogas; biogas; cellulase; fat; fossil fuel; lignocellulose; long chain fatty acid; methane; microbial enzyme; oil; organic compound; organic matter; triacylglycerol lipase; anaerobic digestion; biomass; biotechnological production; biotechnology; crop; economic aspect; energy resource; energy yield; enzyme synthesis; fermentation; food industry; food processing; genetic engineering; hydrolysis; manure; market; medical literature; medical research; microbial degradation; municipal solid waste; nonhuman; priority journal; renewable energy; review; sludge; sludge treatment; solid waste; waste management; waste water; Biofuels; Bioreactors; Biotechnology; Enzymes; Animalia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860633024

To implement this policy effectively, the applicability of SWHs in different regions must be analyzed. Previous studies generally performed SWH benefit-cost analyses based on total annual solar radiation; however, this method may overestimate energy production benefits because, for an SWH, the solar energy captured today cannot be preserved. Therefore, this study proposes the concept of effective solar radiation (ESR), which is based on potential heat output estimated using tap water temperature and solar radiation in each region. The benefits of SWHs are then assessed based on the number of effective days and ESR, instead of using total annual solar radiation. A procedure is established to evaluate the applicability of SWHs in each region based on proposed benefit-cost analyses. Possible outcomes of a national SWH program are estimated. The sensitivities of essential factors, including collector efficiency, installation cost, and discount rate, are also analyzed. Analytical results show that the ratios of ESR to total annual solar radiation for regions in Taiwan are about 82-89%. The payback periods vary at 6-15 years for different regions and heater types being replaced. The national program is expected to reduce greenhouse gases emissions by approximately 150,000 tons eCO 2 annually. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

these feedbacks involve the erosion of silicate rocks and organic-carbon-bearing rocks. The integrated effect of these processes is reflected in the calcium carbonate compensation depth, which is the oceanic depth at which calcium carbonate is dissolved. Here we present a carbonate accumulation record that covers the past 53 million years from a depth transect in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. The carbonate compensation depth tracks long-term ocean cooling, deepening from 3.0-3.5-kilometres during the early Cenozoic (approximately 55-million years ago) to 4.6 kilometres at present, consistent with an overall Cenozoic increase in weathering. We find large superimposed fluctuations in carbonate compensation depth during the middle and late Eocene.

The surface dislocations have been effectively modulating the oxygen reduction characteristics of Pt through synergistic effects of the interacting species. The simultaneous enhancement of dispersion of Pt and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity with a low weight percentage of dispersed Pt has been attained by FeN x doping, which increases the density of the active sites owing to the formation of fine and abundant delaminated regions on the CNF surface. HR-TEM images clearly depict the fine distribution of Pt nanoparticles on the delaminated regions of FeN xCNF. The stable incorporation of Pt on nitrogen doped active sites has been further confirmed by observing the formation of Pt-N peak at 391.5 eV using XPS analysis. The fine distribution of Pt nanoparticles along the abundant nanopockets between the buckled graphene layers helped the system to attain significantly high electrochemically active surface area of Pt as evident from the cyclic voltammetric studies.

We grew 600 seedlings of ten species of the economically important Dipterocarpaceae in experimental gradients of shading (0.3-47.0% of full sunlight) and defoliation (0, 25%, 50% or 75% of leaf area removed). We assessed stem diameters initially, after 2 and 4 mo, and calculated relative growth rates (RGR) with a linear model. Shading interacted with defoliation, reducing RGR by 21.6% in shaded conditions and 8.9% in well-lit conditions. We tested three hypotheses for interspecific trade-offs in growth responses to shading and defoliation. They could be positively related, because both reduce a plant's access to carbon, or inversely related because of trade-offs between herbivore resistance and tolerance. We observed, however, that species varied in their response to shading, but not defoliation, precluding an interspecific trade-off and suggesting that plants tolerate shade and herbivory with differing strategies. Shading most strongly reduced the growth of species with less-dense wood and larger seeds. The strong and variable growth responses to shade, contrasted with the weak and uniform responses to defoliation, suggest that variation in light availability more strongly affects the growth of tropical tree seedlings, and thus community assembly, than does variation in herbivory.

The critical energy situation in South Africa and the highly coal dependent energy generation demonstrates the need to shift to a more sustainable way of living. The residential sector proves to be an optimal starting point to implement new technologies, especially for water heating. The residential hot water demand calculation shows that the annual demand in Gauteng is about 188 million cubic meters. In order to satisfy this demand, different technologies are investigated in this paper, where SWHs lie in focus. Due to the vast income inequality in Gauteng, and also in South Africa, it is obvious that there cannot be one single optimal solution suitable to all households. Therefore, this paper focuses on the differentiation of the residential sector into income groups to show the divergence in warm water demand and the applicability of alternative technologies. In order to analyse appropriate solutions for all income groups, low-cost alternatives are also analysed. The economic analysis shows that although SWHs have higher investment costs than conventional technologies, the payback periods are relatively short (between 3 and 4 years) for high and mid income groups. The payback periods will be even shorter when the planned electricity price tariff increase comes into effect. Furthermore, SWH utilisation has the additional effect of reducing the overall electricity demand up to 70% and greenhouse gas emissions significantly. In addition, SWHs are the most cost-effective water heating technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions for mid and high income groups with negative abatement costs. It is concluded that the SWHs are the most suitable option to decrease fossil energy consumption and reduce the household's expenditure for energy services, especially for mid and high income groups. For lower income groups the utilisation of solar energy can increase the access to energy services and living quality and, therewith, lessen the financial burden to meet their energy needs.","Abatement cost; Annual expenditure; GHG emissions; Income groups; Solar water heaters",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903996476

We put these recent events into the context of the 95-year air temperature record from St. Paul Island and with concurrent spatial meteorological fields. For March 2000-2005 the mean air temperature anomaly at St. Paul was 2.1. °C above the long-term mean, and for March 2007-2010 the mean temperature anomaly at St. Paul was 4.7. °C below the long-term mean. The only multi-year temperature deviations comparable to the first decade of the 2000s are a cold event from 1971 to 1976 followed by a warm event from 1978 to 1983. There was also a short warm event 1935-1937. The temperature transition between warm and cold events in the 1970s and 2000s took two years. While there are theoretical arguments for some physical memory processes in the North Pacific climate system, we cannot rule out that the recent warm and cold events are of a random nature: they are rare in the St. Paul temperature record, they are dominated by North Pacific-wide sea level pressure events rather than local Bering Sea processes, and they are consistent with a red noise model of climate variability. The 1970s transition appears to have an ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation) influence, while the recent events are likely connected to Arctic-wide warming. Evidence provided by the 95-year St. Paul meteorological record reinforces the idea that a red-noise model of climate variability is appropriate for the North Pacific and southeastern Bering Sea. We stress the importance of relatively rare sub-decadal events and shifts, rather than multi-decadal variability associated with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Thus, in the future we can expect large positive and negative excursions in the region that can last for multiple years, but there is as yet little predictability for their timing and duration. © 2012 .","Atmospheric patterns; Bering Sea; Climate change; Pacific Decadal Oscillation","Air temperature; Atmospheric pattern; Bering sea; Climate system; Climate variability; Mean air temperatures; Mean temperature; Meteorological fields; Meteorological records; Noise models; North Pacific; Pacific decadal oscillation; Physical memory; Sea level pressure; Temperature deviation; Temperature transition; Theoretical arguments; Atmospheric pressure; Climate change; Climate models; Nickel compounds; Sea level; Atmospheric temperature; air temperature; atmospheric dynamics; climate change; climate modeling; continental shelf; meteorology; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; sea level pressure; warm front; Alaska; Bering Sea; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Pribilof Islands; Saint Paul Island [Pribilof Islands]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862776929

However, assessments of treatment effectiveness may be improved with a more rigorous accounting of the fuel characteristics. We present two case studies to introduce a relatively new approach to characterizing fuels and predicting potential fire behavior, fuel consumption, and emissions in Southern forests using the Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS) and Consume. The first case study provides fine-scale (&lt;100. ha) examples of fuel treatments (prescribed fire, mechanical thinning, mastication, and herbicide treatment) and their potential effect on predicted fire behavior and effects on measured treatment units. The second case study evaluates potential fire behavior across a managed forest landscape (74,000. ha) in the upper Atlantic Coastal Plain, South Carolina.Results from the fine-scale assessment indicate that fuel treatments reduce reaction intensity, rate of spread, and flamelength by up to 58%, 57%, and 63%, respectively. Fuel loading of strata that control surface fire behavior (i.e., shrubs, grasses, fine woody fuels, and litter) range from 32.0Mgha -1 in the thinned, untreated unit to 8.5Mgha -1 in the unthinned unit treated with herbicides and prescribed fire. Based on model predictions, up to 80% less fuel would be consumed with concomitant reduction in emissions during a wildfire occurring in the treated units compared to the untreated unit.Assessments of potential fire behavior across the study area indicate that overall hazard is low to moderate for this forested landscape. However, localized areas of high surface fire and crown fire potential were identified. Plot- and stand-based modeling both suggest that the potential for high to extreme fire behavior exists for this landscape. Combined, the two case studies highlight the ability of the FCCS to represent measured fuel characteristics and predict differences in potential fire behavior resulting from fuel treatments. Even small differences in fuel characteristics resulting from fuel treatments or site variation could be detected, allowing the effects of both ecological processes and management actions to be quantified. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Fire behavior; Fire hazard; Fuel Characteristic Classification System; Fuel treatment effectiveness; Longleaf pine; Southeastern United States","Fire behavior; Fuel Characteristic Classification System; Fuel treatment effectiveness; Longleaf pine; Southeastern United States; Behavioral research; Fire hazards; Forestry; Fuel gages; Fuels; Herbicides; Research; Weed control; Fires; assessment method; coastal plain; coniferous tree; forest management; forestry modeling; fuel consumption; herbicide; landscape; spatial analysis; thinning; wildfire; Classification; Forest Fires; Forestry; Fuels; Hazards; Herbicides; Measuring Instruments; Pinus; Research; South Carolina; Weed Control; Atlantic Forest; South Carolina; United States; Pinus palustris; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859218464

The results reveal that the volume of CO 2 emissions increased as a result of changes in the input structure of the electricity of the services sector, such as ""electricity → amusement and recreation facilities → household demand"", ""electricity → retail trade → household demand"" and ""electricity → public administration (local) → local government demand"", indicating increasing dependence of services on energy input. I also find that the final demand shift changed CO 2 emissions, for example the rise in demand for integrated circuits in exports has contributed to increasing CO 2 emissions generated from electricity, the fall in demand for frozen fish and shellfish in household demand has contributed to decreasing CO 2 emissions from marine fisheries. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; CO 2 emission; Critical supply-chain paths; Japan; Structural decomposition analysis; Structural path decomposition analysis","Critical Paths; Critical supply-chain paths; Decision makers; Energy inputs; Input-output table; Japan; Life cycle CO; Local government; Marine Fishery; Path decomposition; Policy makers; Public administration; Retail trade; Services sectors; Structural decomposition analysis; Climate change; Decision making; Electricity; Global warming; International trade; Sales; Supply chains; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decision making; electricity generation; emission control; global warming; government; input-output analysis; policy making; public administration; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862220208

A mesocosm experiment was carried out to determine how the microbial community off the coast of Alabama may have responded to the influx of surface oil and dispersants. While the addition of glucose or oil alone resulted in an increase in the biomass of ciliates, suggesting transfer of carbon to higher trophic levels was likely; a different effect was seen in the presence of dispersant. The addition of dispersant or dispersed oil resulted in an increase in the biomass of heterotrophic prokaryotes, but a significant inhibition of ciliates, suggesting a reduction in grazing and decrease in transfer of carbon to higher trophic levels.

This has stimulated a response in many countries, which has led to a closer examination of energy conservation strategies for conventional fossil fuels. One way of reducing building energy consumption is to design buildings, which are more economical in their use of energy for: heating, lighting, cooling, ventilation and hot water supply. Passive measures, particularly natural or hybrid ventilation rather than air-conditioning, can dramatically reduce primary energy consumption. However, exploitation of renewable energy in buildings and agricultural greenhouses, can significantly contribute in reducing dependency on fossil fuels. Therefore, promoting innovative renewable applications and reinforcing the renewable energy market will contribute to preserving the ecosystem by reducing emissions at local and global levels. This will also contribute to the amelioration of environmental conditions, through a reduction in air pollution and greenhouse gases, by the replacement of conventional fuels with renewable energies. © Universiti Malaysia Pahang.","And environment impacts; Built environment; Energy efficiency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84875492099

Apart from the impact of increased traffic volumes, the major factor attributed to this failure is that of policy disconnect between the process of diagnosing air pollution and its management, thereby limiting the capability of local authorities to control traffic-related sources of air pollution. Integrating air quality management into the Local Transport Plan (LTP) process therefore presents opportunities for enabling political will, funding and joined-up policy approach to reduce this limitation. However, despite the increased access to resources for air quality measures within the LTP process, there are local institutional, political and funding constraints which reduce the impact of these policy interventions on air quality management. This paper illustrate the policy implementation gaps between central government policy intentions and the local government process by providing evidence of the deprioritisation of air quality management compared to the other shared priorities in the LTP process. We draw conclusions on the policy and practice of integrating air quality management into transport planning. The evidence thereby indicate the need for a policy shift from a solely localised hotspot management approach, in which the LAQM framework operates, to a more holistic management of vehicular emissions within wider spatial administrative areas. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Air quality action plans; Air quality management; Air quality objectives; Local transport plan; Policy implementation gap","air quality; atmospheric pollution; local government; policy implementation; pollution policy; traffic emission; traffic management; volume; air pollution control; air quality control; ambient air; article; environmental protection; local transport plan; policy; traffic and transport; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; England; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Policy; Local Government; Motor Vehicles; Planning Techniques; Vehicle Emissions; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857674465

It introduces a large pulse of harvest residues (brash) to the soil surface and can alter the balance between autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration. This study determined the influence of thinning, microclimatic factors and plant productivity on carbon (C) losses through the emission of carbon dioxide (CO 2) respired from thinning lines (brash lanes or BL) and the forest floor (FF: without brash) in a first rotation Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) forest in Ireland. Weekly measurements of CO 2 efflux were carried out using an Infra-Red Gas Analyser connected to static chambers; while soil moisture content and soil surface temperature were measured, using theta probes and data loggers, respectively. The soil respiration measurements were also correlated with the gross primary productivity (GPP) determined by eddy covariance techniques.The highest CO 2 efflux were observed at the peak of summer in July/2010 (FF=699.20mgCO 2m -2h -1 and BL=374.22mgCO 2m -2h -1) and were associated with maximum soil surface temperatures and higher rates of GPP. Soil temperature had a strong positive influence on the variation of CO 2 from the forest (FF=75% and BL=59%), and the temperature sensitivity (Q 10) of soil respiration from the FF (5.47) was higher than from the BL (2.72). Soil moisture was inversely correlated with soil respiration from both FF (R=-0.73, p&lt;0.0001) and BL (R=-0.53, p=0.003). The combined effect of temperature and moisture gave a better description of the variability in CO 2 respired from both the FF (R 2=0.85, p&lt;0.0001) and BL (R 2=0.67, p&lt;0.0001) than temperature and/or moisture alone. GPP was positively correlated with soil respiration with a stronger relationship observed in the FF (R 2=0.73, p&lt;0.0001) than the BL (R 2=0.45, p&lt;0.0001).

One possibility to combine the two is through linking Non-ETS offset project-based crediting schemes in the form of Joint Implementation or domestic offset (DO) projects with the EU ETS. Linking would allow non-ETS offset project-based CO 2 credits to be traded within the ETS market. This paper discusses the merits and drawbacks of the implementation of a DO scheme in the built environment in the Netherlands. The built environment can be characterised as a sector with a great diversity and significant energy savings potential. Emphasis is paid on the modalities for estimating energy savings under DO projects. The authors discuss if next to existing EU, national or regional policies in the Netherlands, DO could spur initiatives in sub-sectors or market areas that are difficult to reach with conventional policy instruments. Thus, despite the existing policy framework in this sector, there could be still space for DO to reach the untapped energy savings potential. DO can support activities and technologies that are not covered by other policy instruments, either because they are not part of the instruments focus or are above the minimum requirements of the incumbent policy targets. It is expected that some lessons from this study in the Netherlands can be taken into account also by other countries facing similar market circumstances, which have implemented several policy instruments and are considering DO schemes as an alternative for capturing part of the untapped energy saving potential in their end use sectors. Another possible advantage of DO is that is has the potential to reduce public spending on existing policy goals, when it is considered in conjunction with existing public financing instruments. In order to tap into this potential, there are a series of hurdles in place, like additionality and the current CO 2 price levels, while transaction and administration costs must be kept low. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Build environment; Domestic offsets; Energy efficiency; Non-ETS offsets; Policy instruments; Policy interactions","Build environment; Domestic offsets; Non-ETS offsets; Policy instruments; Policy interaction; Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Public policy; Instruments; carbon emission; emissions trading; energy conservation; energy efficiency; environmental economics; environmental policy; European Union; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864137002

The paper analyses the potential use of geothermal energy resources in eastern Baringo lowlands between Lake Bogoria and Silali prospects, which has an estimated potential of >2700 MWe, in creating the necessary adjustments needed to adapt to the impacts of recurrent droughts by locals. Opportunities for direct and indirect uses of geothermal energy exist in climate vulnerable sectors, such as, agriculture, fisheries, water, livestock production as well as alternative income generating activities such as, tourism, micro enterprises, aloe, honey and beeswax production, fabric dyeing and others using resources sourced from within a 50 km radius. The possibility of accelerated geothermal development and proposed utilisation schemes in causing maladaptation if unsustainably implemented is also discussed. The paper draws a Lindal diagram adapted to the study area showing potential utilisation in the above sectors, and new flow diagram showing potential for cascaded use of geothermal hot water through the different processes. An estimated capacity of 100 MWt and 100 MWe can be used in the potential utilisation schemes discussed in this article to meet local adaptation and lighting needs and much less in a cascaded process. Potential barriers and possible solutions are also discussed. The study concludes that geothermal energy is a vital option for adaptation in the study area if sustainably used. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, we compare specific energy consumption among countries in fossil power generation, steel, and cement sectors. The evaluations were conducted using common system boundaries, allocation, and calculation methods. In addition, we disaggregate within sectors, such as with blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) steel and scrap-based electric arc furnace (Scrap-EAF) steel. The results reveal that characteristics vary by sub-sector. Regional differences in specific energy consumption are relatively large in the power, BF-BOF steel, and cement sectors. For coal power generation and BF-BOF steel production, continual maintenance and rehabilitation are of key importance. We confirm these key factors identified in the previous work on our estimated numerical values. In BF-BOF steel production, corrections for hot metal ratios (pig iron production per unit of BOF crude steel production) and quality of raw materials have a large effect on the apparent specific energy consumption.

East of the Dowsing Fault Zone it is folded into a number of large periclines as a result of post-depositional halokinesis in the underlying Zechstein salt. It is sealed by the overlying Haisborough Group and younger fine-grained strata and is underlain by the Bunter Shale and Zechstein Group. As such it appears to be an attractive target for industrial-scale CO 2 storage. However, the very large masses of CO 2 that would have to be injected and stored if CCS is to be an effective greenhouse gas mitigation option are likely to cause (a) significant pore fluid pressure rise and (b) displacement of formation brines from the reservoir. A series of reservoir flow simulations of large-scale CO 2 injection was carried out to investigate these effects. A simple, 3D geocellular model of the Bunter Sandstone in the NE part of the UK sector of the Southern North Sea was constructed in the TOUGH2 reservoir simulator in which porosity and both horizontal and vertical permeability could be varied. The injection of CO 2 at various rates into the model through a variable number of wells for 50 years was simulated and the model was then run forward for up to 3000 years to see how pore fluid pressures, brine displacement and CO 2 distribution evolved. The simulations suggest that provided there is good connectivity within the reservoir, and 12 optimally distributed injection locations are used, 15-20 million tonnes of CO 2 per year could be stored in the modelled area without the reservoir pore pressure exceeding 75% of the lithostatic pressure anywhere within the model. However, significant fluxes of the native pore fluid (saline brine) to the sea occurred at a point where the Bunter Sandstone crops out at the seabed. This suggests that the potential environmental impacts of brine displacement to the sea floor should be investigated. The injected CO 2 fills only up to about 1% of the total pore space within the model. This indicates that pore fluid pressure rise may be a greater constraint on CO 2 storage capacity than physical containment within the storage reservoir. © 2012 Natural Environment Research Council.","Bunter Sandstone; Flow simulation; Modelling CO 2 injection; Southern North Sea","Brine displacement; Carbon dioxide injection; Fault zone; Geocellular models; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Lithostatic pressure; Pore fluid pressure; Pore fluids; Pore space; Reservoir pore pressure; Reservoir rock; Reservoir simulator; Sea floor; Southern North Sea; Storage capacity; Storage reservoirs; Variable number; Vertical permeabilities; Brines; Flow simulation; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Sandstone; Three dimensional; Water injection; Carbon dioxide; Bunter; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; fluid injection; modeling; permeability; porosity; reservoir rock; sandstone; seafloor; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862736495

This second fine-sand layer could advantageously contain adsorbing materials (e.g. activated carbons, wooden charcoals).

Among these models a warming trend is universal, but projected changes in precipitation vary in sign and magnitude. Two independent methods are applied: a dynamic global vegetation model to assess changes in plant functional types and bioclimatic envelope modeling to assess changes in individual tree and shrub species and biodiversity. The former approach investigates broad responses of plant functional types to climate change, while considering competition, disturbances, and carbon fertilization, while the latter approach focuses on the response of individual plant species, and net biodiversity, to climate change. The dynamic model simulates a region-wide reduction in vegetation cover during the 21st century, with a partial replacement of evergreen trees with grasses in the mountains of Colorado and Utah, except at the highest elevations, where tree cover increases. Across southern Arizona, central New Mexico, and eastern Colorado, grass cover declines, in some cases abruptly. Due to the prevalent warming trend among all 17 climate models, vegetation cover declines in the 21st century, with the greatest vegetation losses associated with models that project a drying trend. The inclusion of the carbon fertilization effect largely ameliorates the projected vegetation loss. Based on bioclimatic envelope modeling for the 21st century, the number of tree and shrub species that are expected to experience robust declines in range likely outweighs the number of species that are expected to expand in range. Dramatic shifts in plant species richness are projected, with declines in the high-elevation evergreen forests, increases in the eastern New Mexico prairies, and a northward shift of the Sonoran Desert biodiversity maximum. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","Bioclimatic envelope model; Biodiversity; Climate change; Dynamic global vegetation model; Southwest United States","bioclimatology; biodiversity; biological invasion; climate modeling; evergreen forest; global climate; grass; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; precipitation (climatology); shrub; twenty first century; vegetation cover; biological model; classification; climate change; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; growth, development and aging; methodology; plant; population dynamics; review; time; United States; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Biological; Plants; Population Dynamics; Southwestern United States; Time Factors; Arizona; Colorado; New Mexico; Sonoran Desert; United States; Utah; Poaceae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862976128

Thermodynamic theory has been applied increasingly to ecological studies to understand ecosystem resilience and integrity. Resilient ecosystems have complex structure and greater levels of biomass and functional diversity, which act to enhance the degradation of solar energy. Forests that exhibit these characteristics express thermodynamic efficiency through a greater capacitance effect that promotes cooler surface temperatures under extreme weather conditions. 2.With forest disturbance, complex structures and functional linkages are simplified, reducing the capacity of the system to degrade energy. Such changes can lead to dysfunctional ecosystem states, impaired provision of ecosystem services and a weakened resilience. 3.This study has applied indicators based on thermodynamic theory to a chronosequence of forest ecosystems in the UK, Germany and Ukraine. Surface temperatures were measured to test thermodynamic theories relating to energy degradation and temperature moderation. Grime's CSR model was applied to plant data to compare functional complexity in vegetation between stands. 4.Old-growth woodlands are shown to attenuate surface temperature more effectively than native species plantations. Consistently lower temperatures were observed in European old-growth forests with high proportions of biomass when compared to managed stands of similar species composition, suggesting a greater efficiency of energy degradation in complex forest ecosystems, particularly at higher temperatures. 5.Analysis of plant species data using Grime's CSR model indicated that old-growth forests ordinate towards competitive and stress-tolerant communities in contrast to intensively managed forests, which had a greater proportion of generalist and ruderal species. High CSR functional scores were associated with moderated temperature extremes. 6.Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest an important thermodynamic basis for conservation in the context of climate change. Conservation practice and management policy, which is based on preserving ecosystem complexity and function, can aid in mitigating the effects of extreme temperatures, enhancing vital services such as climate regulation, primary production and water retention. Old-growth forests have a significant climate mitigation role alongside other recognised ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration. © 2011 The Authors.

The authors tracked changes in children's respiratory health during a wood stove intervention in a rural mountain valley community heavily impacted by wood smoke-derived PM 2.5. Methods: Community-wide impacts on children's health were assessed by prospectively collecting surveys from parents of school children during four winter periods in Libby, Montana. Generalised estimating equations with a logit link were used to estimate the effect of reduction in ambient PM 2.5 on wheeze prevalence and other reported symptoms and infections. Results: Over 1100 wood stoves were replaced with new lower emission wood stoves or other heating sources. Ambient PM 2.5 was 27.6% lower in the winters following the changeout programme compared with baseline winters. There was a 26.7% (95% CI 3.0% to 44.6%) reduced odds of reported wheeze for a 5 μg/m3 decrease in average winter PM2.5. Lower ambient PM 2.5was also associated with reduced odds for reported respiratory infections, including cold (25.4% (95% CI 7.6% to 39.7%)), bronchitis (54.6% (95% CI 24.2% to 72.8%)), influenza (52.3% (95% CI 42.5% to 60.5%)) and throat infection (45.1% (95% CI 29.0% to 57.6%)).

The RCM dynamically downscales the coarse information provided by the Global Climate Models (GCMs) and provides high resolution information, on a subdomain covering Ireland. The RCM used in this work is the Rossby Center's RCM (RCA3). The RCA3 model is evaluated by performing simulations of the past Irish climate, driven by European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-40 data, and by comparing the output to observations. Results confirm that the output of the RCA3 model exhibits reasonable and realistic features as documented in the historical wind data record. For the investigation of the influence of the future climate under different climate scenarios, the Max Plank Institute's GCM, European Center Hamburg Model, is used to drive the RCA3 model. Simulations are run for a control period 1961-2000 and future period 2021-2060. The future climate was simulated using the four Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change emission scenarios A1B, A2, B1 and B2. The results for the downscaled simulations show a substantial overall increase in the energy content of the wind for the future winter months and a decrease during the summer months. The projected changes for summer and winter were found to be statistically significant over most of Ireland. However, the projected changes should be viewed with caution since the climate change signal is of similar magnitude to the variability of the evaluation and control simulations.

The intramolecular CH 3-S bond of the thioether pendant of [Ni I(dmmtc)](OTf) was cleaved in THF at 75 °C in the presence of the bulky thiol DmpSH, which acts as a proton source, and methane was formed in 31% yield and a Ni(II) thiolate complex was concomitantly obtained (Dmp = 2,6-dimesityphenyl). The CH 3-S bond cleavage of [Ni I(mtc)] + also proceeded similarly, but under milder conditions probably due to the lower potential of the [Ni I(mtc)] + complex.

The results indicate that the institutionalising of knowledge and knowledge exchange has been weak, especially compared to the implementation of Local Agenda 21, which also calls for action at the local level.

After incubation, the microbial community structure was compared via 16S and 18S rDNA denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The radioactive contamination with 137Cs and 90Sr was found to have little effect on community structure and no effect on the straw mineralization. The autoclaving and reinoculation of soil had a strong influence on the mineralization and the community structure. Additionally we analyzed the effect of soil treatment on mineralization and community composition. It can be concluded that other environmental factors (such as changing content of dissolved organic carbon) are much stronger regulating factors in the mineralization of wheat straw and that low-level radiation only plays a minor role. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","C-14; Chernobyl; Cs-137; Mineralization; Sr-90; Wheat straw","C-14; Chernobyl; Cs-137; Mineralization; Sr-90; Wheat straws; Agriculture; Cesium; Electrophoresis; Microorganisms; Mineralogy; Nuclear power plants; Radioactivity; Social sciences; Soils; Soil pollution; cesium 137; dissolved organic carbon; dissolved organic matter; DNA 16S; DNA 18S; radioactive material; strontium 90; unclassified drug; agricultural soil; Chernobyl accident; community composition; dose-response relationship; electrokinesis; microbial community; mineralization; nuclear power plant; radionuclide; soil pollution; sterilization; straw; wheat; agricultural land; article; autoclave; biomineralization; bioremediation; chemical composition; community structure; controlled study; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; environmental factor; incubation time; inoculation; isotope labeling; low energy radiation; microbial community; microcosm; microorganism; nonhuman; radiation dose; radiation sterilization; soil; soil pollution; soil treatment; straw; wheat straw; Base Sequence; DNA Primers; DNA, Ribosomal; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; RNA, Ribosomal, 18S; Soil Pollutants, Radioactive; Triticum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855801171

However, agricultural production is strongly influenced by the management decisions of growers, including their practices to modify the microclimate experienced by the growing crop; these adaptations have not been studied at the vineyard level, where managers on the ground are on the front lines of responding to global change. We conducted 20 in-depth interviews with winegrowers to examine farm-scale adaptive responses to environmental stresses, to understand the views and motivations of agricultural managers, and to explore adaptive capacity in practice. We found that growers tend to respond to stresses individually rather than collectively, except when facing severe, unfamiliar pests and diseases. Responses may be reactive or anticipatory; most anticipatory strategies have been short-term, in response to imminent threats. Growers tend to rely on their own experience to guide their management decisions, which may offer poor guidance under novel climate regimes. From using a Vulnerability Scoping Diagram, we find that changing exposure (vineyard location) and sensitivity (planting choices such as vine variety) have the biggest impact on reducing vulnerability, but that adaptations in growing or processing the crop in the vineyard and winery are easier to implement, much more commonly undertaken, and may also offer substantial adaptive capacity. Understanding the context of adaptations, as well as the decision-making processes motivating them, is important for understanding responses to global change. These findings highlight some innovations in adapting to global change, as well as some of the barriers, and point to the need for strategic investments to enhance agricultural resilience to climate change. In particular, strategies to enhance both effective and easy to implement farming adaptations, as well as broader-scale anticipatory, collective responses, could reduce vulnerability in the context of climate change. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Climate change; Climate change adaptation; Frost; Heat; Pests; Resilience; Vulnerability Scoping Diagram","adaptation; agricultural management; agricultural production; climate change; crop yield; ecosystem resilience; environmental stress; frost; global change; vine; vineyard; vulnerability; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860240658

Design/methodology/approach: A set of 100 home gardens and 40 bamboo groves were selected from Irongmara and Dargakona village, in Cachar district, Assam, North East India through random sampling. Sampling was done mostly for smallholders. Culm growth, carbon storage, carbon sequestration and carbon in litter floor mass and soil of bamboo growing areas in homegarden was explored from 2003-2007. Findings: Culm growth extension revealed the brief periodicity of culm growth in a single growth period. Of the total carbon storage soil contributed 84.6 per cent of the total (50.1 Mg ha-1) followed by carbon in above ground vegetation 15 per cent (9 Mg ha-1) and carbon in litter floor mass 0.4 per cent (0.2 Mg ha-1). Practical implications: Bamboo plantation development and its management in home gardens has social, ecological and economical benefits for the rural life in North East India and its promotion can become an effective choice for climate change mitigation strategy. Originality/value: Bamboo forms an important component in the traditional home garden system of North East India where the practice of bamboo cultivation and management provides an important sink for CO2. Village bamboos play an important role in local economics, societies and environments and, considering its potential to mitigate global climate change, the authors recommend the promotion of bamboo in agroforestry expanding practices and rehabilitation of degraded lands.

Consequently, a number of developmental activities are implemented in the country, and one of them is the installation of second generation liquid biofuel demonstration plants. In this study, two gasification-based biomass conversion technologies, methanol and combined heat and power (CHP) production, are assessed for commercialization. Spatial information on forest resources, sawmill residues, existing biomass-based industries, energy demand regions, possible plant locations, and a transport network of Eastern Finland is fed into a geographically explicit Mixed Integer Programming model to minimize the costs of the entire supply chain which includes the biomass supply, biomass and biofuel transportation, biomass conversion, energy distribution, and emissions. The model generates a solution by determining the optimal number, locations, and technology mix of bioenergy production plants. Scenarios were created with a focus on biomass and energy demand, plant characteristics, and cost variations. The model results state that the biomass supply and high energy demand are found to have a profound influence on the potential bioenergy production plant locations. The results show that methanol can be produced in Eastern Finland under current market conditions at an average cost of 0.22 €/l with heat sales (0.34 €/l without heat sales). The introduction of energy policy tools, like cost for carbon, showed a significant influence on the choice of technology and CO 2 emission reductions. The results revealed that the methanol technology was preferred over the CHP technology at higher carbon dioxide cost (&gt;145 €/t CO2).

Yet economic assessments of its effects are currently almost absent. Unlike most other marine organisms, mollusks, which have significant commercial value worldwide, have relatively solid scientific evidence of biological impact of acidification and allow us to make such an economic evaluation. By performing a partial-equilibrium analysis, we estimate global and regional economic costs of production loss of mollusks due to ocean acidification. Our results show that the costs for the world as a whole could be over 100 billion USD with an assumption of increasing demand of mollusks with expected income growths combined with a business-as-usual emission trend towards the year 2100. The major determinants of cost levels are the impacts on the Chinese production, which is dominant in the world, and the expected demand increase of mollusks in today's developing countries, which include China, in accordance with their future income rise. Our results have direct implications for climate policy. Because the ocean acidifies faster than the atmosphere warms, the acidification effects on mollusks would raise the social cost of carbon more strongly than the estimated damage adds to the damage costs of climate change. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Biological impacts; Business-as-usual; Climate policy; Damage costs; Economic assessments; Economic costs; Economic evaluations; Emission trends; Global problems; Marine organisms; Production loss; Scientific evidence; Social cost of carbon; Acidification; Climate change; Cost estimating; Developing countries; Economic analysis; Marine biology; Oceanography; Regional planning; Cost benefit analysis; acidification; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; developing world; economic activity; environmental economics; environmental policy; global change; household income; pollution effect; shellfish culture; China; Mollusca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864284440

The 1s2s 3S 1 states produced with a carbon target are further excited to 1s2p P2o3 state, but this type of excitation does not occur with an aluminum target. This excitation mechanism is attributed to resonant energy transfer from bulk plasmons in the carbon target.

Two common fluorophores, Rhodamine 123 and Acridine Orange, were used to stain U937 cells which were incubated, with and without either Carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorphenylhydrazon or the apoptosis inducer H 2O 2. The wo-FLT, which is a non-imaging quantitative measurement, was able to detect several fluorescence decay components and corresponding weights in a single cell resolution. Following cell treatment, both decay time and weight were altered. Results suggest that the prominent factor responsible for these alterations and in some cases to a shift in emission spectrum as well, is the intracellular fluorophore local concentration. In this study it was demonstrated that the proposed wo-FLT method is superior to color fluorescence based imaging in cases where the emission spectrum of a fluorophore remains unchanged during the investigated process.

An estimated 2 to 3 tonnes of sedimentary organic carbon (C org) was resuspended into the water column during a 9-day experiment. The majority of the sediment cores from within the disturbed area and areas towards the south showed a ∼30% increase in Corg content as well as an increase in carbon burial rates after disturbance, though with a reduction in carbon/phosphorus ratios. High specific surface area (SSA∼25 m 2 g-1) and low Corg/SSA ratios (mostly &lt;0.5) are typical of deep-sea sediments. The increased Corg values were probably due to the organic matter from dead biota and the migration and redeposition of fine-grained, organic-rich particles. Spatial distribution patterns of Corg contents of cores taken before and after disturbance were used to infer the direction of plume migration and re-sedimentation. A positive relationship was observed between total and labile Corg and macrobenthos density and total bacterial numbers prior to disturbance, whereas a negative relationship was seen after disturbance owing to drastic reduction in the density of macrofauna and bacteria. Overall decrease in labile organic matter, benthic biota and redistribution of organic matter suggest that the commercial mining of manganese nodules may have a significant immediate negative effect on the benthic ecosystem inducing changes in benthic community structure. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","Central Indian Basin; Deep-sea sediments; Disturbance experiment; Macrobenthos; Organic carbon; Phosphorus; Specific surface area","Bacterial numbers; Benthic biota; Benthic communities; Benthic ecosystems; Bottom water; Central Indian Basin; Deep sea sediment; High specific surface area; Labile C; Labile organic matter; Macro benthos; Macrofauna; Plume migration; Redeposition; Seabed minings; Sediment core; Sedimentary environment; Spatial distribution patterns; Water columns; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Carbon; Experiments; Manganese nodules; Organic carbon; Organic compounds; Phosphorus; Sedimentation; Sediments; Specific surface area; Sedimentology; manganese; organic carbon; organic matter; phosphorus; deep-sea sediment; deposition; ecosystem response; environmental disturbance; environmental monitoring; macrobenthos; manganese nodule; mining; organic carbon; organic matter; phosphorus; seafloor; sediment core; sedimentary rock; spatial distribution; water column; article; bacterial count; community structure; deep sea sediment; density; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; macrobenthos; marine bacterium; marine environment; mining; nonhuman; particle resuspension; plume dispersion; sediment; simulation; Carbon; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Indian Ocean; Models, Chemical; Phosphorus; Seawater; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical; Central Indian Basin; Indian Ocean; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862891021

The situation in Phoenix is particularly complicated by the large number of water providers, each with its own supply portfolio, demand conditions, and conservation strategies. This paper details spatial optimization models to support water supply allocation between service provider districts, where some districts experience deficits and others experience surpluses in certain years. The approach seeks to reconcile and integrate projections derived from a complex simulation model taking into account current and future climate conditions. The formulated and applied models are designed to help better understand the expected increasingly complex interactions of providers under conditions of climate change. Preliminary results show cooperative agreements would reduce spot shortages that would occur even without climate change. In addition, they would substantially reduce deficits if climate change were to moderately reduce river flows in Phoenix's major source regions, but have little effect under the most pessimistic scenarios because there are few surpluses available for re-allocation. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change; Multi-agency planning and coordination; Spatial optimization","Complex interaction; Complex simulation; Conservation strategies; Demand conditions; Future climate; Multi-agency planning and coordination; River flow; Service provider; Source region; Spatial optimization; Spatial optimization model; Computer simulation; Site selection; Water supply; Climate change; climate change; climate conditions; numerical model; optimization; river flow; spatial analysis; water supply; Arizona; Phoenix; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860869135

Poaceae and . Fabaceae genera. The diesel-fuel concentration in planted unfertilized and ammonium nitrate-supplemented soil was reduced 32-55% and 75-94%, respectively. The effect of phytoremediation was more distinct in unfertilized than in fertilized soil. Using correlation matrix analysis of the relationships between plant resistances to diesel fuel contamination, the number of soil microorganisms (including pollutant degraders) in planted soil, soil enzymatic and respiration activities, and pollutant removal, we found common regularities of phytoremediation of diesel fuel-contaminated leached chernozem for the tested plant species. In unfertilized soil, accumulation of plant biomass was a key point of pollutant removal. This occurred because plants were able to maintain the needed number and activity of hydrocarbon degraders in their root zones. In fertilized soil, the plant-pollutant-microbial interactions tended to intensify the metabolic activity of the soil biota, leading to a dramatic reduction in the hydrocarbon concentration in leached chernozem. At the same time, the relationships between plants and hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms were not weakened by fertilization. Maize (. Zea mays L.), sorghum (. Sorghum bicolor L.

These changes affect the availability and quality of ground and surface waters and accordingly the future productivity of agriculturally used landscapes. The integrated assessment of these changes requires a robust prediction of the potential future characteristics of soil temperature and moisture based on scale-appropriate, process-oriented models. Hence, we present the Soil Heat Transfer Module (SHTM) used as a component of the mesoscale decision support system DANUBIA, which is developed by the multi-disciplinary research project GLOWA-Danube (www.glowa-danube.de). DANUBIA is applied on the Upper Danube catchment to assess the future changes in water availability, quality and use based on Global Change scenarios. In order to cover the temporal and spatial resolution (1h, 1×1km) of the main model as well as the desired investigation period of 50 years, SHTM combines a variable time step conductive heat transfer algorithm with an analytical lower boundary condition to react to long-term climate change with minimal model drift. Changes in soil moisture and soil freezing are explicitly taken into account. The ground heat flux at the soil surface is computed by iterative closure of the energy balance including radiative, latent and sensible energy fluxes. Validation of the heat transfer scheme shows that the variable time step solution improves computational efficiency while imposing only minimal RMSE and phase shift errors. Furthermore, the analytical lower boundary stabilizes the long term heat balance and induces a rather small potential model drift in the order of 0.001Wm -2. Then the results of the full land surface model including SHTM are compared to measurements at 25 agrometeorological sites. Without site-specific parameterisation other than land cover type, we show that the model performs well (RMSE about 2K) in reproducing daily and annual top soil temperature dynamics over long simulation periods. The analysis of systematic model errors reveals that about 75% of the RMSE is attributable to uncertainties in meteorological input, canopy parameters and snow processes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy balance; GLOWA-Danube; Land surface; Mesoscale; Soil temperature","Canopy parameter; Carbon and nitrogen; Climate change impact; Conductive heat transfer; Energy fluxes; Global change; Global change impacts; Glowa-danube; Heat balance; Heat transfer model; Integrated assessment; Land surface; Land surface models; Land-cover types; Lower boundary; Lower boundary conditions; Mesoscale; Meteorological input; Minimal model; Multi-disciplinary research; Phase shift errors; Plant development; Potential Model; Process-oriented model; Regional scale; Research topics; Rigorous evaluation; Site-specific; Soil freezing; Soil surfaces; Soil temperature; Spatial resolution; Systematic models; Top soils; Transfer scheme; Variable time-step; Water availability; Artificial intelligence; Catchments; Computer simulation; Decision support systems; Energy balance; Errors; Heat flux; Heat transfer; Research; Soil mechanics; Soil moisture; Systematic errors; Temperature; Uncertainty analysis; Climate change; agricultural land; climate change; decision making; energy balance; environmental impact assessment; heat balance; heat transfer; integrated approach; land cover; nitrogen cycle; numerical model; soil moisture; soil surface; soil temperature; soil type; spatiotemporal analysis; water availability; Danube River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860212812

Because diesel fuels typically consist of hundreds of compounds, it is difficult to conclusively determine the effects of fuel composition on combustion properties. Surrogate fuels, being simpler representations of these practical fuels, are of interest because they can provide a better understanding of fundamental fuel-composition and property effects on combustion and emissions-formation processes in internal-combustion engines. In addition, the application of surrogate fuels in numerical simulations with accurate vaporization, mixing, and combustion models could revolutionize future engine designs by enabling computational optimization for evolving real fuels. Dependable computational design would not only improve engine function, it would do so at significant cost savings relative to current optimization strategies that rely on physical testing of hardware prototypes. The approach in this study utilized the state-of-the-art techniques of 13C and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and the advanced distillation curve to characterize fuel composition and volatility, respectively. The ignition quality was quantified by the derived cetane number. Two well-characterized, ultra-low-sulfur #2 diesel reference fuels produced from refinery streams were used as target fuels: a 2007 emissions certification fuel and a Coordinating Research Council (CRC) Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engines (FACE) diesel fuel. A surrogate was created for each target fuel by blending eight pure compounds. The known carbon bond types within the pure compounds, as well as models for the ignition qualities and volatilities of their mixtures, were used in a multiproperty regression algorithm to determine optimal surrogate formulations. The predicted and measured surrogate-fuel properties were quantitatively compared to the measured target-fuel properties, and good agreement was found. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon bond; Combustion engines; Combustion model; Combustion property; Computational design; Computational optimization; Cost saving; Current optimization; Diesel reference fuels; Distillation curves; Engine design; Fuel compositions; Hardware prototype; Physical testing; Pure compounds; Regression algorithms; Surrogate fuels; Blending; Combustion; Diesel fuels; Distillation; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Optimization; Refining; Sulfur; Fuels",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862699296

Both types of agriculture are under degradative processes due to mis-use of tillage implements, mis-management of crop residues and inappropriate links between grain and livestock productions. From the research conducted over the last three decades, the vast majority of beneficial tillage effects are transient. Conversely, the harmful effects of conventional tillage (CT) systems are long-lasting, if not permanent. The present paper aims at evaluating major achievements in conservation or no-tillage agriculture (CA or NT) research conducted in dry areas of Morocco and presenting important ways to implement these achievements within the Moroccan rural society. CA has been introduced in response to issues of soil conservation, drought mitigation and soil quality management. NT systems have resulted in reduced soil erosion, greater soil water conservation, improved soil quality and stable and higher crop yields. Changes in crop production practices due to shifting to NT or CA systems and retention of crop residues at or near the surface produced progressive qualitative and quantitative variations in soil organic matter. This can allow agriculture to contribute to country's efforts to reduce and control greenhouse gas emissions. These effects benefited both farmers and society in terms of higher returns and efficiencies. Under NT, benefits from improved agriculture's environmental performance must be added to remunerations of reducing costs of production and improving well-being of farmers. The other strong benefits that CA brings come from the opportunity for early sowing and savings in time, machinery and fuel. Even though, many agronomic, socio-economic and environmental benefits accrue from NT and increasing crop diversity; lack of incentives from the government and social factors encourage the continued use of CT systems. CA systems were sufficiently tested in research stations but found limited adoption in farm communities. The shift in the late nineties to more on-farm research did not result in the envisaged breakthroughs, mainly due to poor research-extension linkages and several social and technical barriers. Consequently, in order to realize durable agricultural growth, there is a huge challenge to out- and up-scale CA in Morocco through linkage of all stakeholders (farmers, developers, researchers, industrials and policy makers). This paper fulfills information gaps and presents a thorough discussion on constraints to CA adoption as well. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural system; Carbon sequestration; Conservation agriculture; Dry areas; No-tillage; Policy; Soil quality","agricultural management; agricultural policy; arid region; carbon sequestration; coexistence; cost-benefit analysis; crop production; crop residue; crop yield; emission control; greenhouse gas; growth rate; livestock farming; policy making; quantitative analysis; research work; rural area; soil conservation; soil erosion; soil quality; soil water; stakeholder; state role; tillage; traditional agriculture; Morocco",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860442004

Due to the periodic wet-dry climate of this region, it is likely that soils in these large constructed wetlands may become dry or partially dry (experiencing drawdown), which represent a challenge to managing and optimizing phosphorus (P) reductions in these systems. Therefore, we designed an experiment to study the interactive effect of hydropattern (batch vs. continuous flow) and the presence or absence of emergent vegetation on P exchange between surface water and organic soil in two sets of 12 mesocosms. These 24 mesocosms were filled with 30-cm deep peat soil, and each set were subjected to either high (12.5gm -2year -1) or low (3.4gm -2year -1) P loading from surface water. All treatments performed similarly prior to surface water drawdown with P reductions being relatively high for high P loading rates and being low for low P loading rates. Mesocosms subject to wet-dry-wet cycles exhibited a three- to four-fold increase in surface water effluent P concentrations immediately following soil re-flooding, which lasted 1-3 and 3-10 weeks for low and high P loading rates, respectively. The magnitude of P flux from sediment to surface water and the time period over which P release took place were P loading-dependent (higher loading led to higher P flux compared to lower P loading rates), and season-dependent (a longer duration of higher P flux experienced during dry- compared to wet-season drawdowns). Results indicated that hydropattern was the dominant factor affecting P flux to overlying surface water for the high P loading rate, while the presence or absence of emergent vegetation was the dominant factor influencing P release for the low P loading rate. Treatments lacking emergent vegetation generated the most particulate P (PP) for both high and low P loading rates. All P fractions were correlated to either hydropattern or inflow concentrations, for both low and high P loading rates, and, with the exception of PP, correlated to vegetation at low-P loading rate. Our results indicated that the presence or absence of emergent vegetation is a critical factor in the management of large constructed wetlands receiving low P loadings while hydropattern should be the focus in managing treatment systems receiving high loads of P. Regardless of the P loading rates, maintaining moist soils in large constructed wetlands is a good management strategy, particularly during dry climatic periods, to minimize soil P oxidation and P flux to surface water after soil re-flooding. © 2012.","Hydropattern; Macrophytes; Phosphorus reduction; Runoff; Storm water management; Wetlands","Climatic periods; Constructed wetlands; Continuous flows; Critical factors; Dominant factor; Emergent vegetation; High load; Hydropattern; Interactive effect; Loading rate; Low mass; Macrophytes; Management strategies; Mesocosms; Moist soil; Organic soil; P reduction; Peat soils; South Florida; Storm water management; Time-periods; Treatment systems; Water effluents; Anoxic sediments; Banks (bodies of water); Climatology; Effluents; Flood control; Phosphorus; Reduction; Runoff; Soils; Surface waters; Vegetation; Water management; Wetlands; Loading; constructed wetland; drawdown; flooding; macrophyte; mesocosm; organic soil; phosphorus; pollutant removal; runoff; stormwater; surface water; water management; water quality; Florida [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863400493

They have also been used to produce reduced-form models to examine situations where solving the more complex model underlying the MAC is difficult. Some important issues arise in such applications: (1) Are MAC relationships independent of what happens in other regions?, (2) are MACs stable through time regardless of what policies have been implemented in the past?, and (3) can one approximate welfare costs from MACs? This paper explores the basic characteristics of MAC and marginal welfare cost (MWC) curves, deriving them using the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis model. We find that, depending on the method used to construct them, MACs are affected by policies abroad. They are also dependent on policies in place in the past and depend on whether they are CO2-only or include all GHGs. Further, we find that MACs are, in general, not closely related to MWCs and therefore should not be used to derive estimates of welfare change. We also show that, as commonly constructed, MACs may be unreliable in replicating results of the parent model when used to simulate GHG policies. This is especially true if the policy simulations differ from the conditions under which the MACs were simulated. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate policy; Economic cost; Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Marginal abatement cost","Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Basic characteristics; Climate policy; Economic costs; Emissions prediction; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Marginal abatement costs; Policy simulation; Cost benefit analysis; abatement cost; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; policy analysis; policy approach; welfare economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864313741

The analysis of atomic scale structure requires high spatial resolution and high detection efficiency when it is integrated as a real device. Therefore, we analyzed these materials by laser-assisted three-dimensional atom probe. However, in the case of analyzing organic materials, there are some problems: carbon cluster ions are generated at field evaporation, the focused ion beam process of needle-shape sample is difficult, and so on. Moreover, the field evaporation of CNT occurs toward unfavorable direction. In this study, we propose the improvement of the focused ion beam processing. We evaluated the measurement condition to reduce carbon cluster ions. And the field evaporation of CNT is simulated for obtaining appropriate measurement condition. In the results section, the ideal needle-shape sample was prepared, and the wavelength dependence of the field evaporation was confirmed. Moreover, it revealed that it was important to change the distance between the specimen apex and the local electrode in the three-dimensional atom probe analysis of CNT.

Tree radial growth and carbon and oxygen stable isotope composition of latewood (δ 13C LW and δ 18O LW, respectively) from 1967 to 2007 were measured in P. halepensis trees from two sharply contrasting stand types: open woodlands with widely scattered trees versus dense afforested stands. In both stand types, tree radial growth, δ 13C LW and δ 18O LW were strongly correlated with annual rainfall, thus indicating that tree performance in this semiarid environment is largely determined by inter-annual changes in water availability. However, trees in dense afforested stands showed consistently higher δ 18O LW and similar δ 13C LW values compared with those in neighbouring open woodlands, indicating lower stomatal conductance and photosynthesis rates in the former, but little difference in water use efficiency between stand types. Trees in dense afforested stands were more water stressed and showed lower radial growth, overall suggesting greater vulnerability to drought and climate aridification compared with trees in open woodlands. In this semiarid ecosystem, the negative impacts of intense inter-tree competition for water on P. halepensis performance clearly outweigh potential benefits derived from enhanced infiltration and reduced run-off losses in dense afforested stands. We investigated whether stand structure modulates the long-term physiological performance and growth of Pinus halepensis Mill. in a semiarid Mediterranean ecosystem. The combined interpretation of latewood δ13C and δ18O and tree ring width series indicated that pines in dense afforested stands were consistently more water stressed and had lower stomatal conductance, photosynthetic rate and radial growth than pines in open woodlands for the last 40 years. In this semiarid ecosystem, the benefits of negligible inter-tree competition for water in open woodlands clearly outweigh potential benefits derived from enhanced infiltration and reduced runoff losses in dense afforested stands, thus rendering the latter more vulnerable to projected increases in drought frequency and duration across the Mediterranean region. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","δ 13C; δ 18O; Climate change; Competition; Plant-climate interactions; Stomatal conductance; Tree-ring; Water use efficiency","carbon; oxygen; rain; water; climate change; competition (ecology); coniferous tree; growth rate; isotopic composition; long-term change; Mediterranean environment; physiological response; semiarid region; stand structure; stomatal conductance; tree ring; vulnerability; water availability; water use efficiency; woodland; article; climate; drought; ecosystem; growth, development and aging; physiology; pine; Southern Europe; Spain; tree; Carbon Isotopes; Climate; Droughts; Ecosystem; Mediterranean Region; Oxygen Isotopes; Pinus; Rain; Spain; Trees; Water; Pinus halepensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860240340

It continues to be a very difficult task which requires employment of quite advanced analytical techniques. These products, despite a similar process of manufacturing, differ in taste and aroma. This happens due to the use of special breeds of animals, the application of appropriate feeding regimes as well as the effect of the place and climate. In order to perform correct identification of geographical origin, a good solution is to determine both stable isotopes as well as trace elements. It is essential to collect detailed meteorological and geochemical data and information about farming practices and to compare them with the obtained results. In a majority of cases, the performed identification is confined to species and the determination of the animal breed is very limited. In the case of individual breeds a comparative analysis of SNPs appears to present the highest potential, especially genes affecting the coat color of animals may serve as markers. Experiments confirm that genes responsible for pigmentation underwent mutations in individual breeds. Authentication on the basis of the manufacturing process appears to be easier to realize than tracing geographical origins. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","DNA analysis; manufacturing process; species/breed identification; stable isotopes; trace elements; tracing of origin","Analytical techniques; Comparative analysis; DNA analysis; Farming practices; Feeding regime; Geochemical data; Geographical origins; Manufacturing process; Stable isotopes; tracing of origin; Traditional food; Authentication; Genes; Industrial engineering; Isotopes; Production engineering; Trace elements; Animals; Animalia; animal; classification; Europe; food analysis; food contamination; meat; review; standard; Animals; Europe; Food Analysis; Food Contamination; Meat",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862105406

In a conventional engine control system, it is not possible to optimize the efficiency of the alternator in terms of emissions and fuel consumption, due to a constant voltage which is imposed and is not modifiable. On the contrary, in a system capable of controlling the voltage of the alternator, referring to such an alternator as ""smart"" hereafter, it would be possible to optimize its efficiency as a function of the vehicle/engine working points. This system requires first and foremost a communication protocol between the alternator and engine control unit, and a special sensor that gets data on the charging status of the battery. In this chapter a management strategy is proposed for regulating the alternator regulation voltage in order to maximize its efficiency on the basis of the engine and vehicle conditions. This is done by using an ""Intelligent Alternator Module (IAM)"" that communicates using the LIN protocol with the Engine Control Module (ECM), and an ""Intelligent Battery Sensor (IBS),"" which provides the information about the battery State-Of-Charge (SOC). These procedures are implemented for both gasoline and diesel engines and the expected improvement has been achieved: the average life of the vehicle battery has been increased, fuel consumption and emission have been reduced. In particular, measurements done have shown that consumption reduction due to the control system described above is about 2-3% on NEDC homologation cycle.

Quantitation of leaf isoprene emission and its response to environmental variation are described by empirically derived equations that replicate observed patterns, but have been linked only in some cases to known biochemical and physiological processes. Furthermore, models have been proposed from several independent laboratories, providing multiple approaches for prediction of emissions, but with little detail provided as to how contrasting models are related. In this review we provide an analysis as to how the most commonly used models have been validated, or not, on the basis of known biochemical and physiological processes. We also discuss the multiple approaches that have been used for modeling isoprene emission rate with an emphasis on identifying commonalities and contrasts among models, we correct some mathematical errors that have been propagated through the models, and we note previously unrecognized covariances within processes of the models. We come to the conclusion that the state of isoprene emission modeling remains highly empirical. Where possible, we identify gaps in our knowledge that have prevented us from achieving a greater mechanistic foundation for the models, and we discuss the insight and data that must be gained to fill those gaps. © 2012 The Authors.

At the same time, the EU policies promote material and energy recovery from waste, and the production of energy from renewable sources. In the energy system, the replacement of another energy production plant with a waste to energy plant (WTE) may either increase or decrease the total emissions. Cities and companies calculate their greenhouse gas emissions or carbon footprints using various calculation protocols, and a change from landfilling to waste incineration affects the emissions of these actors in various ways depending on the system boundaries. In this contribution, impact of a change from landfilling to WTE on the emissions of different actors is calculated for the case in which WTE replaces separate production of district heat (DH) by natural gas and electricity by coal. In the case of a waste management company, emissions decreased from about 51kt CO 2-eq in 2009 (before introduction of the WTE) to -33kt CO 2-eq in 2030. Emissions of DH company decreased by 40%, whereas at the city-level the combined emissions of waste management and district heat consumption decreased 60% between 2009 and 2030. The significance of the energy source to be replaced by energy from WTE on the potential GHG emission reductions was also calculated for different options. The emissions of electricity and district heat produced by WTE were 35-60% smaller than emissions from separate production of district heat by oil or natural gas and production of electricity by natural gas or coal. When electricity and DH produced by the WTE replaced those produced by alternative CHP plants, the impact varied from increase of emissions by 50% to decrease of emissions by 40% depending on the fuel of the CHP plant and electricity source used to cover the smaller electricity generation by the WTE. However, in all the cases, when the avoided emissions from landfilling were taken into account, the emissions of WTE were smaller than those of alternative waste management and energy generation options over time. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon footprint; City greenhouse gas emissions; District heat; Waste to energy","Avoided emissions; Calculation protocols; CHP plant; Climate change mitigation; District heat; Electricity generation; Electricity source; Energy generations; Energy production plants; Energy recovery; Energy source; Energy systems; EU policy; GHG emission; Heat consumption; Landfilling; Renewable sources; System boundary; Total emissions; Waste to energy; Waste-to-energy plants; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Electric generators; Electricity; Emission control; Energy conversion; Gas emissions; Industry; Natural gas; Separation; Waste incineration; Waste management; Greenhouse gases; carbon emission; climate change; ecological footprint; emission control; greenhouse gas; incineration; landfill; mitigation; pollution policy; urban area; waste management; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857680880

In order to analyze whether the mentioned deviations from the equation of state increase with the carbon dioxide content, it was decided to measure the (p, ρ, T) behavior of two additional mixtures with higher carbon dioxide molar fractions (x CO2=0.20,0.50). The new experimental data show again an appreciable disagreement with the GERG-2008 equation of state at low temperatures and high pressures.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is collaborating with the National Center for Atmospheric Research to quantitatively address the linkages between climate and human plague in this region. The aim of this paper is to advance knowledge of the climatic conditions required to maintain enzootic cycles and to trigger epizootic cycles and ultimately to target limited surveillance, prevention, and control resources. A hybrid dynamical-statistical downscaling technique was applied to simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) to generate a multiyear 2-km climate dataset for modeling plague in the West Nile region.

Topography exerts a first-order influence on the climatic gradients in West Nile, which lies in a transition zone between the drier East African Plateau and the wetter Congo Basin, and between the unimodal rainfall regimes of the Sahel and the bimodal rainfall regimes characteristic of equatorial East Africa.

Design/methodology/approach: Primary data from 116 female-headed households (FHHs) and 184 male-headed households (MHHs) is examined for the three Northern provinces of Cameroon. The survey generated information on the response and coping strategies to climatic variation; and the socioeconomic impacts of climate on households. The multinomial logit model is employed to establish the determinants of the choice selection for climate risk coping options by households. Findings: Both FHHs and MHHs are exposed to stresses related to food production and availability, low incomes and food accessibility and utilization of food supplies, heightened by the real and perceived effects of the variability of current climate. Short-term coping choices include diversification of livelihood which in turn impacts food accessibility and consumption choices. Practical implications: A seasonal pattern is revealed in household expenditure with households spending more than 70 percent of their income on food in spring. The lowest food expenditures are in summer. Market and income manipulation choices for food supply stability include a range of non-farm income generation strategies to cope with expected shortages induced by climatic variability. The current climate variation, household demography, and farming conditions via access to credit, tenure, and extension service delivery are significant determinants of coping choices for households perceiving change in climatic patterns. Originality/value: Significant seasonal patterns in household food availability, accessibility and utilization are observed with important implications for both household welfare and as precursor to long-term adaptation to climate change. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Cameroon; Climate change; Climate variation; Climatology; Coping choices; Female-headed household; Food crops; Food security","adaptive management; climate change; climatology; coping strategy; demography; female headed household; food availability; food production; food security; food supply; gender issue; household expenditure; household survey; logit analysis; low income housing; patriarchy; perception; risk assessment; seasonality; socioeconomic impact; sustainability; Cameroon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864557708

Whereas correlation statistics were designed to show the relationship between variables, autocorrelation statistics are designed to show the correlations within variables, and spatial autocorrelation shows the correlation within variables across space. Most natural ecological phenomena display spatial autocorrelation found at all spatial scales. Although the spatial autocorrelation concept was developed principally in the late 1950s, it has been applied in environmental economic studies for less than a decade and primarily as a new explanatory variable in the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) relationship. Spatial ecological autocorrelation is often driven by multiple causes that may be exogenous or endogenous. Maddison (2007) specifies three endogenous mechanisms of spatial environmental autocorrelation: pollution displacement hypothesis, foreign direct investment (FDI) and international trade, and finally, the strategic response of countries to transboundary pollution flows. In the pollution displacement hypothesis, higher-income countries import pollution-intensive goods and in fact export their pollution to lower-income countries. As numerous empirical analyses have identified distance as an important factor in determining the volume of trade, a country's emissions should be influenced by its neighbors. FDI and international trade are the mechanisms of technology diffusion. Again, distance is a determinant of technology diffusion, and consequently one might expect spatial autocorrelation through FDI and international trade. Finally, spatial autocorrelation may occur as a consequence of countries' strategic response to transboundary pollution flows. In this case, the spatial relationship between countries is defined not by distance, but by the meteorologically determined pattern of transboundary deposition of pollutions. This paper examines a new mechanism for spatial environmental autocorrelation through institutions. In this mechanism, when the institutions of a country affect its own environmental quality, they affect the institutions of their neighbors simultaneously. This mechanism, which can be called the spatial institutional spillover effect, links the environmental quality of countries together. Materials and Methods: Two recent findings about the features of institutions influence the subject of this paper. First, institutions and institutional quality can affect the quality of environment. Second, institutional quality can spread spatially. Theoretically, a combination of these two features paves our way to the idea that the environmental quality of geographic units (especially countries) can spread through institutions. In other words, when the institutional quality of a referred country affects its own level of environmental degradation and simultaneously, changes the institutional quality of its neighboring countries, one may claim that the environmental quality of countries can be spread to the neighboring countries by the mechanism of spatial institutional spillover. Previous studies provide the cornerstones of this hypothesis. Theoretically, the combination of the studies leads the researchers to the hypothesis about the existence of spatial environmental autocorrelation through the spatial institutional spillover effect. To examine this effect and find its direction, it is required to design a model that can estimate the impacts of the institutional quality of countries and their neighbors on an indicator of environmental quality in the context of the EKC relationship. When institutional quality indicators have been designed primarily for using at a national level, it is more sensible to test the hypothesis for transboundary pollutions, such as CO2 pollutant. CO2 has the longest panel data among other global and local pollutants, which makes it more attractive for empirical studies, especially time series and panel data modeling. To consider and measure the spatial spillover of institutions, the spatial configuration of geographic units should be considered in the econometric model. Spatial econometrics has been designed to measure the impact of spatial configuration and its consequences, such as spatial dependence and heterogeneity, by using a spatial weight matrix (usually labeled as matrix W). When N is the number of geographic units, i.e. cross-sections, W is an N × N matrix with zeroes on its main diagonal. The off-diagonal elements, W1J, represent the spatial relationship between cross-sections i and j. Based on the first law of Tobler, the common method for the formation of W1J is to use the contiguity measures for the nearest neighbors. Tobler (1970) believes that everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than the distant ones. Under this law, a first-order contiguity matrix can be designed when W1J = 1 if i and j are such that there is no observation closer to either i or j, and zero otherwise. In this case where cross-sections are countries, the first-order contiguity matrix, W, is defined based on the common land borders. A transformation often used in practical works, such as ours, converts the matrix W to have row-sums equal to unity. This matrix is referred to as a 'standardized first-order contiguity matrix'. Conclusion: The results from different models showed that the institutional spillover effect is the primary determinant of environmental quality in every country. The results show that improving and deepening of good governance in MENA countries could reduce CO2 pollution in their own countries and in their neighboring ones. Spatial environmental autocorrelation is a phenomenon in which environmental variables are correlated with each other across the space. Different mechanisms have been proposed by other authors to justify the phenomenon, the pollution displacement hypothesis, FDI, international trade, and finally, the strategic response of countries to transboundary pollution flows. In this paper, another mechanism to explain the environmental autocorrelation of countries was examined through the spatial institutional spillover effect. The results from different models showed that the institutional spillover effect is the primary determinant of environmental quality in every country. In other words, spatial spillover of the institutional quality of countries on their neighbors and its impact on the environmental quality of countries is a channel that has been active in recent decades. Indeed, results should increase the sensitivity of environmental policy-makers about the institutional conditions of their own and neighboring countries. The quality of governance in neighboring countries can affect not only their own environmental quality, but also our environmental conditions. It is more evident that the environmental and institutional pillars of sustainable development are linked not only domestically, but also internationally together. Therefore, integrated regional programs to improve the different pillars of sustainable development should receive more attention by the governments.","Institutional development; JEL classification: C33, H11, 053, Q56; MENA region; Panel data model; Spatial autocorrelation; Spatial spillover of good governance",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921775406

The case study demonstrates the feasibility of the outlined approach: Policy 1 increases efficacy by a factor of up to 3.7, and Policy 2 reduces annual CO 2 by 1.5 million metric tons, showing that a comparison of diverse multiagency policies at a sketch planning level is productive.

To date, however, it is unclear whether these plans are being implemented or have any causal effects on emissions. Using data from California, I provide the first quantitative analysis of the impacts of climate plans. I find that cities with climate plans have had far greater success in implementing strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions than their counterparts without such plans. For example, they have more green buildings, spend more on pedestrian and bicycle infrastructure, and have implemented more programs to divert waste from methane-generating landfills. I find little evidence, however, that climate plans play any causal role in this success.

For wintertime, numerical prediction of snowfall amounts is done by applying an estimated snow-to-liquid ratio to the liquid-equivalent QPF from the NWP model. A method has been developed to use prognostic fields from a detailed bulk scheme to predict the instantaneous snow-to-liquid ratio of precipitating snow. By exploiting aspects of the parameterization of the large crystal/aggregate (snow) category, which allow for a prediction of the mean particle size and a corresponding realistic bulk density, combined with pristine ice and graupel fields, the total volume flux of ice-phase precipitation (excluding hail) is computed, independently from the computation of the total solid mass flux. Ultimately, the accumulated unmelted solid precipitation quantity is thus predicted without having to estimate the average snow-to-liquid ratio for a given event, as is typically done for wintertime QPF. The new technique has been implemented into the two-moment version of the Milbrandt-Yau microphysics scheme, whichwas used in a high-resolution (2.5 and 1 km)NWPmodeling systemover theVancouver- Whistler region of Canada in support of forecasting for the Vancouver 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Experimental fields were produced including the instantaneous snow-to-liquid ratio and the snowfall accumulation predicted directly from the scheme using the new approach. Subjective evaluation indicates that the model can discriminate between low-density and high-density snow for instantaneous precipitation. Comparison of the predicted snow-to-liquid ratio to observed climatologies indicates that the scheme produces a realistic probability distribution.","Cloud resolving models; Ice particles; Numerical weather prediction/forecasting; Parameterization; Snow cover","Bulk density; Bulk microphysics; Cloud resolving model; High resolution; Ice particles; Large crystal; Low density; Mean particle size; Microphysics; Numerical predictions; Numerical weather prediction; NWP model; Olympics; Parameterizations; Precipitating snow; Quantitative precipitation forecasting; Snow covers; Snow-to-liquid ratio; Solid precipitation; Subjective evaluations; Surface precipitation; Total solids; Volume flux; Climatology; Ice; Numerical models; Parameterization; Physics; Probability distributions; Snow; Weather forecasting; Liquids; bulk density; climatology; ice; parameterization; particle size; precipitation (climatology); prediction; probability; snow cover; weather forecasting; British Columbia; Canada; Vancouver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866341097

To have a meaningful impact, CCS infrastructure will have to be deployed on a massive scale; in the U.S. this will require capturing CO 2 from hundreds of fossil fuel power plants and building a dedicated pipeline network to transport a volume of CO 2 greater than domestic oil consumption. In this paper, we analyze the effect of geologic reservoir uncertainty on constructing CCS infrastructure-geologic uncertainty can impact reservoir cost and capacity estimates by as much as an order of magnitude. This uncertainty propagates through the capture-transport-storage system, influencing decisions including where and how much CO 2 should be captured. We demonstrate the effect of geologic uncertainty using a proposed oil shale industry that could generate tens of millions of tonnes of CO 2 each year. We show that uncertainty can make transport and storage costs deviate by over 100% and that CCS infrastructure, particularly the optimal pipeline network, can considerably diverge spatially. Finally, we draw conclusions on how geologic uncertainty may end up being a driving factor on how major industries decide to manage produced CO 2. © 2012.","CO 2 storage; Infrastructure; Optimization; Saline aquifers; System modelling; Uncertainty","Domestic oil; Driving factors; Geologic reservoirs; Infrastructure; Oil shale industry; Pipeline networks; Saline aquifers; Storage costs; Storage infrastructure; System modelling; Uncertainty; Aquifers; Climate change; Cost benefit analysis; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Optimization; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon dioxide; aquifer; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; emission control; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; infrastructure; optimization; uncertainty analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858110772

Further, we illustrate research linking adjacent process scales, such that critical information is passed from one process scale to the next adjacent scale. We demonstrate this cross-scale approach using real world CO2 capture and storage data, including a scenario managing CO2 emissions from a large U.S. electric utility. At the pore scale, we present a new method for incorporating pore-scale surface tension effects into a relative permeability model of CO2-brine multiphase flow at the reservoir scale. We benchmark a reduced complexity model for site-scale analysis against a rigorous physics-based reservoir simulator, and include new system level considerations including local site-scale pipeline routing analysis (i.e., reservoir to site scale). We also include costs associated with brine production and treatment at the site scale, a significant issue often overlooked in CCS studies.

Despite the common hope that reserves play this role, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of local protection against global problems is lacking. Here we show that marine reserves increase the resilience of marine populations to a mass mortality event possibly caused by climate-driven hypoxia. Despite high and widespread adult mortality of benthic invertebrates in Baja California, Mexico, that affected populations both within and outside marine reserves, juvenile replenishment of the species that supports local economies, the pink abalone Haliotis corrugata, remained stable within reserves because of large body size and high egg production of the protected adults. Thus, local protection provided resilience through greater resistance and faster recovery of protected populations. Moreover, this benefit extended to adjacent unprotected areas through larval spillover across the edges of the reserves. While climate change mitigation is being debated, coastal communities have few tools to slow down negative impacts of global environmental shifts. These results show that marine protected areas can provide such protection. © 2012 Micheli et al.",,"abalone; article; benthos; body size; climate change; controlled study; ecosystem resilience; egg production; environmental impact; environmental management; environmental protection; geographic distribution; Haliotis corrugata; hypoxia; marine environment; Mexico; mortality; nonhuman; population dynamics; Animals; California; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Gastropoda; Invertebrates; Mexico; Oceans and Seas; Haliotis corrugata; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863993410

Carbonate alkalinity (CA) refers to the cases in which only bicarbonate and carbonate species are considered. Total alkalinity (Alk) implies additional species having acid-base properties. Biochemical processes give rise to the organic alkalinity (OA) in natural waters. The value of these topics is obvious if we refer to the plethora of publications in this field. As a matter of fact, the approaches towards Alk provide ambiguous results and those for CA arouse some reservations as well. Having this in mind, a new approach for alkalinity determination, presented in recent review paper published in this journal (Crit. Rev. Anal. Chem. 2011, 41, 151), was developed in a more systematic and complete way, and new acronyms, TAL for total alkalinity and CAM for carbonate alkalinity, were introduced in that article. The methods proposed there and here are based on potentiometric pH titration, as the most common method applied for studying acid-base properties of humic substances (humic and fulvic acids). The parameters involved with CAM are resolved with the use of an Excel spreadsheet for the resolution of linear equations, whereas the parameters of a nonlinear regression equation referring to the TAL method are obtainable according to a more advanced, iterative computer program. A compact approach to CAM, based on the modified Gran II method, is carried out, but in a manner quite different and more thorough than the ones presented hitherto. Except for equivalence volumes, the CAM method enables evaluating the activity coefficient of hydrogen ions and values for (hybrid and concentration) dissociation constants of carbonic acid and ionic product of water. The possibilities and limitations of this method are tested by using a simulation procedure. The results obtained from simulated titrations provide the reference level related to error-free V and pH values at the points of titration curve ph = ph(V), ph = - log h, h - activity of hydrogen ions. The TAL model with Simms constants involved allows ""homogenizing"" the treatment of mono- and polyprotic acids and bases, especially those of undefined composition, i.e., carbonate species, fulvic acids, and their soluble complexes with metal ions. The TAL model may also be extended to the option where an approach based on a pre-dose addition is applied. pH and acid-base equilibria are very important topics and some aspects of them have been treated in this journal. Alkalinity determinations are of value in anaerobic digesters and anaerobic wastewater treatment, mine drainage and associated water, coastal seawater, marine aquaculture, estuarine water, and food and beverages, to point out a few recent examples. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Acid-base titration; carbonate alkalinity; pH titration; total alkalinity","Acid-base equilibria; Acid-base property; Acid-base titration; Anaerobic digester; Anaerobic waste water treatment; Biochemical process; Carbonate alkalinity; Carbonate species; Carbonic acids; Coastal seawater; Dissociation constant; Estuarine waters; Excel spreadsheets; Fulvic acids; Humic and fulvic acids; Humic substances; Hydrogen ions; Ionic product of water; Marine aquaculture; Mine drainage; Natural waters; Non-linear regression; PH titration; pH value; Polyprotic acid; Reference levels; River water; Simulation procedures; Soluble complexes; Titration curves; Biological materials; Cams; Carbon dioxide; Dissociation; Hydrogen; Metal ions; Nonlinear equations; Organic acids; pH; Seawater; Titration; Alkalinity; alkalinity; anoxic conditions; bicarbonate; biochemistry; computer simulation; error analysis; pH; regression analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862507617

These studies have mostly followed highly aggregated top-down approaches without estimating the full range of REDD+ costs elements, thus underestimating the actual costs of REDD+. Based on three REDD+ pilot projects in Tanzania, representing an area of 327,825 ha, this study explicitly adopts a bottom-up approach to data assessment. By estimating opportunity, implementation, transaction and institutional costs of REDD+ we develop a practical and replicable methodological framework to consistently assess REDD+ cost elements.Results: Based on historical land use change patterns, current region-specific economic conditions and carbon stocks, project-specific opportunity costs ranged between US$ -7.8 and 28.8 tCO xxxx for deforestation and forest degradation drivers such as agriculture, fuel wood production, unsustainable timber extraction and pasture expansion. The mean opportunity costs for the three projects ranged between US$ 10.1 - 12.5 tCO 2. Implementation costs comprised between 89% and 95% of total project costs (excluding opportunity costs) ranging between US$ 4.5 - 12.2 tCO 2 for a period of 30 years. Transaction costs for measurement, reporting, verification (MRV), and other carbon market related compliance costs comprised a minor share, between US$ 0.21 - 1.46 tCO 2. Similarly, the institutional costs comprised around 1% of total REDD+ costs in a range of US$ 0.06 - 0.11 tCO 2.Conclusions: The use of bottom-up approaches to estimate REDD+ economics by considering regional variations in economic conditions and carbon stocks has been shown to be an appropriate approach to provide policy and decision-makers robust economic information on REDD+. The assessment of opportunity costs is a crucial first step to provide information on the economic baseline situation of deforestation and forest degradation agents and on the economic incentives required to halt unsustainable land use. Since performance based REDD+ carbon payments decrease over time (as deforestation rates drop and for each saved ha of forest payments occur once), investments in REDD+ implementation have a crucial role in triggering sustainable land use systems by investing in the underlying assets and the generation of sustainable revenue streams to compensate for opportunity costs of land use change. With a potential increase in the land value due to effective REDD+ investments, expenditures in an enabling institutional environment for REDD+ policies are crucial to avoid higher deforestation pressure on natural forests. © 2012 Merger et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Institutional costs; Opportunity costs; REDD+ cost elements; REDD+ economics; REDD+ implementation costs; Transaction costs","bottom-up approach; climate change; compliance; cost-benefit analysis; data interpretation; deforestation; environmental economics; estimation method; incentive; institutional framework; land use change; mitigation; pasture; sustainability; sustainable development; timber harvesting; top-down approach; transaction cost; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864701196

We estimated the annual whole-crown carbon gain of trees of the species Boswellia papyrifera, which are tapped for frankincense, by integrating leaf photosynthetic rates over the total leaf area and leaf life span. We examined the effect of tapping on total leaf area and leaf photosynthesis and, in turn, on carbon gain and resin yield for trees of a dry highland population and a wetter lowland population. Highland and lowland trees had similar total leaf area, but highland trees had higher photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area than lowland trees since they received more light and had higher photosynthetic capacities. Highland trees therefore achieved a higher annual carbon gain than lowland trees, despite a shorter rainy season and shorter leaf lifespan. Intensive tapping reduced crown leaf area and the carbon gain in the lowland trees, but not in highland trees.

This chapter follows the lead of Tom Schelling and argues a more balanced approach. International aid should continue to be devoted to development precisely to allow low latitude countries to develop and reduce their dependence on biological sectors such as agriculture and forestry. Not only will this alleviate poverty in these countries, but it will also reduce their vulnerability to climate change by moving these economies towards climate resilient sectors and giving them the income to adapt. Finally, development offers low latitude countries compensation for enduring climate change that they did not cause. Developing countries can take care of efficient adaptation on their own. With traditional economic development (versus handouts), developing countries will develop self-reliance and the resources to pursue adaptation in their own interest. © Oxford University Press 2012.

Here we employ an online weather and chemical transport model, WRF-Chem, and a gridded population density map, LANDSCAN, to estimate changes in fine particle pollution exposure, health benefits, and economic valuation for two emission reduction strategies based on increasing the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) in Santiago, Chile. The first scenario, switching to a CNG public transportation system, would reduce urban PM2.5 emissions by 229t/year. The second scenario would reduce wood burning emissions by 671t/year, with unique hourly emission reductions distributed from daily heating demand. The CNG bus scenario reduces annual PM2.5 by 0.33μg/m 3 and up to 2μg/m 3 during winter months, while the residential heating scenario reduces annual PM2.5 by 2.07μg/m 3, with peaks exceeding 8μg/m 3 during strong air pollution episodes in winter months. These ambient pollution reductions lead to 36 avoided premature mortalities for the CNG bus scenario, and 229 for the CNG heating scenario. Both policies are shown to be cost-effective ways of reducing air pollution, as they target high-emitting area pollution sources and reduce concentrations over densely populated urban areas as well as less dense areas outside the city limits. Unlike the concentration rollback methods commonly used in public policy analyses, which assume homogeneous reductions across a whole city (including homogeneous population densities), and without accounting for the seasonality of certain emissions, this approach accounts for both seasonality and diurnal emission profiles for both the transportation and residential heating sectors. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Compressed natural gas; Health benefits; PM2.5; Santiago; Wood burning; WRF-chem","Health benefits; PM2.5; Santiago; Wood burning; WRF-chem; Air pollution; Compressed natural gas; Emission control; Gas emissions; Health; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Heating; compressed natural gas; natural gas; unclassified drug; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; burning; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; health impact; heating; natural gas; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution exposure; pollution policy; urban pollution; wood; air pollutant; air pollution; ambient air; article; chemical model; Chile; concentration (parameters); economic evaluation; energy resource; environmental exposure; environmental management; exhaust gas; health hazard; heating; mortality; online system; particulate matter; population density; priority journal; public health; residential home; seasonal variation; traffic and transport; urban area; winter; Air Pollution; Chile; Gas, Natural; Heating; Humans; Vehicle Emissions; Chile; Metropolitana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862257131

Previous research has considered the likely causal influences and magnitude of such movements and the risks to national and international security. There has been little research on the consequences of climate-related migration and the health of people who move.Objectives: In this review, we explore the role that health impacts of climate change may play in population movements and then examine the health implications of three types of movements likely to be induced by climate change: forcible displacement by climate impacts, resettlement schemes, and migration as an adaptive response. Methods: This risk assessment draws on research into the health of refugees, migrants, and people in resettlement schemes as analogs of the likely health consequences of climate-related migration. Some account is taken of the possible modulation of those health risks by climate change. Discussion: Climate-change-related migration is likely to result in adverse health outcomes, both for displaced and for host populations, particularly in situations of forced migration. However, where migration and other mobility are used as adaptive strategies, health risks are likely to be minimized, and in some cases there will be health gains. Conclusions: Purposeful and timely policy interventions can facilitate the mobility of people, enhance well-being, and maximize social and economic development in both places of origin and places of destination. Nevertheless, the anticipated occurrence of substantial relocation of groups and communities will underscore the fundamental seriousness of human-induced climate change.","Climate change; Displacement; Health; Migration; Resettlement","climate change; ecosystem; environmental sanitation; health; health hazard; human; hunger; infection; malnutrition; migration; morbidity; mortality; priority journal; public health problem; refugee; review; risk assessment; social adaptation; socioeconomics; urbanization; vulnerable population; health status; Climate Change; Emigration and Immigration; Health Status; Humans; Risk Assessment",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861058062

Objectives: We estimated health risks for exposures to air emissions from a NGD project in Garfield County, Colorado with the objective of supporting risk prevention recommendations in a health impact assessment (HIA). Methods: We used EPA guidance to estimate chronic and subchronic non-cancer hazard indices and cancer risks from exposure to hydrocarbons for two populations: (1) residents living >1/2. mile from wells and (2) residents living ≤1/2. mile from wells. Results: Residents living ≤1/2. mile from wells are at greater risk for health effects from NGD than are residents living >1/2. mile from wells. Subchronic exposures to air pollutants during well completion activities present the greatest potential for health effects. The subchronic non-cancer hazard index (HI) of 5 for residents ≤1/2. mile from wells was driven primarily by exposure to trimethylbenzenes, xylenes, and aliphatic hydrocarbons. Chronic HIs were 1 and 0.4. for residents ≤1/2. mile from wells and >1/2. mile from wells, respectively. Cumulative cancer risks were 10 in a million and 6 in a million for residents living ≤1/2. mile and >1/2. mile from wells, respectively, with benzene as the major contributor to the risk. Conclusions: Risk assessment can be used in HIAs to direct health risk prevention strategies. Risk management approaches should focus on reducing exposures to emissions during well completions. These preliminary results indicate that health effects resulting from air emissions during unconventional NGD warrant further study. Prospective studies should focus on health effects associated with air pollution. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Hydrocarbon emissions; Natural gas development; Risk assessment","Air emissions; Air pollutants; Aliphatic hydrocarbons; Cancer risk; Gas development; Hazard indices; Health effects; Health impact; Health impact assessment; Human health risk assessment; Hydrocarbon emission; Prospective study; Risk prevention; Subchronic; Subchronic exposure; Technological advances; Unconventional natural gas; Air pollution; Benzene; Directional drilling; Diseases; Hazards; Health; Hydraulic fracturing; Hydrocarbons; Natural gas; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Well completion; Xylene; Health risks; 1,3,5 trimethylbenzene; aliphatic hydrocarbon; benzene; ethylbenzene; natural gas; xylene; atmospheric pollution; cancer; carbon emission; health impact; health risk; natural gas; pollution exposure; risk assessment; air pollutant; air pollution; article; blood toxicity; cancer risk; developmental disorder; environmental exposure; environmental impact assessment; health hazard; human; neurotoxicity; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; risk assessment; risk management; toxicity testing; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Colorado; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Gas, Natural; Humans; Hydrocarbons; Neoplasms; Public Health; Risk Assessment; Colorado; Garfield County [Colorado]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859749760

Verification based on direct observation of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations will be necessary to demonstrate that estimated emission reductions have been actualized in the atmosphere. Here we assess the capability of ground-based observations and a highresolution (1.3 km) mesoscale atmospheric transport model to determine a change in greenhouse gas emissions over time from a metropolitan region. We test the method with observations from a network of CO2 surface monitors in Salt Lake City. Many features of the CO2 data were simulated with excellent fidelity, although data-model mismatches occurred on hourly timescales due to inadequate simulation of shallow circulations and the precise timing of boundary-layer stratification and destratification. Using two optimization procedures, monthly regional fluxes were constrained to sufficient precision to detect an increase or decrease in emissions of approximately 15% at the 95% confidence level. We argue that integrated column measurements of the urban dome of CO2 from the ground and/or space are less sensitive than surface point measurements to the redistribution of emitted CO2 by small-scale processes and thus may allow for more precise trend detection of emissions from urban regions.","Atmospheric inversion; Cities; Climate change policy","carbon dioxide; accuracy; air pollution; article; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric transport; carbon footprint; controlled study; field emission; observational study; priority journal; risk assessment; salt lake; simulation; stratification; surface property; urban area; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Geography; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Theoretical; Seasons; Urbanization; Utah",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861887373

However, outside of traditional enhanced oil and gas recovery operations with a well established business model, CCS project deployments are struggling with adoption of a federal or international climate policy driver appearing unlikely for the foreseeable future. As part of a feasibility study for an industrial CCS project at the Boise White Paper mill in Washington State, a business model and CCS system design was developed that provided financial surety for the project developers while recognizing that uncertainty in revenue forecasts for CO 2 storage would persist for the foreseeable future. Key to the business model was installation of a new 37MWe biomass-fueled power island at the plant that would replace antiquated boilers and that could still supply the necessary steam to run pulp and paper production operations when capturing CO 2 emissions under favorable market conditions for monetizing CO 2 storage credits. Under unfavorable market conditions, CO 2 capture would be suspended and excess power generated from the plant would reduce external electrical energy purchases required for paper mill operations. The net CO 2 reduction for the project versus current operations is 1.0MMT of CO 2 per year with the CCS system online, and 139ktons per year with the CCS system offline due to reduced natural gas co-firing. So, both operational modes offered a significant net reduction in CO 2 emissions. Based on assumptions regarding electricity and natural gas pricing, and CO 2 storage revenue generated through an open market mechanism priced at $15 per metric ton CO 2, the payback period for the project capturing 0.5MMT/yr (62% of total CO 2 production) was estimated at 6.7 years versus 7.4 years with the CCS system offline. Geologic storage was evaluated in the deep flood basalt formations that dominate the storage capacity in Eastern Washington. Sub-basalt sediments were also examined at the site to provide alternative or supplemental storage capacity in the event that storage in the basalt sequences did not prove technically or economically feasible. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Basalt; Biomass; CO 2 capture; Geologic sequestration; Negative carbon emissions","A-carbon; Business models; Carbon capture and storage; Carbon emissions; Climate policy; Co-firing; Electrical energy; Feasibility studies; Flood basalt; Geologic sequestrations; Geologic storage; Market condition; Natural gas pricing; Offline; Oil and gas; Open market; Operational modes; Paper mill operations; Payback periods; Project developers; Pulp and paper; Revenue forecasts; Storage capacity; System online; Technology options; Washington; Washington State; White papers; Basalt; Biomass; Boilers; Carbon capture; Climate models; Commerce; Economics; Electric generators; Enhanced recovery; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Natural gas; Paper and pulp mills; Papermaking machinery; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon dioxide; basalt; biofuel; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; emission control; environmental economics; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; market conditions; uncertainty analysis; Carbon; Economics; Electric Generators; Emission; Greenhouse Gases; Natural Gas; Paper Machines; Paper Mills; Storage; Washington; United States; Washington [United States]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859746189

Water managers and planners on both sides of the border are promoting desalination-the conversion of seawater or brackish groundwater to fresh water-as an adaptation response that can help meet growing water demands and buffer against the negative impacts of climate change on regional water supplies. However, the uneven distribution of costs and benefits of this expensive, energy-intensive technology is likely to exacerbate existing social inequalities in the border zone. In this paper, we examine the discourses employed in the construction of the climate problem and proposed solutions. We focus our analysis on a proposed Arizona-Sonora binational desalination project and use insights from risk and hazards literature to analyze how, why, and to what effect desalination is emerging as a preferred climate change adaptation response. Our risk analysis shows that while desalination technology can reduce some vulnerabilities (e.g., future water supply), it can also introduce new vulnerabilities by compounding the water-energy nexus, increasing greenhouse gas emissions, inducing urban growth, producing brine discharge and chemical pollutants, shifting geopolitical relations of water security, and increasing water prices. Additionally, a high-tech and path-dependent response will likely result in increased reliance on technical expertise, less opportunity for participatory decision-making and reduced flexibility.

In addition, REDD+ "" safeguards"" are intended to protect non-carbon forest values. While REDD+ countries are formally requested to provide information on safeguards, there is as yet no agreement on the relative priority of carbon versus non-carbon values, and the appropriate level of safeguard standardization.This, we argue, has allowed REDD+ to function as a "" boundary object"" spanning disparate priorities. Meanwhile, the contestation of these priorities has been displaced from intergovernmental processes to the various organizations involved in operationalizing REDD+ activities. This article applies a set of organizational, substantive and conceptual typologies to compare differences in the balance of actors, interests and ideas across these organizations. It finds that multi-lateral funding programs have drawn heavily on existing safeguards for international aid, while private certification schemes have specialized in different niche priorities at the project level. In regards to the substance of safeguard requirements, the involvement of donors and investors appears correlated with a stronger emphasis on carbon and risk mitigation while greater NGO involvement and the decoupling of safeguards design from REDD+ funding appear correlated with greater emphasis on social rights and benefits.These findings have several critical implications for future REDD+ activities. Firstly, the choice of organizations involved in defining, funding and verifying safeguard activities, and the balance of actors in their governing structures, are likely to influence the relative emphasis on non-carbon values. Secondly, a diversity of approaches to disbursing REDD+ incentives may be necessary to maintain widespread support for REDD+. Thirdly, it remains to be seen whether REDD+ will remain a boundary object if it transitions to a national-level, performance based system where the design and enforcement of safeguards competes directly with financial compensation for measurable emissions reductions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Certification; FCPF; Forest carbon certification; REDD+; Safeguards; Social safeguards; UN-REDD","carbon; air pollution control; article; biotypology; certification; climate change; community program; environmental management; environmental planning; environmental protection; forest management; funding; organization; priority journal; reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation; screening; social aspect; social care; social control; standardization; United Nations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861173974

Diesel engines have high thermal efficiency and thus, high fuel efficiency. They are widely used in commerce prompting continuous improvement in diesel engines and fuels. Concern for health effects from exposure to diesel exhaust arose in the mid-1900s and stimulated development of emissions regulations and research to improve the technology and characterize potential health hazards. This included epidemiological, controlled human exposure, laboratory animal and mechanistic studies to evaluate potential hazards of whole diesel exhaust. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (1989) classified whole diesel exhaust as - ""probably carcinogenic to humans"" This classification stimulated even more stringent regulations for particulate matter that required further technological developments. These included improved engine control, improved fuel injection system, enhanced exhaust cooling, use of ultra low sulfur fuel, wall-flow high-efficiency exhaust particulate filters, exhaust catalysts, and crankcase ventilation filtration. The composition of New Technology Diesel Exhaust (NTDE) is qualitatively different and the concentrations of particulate constituents are more than 90% lower than for Traditional Diesel Exhaust (TDE).

The original list included carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, particulate matter, photochemical oxidants (later regulated as ozone), and hydrocarbons. Later, the listing of hydrocarbons was revoked and lead was listed. The CAA requires the EPA Administrator to set National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for these pollutants using the ""latest scientific knowledge"" at levels that, in the judgment of the Administrator, are ""requisite to protect public health"" while ""allowing an adequate margin of safety"" without considering the cost of implementing the NAAQS. The NAAQS are set using scientific knowledge to inform the Administrator's policy judgments on each NAAQS. Recently, there has been increasing tension and debate over the role of scientific knowledge versus policy judgment in the setting of NAAQS. This paper reviews key elements of this debate drawing on the opinion of Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, in Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, to resolve the conundrum posed by the CAA language. I conclude that scientists should carefully distinguish between their interpretations of scientific knowledge on specific pollutants and their personal preferences as to a given policy outcome (i. e., specific level and form of the NAAQS), recognizing that these are policy judgments as to acceptable levels of risk if the science does not identify a threshold level below which there are no identifiable health risks. These policy judgments are exclusively delegated by the CAA to the EPA Administrator who needs to articulate the basis for their policy judgments on the level and form of the NAAQS and associated level of acceptable risk. © 2011 The Author(s).","Clean Air Act; Criteria pollutants; Ozone; Particulate matter; Policy; Regulations; Risk","air quality; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; health risk; hydrocarbon; oxidation; oxide; ozone; particulate matter; policy making; pollutant; pollutant source; pollution control; risk factor; threshold; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861231291

In this chapter, we explore the theory and evidence underpinning road user charging, with a particular focus on the role of the policy in addressing climate change damage costs. In practice, countries have been hesitant to adopt national road user charging for cars. With the exception of the city state of Singapore, none has yet done so. Instead, road-related taxes, mainly on fuel and car ownership, are commonplace and a major source of tax revenue. It emerges that there is a diverse patchwork of approaches to charging for road use throughout the world, and varying calls for reform. Greenhouse gas reduction is not always at the centre of the road user charging debate. However, national road user charging appears to offer a holistic solution: it is therefore interesting to explore what role within it climate change costs should take, and what impact on climate change such a solution might have. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

A new ""zero-emissions stabilization (Zstabilization)"" is proposed, where CO2 emissions are reduced to zero at some time and thereafter the concentration is decreased by natural removal processes, eventually reaching an equilibrated stable state. Simplified climate experiments show that, under Z-stabilization, considerably larger emissions are permissible in the near future compared with traditional stabilization, with the same constraint on temperature rise. Over longer time scales, the concentration and temperature decrease close to their equilibrium values, much lower than those under traditional stabilization. The smaller temperature rise at final state is essential to avoid longer-term risk of sea level rise, a significant concern under traditional stabilization. Because of these advantages a Z-stabilization pathway can be a candidate of practical mitigation strategies as treated in Part 2. © 2012 The Japan Academy.","Carbon cycle; Climate commitment; CO2 emissions; Irreversible climate change; Sea level rise; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change","carbon dioxide; air pollution; article; atmosphere; chemistry; climate change; forecasting; international cooperation; temperature; time; Air Pollution; Atmosphere; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Forecasting; Internationality; Temperature; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867046408

By adding new variables (tagged species), PASCAL traces 1) the source region of emissions (source apportionment), 2) the age of individual species (elapsed time from emissions), 3) net and gross production and loss amounts from individual physical and chemical processes during transport (Lagrangian way), and 4) local production and loss rates at individual grid cells (Eulerian way) for primary and secondary aerosols and their precursor gases. The main advantage of PASCAL is the third one, which can trace accumulated production and loss amounts of individual processes during transport from source regions to each grid cell (Lagrangian type of integration) for both gross (production and loss) and net (gross production - loss) concentrations. Currently the method is applied for mixing ratios of CO and SO 2 and mass concentrations of black carbon and sulfate aerosols. This algorithm is not impacted by the non-linearity of chemical reactions and is computationally efficient. CMAQ/PASCAL model calculations were conducted over the East Asian region to test its performance. The overall validity of PASCAL calculations is confirmed for all species, periods, altitudes, and regions.

Food waste can be reduced by various activities including preventing edible food loss, draining moisture, and home composting. These activities have different potentials for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. Therefore, we conducted a life-cycle inventory analysis of household waste management scenarios for Kyoto with a special emphasis on food waste reduction activities. Methods The primary functional unit of our study was ""annual management of household combustible waste in Kyoto, Japan."" Although some life-cycle assessment scenarios included food waste reduction measures, all of the scenarios had an identical secondary functional unit, ""annual food ingestion (mass and composition) by the residents of Kyoto, Japan."" We analyzed a typical incineration scenario (Inc) and two anaerobic digestion (dry thermophilic facilities) scenarios involving either source-separated collection (SepBio) or nonseparated collection followed by mechanical sorting (Mec- Bio). We assumed that the biogas from anaerobic digestion was used for power generation. In addition, to evaluate the effects of waste reduction combined with separate collection, three food waste reduction cases were considered in the Sep- Bio scenario: (1) preventing loss of edible food (PrevLoss); (2) draining moisture contents (ReducDrain); and (3) home composting (ReducHcom). In these three cases, we assumed that the household waste was reduced by 5%. Results and discussion The GHG emissions from the Inc, MecBio, and SepBio scenarios were 123.3, 119.5, and 118.6 Gg CO2-eq/year, respectively. Compared with the SepBio scenario without food waste reduction, the PrevLoss and ReducDrain cases reduced the GHG emissions by 17.1 and 0.5 Gg CO2-eq/year. In contrast, the ReducHcom case increased the GHG emissions by 2.1 Gg CO2-eq/year. This is because the biogas power production decreased due to the reduction in food waste, while the electricity consumption increased in response to home composting. Sensitivity analyses revealed that a reduction of only 1% of the household waste by food loss prevention has the same GHG reduction effect as a 31-point increase (from 50% to 81%) in the food waste separation rate. Conclusions We found that prevention of food losses enhanced by separate collection led to a significant reduction in GHG emissions. These findings will be useful in future studies designed to develop strategies for further reductions in GHG emissions. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","Anaerobic digestion; Food loss prevention; Food waste; Greenhouse gas emissions; Household waste; Life-cycle inventory/Waste reduction activities","biogas; anaerobic digestion; article; biofuel production; carbon footprint; combustion; composting; controlled study; electricity; energy conservation; food intake; food waste; greenhouse gas; household; incineration; Japan; life cycle assessment; moisture; power supply; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; waste; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865148061

We demonstrated that PLLA forms the complex crystal with CO2 under high-pressure CO2 below room temperature, and the crystal transition to the α-form, which is accompanied with gradual changes in the packing and conformation of PLLA chains, occurs with CO2 desorption and subsequent annealing in air (annealing was needed only for films with a draw ratio smaller than three). Compared with the α-form, the oriented CO2 complex film showed shorter a-, longer b-, and shorter c-axis lengths, resulting in a slight increase in the unit cell volume. The hexagonal packing (a/b ≈ 1.73), which is seen in the α-form, no longer exists for the oriented CO2 complex film (a/b ≈ 1.33). It was indicated that the chain helical conformation of PLLA in the CO2 complex is similar but different to that in the α-form (10/7 helix for both forms), because of the interactions between PLLA and CO2. It seems likely that CO 2 molecules are encapsulated in the cavity surrounded by four PLLA chains. With CO2 desorption, the a-axis length increased and the b-axis one decreased, so that a/b increased to 31/2 (hexagonal packing), keeping the orthorhombic system. It was proposed that the formation of α″-crystals results from PLLA being trapped in the quasi-stable state during the CO2 complex-to-α-form transition, and the energy barrier between the α″- and α-forms can be overcome by only CO2 desorption in the case of a draw ratio higher than two. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Complex; Poly(l-lactide)","Chains; Conformations; Desorption; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; X ray diffraction; Complex; Crystal polymorph; Crystal transition; Helical conformation; Orthorhombic systems; Poly (l-lactide); Transition behavior; Wide angle Xray diffraction; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865277312

The dilution method effectively resulted in soil communities with consistently contrasting levels of species (TRF) richness. In particular, the 10 -6 dilution of field soil resulted in less rich communities in bare unplanted soil than did the 10 -1 soil dilution. However, this was not the case in planted soils where root activity was a powerful influence on species richness. After seven months, principal components analysis (PCA) separated bacterial community composition primarily on planting regime; planted mycorrhizal, planted non-mycorrhizal and bare soil treatments all contained different bacterial community compositions. A consistent finding in planted and unplanted soils was that aggregate stability was positively correlated with small pore sizes. Mycorrhizal colonisation decreased plant biomass and also resulted in reduced soil bacterial species richness, lower percentage organic matter and smaller pore sizes relative to planted but non-mycorrhizal soils. However, soil aggregate stability and water repellency were increased in these (mycorrhizal) soils probably due to AMF hyphal activities including enmeshment and/or glomalin production. In contrast, bacterial TRF richness was positively correlated with aggregate stability in the bare and non-mycorrhizal planted soils. Soil organic carbon was an important factor in all treatments, but in the bare soil where there was no additional input of labile C from roots, the percentage C could be directly related to fungal TRF richness. The less species rich bare soil contained more organic C than the more species rich bare soil. This suggests a degree of redundancy with regard to mineralisation of organic matter when additional, more utilisable C sources are unavailable. Understanding the effects of microbial diversity on functional parameters is important for advancing sustainable soil management techniques, but it is clear that soil is a dynamic ecosystem. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.","Aggregate stability; Arbuscular mycorrhizas; Soil dilution method; Soil porosity; X-ray Computed Tomography (CT)","aggregate stability; arbuscular mycorrhiza; dilution; fungus; inoculation; mineralization; soil carbon; soil management; soil microorganism; soil structure; species richness; Arbuscular; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864027034

The number size distributions show a higher abundance of ultrafine aerosols (10-100. nm) inside the plume than upwind of the plant, indicating the emissions of nanoparticles by the industrial process. Individual analysis of particles collected inside the plume shows a high proportion of metal bearing particles (Mn-/Fe-) consisting essentially of internally mixed aluminosilicate and metallic compounds. These particles evolve rapidly (in a few minutes) after emission by adsorption of VOC gas and sulfuric acid emitted by the plant but also by agglomeration with pre-existing particles. At the moment, municipalities require a monitoring of industrial emissions inside the chimneys from manufacturers. However those measures are insufficient to report such rapid changes in chemical composition and thus to evaluate the real impact of industrial plumes in the close environment of plants (when those particles leave the industrial site).

This is why multiple dimensions of evaluation and a structured room for collective deliberation and learning should be considered. Methods: A participative procedure is used to select a core set of performance indicators of policies for sustainable urban mobility. Citizen participation and stakeholder involvement are obtained through a national sample survey and a deliberative multi-criteria analysis, respectively. This procedure is applied to the Italian case. Results: Citizens are more oriented towards reducing private transport costs, air pollution and traffic accidents; stakeholders are more in favour of improving car-free accessibility and reducing the consumption of land and public space generated by urban mobility. The resulting core sets of indicators are highly sensitive to the threshold chosen for the selection. Using a lower cut-off threshold, four performance indicators are shared between the two sets: 'CO2 from transport', 'Quantity and quality of public transport', 'PMx, COVNM, NOx, CO from transport', 'Death and injuries from traffic accident'; using a higher cut-off threshold the two sets feature no intersection. Concluding remarks: Further testing at a local scale is needed in order to explicitly consider context-specific objectives, indicators and data; stronger interactions among experts, citizens and stakeholders are needed in order to avoid the generation of equivocal results. © 2012 The Author(s).","National survey; Participation; Sustainability indicators; Urban mobility","Citizen participation; Core set; Highly sensitive; Local scale; Multi Criteria Analysis; Multiple dimensions; Participation; Performance indicators; Private transport; Public space; Public transport; Stakeholder involvement; Sustainability indicators; Urban mobility; Benchmarking; Carbon dioxide; Highway accidents; Surveys; Mass transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861630575

The paper employs the example of international conditional transfers targeted to overcome suboptimal low climate protection efforts by influencing the abatement technology choice of countries. Design/methodology/approach: The paper applies the Lancastrian characteristics approach and conduct numerical simulations for divergent degrees of substitutability between different characteristics. The paper takes into account climate-protection benefits (global pollution reduction) as well as co-benefits (local pollution reduction) of climate protection activities. Findings: The analysis shows that individual country solution can be improved upon by making transfers from the richer countries to the poorer ones, if the latter have a lower relative preference for the global public goods (global pollution reduction) than the former. The magnitudes of such transfers will depend on the relative benefits of the global and local pollutants in the two countries. The authors also investigated the dependency of the potential for transfers on the degree of complementarity between global and local pollution characteristics. With a ""Cobb Douglas"" type of function used here the elasticity of substitution between the two is of course one. With a zero degree of substitutability the adjustment to a lower level of the global public good in fact starts to happen at a lower per capita income level. The scope for conditional transfers is still there, although the gains can be slightly smaller than when adjustment on the ""global pollution characteristic - local pollution characteristic"" margin is possible. Originality/value: This paper is a contribution to the literature on impure public goods. In particular, the authors examine the role of international transfers in obtaining an efficient global allocation of resources in the presence of such public goods. To date the analysis of impure public goods has not examined the case of a continuum of technologies where an efficient solution requires conditional transfers, i.e. payments from one country to another to undertake a different supply of global and local public goods than the second country would wish to undertake. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Ancillary benefits of climate policy; Climatology; Conditional transfers; Environmental management; Impure public goods; Lancastrian characteristics approach",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860856628

In response, coordinated global action has emerged to mitigate climate change, to gauge and map climate-related risks, and to plan for adaptation, which in turn has opened new avenues of funding, power, knowledge and opportunity. The identification of climate risks, analysis and diffusion of 'impact' scenarios, incorporation of carbon into economic regimes, and interventions to enhance adaptive capacity will necessarily be experienced differently by different groups. As climate-related crises produce winners and losers, so may discourses and plans made to avert such crises. In the process both the bio-physical events and the social responses shape and reshape social stratification and the distribution of risk. They produce new inequalities and needs for new kinds of responses to guard against injustice. From the emergence of desalination water projects and contested water access, to relocation planning in the Arctic and the South Pacific due to sea-level rise, to increasingly centralized forest management; mitigation and adaptation responses and interventions create their own critical outcomes. This essay and the articles in this special issue examine some new opportunities and risks associated with climate-change discourses and interventions. This special issue shows that vulnerable communities may be at risk of material injury following climate change or climate change intervention; and, be further insulted and injured by lack of representation and recognition, and by misrecognition as simplified, stereotyped victims in local, national and international climate conversations. Using a mixture of theoretical insight and case study research, this collection of articles explores the injuries of climate change as it applies to both direct physical stress scenarios and exposure to adaptation and mitigation policies and planning, as well as the discursive insults of being discounted, stereotyped, or ignored. © 2012.",,,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860257991

As ecological thresholds are met, community-wide migrations will become more common. These community-wide migrations are more likely to occur to already vulnerable populations, and may levy high social costs. In order to prevent the negative outcomes associated with forced migration and diaspora, policy intervention is likely. Our research examines the case study of Shishmaref, Alaska, where relocation as an adaptation strategy to changing ecological conditions is the only sustainable option. We find that the colonial history in Shishmaref is explicitly linked to contemporary exposure to hazards and increased vulnerability. We further assess obstacles to a State sponsored relocation. These obstacles include disaster response protocol that does not adequately accommodate climate change scenarios. Relocation planning is further complicated by feelings of mis- and under-representation of local voices in political arenas. This case demonstrates the interrelatedness between historically constructed vulnerability and obstacles to adaptation planning. We also offer unique insight into the details of relocation planning as an adaptation strategy among one of the first community-wide migrations associated with climate change. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Adaptation; Environmental migration; Governance; Inequity; Vulnerability","adaptation; assessment method; climate change; decision making; environmental conditions; governance approach; migration; policy making; precipitation (climatology); sustainable development; vulnerability; Alaska; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860235304

Hence, timely and accurate forest data are required to combat deforestation and forest degradation in support of climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation policy initiatives. Within Indonesia, Sumatra Island stands out due to the intensive forest clearing that has resulted in the conversion of 70% of the islands forested area through 2010. We present here a hybrid approach for quantifying the extent and change of primary forest in Sumatra in terms of primary intact and primary degraded classes using a per-pixel supervised classification mapping followed by a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based fragmentation analysis. Loss of Sumatras primary intact and primary degraded forests was estimated to provide suitable information for the objectives of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD and REDD+) program. Results quantified 7.54Mha of primary forest loss in Sumatra during the last two decades (1990-2010). An additional 2.31Mha of primary forest was degraded. Of the 7.54Mha cleared, 7.25Mha was in a degraded state when cleared, and 0.28Mha was in a primary state. The rate of primary forest cover change for both forest cover loss and forest degradation slowed over the study period, from 7.34Mha from 1990 to 2000, to 2.51Mha from 2000 to 2010. The Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data set was employed to evaluate results. GLAS-derived tree canopy height indicated a significant structural difference between primary intact and primary degraded forests (mean height 28m ±8.7m and 19m ±8.2m, respectively). The results demonstrate a method for quantifying primary forest cover stand-replacement disturbance and degradation that can be replicated across the tropics in support of REDD+initiatives. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.","change detection; deforestation; forest degradation; Indonesia; Landsat; remote sensing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864403814

This premise was tested by artificially elevating temperatures (increase 2.1-3.8°C) and reducing the amounts of fog and dew precipitation (decrease 30.1-31.9%), in an approximation of future climate warming scenarios, using transparent hexagonal open-top warming chambers placed around natural populations of four lichen species (Xanthoparmelia austroafricana, X. hyporhytida, Xanthoparmelia. sp., Xanthomaculina hottentotta) at a dry inland site and two lichen species (Teloschistes capensis and Ramalina sp.) at a humid coastal site in the arid South African Succulent Karoo Biome. Effective photosynthetic quantum yields (ΔF/F′ m) were measured hourly throughout the day at monthly intervals in pre-hydrated lichens present in the open-top warming chambers and in controls which comprised demarcated plots of equivalent open-top warming chamber dimensions constructed from 5-cm-diameter mesh steel fencing. The cumulative effects of the elevated temperatures and diminished precipitation amounts in the open-top warming chambers resulted in significant decreases in lichen (ΔF/F′ m). The decreases were more pronounced in lichens from the dry inland site (decline 34.1-46.1%) than in those from the humid coastal site (decline 11.3-13.7%), most frequent and prominent in lichens at both sites during the dry summer season, and generally of greatest magnitude at or after the solar noon in all seasons. Based on these results, we conclude that climate warming interacting with reduced precipitation will negatively affect carbon balances in endemic lichens by increasing desiccation damage and reducing photosynthetic activity time, leading to increased incidences of mortality. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Chlorophyll fluorescence; Diurnal fluctuations; Open-top warming chambers; Photosynthetic quantum yield; Succulent karoo biome","chlorophyll; arid region; biome; carbon balance; chlorophyll; coastal zone; dew; experimental study; fluorescence; global warming; humid environment; lichen; limiting factor; magnitude; mortality; open-top chamber; photosynthesis; population structure; temperature effect; article; climate change; ecosystem; lichen (organism); metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; South Africa; temperature; Chlorophyll; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Lichens; Photosynthesis; South Africa; Temperature; South Africa; Ramalina; Teloschistes; Xanthomaculina hottentotta; Xanthoparmelia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859643949

To determine the effective policy instrument(s) for reducing CO 2 emission, various policy instruments, which are likely to be implemented in the near future or have been implemented in China, are examined and compared. These instruments include carbon tax, energy tax, fuel tax, clean energy vehicle subsidy, and reduction on ticket price. The CIMS model system is employed as the simulation vehicle to predict the emission dynamics of CO 2 and local air pollutants under business-as-usual and policy scenarios for the transportation sector of China from 2008 to 2050.

The policy instruments proposed in the present research can all help mitigate the CO 2 emission intensity of the Chinese transportation industry to different extents, and then induce the co-benefits of local air pollutants reduction. Among these policy instruments, energy and fuel taxes, with the tax rates set, are the two most promising instruments for CO 2 emission intensity reduction to reach the 2020 carbon intensity reduction targets, whereas subsidies are the least promising options. CO 2 tax could be an effective policy tool, but with the suggested low tax rate during discussions in China, it is unlikely that the transportation sector would significantly contribute to achieving a desirable carbon intensity reduction. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","China; CIMS_China_Transportation model; Co-benefit; CO 2 emission reduction; Policy options; Transportation","air pollution; air pollution control; article; carbon dioxide tax; carbon footprint; China; dynamics; energy tax; fuel tax; policy; prediction; priority journal; simulation; tax; theoretical model; traffic and transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859936130

Agricultural sector dispensing a consequential amount of methane (about 2/3rd of total anthropogenic); livestock rearing generates 7-12 Tg methane annually from the country. The methane generation from ruminants not only contributes significantly to global warming but also leads a loss of dietary energy (7-12% of GEI). This loss needs attention, where acute shortage of quality feeds prevails. Efforts were made in the past to control the enteric methane emission using customary feeding approaches including chemicals and methane analogues, but most of them dubitable with one or more critical limitations like few respond at high doses, toxicity to either host animal or inhabited synergistic microbes etc. Therefore, the search for suitable, effective and safe methane mitigating agent is still ongoing, and extensive screenings of newer strategies are on radar of animal nutritionist and microbiologists in association with biotechnologists for abatement of methane emission from ruminants. This review paper examines the biological approaches such as reductive acetogenesis, immunization, phage therapy, defaunation, disabling the protein bindings accountable for association of methanogens with other microorganisms in rumen. In conclusion, there is the foremost need to explore the potentialities of state-of-the-art biological approaches under in vivo and with topographical variations.","Immunization genomics; Livestock methane; Phage therapy; Protein genomics; Reductive acetogenesis","Animalia; Bovidae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865686181

The energy of AE events is used as a measure of stress-induced damage during static fatigue at intermediate temperatures. The energy released by sources was determined from the signal energy received by two sensors, the effects of attenuation due to propagation distance were eliminated. A method for real-time analysis of energy release has been developed. It allows the identification of a characteristic time at 55% of the measured rupture time.

The NARCCAP Regional Climate Models' simulations have been classified into the following three groups based on the driving data used at the RCMs boundaries: (1) NCEP (6 simulations); (2) GCM-historical (5 simulations); and (3) GCM-future (4 simulations). Historical simulations are representative of the 1968-2000 period while future simulations cover the 2041-2070 period. A reference common grid has been defined to ease the comparison. Multi-model average intensities of AM precipitation of 6-, 12-, 24-, 72-, and 120-h for 2-, 5-, 10-, and 20-year return periods have been estimated for each simulation group. Comparison of results from NCEP and GCM-historical groups shows good overall agreement in terms of spatial distribution of AM intensities. Comparison of GCM-future and GCM-historical groups clearly shows widespread increases with median relative changes across all gridpoints ranging from 12 to 18% depending on durations and return periods. Fourteen Canadian climatic regions have been used to define regional projections and average regional changes in intense precipitation have been estimated for each duration and return period. Uncertainties on these regional values, resulting from inter-model variability, were also estimated. Results suggest that inland regions (e.g. Ontario and more specifically Southern Ontario, the Prairies, Southern Quebec) will experience the largest relative increases in AM intensities while coastal regions (e.g. Atlantic Provinces and the West Coast) will experience the smallest ones. These projections are most valuable inputs for the assessment of future impact of climate change on water infrastructures and the development of more efficient adaptation strategies. © 2011 Royal Meteorological Society.","Climate change; Global climate model; Intense rainfall; Multi-model ensemble; NARCCAP; Regional climate model","Adaptation strategies; Annual maxima; Climatic regions; Coastal regions; Ensemble simulation; Global climate model; Gridpoints; Historical simulation; Intense precipitation; Multi-model; Multi-model ensemble; NARCCAP; North American; Ontario; Regional climate changes; Regional climate models; Return periods; Water infrastructure; West coast; Climate change; Climate models; Coastal zones; Rain; Water supply; Uncertainty analysis; climate change; climate modeling; ensemble forecasting; precipitation (climatology); precipitation assessment; rainfall; regional climate; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Quebec [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862704300

General predictions are that ocean acidification will be detrimental to reef growth and that 40 to more than 80 per cent of present-day reefs will decline during the next 50 years. Coldwater corals (CWCs) are thought to be strongly affected by changes in ocean acidification owing to their distribution in deep and/or cold waters, which naturally exhibit a CaCO3 saturation state lower than in shallow/warm waters. Calcification was measured in three species of Mediterranean cold-water scleractinian corals (Lophelia pertusa, Madrepora oculata and Desmophyllum dianthus) on-board research vessels and soon after collection. Incubations were performed in ambient sea water. The species M. oculata was additionally incubated in sea water reduced or enriched in CO2. At ambient conditions, calcification rates ranged between -0.01 and 0.23% d-1.

Multiple investigations concluded that no fraud or scientific misconduct had occurred. Despite the exonerations, however, the email controversy has had impacts, both negative and positive. On the negative side, a small minority of the American public and a somewhat larger minority of American TV news professionals-mostly political conservatives-indicated that the controversy made them more certain that climate change is not happening, and undermined their trust in climate scientists. Conservative organizations and politicians continue to cite the controversy in justifying their opposition to government action on climate change. On the positive side, the controversy impressed upon the climate science community the need for improved communication and public engagement efforts, and many individuals and organizations have begun to address these needs. It also reminded the climate science community of the importance of transparency, data availability, and strong quality assurance procedures, stimulating many organizations to review their data management practices. Although it is too soon to gauge the lasting legacy of the controversy, if the climate science community takes it as an opportunity to improve its already high standards of scientific conduct-as well as improve its less well-developed approach to public engagement-the long-term prognosis is good. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,"Crime; Electronic mail; Information management; Quality assurance; Societies and institutions; Climate science; Climate scientists; Data availability; Government actions; Management practices; Public engagement; Quality assurance procedures; Scientific misconduct; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862111311

The expected biochemical pathway for these predominantly aerobic systems is nitrification. However, non-uniform media with low oxygen levels can shift biofilter microbial pathways to denitrification, a source of greenhouse gases. Several factors contribute to the formation of anoxic/anaerobic zones: media aging, media and particle structure, air velocity distribution, compaction, biofilm thickness, and moisture content (MC) distribution. The present work studies the effects of media moisture conditions on ammonia (NH3) removal and greenhouse gas generation (nitrous oxide, N2O and methane, CH4) for gas-phase compost biofilters subject to a 100-day controlled drying process. Continuous recordings were made for the three gases and water vapor (2.21-h sampling cycle, each cycle consisted of three gas species, and water vapor, for a total of 10,050 data points). Media moisture conditions were classified into three corresponding media drying rate (DR) stages: Constant DR (wetter media), falling DR, and stable-dry system. The first-half of the constant DR period (0-750h; MC=65-52%, w.b.) facilitated high NH3 removal rates, but higher N2O generation and no CH4 generation. At the drier stages of the constant DR (750-950h; MC=52-48%, w.b.) NH3 removal remained high but N2O net generation decreased to near zero. In the falling DR stage (1200-1480h; MC=44-13%) N2O generation decreased, CH4 increased, and NH3 was no longer removed. No ammonia removal or greenhouse gas generation was observed in the stable-dry system (1500-2500h; MC=13%). These results indicate that media should remain toward the drier region of the constant DR (in close proximity to the falling DR stage; MC=50%, approx.), to maintain high levels of NH3 removal, reduced levels of N2O generation, and nullify levels of CH4 generation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Ammonia biofiltration; Denitrification; Gas-phase biofilters; Greenhouse gases; Moisture; Nitrification; Nitrous oxide; Waste management","Air; Biofilters; Composting; Denitrification; Gas generators; Greenhouse gases; Moisture; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Waste management; Water vapor; Air velocity distributions; Ammonia biofiltration; Bio-film thickness; Biochemical pathway; Concentrated animal feeding operations; Gas phase biofilters; Moisture conditions; Nitrous oxide; Ammonia; ammonia; methane; nitrous oxide; ammonia; anoxic conditions; biofiltration; compost; denitrification; gas phase reaction; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; methane; moisture content; nitrous oxide; odor; oxygen; pollutant removal; waste management; water vapor; article; biochemistry; biofilm; biofilter; gas phase compost biofilter; greenhouse gas; moisture; nitrification; particle size; priority journal; waste management; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860432425

The focus of this paper is to report how various operating processes, utilized in-house and by collaborators, influence the catalytic activity during conditioning of biomass- derived syngas. Efficient cleaning and conditioning of biomass-derived syngas for use in fuel synthesis continues to be a significant technical barrier to commercialization. Multifunctional, fluidizable catalysts are being developed to reform undesired tars and light hydrocarbons, especially methane, to additional syngas, which can improve utilization of biomass carbon. This approach also eliminates both the need for downstream methane reforming and the production of an aqueous waste stream from tar scrubbing. This work was conducted with NiMgK/Al 2O 3 catalysts. These catalysts were assessed for methane reforming performance in (i) fixed-bed, bench-scale tests with model syngas simulating that produced by oak gasification, and in pilot-scale, (ii) fluidized tests with actual oak-derived syngas, and (iii) recirculating/ regenerating tests using model syngas. Bench-scale tests showed that the catalyst could be completely regenerated over several reforming reaction cycles. Pilot-scale tests using raw syngas showed that the catalyst lost activity from cycle to cycle when it was regenerated, though it was shown that bench-scale regeneration by steam oxidation and H 2 reduction did not cause this deactivation. Characterization by TPR indicates that the loss of a low temperature nickel oxide reduction feature is related to the catalyst deactivation,which is ascribed to nickel being incorporated into a spinel nickel aluminate that is not reduced with the given activation protocol. Results for 100 h time-on-stream using a recirculating/ regenerating reactor suggest that this type of process could be employed to keep a high level of steady-state reforming activity, without permanent deactivation of the catalyst. Additionally, the differences in catalyst performance using a simulated and real, biomass-derived syngas stream indicate that there are components present in the real stream that are not adequately modeled in the syngas stream. Heavy tars and polycyclic aromatics are known to be present in real syngas, and the use of benzene and naphthalene as surrogates may be insufficient. In addition, some inorganics found in biomass, which become concentrated in the ash following biomass gasification, may be transported to the reforming reactor where they can interact with catalysts. Therefore, in order to gain more representative results for how a catalyst would perform on an industrially-relevant scale, with real contaminants, appropriate small-scale biomass solids feeders or slipstreams of real process gas should be employed. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","Biomass; Deactivation; Ni catalyst; Reforming; Regeneration; Syngas","Bench-scale test; Biomass feedstock; Biomass Gasification; Catalyst performance; Deactivation; Fixed-bed; Inorganics; Light hydrocarbon; Low temperatures; Methane reforming; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Ni catalysts; Nickel aluminate; Nickel oxide reduction; Operating process; Pilot scale; Pilot scale test; Pilot-scale study; Polycyclic aromatics; Real process; Reforming activity; Reforming reactors; Regeneration; Solids feeders; Steam oxidation; Syn-gas; Technical barriers; Waste stream; Benzene; Bioconversion; Biomass; Catalyst deactivation; Catalyst regeneration; Fluidization; Gasification; Methane; Naphthalene; Nickel compounds; Polymer blends; Reforming reactions; Synthesis (chemical); Synthesis gas; Tar; Testing; Catalyst activity",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866142346

Under the right conditions, a CHP system can reduce the harmful emissions resulting from power production, causing less greenhouse gases to be released than a reference system where power is purchased from the electricity grid. Different building types may be more or less likely to save emissions with CHP systems based on the electrical and thermal needs of the building. This investigation evaluates seven different types of buildings located in Chicago, Illinois for their potential to reduce CO 2, NO x, and CH 4 emissions using a CHP system. The CHP system modeled is sized to provide 30% of the average hourly electricity needs of each building. The total carbon equivalent emissions, primary energy consumption (PEC), and operational cost of a CHP system are presented along with those of a reference system. In addition, the CHP system efficiency is analyzed with respect to the fraction of the thermal load that is satisfied by the CHP system (R h). Results show that a CHP system would reduce emissions for all buildings studied, with more than 21% of carbon equivalent emissions reduced for an outpatient health care building. PEC and operational cost would be reduced with the use of a CHP system for some of the buildings. In general it is beneficial to have high R h values to provide better emissions, cost and PEC reduction from the CHP system operation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon equivalent; CHP emission reduction; CHP in commercial buildings; CO 2 emission reduction","Building types; Carbon equivalent; Carbon equivalent emission; Chicago; CHP emission reduction; CHP in commercial buildings; CHP-systems; Combined heating; Commercial building; Electricity grids; Emissions reduction; Generate electricity; Harmful emissions; Hot water; Illinois; Operational costs; Power production; Primary energy consumption; Reference systems; Total carbon; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Electricity; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Health care; Office buildings; Waste heat; Cost reduction; ammonia; building; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; combined heat and power; electricity generation; nitrogen oxides; Chicago; Illinois; United States; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862826856

Using small sample regression techniques, we analyze the outputs of stakeholder groups in 18 states that have completed Climate Action Plans to reduce GHGs. We find that an increase of 1percent in the number of energy industry representatives that participate in Climate Action Councils significantly predicts a 4percent reduction of GHG mitigation targets for the energy sector. More surprisingly, the results also show that where the utilities represent a larger share of the state economy, the Climate Action Plans identify more aggressive GHG reduction goals for the energy sector. We also find that the political orientation of the executive of the state is not correlated with GHG mitigation requirements for the energy sector, suggesting that GHG mitigation is less partisan at the state level than in Washington, DC. We find no evidence that state wealth is associated with GHG mitigation requirements.

Whether such patterns are common to co-distributed taxa may depend on the extent to which species vary in ecology and vagility. We investigated whether broad-scale phylogeographic patterns common to a number of small-bodied vertebrate and invertebrate species in eastern Australian forests were reflected in the population genetic structure of an Australo-Papuan forest marsupial, the red-legged pademelon (Macropodidae: Thylogale stigmatica). Strong genetic structuring of mtDNA haplotypes indicated the persistence of T.stigmatica populations across eastern Australia and southern New Guinea in Pleistocene refugial areas consistent with those inferred from studies of smaller, poorly dispersing species. However, there was limited divergence of haplotypes across two known historical barriers in the northeastern Wet Tropics (Black Mountain Barrier) and coastal mideastern Queensland (Burdekin Gap) regions. Lack of divergence across these barriers may reflect post-glacial recolonization of forests from a large, central refugium in the Wet Tropics. Additionally, genetic structure is not consistent with the present delimitation of subspecies T.s.wilcoxi and T.s.stigmatica across the Burdekin Gap. Instead, the genetic division occurs further to the south in mideastern Queensland. Thus, while larger-bodied marsupials such as T.stigmatica did persist in Pleistocene refugia common to a number of other forest-restricted species, species-specific local extinction and recolonization events have resulted in cryptic patterns of genetic variation. Our study demonstrates the importance of understanding individualistic responses to historical climate change in order to adequately conserve genetic diversity and the evolutionary potential of species. © 2011 The Authors.

We undertook a multiproxy study on an alpine lake (ESM-1) at the modern tree-line in boreal, southern Siberia. Steppe and tundra biomes were extensive in eastern Sayan landscapes during the early Holocene. Boreal forest quickly expanded by 9.1 ka BP, and dominated the landscape until c 0.7 ka BP, when the greatest period of compositional turnover occurred. At this time, alpine meadow landscape expanded and Picea obovata colonised new habitats along river valleys and lake shorelines, because of prevailing cool, moist conditions. During the early Holocene, chironomid assemblages were dominated by cold stenotherms. Diatoms for much of the Holocene were dominated by alkaliphilous, fragilarioid taxa, up until 0.2 ka BP, when epiphytic species expanded, indicative of increased habitat availability. C/N mass ratios ranged between 9.5 and 13.5 (11.1-15.8 C/N atomic ratios), indicative of algal communities dominating organic matter contributions to bottom sediments with small, persistent contributions from vascular plants. However, δ 13C values increased steadily from -34.9‰ during the early Holocene (9.3 ka BP) to -24.8‰ by 0.6 ka BP. This large shift in magnitude may be due to a number of factors, including increasing within-lake productivity, increasing disequilibrium between the isotopic balance of the lake with the atmosphere as the lake became isotopically 'mature', and declining soil respiration linked to small, but distinct retreat in forest biomes. The influence of climatic variables on landscape vegetation was assessed using redundancy analysis (RDA), a linear, direct ordination technique. Changes in July insolation at 60 °N significantly explained over one-fifth of the variation in species composition, while changes in estimates of northern hemisphere temperature and ice-rafted debris events in the North Atlantic were also significant, but considerably less important. The potential importance of climate and biome development (tundra, steppe, cold deciduous forest and taiga) on different trophic levels (i.e. chironomid and diatom communities) in lake ESM-1 was also assessed using RDA. Climate predictors had a more significant influence on Holocene chironomid assemblages, especially July insolation at 60 °N, estimates of regional precipitation and estimates of northern hemisphere temperature, while only the development of the taiga biome had a significant impact on these primary consumers. Diatom communities also had a small, but significant influence on Holocene chironomid populations, perhaps linked to variation in faunal feeding strategies. In contrast, climatic and biome predictors explained similar amounts of variation in the Holocene diatom assemblage (approximately 20% each), while chironomids themselves as predictors explained just under 7% of diatom variation. Lake acidity was inferred using a diatom inference model. Results suggest that after deglaciation, the lake did not undergo a process of gradual acidification, most likely due to the presence of continuous permafrost and low levels of precipitation, preventing base cations and dissolved organic carbon entering the lake (except for the period between 1.7 and 0.7 ka BP). We conclude that lakes in continental, boreal regions undergo different models of lake ontogeny than oceanic boreal regions. Unlike other regions discussed, climate is a more important driver of ecosystem change than catchment changes. We also demonstrate that the start of the period coincident with the onset of the Little Ice Age resulted in important thresholds crossed in catchment vegetation and aquatic communities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Biome; Chironomid; Diatom; Eastern Sayan mountains; Lake ontogeny; Multiproxy; Organic isotope; Pollen; Redundancy analysis","Biome; Chironomid; Diatom; Eastern Sayan mountains; Lake ontogenies; Multi proxies; Pollen; Redundancy analysis; Catchments; Climate change; Debris; Ecosystems; Estimation; Forestry; Incident solar radiation; Isotopes; Landforms; Redundancy; Runoff; Sediments; Vegetation; Lakes; acidification; aquatic ecosystem; biome; boreal forest; climate effect; climate variation; deglaciation; diatom; habitat availability; ice-rafted debris; insect; Little Ice Age; meadow; ontogeny; palynology; permafrost; trophic level; vascular plant; Asia; algae; Bacillariophyta; Chironomidae; Picea; Picea obovata; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859726546

They were developed from visual inspection of cores and cuttings, thin-section microscopy or mercury porosimetry. Recent advances in NMR log and core analysis, complemented by more quantitative use of borehole image logs, have led to the application of log-based porosity partitioning based on some of these earlier models. The foundation of this approach is the link between NMR T2 distributions and pore-size distributions obtained from special core analysis. Several case studies record the success of this approach in carbonate formations drilled with water-based mud, where the NMR response is well characterized and has been validated by core analysis. The recently discovered carbonate reservoirs offshore Brazil are typically drilled with oil-based mud to avoid drilling and completion problems in the 2000 m of salt overlying the reservoir. NMR logs are routinely run in the reservoir section and the interpretation methods developed for carbonates drilled with water-based mud have been adapted for evaluating reservoir quality, when oil-based mud is used. These carbonates tend to be oil-wet to the 28-30° API reservoir oil and to the oil-based mud filtrate; this ensures that surface relaxivity is the dominant relaxation mechanism in the NMR response, which enables the correlation of T2 distributions with the variety of pore sizes in the reservoir zones. Interpreting NMR logs in such conditions requires detailed knowledge of the oil-based mud filtrate and reservoir oil properties, and of the wettability of the formation at downhole conditions. One of the key requirements for correctly interpreting the NMR log data are to perform the lab NMR measurements of fluids and core samples at the same pressure and temperature conditions as the lab PVT measurements. When compared with downhole NMR log data, lab measurements performed on native-state, restored-state, brine-saturated and partially-saturated cores at PVT conditions show that many of the existing carbonate classification schemes can be applied to the presalt carbonates. The common features of these schemes will be examined, and the relevance of these various models to formation evaluation in the presalt carbonates will be reviewed. Options for analyzing borehole image logs in carbonates drilled with oil-based mud will also be presented as an aid to porosity typing with NMR. The key considerations for core analysis and for acquiring, processing and analyzing NMR and logs in carbonates drilled with oil-based mud are summarized. ©2012 Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log Analysts.",,"Borehole image logs; Carbonate formations; Carbonate reservoir; Classification scheme; Downhole conditions; Downholes; Drilling and completion; Formation evaluation; Grain size; Interpretation methods; Log data; Mercury porosimetry; NMR measurements; Oil-based mud; Petrophysics; Pore-throat size; Pressure and temperature; Relaxation mechanism; Relaxivity; Reservoir quality; Rock textures; Special core analysis; Visual inspection; Water-based muds; Boreholes; Boring; Carbonates; Carbonation; Core analysis; Mercury (metal); Offshore drilling; Offshore oil wells; Oil bearing formations; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Pore size; Thermal logging; Nuclear magnetic logging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869099773

High N 2O and CH 4 emissions were observed during the first and last 2 weeks, respectively. Cumulative CH 4 emissions were significantly (P &lt; 0.001) affected by sowing density rather than by the rice cultivar. Cumulative CH 4 emissions reached 68.2 kg C ha -1 in the CY-C treatment and 121.6 kg C ha -1 in the NG-C treatment, which were significantly (P &lt; 0.001) higher than the emissions at reduced sowing densities (15.9 kg C ha -1 in the CY-R treatment and 20.9 kg C ha -1 in the NG-R treatment). Under the conventional sowing density, cumulative CH 4 emissions during the seedling stage were comparable to data of rice-growing season. Both the rice cultivar and the sowing density significantly (P &lt; 0.05-0.01) affected cumulative N 2O emissions. Relative to the CY cultivar, the NG cultivar increased global warming potential (GWP) over a 100-year horizon by 62.1% and 70. 7% under the reduced and conventional sowing densities, respectively. The GWP of N 2O and CH 4 during the seedling stage was equivalent to the GWP of the entire rice-growing season in this region, indicating that the seedling stage is an important greenhouse gas emission source of rice agriculture. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Global warming potential; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Paddy field; Rice growing season; Transplanted rice","agricultural emission; cultivar; global warming; greenhouse gas; growing season; methane; nitrous oxide; rice; seedling; sowing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862694502

Charging such vehicles will impose additional demands on the electricity network but given the pattern of vehicle usage, the possibility exists to discharge the stored energy back to the grid when required, for example when lower than expected wind generation is available. Such vehicle-to-grid operation could see vehicle owners supplying the grid if they are rewarded for providing such services. This paper describes a model of an electric vehicle storage system integrated with a standardized power system (the IEEE 30-node power system model). A decision-making strategy is established for the deployment of the battery energy stored, taking account of the state of charge, time of day, electricity prices and vehicle charging requirements. Applying empirical data, the benefits to the network in terms of load balancing and the energy and cost savings available to the vehicle owner are analyzed. The results show that for the case under study, the EVs have only a minor impact on the network in terms of distribution system losses and voltage regulation but more importantly the vehicle owner's costs are roughly halved. © 2012 IEEE.","Electric vehicle; power flow; state of charge; vehicle to grid","Air pollutants; Battery energy; Decision-making strategies; Distribution systems; Electricity networks; Electricity prices; Empirical data; Energy and cost; Power flows; Power system model; State of charge; Storage systems; Stored energy; Time of day; Vehicle to grids; Wind generation; Charging (batteries); Costs; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Lead acid batteries; Voltage regulators; Electric vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860232157

The recoil protons were detected in coincidence with the forward moving charged fragments and neutrons. It is demonstrated that through the correlation between the recoil protons and forward moving charged fragments, the core fragment knockout and valence nucleon knockout reaction mechanisms can be discriminated at energies around 100 MeV/u. The 5He ground-state resonance was reconstructed based on the selection of the valence nucleon knockout mechanism. The resonance parameters were obtained for both carbon and hydrogen targets, which are consistent with those previously reported in the literature. The importance of selecting appropriate reaction mechanisms is discussed based on reconstructions using events with larger transverse momentum transfer. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861398080

The regulation of GHG emissions in the US, with adoption of 2016 standards and ongoing work toward 2025 standards, provides a rich case study to assess questions about the appropriate amount of lead-time to promote sustained long-term investment in vehicle efficiency technology. This analysis examines the milestones, phase-in, lead-time, investments, technology diffusion, and GHG emission progress-to-date toward 2016 standards in the US. The findings suggest that the 2016 rulemaking process establishes a strong model for regulatory lead-time, allowing for ample time for industry to make the necessary investments to meet their GHG reduction commitments by 2016. The 2025 rulemaking continues this strong precedent for extended regulatory lead-time and has led to near unanimous automaker support. The 13-year lead-time for 2025 standards is appropriate to help reduce technology investment risk and sustain long-term capital investments, and it is especially fitting for the difficult task of launching advanced electric-drive technologies for deep long-term GHG emission cuts. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Lead-time; Regulation; Vehicle","automobile industry; carbon emission; emission control; greenhouse gas; investment; regulatory framework; technology diffusion; transportation policy; transportation technology; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859802407

The microbiota colonizing the rhizosphere (immediately surrounding the root) and the endophytic compartment (within the root) contribute to plant growth, productivity, carbon sequestration and phytoremediation. Colonization of the root occurs despite a sophisticated plant immune system, suggesting finely tuned discrimination of mutualists and commensals from pathogens. Genetic principles governing the derivation of host-specific endophyte communities from soil communities are poorly understood. Here we report the pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene of more than 600 Arabidopsis thaliana plants to test the hypotheses that the root rhizosphere and endophytic compartment microbiota of plants grown under controlled conditions in natural soils are sufficiently dependent on the host to remain consistent across different soil types and developmental stages, and sufficiently dependent on host genotype to vary between inbred Arabidopsis accessions. We describe different bacterial communities in two geochemically distinct bulk soils and in rhizosphere and endophytic compartments prepared from roots grown in these soils. The communities in each compartment are strongly influenced by soil type. Endophytic compartments from both soils feature overlapping, low-complexity communities that are markedly enriched in Actinobacteria and specific families from other phyla, notably Proteobacteria. Some bacteria vary quantitatively between plants of different developmental stage and genotype. Our rigorous definition of an endophytic compartment microbiome should facilitate controlled dissection of plant-microbe interactions derived from complex soil communities. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Independent variables included parental education and socio-economic status, children's body mass index, number of siblings, parity order, smoking and drinking habits. Results: A total of 311 subjects (49.2% females), residing in either the exposed (n=154) or the reference (n=157) area participated. Average airborne and soil manganese were respectively 49.5ng/m3 (median 31.4, range 1.24-517) and 958ppm (median 897, range 465-1729) in the impacted area, and 27.4ng/m3 (median 24.7, range 5.3-85.9) ng/m3 and 427ppm (median 409 range 160-734) in the reference area. Regression models showed significant impairment of motor coordination (Luria-Nebraska test, p=0.0005), hand dexterity (Aiming Pursuit test, p=0.0115) and odor identification (Sniffin' task, p=0.003) associated with soil manganese. Tremor intensity was positively associated with blood (p=0.005) and hair (p=0.01) manganese. Conclusion: Historical environmental exposure to manganese from ferroalloy emission reflected by the concentration in soil and the biomarkers was associated with sub-clinical deficits in olfactory and motor function among adolescents. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Airborne particles; Children; Manganese; Metals; Neuromotor changes; Soil","biological marker; copper; iron; lead; manganese; tap water; zinc; adolescent; adolescent health; airborne particle; article; blood sampling; body mass; child; clinical assessment; controlled study; disease association; drinking behavior; environmental exposure; ethnic group; female; hair analysis; hand movement; human; human tissue; Italy; long term exposure; major clinical study; male; motor coordination; neuropsychological test; olfactory discrimination; population risk; priority journal; risk assessment; school child; sex difference; smelling disorder; smoking habit; surface soil; tremor; urinalysis; Adolescent; Adolescent Development; Age Factors; Air Pollutants; Biological Markers; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Iron; Italy; Linear Models; Logistic Models; Male; Manganese; Manganese Poisoning; Motor Activity; Multivariate Analysis; Nervous System; Neuropsychological Tests; Olfaction Disorders; Residence Characteristics; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Smell; Tremor; Luria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864511374

However, the effects of these structures for carbon retention have been scarcely considered and quantified. This research formulated a simple approach in estimating the carbon retention effects of check dams in Yan'an prefecture of the Loess Plateau region of China based on check dam inventory data and benefit transfer approach. Results indicated that the large and medium sized check dams had retained about 42.3 million tons of soil organic carbon (SOC) with a high spatial variability. This is a significant amount similar to about 1.48% of the SOC stored in the 0-40. cm soil layer across the whole Loess Plateau or roughly 4% of the estimated carbon emission from fossil fuel in China in 2000. Total volume of check dam is the most important influencing factor for carbon retention effects at both check dam and county-levels. Years after construction is also a significant factor at check dam level. The numbers of check dams and land use as well as topographical factors have impacts on the respect of check dam carbon retention of varied significance at the county-level. The effectiveness of carbon retention decreased from north to south. The results of this research can be used as important decision support for check dam development planning at the local context. This research also revealed the scientific worthiness in quantifying the carbon retention effects concerning the relationships between soil erosion and carbon cycling. On this respect, process-based monitoring and research are urgently in need. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon cycling; Check dam; Loess Plateau; Sediment; Soil erosion; Soil organic carbon","Carbon cycling; Check dam; Loess Plateau; Soil erosion; Soil organic carbon; Carbon; Decision support systems; Erosion; Fossil fuels; Research; Sediments; Soil conservation; Soils; Water conservation; Water management; Dams; basin management; carbon cycle; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; dam; estimation method; fossil fuel; soil erosion; soil organic matter; spatial variation; topography; watershed; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860282992

The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) approach was applied to isolate the factors responsible for this decrease. It is concluded that 15% of the decrease can be attributed to the drop in demand for electricity triggered by the economic recession, and 28% can be attributed to switching of fuel from coal to gas responding to the decrease in prices for the latter. The largest factor in the decrease, close to 57%, resulted from an overall decline in emissions per unit of power generated from coal. This is attributed in part to selective idling of older, less efficient coal plants that generally do not incorporate technology for sulfur removal, and in part to continued investments by the power sector in removal equipment in response to the requirements limiting emissions imposed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).

Location Central Europe, Belgium and the Netherlands. Methods The diversity of native and alien flora was analysed in 32 cities. In each city, plant species were recorded in seven 1-ha plots that represented seven urban habitat types with specific disturbance regimes. Plants were classified into native species, archaeophytes (introduced before ad 1500) and neophytes (introduced later). Two sets of explanatory variables were obtained for each city: climatic data and all-scale spatial variables generated by analysis of principal coordinates of neighbour matrices. For each group of species, the effect of habitat type, climate and spatial variables on variation in species composition was determined by variation partitioning. Responses of individual plant species to climatic variables were tested using a set of binomial regression models. Effects of climatic variables on the proportion of alien species were determined by linear regression. Results In all cities, 562 native plant species, 188 archaeophytes and 386 neophytes were recorded. Proportions of alien species varied among urban habitats. The proportion of native species decreased with increasing range and mean annual temperature, and increased with increasing precipitation. In contrast, proportions of archaeophytes and neophytes increased with mean annual temperature. However, spatial pattern explained a larger proportion of variation in species composition of the urban flora than climate. Archaeophytes were more uniformly distributed across the studied cities than the native species and neophytes. Urban habitats rich in native species also tended to be rich in archaeophytes and neophytes. Main conclusions Species richness and composition of central European urban floras are significantly affected by urban habitat types, climate and spatial pattern. Native species, archaeophytes and neophytes differ in their response to these factors. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Archaeophytes; Invasive species; Neophytes; Non-native plants; Species richness; Vascular plants","climate effect; community dynamics; flora; habitat type; habitat use; introduced species; native species; spatial variation; species diversity; species richness; temperature effect; urban area; vascular plant; Central Europe; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859425662

In the past, asbestos was used in many industries and it is still found in many installations. Our objective was to ascertain whether there might be excess pleural cancer mortality among populations residing in the vicinity of Spanish industrial installations that are governed by the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive and the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register Regulation and report their emissions to air. An ecological study was designed to examine pleural cancer mortality at a municipal level (8098 Spanish towns) over the period 1997-2006, during which 2146 deaths were registered. We conducted an exploratory ""near vs. far"" analysis to estimate the relative risks (RRs) of towns situated at a distance of < 2. km from installations. This analysis was repeated for each of the 24 industrial groups. RR and their 95% credible intervals (95% CIs) were estimated on the basis of a Poisson conditional autoregressive Bayesian model with explanatory variables. Integrated nested Laplace approximations were used as a Bayesian inference tool. Analysis showed statistically significant RRs in both sexes in the vicinity of 7 of the 24 industrial groups studied (RR, 95% CI), namely, biocide facilities (2.595, 1.459-4.621), ship-building (2.321, 1.379-3.918), glass and mineral fibre production (1.667, 1.041-2.665), non-hazardous waste treatment (1.737, 1.077-2.799), galvanising (1.637, 1.139-2.347), organic chemical plants (1.386, 1.075-1.782) and the food and beverage sector (1.255, 1.006-1.562). In the proximity of sources pertaining to the biocide, organic chemical and galvanising sectors, the risk was seen to be rising among men and women, a finding that could indicate airborne environmental exposure. These results support that residing in the vicinity of IPPC-registered industries that release pollutants to the air constitutes a risk factor for pleural cancer. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Asbestos; Environmental pollution/prevention and control; Epidemiology; Industrial pollution; Mesotheliomas","Bayesian inference; Bayesian model; Beverage sectors; Cancer mortality; Conditional autoregressive; Credible interval; Ecological studies; Environmental exposure; Environmental pollutions; Explanatory variables; Fibre production; Industrial groups; Industrial installations; Industrial pollution; Integrated pollution prevention and control directives; Laplace approximation; Mesotheliomas; Non hazardous wastes; Pollutant release and transfer registers; Relative risks; Risk factors; Asbestos; Bayesian networks; Biocides; Chemical plants; Diseases; Epidemiology; Galvanizing; Industrial chemicals; Industrial emissions; Inference engines; Organic chemicals; Pollution control; Risk perception; Tumors; Waste treatment; Industry; asbestos; atmospheric pollution; cancer; epidemiology; health risk; industrial emission; mortality; pollutant source; pollution control; pollution exposure; risk factor; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollutant; air pollution; article; Bayes theorem; building; cancer mortality; chemical industry; child; environmental exposure; female; food industry; glass industry; human; industrial pollution; infant; male; pleura cancer; preschool child; priority journal; risk assessment; school child; ship; Spain; waste management; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asbestos; Bayes Theorem; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Male; Mesothelioma; Occupational Exposure; Pleural Neoplasms; Poisson Distribution; Risk; Risk Factors; Spain; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859748553

For a given carbon concentration, both steady-state photomechanical stress response and energy conversion efficiency were found to be directly related to the dimensional state of the carbon nanostructure additive. A maximum observed stress change of ∼60kPa and ∼5×10 3% efficiency were obtained with just 1wt% MWNT loading. Actuation and relaxation kinetic responses were found to be related not to dimensionality, but to the percolation threshold of the carbon nanostructure additive in the polymer. Establishing a connective network of the carbon nanostructure additive allowed for energy transduction responsible for the photomechanical effect to activate carbon beyond the NIR illumination point, resulting in enhanced actuation. For samples greater than percolation threshold, photoconductivity of the nanocomposite structure as a function of applied pre-strain was measured. Photoconductive response was found to be inversely proportional to applied pre-strain, demonstrating mechanical coupling. Mechanical response dependence to the carbon nanostructure dimensional state could have significance in developing new types of carbon-based mixed-dimensional composites for sensor and actuator systems. © 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Activate carbons; Carbon concentrations; Carbon Nanostructures; Carbon-based; Energy transduction; Highly ordered pyrolytic graphites; Homogeneous dispersions; Mechanical coupling; Mechanical response; Mixing techniques; Nano-composite structure; Nano-platelets; Near infrared light; Percolation thresholds; Photoconductive response; Photomechanical effects; Polymer composite; Pre-strain; Relaxation kinetics; Sensor and actuators; Silicone elastomers; Single layer; Stress changes; Stress response; Conversion efficiency; Graphene; Infrared devices; Loading; Percolation (computer storage); Percolation (fluids); Percolation (solid state); Photoconductivity; Silicones; Stress analysis; Nanostructures; carbon nanotube; article; chemistry; conformation; crystallization; light; macromolecule; materials testing; methodology; particle size; photochemistry; radiation exposure; surface property; ultrastructure; Crystallization; Light; Macromolecular Substances; Materials Testing; Molecular Conformation; Nanotubes, Carbon; Particle Size; Photochemistry; Surface Properties",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860663780

In many High Arctic areas, driftwood and whale bone are usually the preferred targets for radiocarbon dating, with marine shells a third choice because of their often large age and height uncertainties with respect to former sea level. Here we detail a new approach to sampling marine shells that reduces these problems by targeting juvenile, articulated specimens of Astarte borealis that are washed onto the beach under storm conditions and become incorporated into the beach crest. Radiocarbon dates from articulated valves of A. borealis from eight raised beaches from Billefjorden, Svalbard, provide a chronology for Holocene beach ridge formation and RSL change that compares favourably to the most precise records developed from elsewhere in Svalbard using driftwood or whale bone. We demonstrate the value of this new approach by comparing our record with previously published RSL data from eastern Svalbard to test different models of Late Weichselian ice load in this region. We find support for a major ice dome centred south and east of Kong Karls Land but no evidence for a significant ice dome located over easternmost Spitsbergen or southern Hinlopen Strait as proposed from recent marine geophysical survey. The approach is potentially applicable elsewhere in Svalbard and the High Arctic to address questions of RSL change and beach ridge chronology, and hence wider questions regarding palaeoclimate and ice load history. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Arctic palaeoclimate; Glacio-isostasy; Raised beach; Relative sea-level change; Svalbard-Barents Sea Ice Sheet","Beach ridge; Borealis; Geophysical surveys; Glacio-isostasy; High arctic; Holocenes; Ice loads; Ice sheet; Palaeoclimate; Radiocarbon dates; Radiocarbon dating; Relative sea level; Sediment supply; Spitsbergen; Svalbard; Bone; Domes; Sea ice; Sea level; Storms; Wood; Beaches; bivalve; dome; geochronology; geophysical survey; glacioisostasy; Holocene; ice sheet; juvenile; paleoclimate; radiocarbon dating; raised beach; sea ice; sea level change; sediment transport; shell; Weichselian; Arctic; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen; Astarte borealis; Cetacea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863664796

The contribution of different emitters to the overall excitation-emission matrix was analyzed on the assumption that pure substances existing in a unique form show an excitation wavelength-invariant emission spectrum. The occurrence of emitters differing in size and aggregation was supported by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), time-resolved single photon counting, and time-resolved anisotropy experiments. The effect on photoluminescence (PL) of the particle surface oxidation as a result of aging is studied and compared to that of surface oxidized particles obtained by a top-down (TD) approach following an electrochemical method with HF etching. Surface oxidation to SiO x seems to introduce two different effects on the SiNP PL. An emission originated in surface states associated to SiO x was identified and observed for SiNPs synthesized by both BU and TD approaches.

Dairy cows were housed and monitored in 12 environmentally controlled rooms (4 cows diet-1). Two experiments were performed, representing two lactation stages (initial days in milk were 115 ± 39 d in Stage 1 and 216 ± 48 d in Stage 2). Th e results demonstrated that the combination of diff erent dietary ingredients resulted in diff erent gas emissions while maintaining similar dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield (MY). Diet eff ect on ammonia (NH3) emissions was more prominent in Stage 1. During Stage 1, cows fed the Midwest diet had the highest daily NH3 emission, corresponding to the highest crude protein (CP) concentration among the three regions. Th e diff erences in NH3 emissions (39.0%) were much larger than the percent diff erence in CP concentrations between diets (6.8%). Diff erences in N intake, N excretion, or milk urea N alone may not serve as a strong indicator of the potential to reduce NH3 emissions. Lower emissions of methane (CH4) per unit DMI or per unit MY were observed for cows off ered the South diet during Stage 1 as compared with that from cows off ered the Midwest or West diets. No diet eff ect was observed for hydrogen sulfi de (H2S) emission per unit S intake, nor for nitrous oxide (N2O) emission.

Building a low-carbon city has been pursued by people with a high degree of enthusiasm in China. Different from actions at the national level and distinct from practices of developed countries, low-carbon development in Chinese cities should be placed on diverse concerns. Taking Suzhou of Jiangsu Province of China as a case city, this paper adopts a scenario analysis approach to explore strategic focal points in the transition to a low-carbon city. Within this transition, we mainly focus on the different contributions from two factors-economic restructuring and technological upgrading. Scenario analysis results show that 1) in the case of no breakthrough technologies, it is difficult to achieve absolute emission reductions; 2) technologies involved in optimizing energy structure and improving energy efficiency of basic service sectors should be highly emphasized in local planning; 3) in comparison with technological upgrading, economic structural adjustment could be a stronger contributor to mitigation, which is one of the main differences from developed countries. However, the key issue of economic restructuring is to promote the growth of emerging low-carbon industries, which requires not only a strategic choice of new industries but also an introduction of advanced low-carbon technologies. It is also found that establishing a local carbon emissions accounting system is a prerequisite and the first priority for realizing a low-carbon transition and government capacity buildings should be strengthened accordingly. © 2011 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","economic restructuring; low-carbon city; technology upgrading",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870389509

The occurrence of PAHs was mainly derived from various combustion sources, especially the combustion of biomass and domestic coal. Uniform composition of sedimentary PAHs (52-62% of phenanthrene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, and benzo[g,h,i]perylene) suggested air-borne mixtures intractable to degradation. The concentrations of the sum of 15 PAHs (16 priority pollutants designed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency minus naphthalene; designed as Σ 15PAH) in Yellow Sea sediment cores were generally higher than those in the South China Sea. The profiles of Σ 15PAH concentrations recorded in the sediment cores closely followed historical socioeconomic development in China. In general, Σ 15PAH concentrations started to increase from the background pollution level posed by agricultural economy at the turn of 20th century. In addition, a Σ 15PAH concentration reduction was observed during the Chinese Civil War (1946-1949) and Great Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), suggesting them as setbacks for economic development in Chinese history. Increasing PAH emissions as a result of increasing coal combustion associated with the rapid urbanization and industrialization since the implementation of the Reform and Open Policy (since 1978) accounted for the fast growth of Σ 15PAH concentrations in sediment cores. The decline of Σ 15PAH concentrations from subsurface maximum until sampling time was inconsistent with current-day economic development in China, and may possibly suggest emission reductions due to decreasing proportional use of domestic coal and increasing consumption of cleaner energies (natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas).

SCIPP is a member of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-funded Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessments network, a program which aims to better connect climate-related scientific research with in-the-field decision-making processes. The results of the study found that the average temperature over the study area is anticipated to increase by 1. 7°C to 2. 4°C in the twenty-first century based on the different emission scenarios with a rate of change that is more pronounced during the second half of the century. Summer and fall seasons are projected to have more significant temperature increases, while the northwestern portions of the region are projected to experience more significant increases than the Gulf coast region. Precipitation projections, conversely, do not exhibit a discernible upward or downward trend. Late twenty-first century exhibits slightly more precipitation than the early century, based on the A1B and B1 scenario, and fall and winter are projected to become wetter than the late twentieth century as a whole. Climate changes on the city level show that greater warming will happened in inland cities such as Oklahoma City and El Paso, and heavier precipitation in Nashville. These changes have profound implications for local water resources management as well as broader regional decision making. These results represent an initial phase of a broader study that is being undertaken to assist SCIPP regional and local water planning efforts in an effort to more closely link climate modeling to longer-term water resources management and to continue assessing climate change impacts on regional hazards management in the South. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"air temperature; climate change; climate modeling; decision making; downscaling; global climate; hazard management; precipitation (climatology); trend analysis; twenty first century; urban climate; water management; El Paso; Gulf Coast [United States]; Nashville; Oklahoma County; Oklahoma [United States]; Tennessee; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864465135

This research presents a summary of the local efforts in China's ecological industrial parks (EIPs) to assess GHG emissions and identify potential mitigation measures. Through field study and interviews in Suzhou Industrial Park (SIP), in Jiangsu Province, we conducted an energy-based GHG emissions inventory for SIP area from 2005-2010, with forecasts to 2015. The area emitted a total of 10.30 MMT CO 2E in 2010. Three development strategies including business-as-usual (BAU), existing and pending regulations (EPR) and voluntary mitigating efforts (VME) were introduced to estimate the energy-related GHG emissions in 2015. The results projected that emissions will increase to 17.16Mt in 2015 with no change in policy or practice, but 3.42Mt of emissions are avoidable with full compliance with national and provincial energy policies (1.41Mt), as well as local efforts (2.01Mt).

Root malate exudation is the major contributor to Arabidopsis Al resistance, and is conferred by expression of AtALMT1, which encodes the root malate transporter. Root citrate exudation plays a smaller but still significant role in Arabidopsis Al resistance, and is conferred by expression of AtMATE, which encodes the root citrate transporter. In this study, we demonstrate that levels of Al-activated root organic acid exudation are closely correlated with expression of the organic acid transporter genes AtALMT1 and AtMATE. We also found that the AtALMT1 promoter confers a significantly higher level of gene expression than the AtMATE promoter. Analysis of AtALMT1 and AtMATE tissue- and cell-specific expression based on stable expression of promoter-reporter gene constructs showed that the two genes are expressed in complementary root regions: AtALMT1 is expressed in the root apices, while AtMATE is expressed in the mature portions of the roots. As citrate is a much more effective chelator of Al 3+ than malate, we used a promoter-swap strategy to test whether root tip-localized expression of the AtMATE coding region driven by the stronger AtALMT1 promoter (AtALMT1P::AtMATE) resulted in increased Arabidopsis Al resistance. Our results indicate that expression of AtALMT1 P::AtMATE not only significantly increased Al resistance of the transgenic plants, but also enhanced carbon-use efficiency for Al resistance. © 2012 The Authors.

Once implemented, the measures will have great impact on China’s foreign trade. Using the input-output table in 2007, this paper had analyzed the influences on China’s foreign trade as a whole and sub-sectors in three tax rates scenarios. The results showed that the tariff level of China’s exports will increase by 3.6%–6.3% if the tax was levied on exports embodied emissions, and by 1.0%–1.7% if levied on export direct emissions. In 2007, the former total amount of carbon tax was about US$42.6–73.0 billion, 4 times that of the latter. Based on export embodied emissions, sectors largely influenced were non-traditional energy intensive ones, such as textile, et al. These sectors should be encouraged to carry out industrial upgrading, raising the value-added of export goods, and reducing their embodied emissions by reduction of energy intensity. Taking into account of the complexity of data collection, the tax levied on products direct emission is more operational. The results showed that the five top sectors most affected were other chemical materials, processing of petroleum and nuclear fuel, coking, smelting and rolling of ferrous metal and textile. Most of them were energy intensive sectors. Therefore, adjusting export products structure, and controlling too fast development of energy intensive industries are also important strategies in China. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Border carbon adjustments; Climate change; Input-output model; International trade",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007823549

Given increasing human-derived stressors acting on marine ecosystems, the need for such effective action is urgently clear. Here we explore mechanisms underlying the utility of marine reserves to reinstate trophic dynamics and to increase resilience of kelp beds against climate-driven phase shift to sea urchin barrens on the rapidly warming Tasmanian east coast. Tethering and tagging experiments were used to examine size- and shelter-specific survival of the range-extending sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii (Diadematidae) translocated to reefs inside and outside no-take Tasmanian marine reserves. Results show that survival rates of C. rodgersii exposed on flat reef substratum by tethering were approximately seven times (small urchins 10.1 times; large urchins 6.1 times) lower on protected reef within marine reserve boundaries (high abundance of large predatorycapable lobsters) compared to fished reef (large predatory lobsters absent). When able to seek crevice shelter, tag-resighting models estimated that mortality rates of C. rodgersii were lower overall but remained 3.3 times (small urchins 2.1 times; large urchins 6.4 times) higher in the presence of large lobsters inside marine reserves, with higher survival of small urchins owing to greater access to crevices relative to large urchins. Indeed, shelter was 6.3 times and 3.1 times more important to survival of small and large urchins, respectively, on reserved relative to fished reef. Experimental results corroborate with surveys throughout the range extension region, showing greater occurrence of overgrazing on high-relief rocky habitats where shelter for C. rodgersii is readily available. This shows that ecosystem impacts mediated by range extension of such habitat-modifying organisms will be heterogeneous in space, and that marine systems with a more natural complement of large and thus functional predators, as achievable within no-take reserves, will minimize local risk of phase shifts by reinstating size and habitat-specific predator-prey dynamics eroded by fishing. Importantly, our findings also highlight the crucial need to account for the influence of size dynamics and habitat complexity on rates of key predator-prey interactions when managing expectations of ecosystem-level responses within marine reserve boundaries. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","Centrostephanus rodgersii; Climate change; Fishing; Kelp beds; Marine protected areas; Predation; Range extension; Resilience; Sea urchin; Spatial refuge; Tasmanian temperate reefs; Urchin barrens","anthropogenic effect; climate change; coral reef; echinoderm; habitat management; kelp forest; marine ecosystem; marine park; mortality; predator-prey interaction; range expansion; refuge; survival; trophic interaction; animal; article; biomass; body size; climate; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; food chain; methodology; Pacific Ocean; Palinuridae; physiology; population dynamics; predation; risk factor; sea urchin; Animals; Biomass; Body Size; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Food Chain; Pacific Ocean; Palinuridae; Population Dynamics; Predatory Behavior; Risk Factors; Sea Urchins; Australia; Tasmania; Centrostephanus rodgersii; Diadematidae; Echinoidea; lobster",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863006611

Analysis of these signals strongly suggests the TeV emission to have a morphology consistent with a point source up to the angular resolution of the HESS telescope (approximately 3pc), while the point-source nature of the GeV emission is currently unsettled, with indications that it may be spatially extended. In the case that the emission is hadronic and in a steady state, we show that the expected γ-ray morphology is dominated by the distribution of target gas, rather than by details of cosmic-ray injection and propagation. Specifically, we expect a significant portion of hadronic emission to coincide with the position of the circumnuclear ring, which resides between 1 and 3pc from the Galactic center. We note that the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be able to observe conclusive correlations between the morphology of the TeV γ-ray source and the observed gas density, convincingly confirming or ruling out a hadronic origin for the γ-ray emission. © 2012.

Meanwhile, the bound metal ions could be completely recovered to actualize their recyclable utilization. The magnetic sorbent was prepared with micro-suspension polymerization and its surface was modified with amino groups. After the adsorption by these magnetic beads, the residual concentrations of these metal ions (Cu2+, Ni2+ and Co2+) could be reduced to 0.537, 1.0 and 0.01mgL-1, respectively. The corresponding recovery efficiency of the bound metal ions exceeded 98%, which meant the almost all metal ions could be fully recycled without change their valence state and chemical properties. The adsorption equilibrium and kinetics were also studied. It found that the only a monolayer of metal ions was absorbed on the surface of these magnetic beads. The saturated amount of Co2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ reached to 50.3, 49.6 and 51.7mgg-1, respectively and each amino group on the magnetic beads could capture a metal ion.

The study of climate-vegetation interaction is the basis for research on the responses of terrestrial ecosystem to global change and mainly comprises two important components: climate vegetation classification and the NPP of the natural vegetation. Comparing NPP estimated from the classification indices-based model with NPP derived from measurements at 3767 sites in China indicated that the classification indices-based model was capable of estimating large scale NPP. Annual cumulative temperature above 0°C and a moisture index, two main factors affecting NPP, were spatially plotted with the ArcGIS grid tool based on measured data in 2348 meteorological stations from 1961 to 2006. The distribution of NPP for potential vegetation classes under present climate conditions was simulated by the classification indices-based model. The model estimated the total NPP of potential terrestrial vegetation of China to fluctuate between 1.93 and 4.54 Pg C year -1. It provides a reliable means for scaling-up from site to regional scales, and the findings could potentially favor China's position in reducing global warming gases as outlined in the Kyoto Protocol in order to fulfill China's commitment of reducing greenhouse gases. © World Scientific Publishing Company.","classification indices-based model; climate-vegetation interaction; Integrated Orderly Classification System (IOCS); Net primary productivity (NPP); potential productivity of natural vegetation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860442701

However, the motorcycles' emissions are the main moving air pollution sources. Therefore, it's important to develop more efficient combustion technology in order to save energy and reduce air pollution. In this paper, a novel technology of hydrogen-gasoline compound fuel is developed. Hydrogen gas is released from solid state hydrogen storage tank and then mixed with the incoming gasoline. The intake valve in manifold sucks the hydrogen-gasoline compound fuel into the cylinder for combustion. A series of performance test is conducted by motorcycle chassis dynamometers. The results reveal that this technology can increase the power and torque, and decrease fuel consumption per kilo-power due to promote combustion efficiency. In addition, the hydrogen has greater heat value, so the oil temperature and sparkplug temperature increase. This technique can reduce CO and HC, but increase CO2 and NOx. The engine performance is improved at rarefied hydrogen-gasoline compound fuel. Therefore, the engine performance with M.J. #98 is better than that with M.J. #110. This technique can achieve energy saving and environment-friendly purpose.

This paper simulates the potential impacts of subsidy removal, and compares different policy options to mitigate the adverse effects. The main findings are as follows. Firstly, subsidy removal would affect the competitiveness, output, welfare and emissions of different world regions disproportionally. Secondly, subsidy removal in China would result in competitiveness issue through trade channel, which would generate negative externalities to China, but positive externalities to other world regions without subsidy removal. Thirdly, subsidy removal in China would result in rebound effects, which would generate positive externalities to regions without subsidy removal, but be harmful to world's emission reductions.

The proposed method is based on a combination of independent component analysis (ICA) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Since the classical CCA cannot handle high-dimensional data wherein the number of variables is larger than the number of observations, ICA is pre-performed to reduce the dimension of the data. It is well known that empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is a popular method for dimension reduction in the climatology community; however, loss of information occurs when the data is not Gaussian distributed. To extend the scope of distribution assumption and improve the prediction ability simultaneously, we propose the ICA-based method. This study focuses on the prediction of future precipitation for the boreal summer (June- July-August; JJA) through 29 years (1979-2007) on East Asia region. Results of the proposed ICA-based method show an improvement in seasonal climate prediction in terms of correlation and root mean square error as compared with those of the GCM simulation and the EOF/CCA method. © The Korean Meteorological Society and Springer 2012.","Canonical correlation analysis; Climate change; Independent component analysis; Precipitation; Prediction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864032959

Key economic sectors in Suzhou considering direct amount are production and supply of electric and heat power, smelting and pressing of ferrous metals, services, other manufacturing, textile, non-metallic mineral products and chemistry, while key economic sectors considering accumulative amount are agriculture, construction, production and supply of electric and heat power, services and smelting and pressing of ferrous metals. Uncertainties for sustainable urban materials management are consistent with the development stage of the economy. Thus, when constructing urban PIOT for a particular city based on monetary input-output table (MIOT) of another city or province, the development stage of the city or province whose MIOT is used should be similar to that of the particular city.

Non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), as key precursors of ozone, were found to be the limiting factor in photochemical ozone formation for large areas in the PRD. For source apportioning of NMHCs as well as ozone pollution control strategies, it is necessary to obtain typical seasonal and diurnal patterns of NMHCs with a large pool of field data. To date, few studies have focused on seasonal and diurnal variations of NMHCs in urban areas of Guangzhou. This study explored the seasonal variations of most hydrocarbons concentrations with autumn maximum and spring minimum in Guangzhou. The diurnal variations of most anthropogenic NMHCs typically showed two-peak pattern with one at 8:00 in the morning and another at 20:00 in the evening, both corresponding to traffic rush hours in Guangzhou, whereas isoprene displayed a different bimodal diurnal curve. Propene, ethene, m, p-xylene and toluene were the four largest contributors to ozone formation in Guangzhou, based on the evaluation of individual NMHCs' photochemical reactivity. Therefore, an effective strategy for controlling ozone pollution may be achieved by the reduction of vehicle emissions in Guangzhou. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Non-methane hydrocarbons; Ozone formation; Photochemical reactivity; Seasonal and diurnal variations","2,3 dimethylbutane; 3 methylhexane; 3 methylpentane; alkane; alkyne; aromatic hydrocarbon; benzene; biogenic; butane; ethane; ethylbenzene; ethylene; heptane; hexane; hydrocarbon; isohexane; isoprene; octane; para xylene; pentane; propylene; toluene; unclassified drug; xylene; air quality; concentration (composition); diurnal variation; isoprene; nonmethane hydrocarbon; ozone; photochemistry; toluene; traffic emission; urban area; xylene; air analysis; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; article; autumn; China; circadian rhythm; controlled study; environmental impact assessment; exhaust gas; photochemistry; seasonal variation; spring; summer; urban area; winter; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861496070

When manure is excreted by animals, it undergoes a series of reactions such as decomposition, hydrolysis, ammonia volatilization, nitrification, denitrification, fermentation etc., from which carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitrous oxide (N 2O), methane (CH 4) and ammonia (NH 3) can be produced. Based on the principles of thermodynamics and reaction kinetics, these reactions are commonly controlled by a group of environmental factors such as temperature, moisture, redox potential, pH, substrate concentration gradient etc. The relations among the environmental factors, the reactions and the gas production have been incorporated in a process-based model, Manure-DNDC, to describe manure organic matter turnover and gas emissions. Using Manure-DNDC, the users can construct a virtual farm by selecting and integrating one or more of the candidate farm facilities (i. e., feedlot, compost, lagoon, anaerobic digester and cropping field) parameterized in the model. Manure-DNDC calculates variations of the environmental factors for each component facility based on its technical specifications, and then utilizes the environmental factors to drive the biogeochemical reactions. To verify the applicability of Manure-DNDC for livestock farms, seven datasets of air emissions measured from farms across the U. S. plus a Scotland pasture were utilized for model tests with encouraging results. A dairy farm in New York was used to assess the impacts of alternative management practices on the gas mitigation. The modeled results showed that a combination of changes in the feed quality, the lagoon coverage and the planted crop type could reduce greenhouse gas emission by 30 % and NH 3 by 36 % at the farm scale. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Ammonia volatilization; DNDC; Farm scale; Greenhouse gases; Livestock operation systems; Manure life cycle","biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); denitrification; environmental factor; fermentation; gas production; greenhouse gas; hydrolysis; livestock; livestock farming; management practice; manure; nitrogen compound; numerical model; pH; reaction kinetics; soil emission; temperature effect; thermodynamics; volatilization; New York [United States]; Scotland; United Kingdom; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863548849

To levy CBTA could reduce China's emissions. Meanwhile, China's emissions reduction could also be achieved by China's climate policies (termed as CBTA-emissions-equivalent policies). This paper contributes to the discussion on CBTA by comparing the potential regional effects of CBTA and CBTA-emissions-equivalent policies. The main findings are as follows: (1) CBTA and CBTA-emissions-equivalent policies would result in relocations of outputs across regions and countries, affect the structure of economy and contribute to world's emissions reduction. (2) There would be significant differences in the regional effects between CBTA and CBTA-emissions-equivalent policies. (3) Compared to carbon tax, CBTA would be a costly and inefficient policy instrument to reduce emissions, but could function as an effective coercion strategy. (4) These policies would result in competitiveness issue and rebound effects, wherein different countries would be affected differently. China is a large economy and energy consumer with high openness to international trade. Looking ahead, the Chinese government should consider the potential interactions between China and other economies when designing tax reforms. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon leakage; Carbon motivated border tax adjustments; Competitiveness issue","Border tax adjustments; Carbon emissions; Carbon leakage; Carbon taxes; Chinese Government; Climate policy; Competitiveness issue; Emissions reduction; Energy consumer; Policy instruments; Rebound effect; Regional effects; Tax reform; Competition; Emission control; International trade; Taxation; Carbon; carbon emission; economic impact; emission control; environmental economics; environmental policy; environmental tax; government; policy implementation; policy strategy; tax reform; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862241813

Analysis and compilation of 10 sediment cores from 8 sites distributed on the eastern Canadian continental shelf and upper slope south of Hudson Strait revealed distinct beds with elevated detrital carbonate (DC) concentrations, known by their distinct composition to originate from erosion of carbonate bedrock and carbonate-rich glacial sediments in the Hudson Bay-Hudson Strait region. At all but one site, radiocarbon ages, bracketing and within the thickest and most widespread of these beds, are coeval with the age constraints for the Agassiz floods in Hudson Strait and southeastern Hudson Bay. The DC distribution and concentration of this bed are consistent with southward transport in the Labrador Current. Transfer function analysis of dinoflagellate assemblage data from cores on the central Labrador Shelf, in Hudson Bay, and on the Northeast Newfoundland Shelf reveal that early Holocene seasonal ice cover was 5-6 months longer than at present, requiring the application of a 200-year reduction to the radiocarbon age constraints on the Lake Agassiz outburst floods. The age of the floods is reduced to about 8.33 cal ka (7.5 14C ka) from the previous determination of 8.47 cal ka (7.7 14C ka), with a similar reduction in their error ranges to 8.04-8.49 cal ka from 8.16-8.74 cal ka. Based on present current routing, the Agassiz floodwaters and icebergs are inferred to have travelled south in the Labrador Current, and to have possibly become incorporated into the North Atlantic Current, and transported to the Nordic seas. There the freshwater additions would have lessened deepwater production with a concomitant reduction in northward heat transport in the upper limb of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, thereby contributing to the 8.2 cal ka cold event. Variation in the calcite and dolomite content of the Agassiz DC bed, two salinity reductions during Agassiz bed deposition, and low-level shorelines of lakes Agassiz and Ojibway suggest that more than one outburst was delivered during the final Agassiz drainage. The 8.2 cal ka cold event registered in Greenland was coeval with a second or later flood, which possibly accompanied the final collapse of the LIS in Hudson Bay. © 2011 .",,"bedrock; carbonate; concentration (composition); continental shelf; core analysis; detrital deposit; dinoflagellate; glacial deposit; Holocene; ice cover; iceberg; Laurentide Ice Sheet; radiocarbon dating; Atlantic Ocean; Canada; Hudson Strait; Labrador Current; Dinophyceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860250131

Mechanisms driving intraannual variability in DMS production and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) degradation in open-ocean, oligotrophic regions were investigated during a 10-month time-series at the Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study site in the Sargasso Sea. Abundance and transcription of bacterial DMSP degradation genes, DMSP lyase enzyme activity, and DMS and DMSP concentrations, consumption rates and production rates were quantified over time and depth. This interdisciplinary data set was used to test current hypotheses of the role of light and carbon supply in regulating upper-ocean sulfur cycling. Findings supported UV-A-dependent phytoplankton DMS production. Bacterial DMSP degraders may also contribute significantly to DMS production when temperatures are elevated and UV-A dose is moderate, but may favour DMSP demethylation under low UV-A doses. Three groups of bacterial DMSP degraders with distinct intraannual variability were identified and niche differentiation was indicated. The combination of genetic and biochemical data suggest a modified 'bacterial switch' hypothesis where the prevalence of different bacterial DMSP degradation pathways is regulated by a complex set of factors including carbon supply, temperature and UV-A dose. © 2012 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"dimethyl sulfide; dimethylpropiothetin; dimethylsulfoniopropionate lyase; lyase; sea water; sulfide; sulfonium derivative; sulfur; article; Atlantic Ocean; bacterial gene; bacterium; Bermuda; enzymology; genetic transcription; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; phytoplankton; radiation exposure; ultraviolet radiation; Atlantic Ocean; Bacteria; Bermuda; Carbon-Sulfur Lyases; Genes, Bacterial; Phytoplankton; Seawater; Sulfides; Sulfonium Compounds; Sulfur; Transcription, Genetic; Ultraviolet Rays; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859967992

The shale gas boom has major implications for the future of nuclear power, the author writes. Projections for the cost of electricity suggest that natural gas will maintain an advantage over nuclear power for many years to come in the United States, and there is reason to believe that overseas markets could eventually enjoy some of the benefits of the shale gas boom. Uncertainties about the size of shale resources and the long-term productivity of new wells could affect the future price of natural gas in the United States but are unlikely to make nuclear power competitive with gas, the author argues. However, public fears about environmental contamination could drive up the cost of natural gas. The author urges companies and policy makers to address these fears in ways that build public confidence. Stringent climate policy probably would not eliminate the cost advantage of natural gas over nuclear before 2030, he writes, but could tip the balance after that. The biggest question mark looming over natural gas in a carbon-constrained world is the prospect of applying carbon-capture-and- sequestration technology to the resource. © 2012 The Author(s).","carbon capture and sequestration; climate change; coal; energy prices; natural gas; nuclear power; shale gas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871798890

Saccharomyces cerevisiae UGA4 gene encodes a permease capable of transporting γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into the cells. Yeast uses this amino acid as a nitrogen source or as a carbon skeleton that enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle.The quality of the carbon source modulates UGA4 expression through two parallel pathways, each one acting on different regulatory elements, the UAS GATA and the UAS GABA. In the presence of a fermentable carbon source, UGA4 expression is induced by GABA while in the presence of a non-fermentable carbon source this expression is GABA-independent.The aim of this work was to study the mechanisms responsible for the differences in the profiles of UGA4 expression in both growth conditions.We found that although the subcellular localization of Gln3 depends on the carbon source and UGA4 expression depends on Tor1 and Snf1, Gln3 localization does not depend on these kinases. We also found that the phosphorylation of Gln3 is mediated by two systems activated by a non-fermentable carbon source, involving the Snf1 kinase and an unidentified TORC1-regulated kinase.We also found that the activity of the main transcription factors responsible for UGA4 induction by GABA varies depending on the quality of the carbon source. In a fermentable carbon source such as glucose, the negative GATA factor Dal80 binds to UGA4 promoter; only after the addition of the inducer, the positive factors Uga3, Dal81 and Gln3 interact with the promoter removing Dal80 and leading to gene induction. In contrast, in the non-fermentable carbon source acetate the negative GATA factor remains bound to UGA4 promoter in the presence or absence of GABA, the positive factors are not detected bound in any of these conditions and in consequence, UGA4 is not induced. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon regulation; Dal81; GATA factors; Kinases; Uga3; UGA4","4 aminobutyric acid; carbon; fungal protein; transcription factor; uga4 protein; unclassified drug; article; carbon source; gene induction; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Carbon; DNA-Binding Proteins; Fermentation; GABA Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; gamma-Aminobutyric Acid; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Glucose; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Transcription Factors; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860664891

Thus, its larvae are exposed to variations in available food sources (in terms of quantity and quality). We aimed to investigate if bacteria could contribute to larval food both in presence or absence of phytoplankton, and to compare these results to seasonal variations of bacteria and phytoplankton abundances at a coastal site in the English Channel. First, ingestion of fluorescent beads of 0.5 to 2μm diameter, showed that larvae were able to ingest particles of typical bacterial size. Then we used a dual stable isotope labeling approach which consisted in labeling a bacterial pelagic community with 15N and a diatom (Chaetoceros gracilis) culture with 13C, and supplying larvae with 15N-labeled bacteria, 13C-labeled diatoms, and both labeled sources. This technique has, to our knowledge, never been applied to invertebrate larvae. After 24h of experiment, larvae were significantly enriched in all treatments: +21.5‰ ({increment}δ 13C) when supplied with diatoms, +1364‰ ({increment}δ 15N) when supplied with bacteria, and +24‰ ({increment}δ 13C) and +135‰ ({increment}δ 15N) when supplied with the two mixed sources. These results indicated that bacteria can contribute to the larval nutrition in C. fornicata, even in the presence of phytoplankton. Our results however suggested that larvae of C. fornicata preferentially used diatoms and showed that the supply of free bacteria did not alter the uptake of diatoms. Considering the seasonal variations of bacteria and phytoplankton abundances at the study site, these results suggested that bacteria may constitute a complementary resource for the larvae of C. fornicata when phytoplankton is abundant and may become a substitute resource when phytoplankton is less available. This approach offers promising perspectives to trace food sources and assess nitrogen and carbon fluxes between planktotrophic larvae and their preys. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","13c and 15n; Bacteria; Crepidula fornicata; Diatoms; Larval feeding; Stable isotope labeling","abundance; bacteriology; carbon cycle; diatom; food availability; gastropod; invasive species; larva; nitrogen cycle; phytoplankton; preference behavior; seasonal variation; stable isotope; English Channel; Bacillariophyta; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chaetoceros gracilis; Crepidula fornicata; Diplomonadida group; Gastropoda; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858727904

However, concerns have been raised regarding the sensitivity of the results to model specifications, lower exposures, and averaging time. Objective: We addressed these issues using 11 additional years of follow-up of the Harvard Six Cities study, incorporating recent lower exposures. Methods: We replicated the previously applied Cox regression, and examined different time lags, the shape of the concentration-response relationship using penalized splines, and changes in the slope of the relation over time. We then conducted Poisson survival analysis with time-varying effects for smoking, sex, and education. Results: Since 2001, average PM2.5 levels, for all six cities, were &lt; 18 μg/m3. Each increase in PM2.5 (10 μg/m3) was associated with an adjusted increased risk of all-cause mortality (PM2.5 average on previous year) of 14% [95% confidence interval (CI): 7, 22], and with 26% (95% CI: 14, 40) and 37% (95% CI: 7, 75) increases in cardiovascular and lung-cancer mortality (PM2.5 average of three previous years), respectively. The concentration-response relationship was linear down to PM2.5 concentrations of 8 μg/m3.

A thermodynamic model of the combined heat and power solid oxide fuel cell generator (μCHP-SOFC) running on methanol and ethanol, respectively, has been developed. System performances achieved with these two fuels are compared to the baseline plant operated with methane, and are evaluated considering either internal or external vaporization plus pre-heating of the liquid fuel. The achieved lower heating value (LHV) efficiencies for the conversion into electricity of methane, methanol and ethanol are found comparable, ranging from 51 to 56%. The efficiency penalty observed when switching from methane to the liquid fuels is modest, or even nil (ethanol case), provided that the fuel is vaporized and pre-heated within the SOFC 'hot-box'.Experimental sessions on planar Ni-based anode supported SOFCs running on methanol and ethanol, respectively, are also presented. The fuel cell operation under direct internal steam-reforming of these two fuels is assessed at 800 and 1000 °C, while varying the steam-to-fuel (S/F) ratio and the fuel utilization (FU) factor. Methanol is easily converted at both 800 °C and 1000 °C when directly fed to the Ni anode; whereas, direct reforming of ethanol requires an operating temperature as high as 1000 °C. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Ethanol; Internal reforming; Liquid fuels; Methanol; SOFC; System modeling","Anode-supported SOFCs; Combined heat and power; Direct internal reforming; Fuel cell operation; Fuel utilization; Internal reforming; Lower heating value; Operating temperature; Solid oxide; System modeling; Thermodynamic model; Ethanol; Liquid fuels; Methane; Methanol; Power generation; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Vapors; Steam reforming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860553239

Our results show that sites with the highest levels of SAD had reduced canopy cover, stand density, and basal area, and these differences were reflected by reductions in understory vegetation cover. Conversely, sites with the highest levels of SAD had greater understory standing biomass, suggesting that vegetation on these sites was highly clustered. Changes in forest and understory vegetation structure likely resulted in shifts in small mammal community composition across the SAD gradient, as we found reduced species diversity and higher densities of deer mice, the primary host for SNV, on sites with the highest levels of SAD. Sites with the highest levels of SAD also had significantly greater SNV prevalence compared to sites with lower levels of SAD, which is likely a result of their abundance of deer mice.

We propose a low-field NMR tomographic method to non-invasively image the water-content distribution in electrically conductive formations in relatively large-scale experiments (∼1 m3 sample volumes). Operating in the weak magnetic field of Earth entails low Larmor frequencies at which electromagnetic fields can penetrate electrically conductive material. The low signal strengths associated with NMR in Earth's field are enhanced by pre-polarization before signal recording. To localize the origin of the NMR signal in the sample region we do not employ magnetic field gradients, as is done in conventional NMR imaging, because they can be difficult to control in the large sample volumes that we are concerned with, and may be biased by magnetic materials in the sample. Instead, we utilize the spatially dependent inhomogeneity of fields generated by surface coils that are installed around the sample volume. This relatively simple setup makes the instrument inexpensive and mobile (it can be potentially installed in remote locations outside of a laboratory), while allowing spatial resolution of the order of 10 cm. We demonstrate the general feasibility of our approach in a simulated CO2 injection experiment, where we locate and quantify the drop in water content following gas injection into a water-saturated cylindrical sample of 0.45 m radius and 0.9 m height. Our setup comprises four surface coils and an array consisting of three volume coils surrounding the sample. The proposed tomographic NMR methodology provides a more direct estimate of fluid content and properties than can be achieved with acoustic or electromagnetic methods alone. Therefore, we expect that our proposed method is relevant for geophysical applications, such as for monitoring CO2 injections in saline aquifers or detecting water leakage into nuclear waste deposit sites installed in electrically conductive formations. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

If we take rapid urbanisation as a given and that it is already well underway, it is still widely unclear what research needs to be conducted and policy changes made to support municipalities of fast transforming cities and to avoid repeating the development mistakes that have occurred in industrialised nations, i.e. driving urban growth with high consumption patterns without fully considering the environmental and social needs and occupants' behaviour and aspirations. The scale and pace of change requires a solid systems approach of urban development. The purpose of this paper is to explore the rapid urbanisation of Chinese cities with a focus on the plans for a new, on-going urban sub-centre in the north-west of Shanghai: Zhenru urban sub-centre. Information-rich urbanisation is a defining feature of the 21st century, reshaping cities and communities in China and in developing countries around the world. The paper compares two cases of urban development patterns for new sub-centres for polycentric city structures: it relates to new urban sub-centres in Berlin (Germany) and Shanghai (China), and the relationship of these sub-centres to 'Network City' theory. Network theory is useful in this context as the 'network' metaphor and concepts of decentralisation seem to have replaced the 'machine' metaphor which was based on efficiency based on the availability of cheap fossil fuels. The question to be addressed is how Chinese cities can be better steered towards more sustainable models of development. As cities aim to move towards more resilient urban ecosystems and polycentric systems, the case of Potsdamer Platz Berlin, compared to Zhenru sub-centre in Shanghai, is discussed. Both are transport-oriented developments promoting mixed-use density and less car-dependency. According to documentation of the Shanghai municipality, Zhenru urban centre, which is currently in its planning phase, is supposed to become a 'new sustainable sub-centre for a growing metropolis'. Based on the Potsdamer Platz experience, where an isolated 'City within the City' was developed, a series of careful recommendations are formulated for the design and development of such centres, knowing that it is rather difficult to translate from one case to the other. The conclusion includes five lessons (recommendations) from Potsdamer Platz for the urban design of new sub-centres to ensure a delivery of economical, social and environmental sustainable outcomes. A core finding is that drawing lessons from the German case study for Chinese urbanisation seemed a useful tactic and gave a sense that there are underlying urban design strategies. However, the conversion of such strategies to another cultural and social context requires further research. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","China; Network city theory; Urban sub-centre",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861095223

Even though CO2 itself is not harmful, high levels of CO2 concentration in indoor environments displace oxygen in the air and can cause a deficiency of oxygen for breathing. The most important aspect of CO2 in DCV is that it is a good indicator of occupancy in indoor spaces. Therefore, CO2 is an effective parameter for controlling ventilation based on occupancy level. CO2-based DCV has been increasingly used in recent years to optimize the energy consumption in ventilation systems as technological advances make its implementation more feasible and interest in environmentally responsible building design grows. This study aims to provide information about CO2-based DCV and suggest implications for interior design practitioners and educators. To achieve this purpose, this study reviewed previous studies and examined the current practices in CO2-based DCV in order to suggest guidelines for CO2-based DCV implementation for interior designers. The guidelines focused on proper CO2 sensor location design, taking into consideration the activities and other equipment in the room. In addition, a study of CO2-based DCV in the lecture halls of a university campus was conducted. Physical measurements were done in the lecture halls, and trends data were collected from the university's facility management department to compare the measurements. A perceived indoor environmental quality survey was also done to explore the occupants' responses about CO2-based DCV. © Copyright 2012, Interior Design Educators Council.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883519828

In advance of fishery-enhancement trials for the mud crab Scylla olivacea, a mark-recapture study was conducted to estimate population size and turnover in 50ha of isolated mangrove on Panay Island, Philippines. A total of 811 crabs were released in six sessions with an overall recapture rate of 41.5±3.6%. Population size ranged from 607-1637 individuals. There was a high degree of site-fidelity, with 45.5% of recaptures in the same sampling areas as releases. Total mortality was 0.79month-1, with fishing mortality accounting for 95% of overall mortality. Von Bertalanffy and Gompertz growth models yielded estimates for L∞ (carapace width) of 117.3±14.7 and 110.6±2.1mm and for k of 2.16±0.74 and 3.25±0.81, respectively. Crab densities of 12-33 individuals ha-1 in the study area were lower than in other mangrove systems owing to intermittent recruitment, while growth rates indicated no limitation in terms of food supply.

The Nd variations are highly consistent and exhibit reproducible patterns over a very large geographic area, confirming the seawater origin of the signal. Combining geochemical constraints with paleogeographic reconstructions, we highlight the respective roles of (1) large-scale tectonic events, (2) continental weathering from surrounding Precambrian terrains (90-65 Ma), (3) oceanic circulation changes (50-40 Ma) and, possibly, (4) local volcanism of the ultra-fast spreading South East Indian Ridge (SEIR) (60-50 Ma) on the Nd isotopic composition of South Indian seawater. Between 60 Ma and 50 Ma, the regional Nd isotopic variations closely mimic changes in SEIR spreading rate. We suggest that the Nd isotopic composition of seawater could be influenced by Nd of volcanic origin in the vicinity of ultra-fast spreading ridges (>13 cm/yr). The India-Asia collision closed the Equatorial Seaway between Asia and India and drastically changed oceanic circulation patterns in the Indian Ocean: warm and more radiogenic Pacific equatorial seawater was diverted to the South by the East Indian coast.

The purpose of the studies was to analyse children's specific vulnerabilities to climate change that need to be taken into account in policy development. Scientific research indicates that existing vulnerabilities are likely to be exacerbated by continued climate change. Because children have unique perspectives of their environment, they can be important actors in enhancing community capacity to address climate-related risks. In the UNICEF research, children noted a range of experiences, ranging from livelihood insecurity in Mongolia to threats of sea level rising in the Pacific Islands to massive flooding of their neighbourhoods in the Philippines and crop failures in Indonesia. Involving children in the design of policy, and designing climate change policies with children's rights in mind, are essential to creating policies that do not have unintended negative consequences. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Child-centred adaptation; Children; Climate change; Sustainable development",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863986859

These forests are being altered at a rapid rate, especially by industrial logging and swidden farming. Wildfires, expanding oil palm plantations, and industrial mining are also causing forest loss. At current rates of exploitation, most industrially accessible forests in PNG are projected to be logged or cleared in just 1-2 decades. Much of the country's timber is exported as raw logs, mainly to China, providing only limited income and employment for local communities. Despite growing exploitation of its natural resources, many social indicators in PNG, such as per-capita income, literacy, and the Human Development Index, remain alarmingly low. We highlight a range of near-term policy measures designed to improve forest conservation and sustainability in PNG. These include: (1) reducing annual timber harvests to a more-sustainable level, (2) curtailing raw-log exports while promoting expansion of domestic wood-processing industries, (3) combating serious corruption in the forestry sector, (4) reinstating the rights of traditional communities in PNG to sue corporations for past or anticipated environmental damage, (5) expanding and improving the management of protected areas, and (6) stabilizing the administration of international carbon-trading funds designed to reduce emissions from forest conversion. We also recommend that educational and family-planning support be improved for younger women to help reduce the destabilizing effects of rapid population growth. These measures will help to reduce environmental damage and slow the exhaustion of timber supplies, while improving societal benefits for PNG citizens. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon-trading; Corruption; Deforestation; Forest management; Globalization; Governance; Logging; Multinational corporations; Papua New Guinea; REDD; Tropical timber","conservation planning; corruption; deforestation; emissions trading; environmental degradation; environmental economics; environmental education; export; family planning; forest management; globalization; industrial development; logging (timber); multinational enterprise; native species; population growth; prioritization; protected area; shifting cultivation; sustainable development; timber industry; trade-environment relations; tropical forest; wildfire; Papua New Guinea; Elaeis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862002578

Post-mining landscapes often differ dramatically from pre-mining ones. One of the largest open cut lignite mining areas in Europe is in Eastern Germany, south of Leipzig. This paper uses an ecosystem services approach to assess the impacts of mining activity over a 100-year period, spanning pre- and post-mining states. We recorded historical land use data from maps and outlined three future potential land use scenarios based on current planning documents. Our results indicate that maps showing the potentials to provide ecosystem services support the prioritization of preference areas in regional planning. For example, forested and heterogeneous habitats are predicted to enhance future urban development and mitigation of future climate change - a goal of the Saxon government. In contrast, if future development priorities are on local food production and bio-energy use, more arable and grassland areas should be pursued. The use of freely and publicly available data and the simple methods of the approach presented here can be used to inform and improve regional landscape planning. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

They are rapidly progressing northwestward, closely approaching the Adriatic and the Tyrrhenian seas. The shift in range locally leads to profound ecological changes where amphisteginids have become the dominant species along entire stretches of coastline. Mass deposits of amphisteginids reflect an increased carbonate production and reduced assemblage diversity, and these are likely to trigger major changes in ecosystem functioning. It is anticipated that the ongoing warming trend will convey the northwestward migration of amphisteginid foraminifers. To project future species distributions we applied a speciesdistribution model (SDM) that is based on ecological niche constraints of current distribution ranges. Our model indicates that further warming is likely to cause a northwestward range extension and predicts dispersal through the straits of Sicily, Messina, and Otranto into the Tyrrhenian and Adriatic seas.

But the required amounts of transfer payments and justifications for them remain contested. We contribute to this debate by developing an argument for transfer payments that derives from the differences between carbon prices that different countries may set in light of two distinct criteria for appropriate levels of emission reductions. If, for reasons of cost efficiency, a globally uniform carbon price was installed, transfer payments would be required to offset these differences. We combine global climate modelling with regional welfare analysis to estimate regional carbon prices under various climate change, emissions and economic scenarios. The estimated ratios between regional carbon prices are surprisingly robust to different modelling assumptions. To the extent that burden-sharing choices in global climate policy are motivated by regional carbon prices, our analysis allows for a quantification of required transfer payments. Assuming a global carbon price of US$35 per tĝ€‰CO 2, for example, our estimates would justify transfer payments of the order of US$15ĝ€""48 billion per year. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Normalized SOA yield curves exhibited an increase followed by a decrease as a function of OH exposure, with maximum yields at O/C ratios ranging from 0.29 to 0.74. The decrease in SOA yield correlates with an increase in oxygen content and decrease in carbon content, consistent with transitions from functionalization to fragmentation. For a subset of alkane precursors (n-C10, n-C15, and JP-10), maximum SOA yields were estimated to be 0.39, 0.69, and 1.1.

Drawing on national and provincial/state level data from telephone surveys administered in the United States and in Canada, the paper provides insight into where the public stands on the climate change issue in two of the most carbon-intensive federal systems in the world. The paper includes the first directly comparable public opinion data on how Canadians and Americans form their opinions regarding climate matters and provides insight into the preferences of these two populations regarding climate policies at both the national and sub-federal levels.

While there is evidence that some species have responded by moving their distributions to higher latitudes, the efficiency of this response in tracking species' climatic niche boundaries over time has yet to be addressed. 2.Here, we provide a continental assessment of the temporal structure of species responses to recent spatial shifts in climatic conditions. We examined geographic associations with minimum winter temperature for 59 species of winter avifauna at 476 Christmas Bird Count circles in North America from 1975 to 2009 under three sampling schemes that account for spatial and temporal sampling effects. 3.Minimum winter temperature associated with species occurrences showed an overall increase with a weakening trend after 1998. Species displayed highly variable responses that, on average and across sampling schemes, contained a strong lag effect that weakened in strength over time. In general, the conservation of minimum winter temperature was relevant when all species were considered together but only after an initial lag period (c. 35years) was overcome. The delayed niche tracking observed at the combined species level was likely supported by the post1998 lull in the warming trend. 4.There are limited geographic and ecological explanations for the observed variability, suggesting that the efficiency of species' responses under climate change is likely to be highly idiosyncratic and difficult to predict. This outcome is likely to be even more pronounced and time lags more persistent for less vagile taxa, particularly during the periods of consistent or accelerating warming. Current modelling efforts and conservation strategies need to better appreciate the variation, strength and duration of lag effects and their association with climatic variability. Conservation strategies in particular will benefit through identifying and maintaining dispersal corridors that accommodate diverging dispersal strategies and timetables. © 2012 The Authors.

With the recent advances in synthesizing large-area graphene sheets, engineers have begun investigating viable methodologies for conducting graphene metrology and quality control at industrial scales to understand a variety of reliability issues including defects, patternability, electrical, and physical properties. This review summarizes the current state of industrial graphene metrology and provides an overview of graphene metrology techniques. In addition, a recently developed large-area graphene metrology technique based on fluorescence quenching is introduced. For each metrology technique, the industrial metrics it measures are identified - layer thickness, edge structure, defects, Fermi level, and thermal conductivity - and a detailed description is provided as to how the measurements are performed. Additionally, the potential advantages of each technique for industrial use are identified, including throughput, scalability, sensitivity to substrate/environment, and on their demonstrated ability to achieve quantified results. The recently developed fluorescence-quenching metrology technique is shown to meet all the necessary criteria for industrial applications, rendering it the first industry-ready graphene metrology technique. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon atoms; Edge structures; Electrical and optical properties; Fluorescence quenching; Graphene sheets; Industrial scale; Industrial use; Layer thickness; Planar sheets; Defects; Electric properties; Fluorescence; Graphene; Industrial applications; Industry; Optical properties; Quenching; Units of measurement; Measurements",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862563710

Drawing on recommendations published by the German Advisory Council on Global Change, levels of unacceptable global marine change (so-called guardrails) are defined in terms of global mean temperature, sea level rise, and ocean acidification. A global-mean climate model [the Aggregated Carbon Cycle, Atmospheric Chemistry and ClimateModel (ACC2)] is coupledwith an economicmodule [taken fromthe Dynamic Integrated Climate-EconomyModel (DICE)] to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to derive CO2 emission pathways that both minimize abatement costs and are compatible with these guardrails. Additionally, the ''tolerable windows approach'' is used to calculate a range of CO2 emissions paths that obey the guardrails as well as a restriction on mitigation rate. Prospects of meeting the global mean temperature change guardrail (2° and 0.2°C decade21 relative to preindustrial) depend strongly on assumed values for climate sensitivity: at climate sensitivities .38C the guardrail cannot be attained under any CO2 emissions reduction strategy without mitigation of non-CO2 greenhouse gases. The ocean acidification guardrail (0.2 unit pHdecline relative to preindustrial) is less restrictive than the absolute temperature guardrail at climate sensitivities >2.5°C but becomes more constraining at lower climate sensitivities. The sea level rise and rate of rise guardrails (1 m and 5 cm decade21) are substantially less stringent for ice sheet sensitivities derived in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report, but they may already be committed to violation if ice sheet sensitivities consistent with semiempirical sea level rise projections are assumed. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867739525

A theoretical analysis is performed in order to characterize the properties of an optimal emissions policy. The model is then applied in a numerical analysis of groundwater contamination by chloride from highway deicers, demonstrating the relevance of the theoretical results to practical management settings. This analytical approach can help determine which policy instruments are likely to be effective in controlling groundwater pollution, especially if costly numerical groundwater models are not available for the aquifer in question. Unlike previous economic studies of groundwater contamination, this approach defines optimal emissions policies as a function of geophysical parameters employed by hydrologists such as distance between source and sink, groundwater velocity, and aquifer dispersivity. The theoretical section of this paper also demonstrates that the relationship between geophysical parameters and optimal emissions levels may be ambiguous. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Analytical solutions; Groundwater protection; Socio-economic aspects; USA","analytical framework; aquifer; groundwater resource; hydrological modeling; mathematical analysis; socioeconomic impact; theoretical study; water management; water quality; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865434059

The main objective of this study is to illustrate spatio-temporal variation of SO2 emission pattern using computational fluid dynamic (CFD) tools of the area surrounding the Yatagan Power Plant (YPP) building in Mugla, Turkey. In order to simulate the atmospheric conditions, wind speed, wind direction and the emission of SO2 from 3 stacks of YPP including the simplified model of the power plant building, a commercial CFD, FLUENT is used. The results involve 75 km2 areas surrounding the YPP with a fine mesh resolution of 5 m × 5 m. SO2 emission shows that the CFD tool is able to simulate the emission with fine mesh digital elevation model (DEM). The DEM highly influences the local magnitude and direction of the wind in the domain which effects both spatial and temporal emission distribution of the SO2 gases. It is noted that the hills around the YPP cause the flue gas emissions to move away from the ground for 4 main wind directions when compared with the constant elevation model. © 2012 Tsinghua University Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","computational fluid dynamics; power plant; sulphur-dioxide",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864746314

Temperature projections indicate further warming, but models do not agree as to seasonal distribution of changes in precipitation. This article reviews evidence for climate change and its impacts in Poland, in the context of observations and projections. It also reviews various aspects of climate change mitigation policy in the country whose energy supply is more coal-dominated than any other country. This is one reason why climate change mitigation efforts are modest and climate policy largely passive. The dramatic decline of industrial production involving a rapid decline in CO2 emissions during 1989-1992 was the crucial element of the Poland's position in the negotiations of international agreements. The European Union (EU) accession in 2004 tied Poland to EU climate policy. This cautious approach is largely in harmony with public attitudes. Poles are aware of climate change, but it is not considered as a priority issue and public opinion is divided about the issues of mitigation. Adaptation to climate change impacts in Poland is driven by the fact that observed impacts are not very large and there is no persuasive attribution of these impacts to greenhouse gas emissions. Reactive adaptation to climate change is preferred over anticipatory adaptation. There are several 'special care' areas in Poland in terms of adaptation: the mountains; the coastal zone of the Baltic Sea; and the river valleys. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc..",,"Coal industry; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Social aspects; Adaptation to climate changes; Climate change mitigation; Energy supplies; Industrial production; Public attitudes; Public opinions; Seasonal distributions; Temperature projection; Climate change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863817401

The model reduction is achieved by approximating the transverse gradients using multiple concentration modes and the concepts of internal and external mass transfer coefficients, spatial averaging over the axial length and simplified chemistry by lumping the oxidants and the reductants. The reduced order model consists of seven ordinary differential equations and captures the essential features of a TWC providing estimates of the oxidant and reductant emissions, fractional oxidation state (FOS) and total oxygen storage capacity (TOSC). The model performance is tested and validated using data on actual vehicle emissions resulting in good agreement for both green and aged catalysts including cold-start performance. We also propose a simple catalyst aging model that can be used to update the oxygen storage capacity in real time so as to capture the change in the kinetic parameters with aging. Catalyst aging is accounted via the update of a single scalar parameter in the model. The computational efficiency and the ability of the model to predict FOS and TOSC make it a novel tool for real-time fueling control to minimize emissions and diagnostics of catalyst aging. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Catalysis; Catalyst deactivation; Chemical reactor; Model reduction; Real-time simulation; Three-way converter","Automotive applications; Axial length; Catalyst aging; Cold-start; External mass transfer coefficient; Low-dimensional models; Model performance; Model reduction; Oxidation state; Oxygen storage capacity; Real time; Real time simulations; Reduced order models; Reductants; Scalar parameters; Spatial averaging; Three way catalytic converter; Three-way converter; Total oxygen; Transient behavior; Vehicle emission; Catalysis; Catalyst deactivation; Chemical reactors; Fueling; Ordinary differential equations; Oxidants; Oxygen; Solid solutions; Catalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857429162

The mechanisms governing organic carbon sequestration in soil remain poorly understood, yet are integral to understanding soil-climate feedbacks. We evaluated the biochemistry of dissolved and solid organic carbon in potential source and sink horizons across a chronosequence of volcanic soils in Hawai'i. The soils are derived from similar basaltic parent material on gently sloping volcanic shield surfaces, support the same vegetation assemblage, and yet exhibit strong shifts in soil mineralogy and soil carbon content as a function of volcanic substrate age. Solid-state 13carbon nuclear magnetic resonance spectra indicate that the most persistent mineral-bound carbon is comprised of partially oxidized aromatic compounds with strong chemical resemblance to dissolved organic matter derived from plant litter. A molecular mixing model indicates that protein, lipid, carbohydrate, and char content decreased whereas oxidized lignin and carboxyl/carbonyl content increased with increasing short-range order mineral content. When solutions rich in dissolved organic matter were passed through Bw-horizon mineral cores, aromatic compounds were preferentially sorbed with the greatest retention occurring in horizons containing the greatest amount of short-range ordered minerals. These minerals are reactive metastable nanocrystals that are most common in volcanic soils, but exist in smaller amounts in nearly all major soil classes.

Pollen data show diversified mixed temperate forest in the northern borderlands and enhanced Mediterranean vegetation in the southern areas, documenting an N-S climatic trend. Terrestrial plant biomarkers and their diagnostic geochemical indices exhibit latitudinal patterns which are interpreted in terms of the different delivery pathways (fluvial/runoff vs. atmospheric transport), resulting from the climate conditions during different periods. During the Late Glacial and early deglaciation periods (20-14 ka BP) relatively increased humidity (H-index) is recorded in the north Aegean Sea, while in the South drier climate was the limiting factor for vegetation development. During this interval, terrestrial n-alkanes showed increased accumulation rates, suggesting massive transport of terrestrial organic matter through runoffs and rivers, followed by weaker input after 14 ka BP. After ~11 ka BP a major expansion of forest cover is evidenced in the NEMR, accompanied by a higher H-index because of the climatic amelioration. The forest vegetation exhibited regionally different characteristics, with cool temperate taxa being more abundant in the Aegean cores, while the SCM record is being featured by Mediterranean elements. At the onset of the Holocene and throughout the Holocene Climatic Optimum the delivery of terrestrial biomarkers increased and became more significant in the Aegean sites compared to the SCM site. Within the Holocene, the average chain length (ACL) of long chain n-alkanes exhibits lower values in the northern Aegean than in the southeastern Aegean and SCM, indicating the predominance of warmer species southwards. Finally, the H-index records a conspicuous humidity increase between 5.4 and 4.3 ka BP in the south Aegean that coincides with an increase in the terrestrial biomarker supply and the deposition of a distinct sapropel-like layer, SMH (Sapropel Mid Holocene). Similar trends in T (temperature) and H indices are slightly delayed and attenuated in the northern Aegean and are accompanied by an increase in the ACL index. A noticeable increase in the accumulation rates (ARs) of terrestrial biomarkers and the HPA index values during this period are clearly recorded in all three cores, indicative of enhanced terrigenous inputs of organic matter along with higher in-situ preservation. © 2011.",,"biomarker; climate conditions; deglaciation; environmental change; forest cover; Holocene; late glacial; organic matter; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; palynology; Postglacial; relative humidity; Aegean Sea; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860512576

Annual simulations with an air-quality model, where only the emission reductions due to insulation was accounted for, were compared for the scenarios, and statistically significant changes in ground-level mass concentration of main air pollutants were found. Emission reductions of up to 9% in particulate matter and 6.3% for sulphur dioxide were found in north-western Europe. Emission changes were negligible for volatile organic compounds, and carbon monoxide decreased by 0.6% over southern Europe while nitrogen oxides changed by up to 2.5% in the Baltic region. Seasonally and regionally averaged changes in ground-level mass concentrations showed that sulphur dioxide decreased by up to 6.2% and particulate matter by up to 3.6% in north-western Europe.

However, the actual greenhouse gas (GHG) impacts of organics diversion from landfills have yet to be thoroughly evaluated and whether such a diversion provides significant environmental benefits in terms of GHG impacts must be answered. This study, using California-specific information, aimed to analyse the GHG impacts of organics diversion through a life-cycle assessment (LCA). This LCA considered all aspects of organics management including transportation, materials handling, GHG emissions, landfill gas capture/utilization, energy impacts, and carbon sequestration. The LCA study evaluated overall GHG impacts of landfilling, and alternative management options such as composting and anaerobic digestion for diverted organic waste. The LCA analysis resulted in net GHG reductions of 0.093, 0.048, 0.065 and 0.073 tonnes carbon equivalent per tonne organic waste for landfilling, windrow composting, aerated static pile composting, and anaerobic digestion, respectively. This study confirms that all three options for organics management result in net reductions of GHG emissions, but it also shows that organics landfilling, when well-managed, generates greater GHG reductions. The LCA provides scientific insight with regards to the environmental impacts of organics management options, which should be considered in decision and policy-making. The study also highlights the importance of how site and case-specific conditions influence project outcomes when considering organic waste management options. © The Author(s) 2012.","anaerobic digestion; composting; greenhouse gas; landfill; Life cycle assessment; organic waste diversion","Aerated static pile; Alternative management; Carbon equivalent; Carbon sequestration; Climate change impact; Energy impact; Environmental benefits; GHG emission; Landfill gas; Landfilling; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle assessments; Management options; Organic wastes; Organics; Organics diversion; Policy making; Project outcomes; Using life; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Composting; Land fill; Life cycle; Piles; Project management; Waste management; Wastes; Greenhouse gases; carbon; carbon dioxide; fluorinated hydrocarbon; fluorocarbon; methane; nitrous oxide; sulfur hexafluoride; anoxic conditions; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; composting; decision making; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; landfill; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; waste management; anaerobic digestion; article; composting; energy yield; greenhouse gas; landfill; organic waste; priority journal; waste management; California; Environmental Remediation; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Theoretical; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864778857

The absorbing efficiency and direct radiative effect of BC strongly depend on its mass concentration (M BC) and type of emission source. In the present study, we report measurements of M BC at the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology (RCAST), located at the center of the urban boundary of Tokyo, using an EC-OC analyzer from 2003 to 2005 and a filter-based Continuous Soot Monitoring System (COSMOS) during 2007-2010. The results indicate that M BC have decreased significantly from 2.6 μg m -3 to 0.5 μg m -3 (∼80% reduction) between 2003 and 2010. Vehicular emissions are the dominant source of BC in Tokyo, and the observed reduction in M BC is mainly attributed to the stringent regulations of particulate matter exhaust from vehicles imposed by the Japanese government. In addition, this observation is also supported from emission estimates using diurnal-weekly variations of M BC in Tokyo and explains the observed reduction to within about 20%. This is the first clear evidence of a significant reduction in BC emissions in Tokyo and shows that measures taken to reduce BC emissions from traffic sources have a strong effect on air quality in a mega-city and also reduce the climate impact of traffic emissions. We highlight the importance of long-term and reliable measurements in detecting BC trends and for the validation and regulation of emission control measures in mega-cities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Black carbon; Diurnal variability; Mega-cities; Vehicular emission","Absorbing efficiency; Advanced science; Adverse health effects; Black carbon; Black carbon aerosol; Climate impacts; Cloud condensation nuclei; Diurnal variability; Emission sources; Filter-based; Mass concentration; Mega-cities; Monitoring system; Particulate Matter; Radiation budget; Radiative effects; Real-time observation; Reliable measurement; Research center; Stringent regulations; Traffic emissions; Traffic sources; Vehicular emission; Air quality; Emission control; Fog; Radiation effects; black carbon; aerosol composition; black carbon; climate effect; diurnal variation; emission control; health risk; megacity; particulate matter; public health; radiation exposure; real time; reduction; regulatory framework; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic emission; urban atmosphere; aerosol; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; analyzer; article; climate; controlled study; exhaust gas; Japan; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; priority journal; Honshu; Japan; Kanto; Tokyo [Kanto]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860635080

The development of transparent, reliable cost analyses that are accessible to all interested stakeholders has played a crucial role in establishing feasible and cost effective standards to improve fuel economy and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The FEV team, together with engineering staff from EPA's National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory, and FEV's subcontractor, Munro & Associates, developed a robust costing methodology based on tearing down, to the piece part level, relevant systems, sub-systems, and assemblies from vehicles ""with and without"" the technologies being evaluated. The parts found to be redesigned, added, or deleted to implement the new technologies were then examined by the team's manufacturing experts to assess their material composition and sequence of fabrication steps. Finally, using information from comprehensive costing databases for raw materials, labor rates, manufacturing overhead, and mark-up costs, each technology's direct manufacturing cost was determined. Where appropriate, these results were scaled to other vehicle sizes and to similar technologies, and sensitivity analyses of key inputs such as raw material costs were performed. Marketplace validation was conducted at all stages of the analysis by cross-checking with data developed by entities and processes external to the team. Costed technologies include: • mild and full parallel hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) • turbocharged, downsized gasoline direct-injection (GDI) engines • 6- and 8-speed automatic and dual-clutch transmissions (DCTs) • hydraulically-actuated variable valve timing and lift (VVT/L) • electrically-driven air conditioning compressor. In addition to this work already completed for EPA, additional case studies are underway looking at advanced high pressure diesel engine technologies, exhaust gas recirculation systems and micro hybrid technology configurations. These studies have been commissioned by the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) for the European light-duty vehicle market. This paper presents the methodology and results of the work done by FEV and Munro for EPA, along with a number of lessons learned by the team along the way. This approach to costing new technologies has proven to be very robust and of substantial value in recent standards-setting activities related to light-duty vehicle GHGs and fuel economy. Its success makes it likely that this approach will continue to find use in the future, not only in government standards setting activities, but also for private interests with a desire to provide, for all to see, an understanding of the cost of applying innovative technologies to products in the transportation sector.",,"Air conditioning; Air engines; Automobile manufacture; Commerce; Compensation (personnel); Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Cost engineering; Cost estimating; Costs; Diesel engines; Direct injection; Engines; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental technology; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fuel economy; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas fuel analysis; Greenhouse gases; Manufacture; Sensitivity analysis; Standards; Vehicle transmissions; Vehicles; Wages; Gas compressors; Air conditioning compressors; Dual clutch transmission; Exhaust gas recirculation systems; Gasoline direct injection engines; Manufacturing overheads; Material compositions; Parallel hybrid electric vehicles; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Gasoline direct injection; Variable valve timing; Hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863186207

Supraphysiologic concentrations of the hormone cholecystokinin (CCK; 100 nM), or its orthologue cerulein (CER), induce zymogen activation and elevate levels of cAMP in pancreatic acinar cells. The two classes of adenylyl cyclase, trans-membrane (tmAC) and soluble (sAC), are activated by distinct mechanisms, localize to specific subcellular domains, and can produce locally high concentrations of cAMP. We hypothesized that sAC activity might selectively modulate acinar cell zymogen activation. sAC was identified in acinar cells by PCR and immunoblot. It localized to the apical region of the cell under resting conditions and redistributed intracellularly after treatment with supraphysiologic concentrations of cerulein. In cerulein-treated cells, pre-incubation with a trans-membrane adenylyl cyclase inhibitor did not affect zymogen activation or amylase secretion. However, treatment with a sAC inhibitor (KH7), or inhibition of a downstream target of cAMP, protein kinase A (PKA), significantly enhanced secretagogue-stimulated zymogen activation and amylase secretion. Activation of sAC with bicarbonate significantly inhibited secretagogue-stimulated zymogen activation; this response was decreased by inhibition of sAC or PKA. Bicarbonate also enhanced secretagogue-stimulated cAMP accumulation; this effect was inhibited by KH7. Bicarbonate treatment reduced secretagogue-stimulated acinar cell vacuolization, an early marker of pancreatitis. These data suggest that activation of sAC in the pancreatic acinar cell has a protective effect and reduces the pathologic activation of proteases during pancreatitis. © 2012 Kolodecik et al.",,"adenylate cyclase; adenylate cyclase inhibitor; chymotrypsinogen; enzyme precursor; protein kinase C inhibitor; trypsinogen; acinar cell; acute pancreatitis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cell fractionation; cell vacuole; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme release; enzyme synthesis; immunoblotting; male; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; protein localization; rat; signal transduction; Acinar Cells; Adenylate Cyclase; Amylases; Animals; Bicarbonates; Biological Markers; Caerulein; Cell Membrane; Cholecystokinin; Cyclic AMP; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; Cytosol; Enzyme Activation; Enzyme Precursors; Male; Pancreas; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Protein Transport; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Solubility; Rattus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864264370

This is of particular concern since the recent recognition by International Agency for Research on Cancer that formaldehyde is carcinogenic to humans. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether residents of newly built Danish residential houses could be exposed to safe levels of formaldehyde. Geometric mean concentration of formaldehyde measured in 20 residential buildings was 0.04 mg m-3. Formaldehyde concentrations in two buildings (10%) exceeded the WHO guideline value. In order to explain the relatively high concentrations, a second phase was performed. The aim was to identify the significant formaldehyde sources and to discuss the source strength in relation to field measurements and WHO guidelines.

We have almost completed narrow-band imaging of our targets, and found that star forming activity is very high even in the proto-cluster cores (zâ‰1.5), and that the peak of star formation is shifted outwards with time, indicating the inside-out formation of clusters. Moreover, we have identified many red emitters especially in high density regions at z&gt;2, which suggests that the mode of star formation and/or the activation of AGN are dependent on environment, and thus holding the key to the environmental effects at the early stage of cluster galaxies formation and evolution. © 2013 International Astronomical Union.","galaxies: clusters; galaxies: evolution; galaxies: formation",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84880448112

Particularly striking are the associations between chemosynthetic bacteria and marine animals that thrive in nutrient-poor environments such as the deep sea because the symbionts allow their hosts to grow on inorganic energy and carbon sources such as sulfide and CO2. Remarkably little is known about the physiological strategies that enable chemosynthetic symbioses to colonize oligotrophic environments. In this study, we used metaproteomics and metabolomics to investigate the intricate network of metabolic interactions in the chemosynthetic association between Olavius algarvensis, a gutless marine worm, and its bacterial symbionts. We propose previously undescribed pathways for coping with energy and nutrient limitation, some of which may be widespread in both freeliving and symbiotic bacteria. These pathways include (i) a pathway for symbiont assimilation of the host waste products acetate, propionate, succinate and malate; (ii) the potential use of carbon monoxide as an energy source, a substrate previously not known to play a role in marine invertebrate symbioses; (iii) the potential use of hydrogen as an energy source; (iv) the strong expression of high-affinity uptake transporters; and (v) as yet undescribed energy- efficient steps in CO2 fixation and sulfate reduction. The high expression of proteins involved in pathways for energy and carbon uptake and conservation in the O. algarvensis symbiosis indicates that the oligotrophic nature of its environment exerted a strong selective pressure in shaping these associations.","3-Hydroxypropionate bi-cycle; Calvin cycle; Metagenomics; Proton-translocating pyrophosphatase; Pyrophosphate dependent phosphofructokinase","carbon monoxide; article; energy; energy conservation; energy resource; metabolomics; metaproteomics; microbial community; nonhuman; Olavius algarvensis; priority journal; proteomics; symbiont; symbiosis; worm; Animals; Bacteria; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Ecosystem; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Energy Metabolism; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Hydrogen; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metabolomics; Oligochaeta; Proteomics; Seawater; Symbiosis; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Invertebrata; Olavius algarvensis; Sipunculus nudus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860831021

However, a CO2 capture process prevents improving power generation efficiency of IGCC, because CO2 separation from gas mixtures requires huge amounts of energy. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the CO2 separation process in the pre-combustion capture process using a process simulator (PRO/II) in the steady state, and proposed a new process using a modularity based on self-heat recuperation (SHR) technology to decrease energy consumption. Pre-combustion capture was applied in the IGCC plant, which involved coal gasification and CO-shift conversion with CO 2 capture. The results show that the energy consumption for the CO2 separation process using SHR was decreased by two-thirds. This means that the power generation efficiency can be improved by SHR compared with conventional IGCC with a CO2 capture process. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Chemical absorption; Coal gasification; Self-heat recuperation","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal gasification; Coal gasification plants; Energy utilization; Gas generators; Precombustion; Pulverized fuel; Separation; Capture process; Chemical absorption; Integrated coal gasification combined cycles; Power generation efficiency; Process simulators; Pulverized coal combustion; Self-heat; Shift Conversion; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862205536

However, land-use-related reductions in sediment delivery rates to estuaries world-wide suggest that these above-ground feedbacks may not apply in some of the world's most vulnerable coastal landscapes. To understand the relationships between sea level rise and marsh survival, we measured root and shoot growth over experimentally manipulated elevations in a rapidly submerging, sediment deficient marsh. Root growth was highest at a distinct optimum elevation in both Schoenoplectus americanus and Spartina patens. S. americanus shoot growth was highest at an optimum elevation, but S. patens shoot growth increased with elevation throughout the intertidal zone. For marsh elevations that are higher than optimum (expected at low sea level rise rates), we propose that an acceleration in the rate of sea level rise will lead to enhanced root growth, organic accretion and wetland stability. For suboptimum marsh elevations (expected at rapid sea level rise rates and/or low sediment supply), increases in the water level will lead to reduced root growth and a decrease in the rate of elevation gain. More than 80% of the marshland in our study area has an elevation below the optimum for root growth, suggesting that this previously unknown feedback could explain observations of rapid marsh deterioration in the region. Synthesis. Below-ground responses of marshes to sea level rise are more broadly applicable than above-ground feedbacks because they are consistent among different species and do not depend on the availability of mineral sediment.

In the case of carbon monoxide oxidation, the rate increase was attributed to a heterogeneous reaction of ozone with carbon monoxide. Ozone injection is investigated along with the direct application of the plasma to the gas upstream of a Diesel oxidation catalyst on a Diesel engine test bench. When used on the Diesel engine exhaust in steady state conditions, depending on the engine regime, the two processes had different effects on the gas composition. Both processes induced heating of the catalyst: while the plasma treatment of the entire gas flux heated the gas itself, and therefore also heated the catalyst, the injection of ozone heated the catalyst solely through the heat of reaction of ozone with the adsorbed species. Mechanisms for these effects are proposed and the performance of each approach is discussed in terms of energy cost and technical feasibility. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon monoxide; Diesel oxidation catalysis; Non-thermal plasma; Ozone; Unburned hydrocarbons","Adsorbed species; Atmospheric pressure dielectric barrier discharges; Carbon monoxide oxidation; Diesel engine test; Diesel oxidation; Diesel oxidation catalyst; Different effects; Energy cost; Gas compositions; Gas flux; Heat of reaction; Heterogeneous catalytic oxidation; Heterogeneous reactions; Induced heating; Nonthermal plasma; Oxidation rates; Plasma treatment; Rate increase; Steady-state condition; Technical feasibility; Unburned hydrocarbons; Atmospheric pressure; Carbon monoxide; Catalysis; Catalysts; Diesel engines; Direct injection; Exhaust systems (engine); Hydrocarbons; Oxidation; Ozone; Plasma applications; Catalytic oxidation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858976554

The second issue is to investigate the possibility of a convergence club where the cross-sectional dispersion of house prices of the club members decreases over time. We utilize a clustering algorithm and the results support that there is strong evidence of multiple convergence clubs.

Herein, we report a NiFe dendritic nanostructure obtained by a simple electrodeposition without template. The control of concentration, potential, and pH plays an important role in the formation of the dendritic nanostructures. The longer and thinner NiFe dendritic nanostructure was obtained by changing the potential from -1.1 to -1.3 V vs. Ag/AgCl and a highly ordered nanostructure was obtained at the low pH of 2. NiFe dendritic material obtained at a potential of -1.3 V in pH 2.00 at 0.025 M NiSO 4 and 0.025 M FeSO 4 has a three-dimensional nanostructure. The growth mechanism of the NiFe dendritic nanostructure was investigated by SEM and the ED pattern of TEM. EDS, XRD, and XPS were used to investigate elemental composition, crystalline structure, and the chemical state of the as-obtained NiFe dendritic material. The efficiency of water-oxidation catalysts is critically influenced by the surface conditions and controlling the surface state is a major factor in developing an artificial photosynthetic system which stores the sunlight energy by water-splitting and carbon dioxide reduction in aqueous solution.

To date, they have been considered to play a minor role in controlling the Calvin cycle in marine diatoms, aquatic primary producers, although diatoms possess a set of plastidic Trxs. In this study we examined the influences of the redox state and the involvement of Trxs in the enzymatic activities of pyrenoidal carbonic anhydrases, PtCA1 and PtCA2, in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. The recombinant mature PtCA1 and -2 (mPtCA1 and -2) were completely inactivated following oxidation by 50 μM CuCl2, whereas DTT activated CAs in a concentration- dependent manner. The maximum activity of mPtCAs in the presence of 6mM reduced DTT increased significantly by addition of 10 μM Trxs from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtTrx-f2 and -m2) and 5 μM Trxs from P. tricornutum (PtTrxF and -M). Analyses of mPtCA activation by Trxs in the presence of DTT revealed that the maximum mPtCA1 activity was enhanced ∼3-fold in the presence of Trx, whereas mPtCA2 was only weakly activated by Trxs, and that PtTrxs activate PtCAs more efficiently compared with AtTrxs. Site-directed mutagenesis of potential disulfide-forming cysteines in mPtCA1 and mPtCA2 resulted in a lack of oxidative inactivation of both mPtCAs. These results reveal the first direct evidence of a target of plastidic Trxs in diatoms, indicating that Trxs may participate in the redox control of inorganic carbon flow in the pyrenoid, a focal point of the CO2-concentrating mechanism. © 2012 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Arabidopsis thaliana; Calvin cycle; Enzymatic activities; Focal points; Inorganic carbon; Marine diatoms; Oxidative inactivation; Phaeodactylum tricornutum; Photosynthetic fixation; Plant chloroplasts; Primary producers; Redox regulation; Redox state; Site directed mutagenesis; Thioredoxins; Amino acids; Carbonic anhydrase; Chlorophyll; Copper compounds; Phytoplankton; Plants (botany); Carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; thioredoxin; Arabidopsis; article; chloroplast; controlled study; diatom; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oxidation; oxidation reduction state; Phaedactylum tricornutum; priority journal; protein function; protein interaction; regulatory mechanism; site directed mutagenesis; Arabidopsis; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonic Anhydrases; Chloroplast Proteins; Chloroplasts; Diatoms; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Oxidation-Reduction; Recombinant Proteins; Thioredoxins; Arabidopsis thaliana; Bacillariophyta; Nitzschia alba; Phaeodactylum tricornutum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862004149

Solvent emission mechanisms from metal cleaning processes were analysed to support process improvement aimed at emission reductions. Methods: The amounts of solvents directly emitted from a washing machine and solvents taken out by metal parts to be cleaned were measured in laboratory experiments using an industrial washing machine. Direct emissions to a local ventilation system and to the workplace were analysed, while several process conditions were changed. The drying rate of solvents on surfaces was analysed for seven metal parts to clarify the effects of their materials and shape. Results: The results for direct solvent emissions show that solvents emitted because of the movement of metal parts inside a washing machine can be mainly exhausted through a local ventilation system, while the operation of an ultrasonic device can increase solvent diffusion to the workplace. Lowering the cooling water temperature can be effective in avoiding such solvent diffusion to the workplace. The results also show that the heat capacity and shape complexity of metal parts can affect the drying rate of solvents on their surfaces. Conclusions: Analysis of the results shows the effectiveness of using a local ventilation system and cooling pipes in controlling solvent emissions for several work tasks. The minimum time required to dry all solvents on the surface of metal parts was also estimated. Analyses of the emission mechanisms in this study clarified the major factors in solvent emissions and the effectiveness of process modifications for emission reductions. The findings are applicable to practical process improvement aimed at emission reductions in cleaning sites. © 2012 The Author.","dichloromethane; emission analysis; metal cleaning; trichloroethylene; volatile organic compounds","Chlorinated organic solvents; Cleaning process; Cooling pipes; Cooling water temperature; Direct emissions; Direct solvents; Drying rates; Emission analysis; Emission mechanism; Emission reduction; Industrial cleaning; Laboratory experiments; Major factors; Metal parts; Minimum time; Monitoring and analysis; Practical process; Process condition; Process Improvement; Process modifications; Shape complexity; Solvent diffusion; Solvent emission; Ventilation systems; Work task; Cleaning; Dichloromethane; Emission control; Metal analysis; Metal cleaning; Metals; Organic solvents; Solvents; Surfaces; Trichloroethylene; Ultrasonic devices; Ventilation; Volatile organic compounds; Washers; Washing machines; Factor analysis; metal; solvent; air conditioning; article; environmental monitoring; human; indoor air pollution; Japan; laundry; occupational exposure; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Japan; Laundering; Metals; Occupational Exposure; Solvents; Ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865045118

The issues related to direct lifecycle and indirect land use change emissions have been addressed. It is found that there are commonalities between the European Renewable Energy Directive (EU-RED) and the UK's Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation (UK-RTFO), but the US-EPA's Renewable Fuel Standard (US-EPA) and the Low Carbon Fuel Standard of the California Air Resources Board (CA-CARB) vary greatly not only among themselves, but also in relation to the European regulations. Agricultural practices (especially soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics), co-product credits from surplus electricity and uncertainties around economic modeling approaches for indirect land use change are the major areas where methodological divergences exist. Incorporation of domestic agricultural practices, sugarcane mills operations, and realistic modeling of indirect impacts of land use change using regional models could provide more coherence in estimations of GHG emissions.

This paper reports the emission benefits for two mitigation strategies, cleaner engines and cleaner fuels, for a 2010 container vessel. In-use emissions were measured following International Organization for Standardization (ISO) protocols. The overall in-use nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission factor was 16.1 ± 0.1 gkW-1 h-1, lower than the Tier 1 certification (17 gkW-1 h -1) and significantly lower than the benchmark value of 18.7 gkW -1 h-1 commonly used for estimating emission inventories. The in-use particulate matter (PM2.5) emission was 1.42 ± 0.04 gkW-1 h-1 for heavy fuel oil (HFO) containing 2.51 wt % sulfur. Unimodal (∼30 nm) and bimodal (∼35 nm; ∼75 nm) particle number size distributions (NSDs) were observed when the vessel operated on marine gas oil (MGO) and HFO, respectively. First-time emission measurements during fuel switching (required 24 nautical miles from coastline) showed that concentrations of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and particle NSD took ∼55 min to reach steady-state when switching from MGO to HFO and ∼84 min in the opposite direction. Therefore, if OGVs commence fuel change at the regulated boundary, then vessels can travel up to 90% of the distance to the port before steady-state values are re-established. The transient behavior follows a classic, nonlinear mixing function driven by the amount of fuel in day tank and the fuel consumption rate. Hence, to achieve the maximum benefits from a fuel change regulation, fuel switch boundary should be further increased to provide the intended benefits for the people living near the ports. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Container vessel; Emission factors; Emission inventories; Emission measurement; Fuel consumption rates; Fuel switching; Health concerns; International organization for standardizations; MgO; Mitigation strategy; Nonlinear mixing; Particle number size distribution; Particulate Matter; Port communities; Steady-state values; Transient behavior; Unimodal; Fuels; Gas oils; International cooperation; Marine engines; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Fuel tanks; fuel oil; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; coastal zone; emission inventory; engine; fuel consumption; health risk; international organization; Kyoto Protocol; nitrogen oxides; nonlinearity; port; public health; size distribution; standardization; steady-state equilibrium; sulfur dioxide; air pollution control; article; certification; diesel engine; field emission; gas; particle size; particulate matter; standardization; tank; vessel; Air Pollution; Algorithms; Fuel Oils; Particle Size; Ships; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860425580

According to reports, 84% of the total CO2 emissions in the world are related to energy consumption. Also, 64% of green house gases emissions in the world are CO2 emissions. On the basis of the IEA scenarios (2009), the growth of CO2 emissions related to energy consumption will continue as a result of growing demand for fossil fuels by 2030. The CO2 emissions related to energy consumption increased from 20.9 G.T, in 1990 to 28.8 G.T, in 2007. The forecasts of IEA in 2009 show that the CO2 emissions related to energy consumption will increase to 34.5 G.T, and 40.2 G.T, by 2020 and 2030, respectively. Its implications are that CO2 emissions related to energy consumption will increase on average by 1.5% in the period of 2000-2030, while the other green house gases will increase on average by 0.3%. The Iranian resource-based structure of the economy and the energy-based production system has caused the consumption of fossil fuels and non-fossil fuels to increase. Although the interrelation between energy consumption and green house gases, especially CO2, shows the green house gas emissions will be high in the future. The statistics show that CO2 emissions per capita in Iran have increased from 3.6 T in 1990 to 6.9 T in 2008, while the CO2 emissions per capita decreased in the United States and Europe. Predictions show that the CO2 related to energy consumption will be an important challenge for the economic future in many countries including Iran. Considering the importance of this challenge, several countries have considered decreasing the CO2 emissions by the definition of policy tools. To achieve this goal, knowing the structure of CO2 emissions related to energy consumption is required. In the present research, the structure of CO2 emissions related to energy consumption at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels is considered. Materials and Methods: The theoretical evidence shows that there is a relationship between energy consumption, CO2 emissions and economic growth. The structure of these relations depends on the economic structure and economic development stages of the countries in question. The empirical evidence has not been considered as demonstrating the structure of the relationship between energy consumption, CO2 emissions and economic growth. Review of the economic literature verifies the relationship between energy consumption, CO2 emissions and economic growth. However, this relationship has been affected by other factors such as population, composition of fuels consumed, and the carbon contents of the fuels being consumed. It is noteworthy that most studies have not paid attention to these factors. Considering the importance of this subject for gaining knowledge about the CO2 emissions structure and the importance of using policy tools, in this paper CO2 emissions structure using the Index Decomposition approach was studied. In recent years, decomposition analysis has been used as an efficient tool for the study of CO2 emissions changes related to energy consumption. Generally, there are two approaches for decomposition analysis: Index Decomposition Analysis (DIA), an approach in which aggregated data at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels are used; and Structural Decomposition Analysis (SDA), which uses Input-Output tables. There are different techniques such as the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LIMDI), Arithmetic Mean Divisia Index (AMDI), and Laspear's Index (LI) for index decomposition analysis. Among these methods, the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index has important characteristics such as time independence, computation flexibilities, consistency in aggregation, and possibility of negative and zero computation. In this paper, the CO2 emissions related to energy consumption in five factors are decomposed, using the Kaya (1990) approach as follows: Et = Ct×St×It×Gt×Pt Where, E: CO2 emission related to energy consumption, C: carbon intensity in fossil fuels, S: share of fossil fuels in energy consumption, I: energy intensiveness of the economy, G: GDP per capita, P: total population. Using LMDI, changes in CO2 emissions (ΔE) for the period of t-1 and t, will be as follows: ΔE(t,t -1) =ceff + seff + Ieff + Geff + Peff Where: Ceff: changes in C (coefficient effect), Seff: changes in S (substitution effect), Ieff: changes in I (intensity effect), Geff: changes in GDP per capita, and Peff: changes in population. These effects have been computed by LMDI as follows: Ceff=L[E(t),E(t-1)] × ln[c(t)/c(t-1)] Seff =L[E(t),E(t-1)] × ln[s(t)/(s(t-1)] Ieff = L[E(t),E(t-1)] × ln[I(t)/I(t-1)] Geff = L[E(t),E(t-1)J × ln[G(t)/G(t-1)] Peff = L[E(t),E(t-1)] × ln[(P(t)/P(t-1)] In the above equations, L(x,y) = (x-y)/ln(x/y) was used for computing (estimating) L[E(t),E(t-1)]. The CO2 emissions related to energy consumption at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels - including industry, agriculture and services - for the period of 1346-1387 was analyzed. The data were extracted from the International Institute for Energy Studies (IIES) and the Power and Energy Planning Department of the Ministry of Energy. In addition, the GDP and population data were derived from the Central Bank of Iran. Results and Discussion: The results of decomposition analysis show that the CO2 emissions related to energy consumption at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels increased in the period of 1967-2008 (1346-1387). Changes in GDP per capita have had a determinant effect on CO2 emissions related to energy consumption. As a result, the achievement of economic growth goals will be accompanied by increasing CO2 emissions related to energy consumption. The changes in population have had a positive effect and have led to an increase in CO2 emissions for all the periods under study. As a result, the changes in CO2 emissions are in line with the population changes. Therefore, policies for controlling population will have a positive effect on decreasing in CO2 emissions related to energy consumption. The share of fossil fuels in energy consumption has increased over the period 1967-1986. These changes have led to an increase in CO2 emissions related to energy consumption. The share of fossil fuels had a negative effect on CO2 emissions for 1987-2001 but, at the beginning of the 2000s, this share has increased and has caused an increase in CO2 emissions. These results show that, unlike world experiences and the global shift to the use of non-fossil fuels, the share of fossil fuels in Iranian energy consumption has increased. Therefore, paying attention to alternative energy sources is necessary, to decrease CO2 emissions in Iran. The energy intensity of the Iranian economy has increased over a long period and this has resulted in an increase in CO2 emissions related to energy consumption. This result shows that unlike world experiences, the energy consumption in the Iranian economy is very high. Therefore, economic policies for reducing energy consumption are necessary in order to achieve the goal of lowering CO2 emissions. The contribution of agricultural sector to GDP has played a decreasing role in generating CO2 emissions. This result is in conflict with the experience of industry and services experiences. The carbon contents of the fossil fuels used in the agricultural sector has increased, unlike that of fuels used in the industry sector. These results show that on one hand agricultural growth has changed in line with CO2 emissions, while on the other hand carbon contents of fossil fuels used in the agricultural sector caused an increase in CO2 emissions. Hence, attention must be paid to the composition of fossil fuels and the share of fossil fuels in energy consumption in order to lower CO2 emissions.","Co2 emissions; Energy consumption; Fossil fuels; Index Decomposition Analysis","Torreya nucifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921711386

As a side effect, the primary NO 2/NO x emission ratio by these vehicles increased from 10% in 2000 (before the introduction of the oxidation catalyst) to between 55% and 70% in 2010. The impact of this evolution in traffic emissions was studied from both a health and a regulatory perspective. Primary NO 2 emissions from road traffic in the Netherlands is expected to increase from 8 kt in 2000 to 15 kt by 2015 and subsequently to decrease to 9 kt by 2020. Meanwhile, exhaust PM emissions from road traffic in the Netherlands will decrease from 7 kt in 2000 to 3 kt by 2020. The impact of exhaust PM on air quality and health was assessed according to the mass concentrations of elemental carbon (EC) in ambient air, as EC is a more sensitive indicator than PM. Monitoring data on the NO 2/EC concentration ratios near road traffic between 2000 and 2010 indicate no significant change in ambient air quality. This indicates that health effects in epidemiological studies associated with long-term exposure to NO 2 concentrations are still valid. The health impact from the introduction of the oxidation catalyst was assessed by comparing the relatively higher NO 2 ("" cost"" ) and lower EC ("" benefit"" ) concentrations at street locations. ""Relative"" refers to traffic emissions in situations ""with"" and ""without"" the oxidation catalyst being introduced. The cost-benefit ratio in 2010 was in balance, but benefits are expected to outweigh costs by 2015 and 2020.

In the past, several studies have aimed to analyse the costs and the technical feasibility of CO2 emissions reduction in the domestic stock. This paper addresses the issue of abatement costs and potentials in the housing stock from a systems perspective in order to capture interactions and interdependencies with the wider energy system. Marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves for the UK residential sector are derived based on the energy systems model UK MARKAL in combination with decomposition analysis. The results indicate that it is cost-effective to implement conservation measures, as well as increase the share of district heat and biomass for space and water heating. The decarbonisation of electricity and heat dominates the lower part of the residential sector MAC curve up to £50/t CO2. The MAC curve is found to be robust to fossil fuel prices, while more expensive electricity and limited availability of biomass significantly reduce the abatement potential.

The success of large-scale tree planting initiatives for climate protection depends on projects being net sinks for CO2 over their entire life cycle. However, previous assessments of urban tree planting initiatives have not accounted for the inputs required for tree production in nurseries, which include greenhouse systems, irrigation, and fertilization. A GHG inventory of nursery operations for tree production is a necessary step to assess the life cycle benefits or drawbacks of large-scale tree planting activities. Methods Using surveys, interviews, and life cycle inventory databases, we developed a process-based life cycle inventory of GHG emissions for a large nursery operation in California, USA. Results and discussion The inventory demonstrated that 4.6 kg of CO2-equivalent is emitted per #5 (nominally a 5- gallon) tree, a common tree size produced by nurseries. Energy use contributed 44% of all CO2-equivalent emissions, of which electricity and propane constituted 78%. Electricity use is dominated by irrigation demands, and propane is used primarily for greenhouse heating. Material inputs constituted the next largest contributor at 36% of emissions; plastic containers contributed just over half of these emissions. Transport emissions accounted for 16% of total nursery GHG emissions. Shipping bamboo stakes from China (43%) and diesel fuel consumed by nursery delivery trucks (33%) were the largest transport emission sources. Conclusions GHG emissions from the tree production life stage are 20% to 50% of mean annual CO2 storage rates based on urban tree inventories for three California cities. While considering nursery production alone is insufficient for drawing conclusions about the net climate change benefits of tree planting initiatives, the results demonstrate that nursery production emissions are modest compared with CO2 storage rates during tree life. Identifying key sources of emissions in the nursery tree production system can help operators reduce emissions by targeting so-called hot-spots. In particular, switching to renewable energy sources, capitalizing on energy and water efficiency opportunities, container light-weighting, and sourcing bamboo stakes from producers closer to the point of use are potential avenues for reduced emissions. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","Carbon footprint; Climate change; Nursery; Tree planting; Tree production; Urban forestry","carbon dioxide; propane; article; carbon footprint; climate change; crop production; energy consumption; environmental impact assessment; environmental management; fertilizer application; forestry; global climate; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; irrigation (agriculture); life cycle assessment; pollution transport; priority journal; risk benefit analysis; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863091705

However such a broad topic inevitably results in number of alternative interpretations of the problem domain and the modelling tools used in its study. This paper seeks to pull together these strands by proposing a theoretical definition of an urban energy system model and then evaluating the state of current practice. Drawing on a review of 219 papers, five key areas of practice were identified - technology design, building design, urban climate, systems design, and policy assessment - each with distinct and incomplete interpretations of the problem domain. We also highlight a sixth field, land use and transportation modelling, which has direct relevance to the use of energy in cities but has been somewhat overlooked by the literature to date. Despite their diversity, these approaches to urban energy system modelling share four common challenges in understanding model complexity, data quality and uncertainty, model integration, and policy relevance. We then examine the opportunities for improving current practice in urban energy systems modelling, focusing on the potential of sensitivity analysis and cloud computing, data collection and integration techniques, and the use of activity-based modelling as an integrating framework. The results indicate that there is significant potential for urban energy systems modelling to move beyond single disciplinary approaches towards a sophisticated integrated perspective that more fully captures the theoretical intricacy of urban energy systems. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

CHP (combined heat and power) systems offer significant primary energy-efficiency gains and emissions reductions, but they can have high upfront investment costs and create nuisance pollution within the urban environment. Urban planners therefore need to understand the tradeoffs between limitations on CHP plant size and the performance of the overall energy system. This paper uses a mixed-integer linear programming model to evaluate urban energy system designs for a range of city sizes and technology scenarios. The results suggest that the most cost-effective and energy-efficient scenarios require a mix of technology scales including CHP plants of appropriate size for the total urban demand. For the cities studied here (less than 200,000 people), planning restrictions that prevent the use of CHP technologies could lead to total system cost penalties of 2% (but with significantly different cost structures) and energy-efficiency penalties of up to 24% when measured against a boiler-only business-as-usual case. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Combined heat and power; Optimization; Urban energy systems","Air pollution control; Computer programming; Costs; Energy utilization; Investments; Optimization; Power generation; Business-as-usual; CHP plant; CHP technology; Combined heat and power; Cost structure; Emissions reduction; Energy efficient; Energy systems; Heat and power; Investment costs; Mixed integer linear programming; Primary energy consumption; System costs; Technology scenarios; Urban energy; Urban environments; Urban planners; Energy efficiency; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; energy conservation; energy efficiency; linearity; numerical model; urban area; urban pollution; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859988938

Model development is a condo cropping and livestock farming in vertical integration to reduce the horizontal land by application of engineered systems. The type of crop and animal farming must be completed by the fully of the five food groups. The model was implemented with animal farming of vertical integration by to build chicken coops on Tilapia and catfish ponds to be used like chicken manure and vegetable waste is food of Tilapia fishes and Catfishes. Fish types are durable and can coexist in a natural separation. The plants were grown as Kale, Rice, Chinese cabbages, Lettuce, Morning glory, Soybeans, Green beans, Peanuts. This model was management control of environmental problems to a minimum. The engineering systems were using wind power, which was free of charge, renewable electricity and oil. The vertical wind turbine and machinery was pumped water that it was done from garbage such as plastic bin and fagot. As well as anaerobic wastewater treatment from the fish pond to fill it back into the pond for reducing the cost of water. And wastewater would be used instead of chemical fertilizer for growing vegetables.

The results reveal the potential for cumulative final energy savings of 27.1 to 37.5 exajoules and energy-related direct emission reductions of 3.2 to 4.4 gigatonnes in 2011-2030 under the best practice scenarios. The continuous improvement scenarios produce cumulative final energy savings of 6.0 to 18.9 exajoules and reduce CO 2 emissions by 1.0 to 2.4 gigatonnes. This analysis highlights that increasing energy efficiency is the most important policy measure for reducing the cement industry's energy and emissions intensity, given the current state of the industry and the unlikelihood of significant carbon capture and storage before 2030. In addition, policies to reduce total cement production offer the most direct way of reducing total energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Cement industry; Emissions reduction; Energy efficiency","Carbon capture and storage; Carbon reduction; Cement production; Continuous improvements; Current energy; Direct emissions; Efficiency improvement; Emission reduction; Emission trends; Emissions intensity; Emissions reduction; Historical production; Policy measures; Total energy consumption; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cements; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Iron and steel plants; Lubrication; Management; Cement industry; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cement; emission control; energy conservation; energy efficiency; manufacturing; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859755277

Both this generation and future generations are left vulnerable to droughts that could have serious global consequences. Droughts are already an integral part of global climate variability, but their impact can be mitigated significantly by proactive risk management planning and preparedness emphasizing increase in water supplies with appropriate reduction in demands, strengthening regulatory framework, education, emergency responses and community rehabilitation services. Sustainable mitigation initiatives are needed to protect life and manage risks and damages to property, agriculture, industries, ecological biodiversity and natural resources. Forensic applications can help in many ways, for example, to understand interaction between components of hydrologic cycle, to determine their origin and history, in land use classification, to locate recharge areas, and in the management of water quality, as well as to determine the time of release, to identify the sources of pollution and dominant ongoing biochemical reactions, to resolve disputes, and to synthesize missing historic data that are so critical in the planning for worst droughts. Weather forecasting capabilities can reduce uncertainties and help in drought preparedness and mitigation strategies. This article reviews global weather pattern and interactions as well as coupled ocean-land-atmosphere phenomenon (El Niño Southern Oscillation and/or La Niña [ENSO] ENSO) causing interannual global climate variability, drought preparedness planning and policies, and mitigation strategies to conserve water, enhance water use efficiencies, to promote sustainable socioeconomic development, and to preserve values of natural resources. Potential applications of classic and emerging forensic fingerprinting techniques and materials to enhance and harness diverse sources of water and address growing water needs now and in the future are also discussed. Finally, an innovative sustainable drought management strategy is proposed. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","drought management planning; drought mitigation; drought preparedness; El Niño; environmental and ecological diversity; environmental forensics; fingerprinting applications; innovative drought management strategy; La Niña; sustainable development; water conservation","Harness",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862272058

Of the about 280 hectares of greenhouses in Azerbaijan, about 20% are antiquated Soviet style greenhouses, many of which are currently being updated and repaired by their owners. New structures of Israeli, Dutch, Turkish and Italian companies have been built or are in the planning stages of construction. Finally, about 30% are home built polyethylene covered greenhouses with mixed wooden and steel frame materials, while low tunnels also exist. The majority of greenhouse cultivation systems in Azerbaijan, regardless of geographic location, consist of fundamental climate control components, and depending on their design and complexity, they can provide a greater or lesser amount of climate control, and subsequent plant growth and productivity. The climograph of Baku shows that greenhouses in Baku, if year round cultivation is needed, will have to be equipped at least with heating and ventilation systems while cooling systems during summer period would be also preferable. The main constraints for greenhouse cultivations in Azerbaijan are heating and cooling since it is considered that climate conditions inside the rudimentarily equipped greenhouses do not meet crop needs for optimal growing. No absolute solutions are available since variations in design and past maintenance may exist. Energy conservation is also necessary since the above greenhouses are not equipped at all with energy saving systems. In this paper, an effort to suggest the appropriate design of greenhouses and their equipment suitable for the region is made, and guidelines on the step up of the supply chain management for the sustainable development of the greenhouse sector in Azerbaijan are given.","Energy saving; Rudimentarily equipped greenhouses; Supply chain","Cannabis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863638544

CA, comprising minimum mechanical soil disturbance and no-tillage seeding, organic mulch cover, and crop diversification is now practised on some 125 million ha, corresponding to about 9% of the global arable cropped land. The area under CA is spread across all continents and many agro-ecologies, including the dry Mediterranean climate. Empirical and scientific evidence is presented to show that significant productivity, economic, social and environmental benefits exist that can be harnessed through the adoption of CA in the dry Mediterranean climates, including those in the CWANA region. The benefits include: higher productivity and income; climate change adaptation and reduced vulnerability to the erratic rainfall distribution; and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

They present complexities in their biophysical details, their scope and scale, and the dynamic character of human action and natural systems. Addressing environmental issues often invokes tensions among battling interests and competing priorities. Air and water pollution, the effects of climate change, ecosystem transformations-these and other environmental issues involve scientific, social, economic, and institutional challenges. This book analyzes why tackling many of these problems is so difficult and why sustainability involves more than adoption of greener, cleaner technologies. Sustainability, as discussed in this book, involves knowledge flows and collaborative decision processes that integrate scientific and technological methods and tools, political and governance structures and regimes, and social and community values. The authors synthesize a holistic and adaptive approach to rethinking the framework for restoring healthy ecosystems that are the foundation for thriving communities and dynamic economies. This approach is that of collective action. Through their research and practical experiences, the authors have learned that much wisdom resides among diverse people in diverse communities. New collaborative decision-making institutions must reflect that diversity and tap into its wisdom while also strengthening linkages among scientists and decision makers. From the pre-publication reviews: ""Finally, we have a book that explains how science is irrelevant without people. It's people who decide when and how to use science, not scientists. This book gives us a roadmap for how to really solve complex problems.

Mosquito generation and development is known to be influenced by the climate. This study was carried out to examine whether the climatic factors data can be used to predict yearly dengue cases of Dhaka city, Bangladesh. Methods: Monthly reported dengue cases and climate data for the years 2000-2008 were obtained from the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) and Meteorological Department of Dhaka, Bangladesh, respectively. Data for the period 2000 to 2007 were used for development of a model through multiple linear regressions. Retrospective validation of the model was done with 2001, 2003, 2005 and 2008 data. Log transformation of the dependent variable was done to normalize data for linear regression. Average monthly humidity, rainfall, minimum and maximum temperature were used as independent variables and number of dengue cases reported monthly was used as dependent variable. Accuracy of the model for predicting outbreak was assessed through receiver operative characteristics (ROC) curve. Results: Climatic factors, i.e. rainfall, maximum temperature and relative humidity were significantly correlated with monthly reported dengue cases. The model incorporating climatic data of two-lag month explained 61 per cent of variation in number of reported dengue cases and this model was found to predict dengue outbreak (≥ 200 cases) with considerable accuracy [area under ROC curve = 0.89, 95%CI = (0.89-0.98)]. Interpretation & conclusions: Our results showed that the climate had a major effect on the occurrence of dengue infection in Dhaka city. Though the prediction model had some limitations in predicting the monthly number of dengue cases, it could forecast possible outbreak two months in advance with considerable accuracy.","Climate; Dengue; Humidity; Outbreak; Prediction model; Rainfall; Temperature","rain; article; Bangladesh; climate; dengue; dependent variable; disease surveillance; epidemic; human; humidity; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; mosquito; predictive validity; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; season; temperature; Cities; Climate; Dengue; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; India; Linear Models; Models, Biological; Predictive Value of Tests; ROC Curve; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865469880

The farms in this study were purposively sampled based on good farm management and record keeping systems. The data that formed this study was collected over a period of three months (one month on each farm). The digestibility (DE) values in feed for farms in Lusaka, Chongwe and Choma districts were 48.7%, 55.1% and 50.3% for growing pigs, while those for adults pigs were 63.6%, 69.1% and 66.0%. The gross energy (GE) values in feed for these farms were 22.68MJ/day, 23.23MJ/day and 16.92MJ/day in growing pigs, while that for adult pigs were 37.8MJ/day, 38.72MJ/day and 28.2MJ/day, respectively. The Ash content values in both feed and manure for growing and adult pigs for these farms were 8.14%, 9.37% and 9.64%.

These results seem to suggest that feeds with low digestibility, low ash content and high energy contents excrete high amounts of volatile solids which is a function of methane (CH4) emissions from pig manure. One approach for reducing CH4 emissions from pig manure can be by increasing the digestibility of feed by modifying feed using feed additives or supplements. This would result in larger portion of energy in the pig feed being directed towards creation of useful products (pork), rather than CH4 emissions from manure.","Feed composition; Greenhouse gas; Methane; Pig manure","Animalia; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863871406

In many cases, the IR emission of dust is an important tool to trace star-forming activities in galaxies. However it is much more than just star-formation tracers. AKARI has revealed the detailed properties of dust grains in regions not relevant to star formation as well, some of which are found not to follow our old empirical knowledge. Because of its unique capabilities, such as near-and far-IR spectroscopy, and all-sky coverage, AKARI has provided new knowledge on the processing of carbonaceous grains including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We present the latest results obtained from our AKARI observations of the ISM in our Galaxy and nearby galaxies. © 2013 International Astronomical Union.","dust; extinction; galaxies: ISM; Galaxy: center",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876512803

Enterprise mix diversification is the most common, and is widely regarded as the most effective, strategy for mitigating multiple sources of short-term economic risk to agricultural enterprises. However, assessments of enterprise mix diversification as a strategy for mitigating climate risks to ensure long term viability of agricultural enterprises are sparse. Using the Lower Murray region in southern Australia as a case study, we combined APSIM modelling with Monte Carlo simulation, probability theory, and finance techniques, to assess the extent to which enterprise mix diversification can mitigate climate-induced variability in long term net returns from rain-fed agriculture. We found that diversification can reduce the standard deviation by up to A$200ha -1, or 52% of mean net returns; increase the probability of breaking even by up to 20%, and increase the mean of 10% of worst probable annual net returns (Conditional Value at Risk) by up to A$100ha -1. We conclude that enterprise mix diversification can also be an effective strategy for hedging against climate-induced economic risk for agriculturalists in marginal areas. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","Adaptation; Agricultural enterprise; Climate variability; Economic net returns; Finance; Monte Carlo; Yield uncertainty","adaptation; climate change; climate variation; ecological economics; economic analysis; economic impact; food security; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; rainfed agriculture; risk factor; uncertainty analysis; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862227058

Their effectiveness with respect to protecting existing biodiversity has been less investigated. Biodiversity and landscape protection effects can be expected in marginal agricultural areas, where farming has been less intensive.We investigated (i) the effectiveness of the Ecological Compensation Area (ECA) scheme for biodiversity protection according to different evaluation criteria and (ii) how the effectiveness of the scheme was influenced by climate, socio-economic conditions and farming structures. Vegetation surveys were carried out in 18 municipalities across the Swiss Alps on 162 randomly selected meadows managed as ECAs and on 162 conventionally managed meadows. Average species richness of ECA-meadows per municipality ranged between 27 and 46 vascular plant species per 25m 2 (conventionally managed meadows: 16-35 species per 25m 2). In lower altitude municipalities (mainly fulltime farming) where ECA meadows constituted 20% of farmland, the difference in species richness between the two land-use types was highly significant and the contribution of ECA-meadows to the grassland species pool was highest. In higher altitude municipalities (mainly part-time farming) where ECA meadows constituted at least 40% of farmland, higher species richness was found. This was associated with a strong botanical similarity of ECA and conventionally managed meadows.We conclude that at lower altitudes, where farming is relatively intensive, the ECA scheme protects a few, economically marginal, species rich and botanically complementary sites, important for maintaining the species pool. At higher altitudes the ECA scheme contributes to protecting existing biodiversity at the landscape scale. As it is more efficient to protect than to restore biodiversity, the protection effect of agri-environmental schemes needs to be adequately recognized. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Cross-compliance; Farmland biodiversity; Land-use intensity; Marginal farmland; Mountain grassland; Nature conservation","agri-environmental policy; biodiversity; environmental protection; grassland; land cover; land use planning; landscape planning; mountain region; policy approach; restoration ecology; species richness; Swiss Plateau; Switzerland; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855267657

Kumgang (Triticum aestivum L.). The resulting protein fractions were separated by one dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (1D-PAGE) coupled with LTQ-FTICR mass spectrometry. This enabled us to detect and identify 767 unique proteins. Our findings represent the most comprehensive exploration of a proteome to date. Based on annotation information from the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database and our analyses via WoLF PSORT and PSORT, these proteins are localized in the chloroplast (607 proteins), chloroplast stroma (145), thylakoid membrane (342), lumens (163), and integral membranes (166). In all, 67% were confirmed as chloroplast thylakoid proteins. Although nearly complete protein coverage (89% proteins) has been accomplished for the key chloroplast pathways in wheat, such as for photosynthesis, many other proteins are involved in regulating carbon metabolism. The identified proteins were assigned to 103 functional categories according to a classification system developed by the iProClass database and provided through Protein Information Resources. Those functions include electron transport, energy, cellular organization and biogenesis, transport, stress responses, and other metabolic processes. Whereas most of these proteins are associated with known complexes and metabolic pathways, about 13% of the proteins have unknown functions. The chloroplast proteome contains many proteins that are localized to the thylakoids but as yet have no known function. We propose that some of these familiar proteins participate in the photosynthetic pathway. Thus, our new and comprehensive protein profile may provide clues for better understanding that photosynthetic process in wheat. ©Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","LTQ-FTICR-MS; Proteomics; Thylakoid; Wheat chloroplast","article; carbon metabolism; cell isolation; cell metabolism; cellular distribution; cellular stress response; chloroplast; density gradient centrifugation; electron transport; fractionation; gene sequence; mass spectrometry; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; photosynthesis; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; protein function; protein localization; proteomics; separation technique; signal transduction; thylakoid; Triticum aestivum; wheat; biological model; cell fractionation; metabolism; methodology; proteomics; wheat; Triticum aestivum; proteome; vegetable protein; Centrifugation, Density Gradient; Models, Biological; Photosynthesis; Plant Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics; Subcellular Fractions; Thylakoids; Triticum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863761936

Renewable energy production is seen to create win-win situations, where both poverty alleviation and climate change mitigation targets can be met. Synergies within the energy-poverty-climate nexus are, however, not self-evident. This article analyzes, firstly, how the win-win policy narrative has emerged in the World Bank's energy policy. Secondly, it assesses how the World Bank has responded to the twin challenge of poverty alleviation and climate change mitigation in its renewable energy projects. In recent years, the two main renewable energy forms the Bank has financed have been large-scale hydropower as an on-grid solution and solar home systems (SHS) as an off-grid solution. Laos is an illustrative case for these trends. There, the World Bank has on the one hand supported controversial largescale hydropower development that is linked to regional power trade scheme in the Mekong region. On the other hand, it has also funded rural electrification projects that include an off-grid component implemented with SHS.

How this pathway controls later steps of meiotic development is largely unknown. Here, we have analyzed the role of the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway in spore formation by the meiosis-specific manipulation of Ras and PKA or by the disturbance of cAMP production. We found that the regulation of spore formation by acetate takes place after commitment to meiosis and depends on PKA and appropriate A kinase activation by Ras/Cyr1 adenylyl cyclase but not by activation through the Gpa2/Gpr1 branch. We further discovered that spore formation is regulated by carbon dioxide/bicarbonate, and an analysis of mutants defective in acetate transport (ady2Δ) or carbonic anhydrase (nce103Δ) provided evidence that these metabolites are involved in connecting the nutritional state of the meiotic cell to spore number control. Finally, we observed that the potential PKA target Ady1 is required for the proper localization of the meiotic plaque proteins Mpc70 and Spo74 at spindle pole bodies and for the ability of these proteins to initiate spore formation. Overall, our investigation suggests that the Ras/cAMP/PKA pathway plays a crucial role in the regulation of spore formation by acetate and indicates that the control of meiotic development by this signaling cascade takes places at several steps and is more complex than previously anticipated. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

The representative volume element incorporates the continuum approach, while carbon nanotube characterizes the atomistic approach. Space frame structure similar to three dimensional beams and point masses are employed to simulate the discrete geometrical constitution of the single walled carbon nanotube. The covalent bonds between carbon atoms found in the hexagonal lattices are assigned elastic properties using beam elements. The point masses applied on each node are coinciding with the carbon atoms work as mass of beam elements. The matrix phase is modeled as a continuum medium using solid elements. These two regions are interconnected by interfacial zone using beam elements. Analysis of nanocomposites having single walled carbon nanotube with different chiralities is performed, using an atomistic finite element model based on a molecular structural mechanics approach. Using the proposed multi scale model, the deformations obtained from the simulations are used to predict the elastic and shear moduli of the nanocomposites. A significant enhancement in the stiffness of the nanocomposites is observed. The effects of interfacial shear strength, stiffness, tensile strength, chirality, length of carbon nanotube, material of matrix, types of representative volume elements and types of loading conditions on the mechanical behavior of the nanocomposites are estimated. The finite element results are compared with the rule of mixtures using formulae. It is found that the results offered by proposed model, are in close proximity with those obtained by the rule of mixtures. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

They concluded that the frequency of storm surges would decrease by about 30%, and that this reduction would compensate the expected mean sea level rise. Their final statement was that ""the frequency of extreme tides in Venice might largely remain unaltered"". Although we agree in the expected reduction of storm surges, we strongly disagree in their final conclusion. First, because the impact of storm surges not only depends on the number of extreme surge events, but also on their intensity, that was not explicitely addressed. Second, because their estimates of mean sea level change for the 21st century are largely underestimated, as they miss some of the components driving sea level variability. Using state-of-the-art estimates for the thermosteric, mass and tidal contributions we show that the flooding events in Venice are expected to dramatically increase in a climate change scenario. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climate change scenarios; Climatic changes; Global climate model; Mean sea level; Sea level variability; Storm surges; Floods; Sea level; Storms; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; extreme event; flooding; sea level; storm surge; tidal cycle; twenty first century; Italy; Veneto; Venezia [Veneto]; Venice",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864276975

This work examines the technical and economic potential for flaring and venting mitigation in a mature oil and gas producing region of the world. Using detailed monthly production data spanning the years 2002-2008 for 18,203 active production facilities, combined with geographic information system pipeline data, reservoir gas composition data, and cost data derived from industry sources, a case study was constructed to explore the technical and economic viability of further mitigation of flaring and venting associated with upstream oil and gas production in Alberta, Canada. Calculations were performed to evaluate the feasibility of mitigation via collection and compression of gas into pipelines to connect into existing pipeline networks. Four main calculation scenarios were considered, and for each, a series of Monte-Carlo analyses were performed to evaluate uncertainties and sensitivities to key calculation parameters. In all scenarios, the results reveal potentially significant opportunities for economically viable flare and vent mitigation that would yield substantial reductions in CO 2 equivalent emissions. Because of the highly skewed distribution of gas volumes flared and vented at individual facilities, the results also show that solutions for comparatively small numbers of the largest facilities can offer large reductions in overall emissions from the sector. These results suggest that in a concerted effort to minimize carbon emissions in the upstream oil and gas industry, there is potential for significant near-term reductions using existing technology while research and development continues on more advanced methods such as carbon capture and storage. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Associated gas; Economic analysis; Flaring; Gas collection; Mitigation; Pipeline; Solution gas; Tie-in; Venting","Airborne pollutants; Alberta , Canada; Calculation parameters; Carbon capture and storage; Carbon emissions; Concerted effort; Cost data; Economic potentials; Economic viability; Emissions reduction; Flaring; Gas compositions; Mature oil; Mitigation; Monte carlo analysis; Oil and gas production; Petroleum production; Pipeline networks; Production data; Production facility; Research and development; Skewed distribution; Substantial reduction; Tie-in; Upstream oil and gas industry; Venting; Associated gas; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Pipelines; Production; Research; Uncertainty analysis; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; economic analysis; emission control; gas pipeline; gas production; GIS; oil production; research and development; venting; Alberta; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857992147

The primary objectives of this study were to assess and compare crop productivity, CH 4 andN 2O flux, and yield-scaled emissions between a conventionally and an organically managed system. All phases of a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max L. (Merr.)]-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) over alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)-alfalfa rotation were present each year. Both systems emitted about 4.2 kg N 2O-N ha -1 yr -1 including growing and nongrowing season emissions, which cumulatively represents 4.74 and 9.26% of 267 kg synthetic-N and 136 kg manure-N applied, respectively. The equivalent of 0.84% of the 78 kg urea-N and 0.76% of the 136 kg manure-N were emitted as N 2O ha -1 within 30-d of fertilizer application in the conventionally managed system and organically managed system, respectively. Following the application of starter fertilizer to the conventionally managed corn, the equivalent of 3.45% of the 11 kg starter N was emitted within 30 d. The largest spring-thaw N 2O flux was measured in the conventionally managed system following alfalfa, which had been killed the previous fall. Yield-scaled N 2O+CH 4 emission (Mg CO 2 equivalents Mg -1 yield) was 1.6- to 5-times greater in the organically managed system, which had lower yield but similar emission compared to the conventionally managed system. Thus, viability of organic systems to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission may be compromised when crop productivity is reduced.

However, these are resources which can be converted to green energy. Landfill gas which is essentially methane (50-55%) and carbon dioxide (40-45%) (both GHGs) is released from MSW by biodegradation processes. The estimation of this methane and its economic and environmental benefits for environmental sustainability are the objectives of this study. Methane emission from MSW disposed of in landfills was estimated using Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology. From the study, based on 8,196,000 tonnes MSW generated in Peninsular Malaysia in 2010, anthropogenic methane emission of about 310,220 tonnes per year was estimated. This was estimated to generate 1.9 billion kWh of electricity year -1 worth over RM 570 million (US$190 million). In addition, this leads to carbon dioxide reduction of 6,514,620 tonnes year -1 equivalent to carbon credit of over RM 257 million (US$85 million). These results were also projected for 2015 and 2020 and the outcomes are promising. Therefore, the exploration of this resource, besides the economic benefits helps in reducing the dependence on the depleting fossil fuel and hence broadening the fuel base of the country. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the European petroleum refining industry is investigated and the prospects for future CO2 abatement in relation to associated infrastructure are assessed. A more efficient use of the adjacent infrastructure, e.g., district heating networks, natural gas grids, neighbouring industries, and CO2 transport and storage systems, could provide opportunities for additional CO2 emissions reduction. It is shown that access to infrastructures that can facilitate CO2 abatement varies significantly across countries and between individual refineries. The assessment shows that short-term mitigation options, i.e., fuel substitution and energy efficiency measures, could reduce CO2 emissions by 9-40 MtCO2/year (6-26% of the total refinery emissions). It is further shown that carbon capture and storage offers the greatest potential for more significant emission reductions in the longer term.

During the past four decades, fishing pressure and climatic conditions have varied greatly in the BS, and stock levels have fluctuated substantially. Trophic control has changed from mainly bottomup to topdown, then back to mainly bottomup. No clear evidence for persistent ecological regimes was found. The past decade has been the warmest on record, with large stocks of demersal and pelagic fish, and increasing abundances of krill and shrimp. Except perhaps for the rather less-studied Arctic species, the short-term effect of the recent warming has been positive for BS stocks.

The aims were to 1) study trade-offs between reductions in CO2 emission and oil use and between Swedish reductions and EU reductions, 2) compare the potential contributions of individual reduction measures, 3) quantify the total CO2 emission and oil use reduction potentials. Swedish energy efficiency measures reduced EU CO2 emission by 45-59 Mt CO2/a, at current biomass use and constant oil use. Doubling Swedish bioenergy use yielded an additional 40 Mt CO2/a reduction. Oil use could be reduced, but 36-81 kt of reductions in CO2 emission would be lost per PJ of oil use reduction. Swedish fossil fuel use within the studied sectors could be nearly eliminated. The expansion of district heating and cogeneration of heat with a high electricity yield were important measures. Plug-in hybrid electric cars reduced CO2 emission compared with conventional cars, and the difference was larger with increasing oil scarcity. The introduction of black liquor gasification in pulp mills also gave large CO2 emission reduction.

We used time series of satellite observations of surface albedo from 2000-2011 and fire perimeters since 1970 to study post-fire changes in surface net shortwave radiation along a latitudinal transect in central Canada. Fire-induced surface shortwave forcing (SSF) integrated over an annual cycle for the first 30years after fire was similar (-4.1W m-2 with a 95% confidence interval of-4.5 to-3.7W m-2) between southern and northern boreal regions. The lack of a latitudinal difference in SSF was caused by counteracting latitudinal trends in seasonal contributions. Spring (March, April, and May) SSF increased with latitude, from-7.2W m-2 in the south to-10.1W m-2 in the north, primarily because of delayed snow melt, which amplified albedo differences between unburned forests and recovering stands. In contrast, winter incoming solar radiation and summer albedo change decreased from south to north, resulting in a decreasing latitudinal trend in winter and summer SSF. Vegetation recovery was slower in the north, leading to smaller increases in summer albedo during the first decade after fire, and a prolonged phase of elevated spring albedo during the second decade. Our results indicate that fires reduce surface net shortwave radiation considerably for many boreal forest ecosystems in North America, providing further evidence that disturbance-mediated shifts in surface energy exchange need to be considered in efforts to manage these forests for climate change mitigation. © 2012.

The history of establishing and developing of a structural design code in China can be roughly divided into four phases: introducing and using foreign codes (1950-1969), creating the main Chinese structural design code (1970-1985), establishing advanced Chinese structural design code (1986-2000), and building an integrated standard system (2001- 2011). Four levels (technical law, basic code, commonly used code, and specific code) are set to build the standard system for the design of building structures, which included 42 applicable codes, 30 under drafting codes, and 12 planned codes. In accordance with the applicable range, all technical codes are divided into four grades namely national, trade, local, and enterprise standards. Against the general background of global warming and climate changes, globalization of economy, and the events of massive earthquake and disasters caused by wind and snow under extreme weather, a new round revision of design code for building s tructures has been initiated in China and most of them have been completed in the end of 2011. The principles of low carbon economy and emission reduction have been considered in the new version of the codes. The main contents and revision points were briefly introduced on code of unified standard, loads, concret e structures, and seismic design.","Building structures; Conceptual design; Global warming; Low carbon economy; Standard system","Building structure; Design codes; Design of buildings; Emission reduction; Extreme weather; Foreign codes; Integrated standards; Low carbon economy; Standard system; Structural design codes; Buildings; Conceptual design; Emission control; Global warming; International trade; Seismic design; Structural design; Building codes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860677742

The results show that losses to irrigated agriculture under a median climate change scenario are modest, but under a 'modified 2030 dry extreme scenario' there would be substantial reductions in water use, irrigated land use and profits. Nevertheless, the Basin-wide proportional economic impacts would be less than the percentage decline in water use. A comparison of model results with and without inter-regional water trade shows that inter-regional water trade in periods of much reduced water availability mitigates the on-farm impacts of climate change. Given that agricultural production in the Basin is likely to be affected by climate change, the development of drought-tolerant crops and cultivars along with learning and extension of best farming practices to reduced water use could also assist irrigated agriculture adapt to climate change within the Basin. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Irrigated agriculture; Water trading","climate change; cultivar; drought resistance; economic activity; irrigation; water availability; water economics; water industry; water use; Australia; Murray-Darling Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859645386

The amount and properties of aerosol particulates, specifically size distribution and composition, can be affected by combustion conditions. Understanding the formation of these particles is important for predicting emissions and understanding potential deposition. Oxy-fuel combustion conditions utilize an oxygen-enriched gas environment with CO2. The high concentration of CO2 is a result of recycle flue gas which is used to maintain temperature. A hypothesis is that high CO2 concentration reduces the vaporization of refractory oxides from combustion. A high-temperature drop-tube furnace was used under different oxygen concentrations and CO2 versus N2 to study the effects of furnace temperature, coal type, and gas phase conditions on particulate formation. A scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) and aerodynamic particle sizer (APS) were utilized for particle size distributions ranging from 14.3 nm to 20 μm. In addition, particles were collected on a Berner low pressure impactor (BLPI) for elemental analysis using scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. Three particle size modes were seen: ultrafine (below 0.1 μm), fine (0.1 to 1.0 μm), and coarse (above 1 μm). Ultrafine mass concentrations were directly related to estimated particle temperature, increasing with increasing temperature. For high silicon and calcium coals, Utah Skyline and PRB, there was a secondary effect due to CO2 and the hypothesized reaction. Illinois #6, a high sulfur coal, had the highest amount of ultrafine mass and most of the sulfur was concentrated in the ultrafine and fine modes. Fine and coarse mode mass concentrations did not show a temperature or CO2 relationship.

Second, adopting Dean's (2002) simultaneous equations system, the relationships between trade, growth and emissions has been estimated and the results confirm the dominance of scale effects over technique effects. Third, the estimated per capita turning point for EKC is used to split the provincial industrial database into two groups (below and above turning point income) and simultaneous equations are estimated separately for them. The split sample provided limited support for the trade-induced emissions hypothesis for COD, but not for SO 2. At the provincial level rising incomes via increased levels of international trade were associated with falling COD due to the technique effect, so that rising incomes among the provinces tended to be associated with lower emissions.

However, the side effects and relatively low efficacy of As 2O3 in treating other leukemias have limited its wider use in therapeutic applications. In the present study, we found that the expression of carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1) affects the resistance to As2O 3 in leukemias, including APL; As2O3upregulated CBR1 expression at the transcriptional level by stimulating the activity of the transcription factor activator protein-1. Moreover, CBR1 overexpression was sufficient to protect cells against As2O3 through modulation of the generation of reactive oxygen species, whereas the attenuation of CBR1 was sufficient to sensitize cells to As2O3. A combination treatment with the specific CBR1 inhibitor hydroxy-PP-Me remarkably increased As2O3-induced apoptotic cell death compared with As2O3 alone, both in vitro and in vivo. These results were confirmed in primary cultured human acute and chronic myeloid leukemia cells, with no significant cell death observed in normal leukocytes.

We test the theory using billing data for participants and nonparticipants in a green-electricity program in Memphis, Tennessee. High-consumption households are more likely to participate, and they participate at higher levels. In terms of a behavioral response, households participating above the minimum threshold level do not change electricity consumption, but those participating at the minimum threshold increase electricity consumption 2.5 percent after enrolling in the program. The result is based on identification strategies that exploit before-after differences between participants and nonparticipants, and differences in the timing of enrollment among participants only. Despite the increase in electricity demand upon the purchase of green electricity for the households with a ""buy-in"" mentality, the net effect for the buy-in households is a reduction in pollution emissions, as the behavioral response is not large enough to offset the environmental benefit of the green-electricity purchase. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon offset; Green electricity; Moral licensing; Renewable energy; Residential electricity demand; Voluntary environmental protection","demand analysis; electricity; energy use; environmental protection; numerical model; public goods; renewable resource; Memphis; Tennessee; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862308448

In particular, experiments in a supersonicjet expansion provided information on the intrinsic photophysical properties of cooled and isolated molecules in which the Boltzmann distribution is almost negligible. Organic molecules showing emission from higher excited states form unique systems to which a number of modern techniques should be applied to obtain more detailed information on their photophysical properties. These data will provide useful information for understanding the dynamical behavior of isolated molecules in their excited states. There seems to be at least three mechanisms for occurrence of fluorescence from higher excited states: (A) the fluorescence occurs through the thermal repopulation of the lower excited state, e.g., S1; (B) it occurs via the reverse internal conversion from the lower singlet state under collision-free conditions; and (C) it occurs directly from the higher singlet state without involvement of the fluorescence component via the reverse internal conversion from the lower singlet state, i.e., prompt fluorescence. In case (C), the internal conversion rate from the higher singlet state to the lower state is considered to be slow enough to compete with the fluorescence from the higher state. In terms of phosphorescence from higher triplet states, there is mainly one mechanism corresponding to case (A) for the occurrence of the emission, except for the case of halogenated benzenes, for which dual phosphorescence from the 3(∏, ∏*) and 3 (∏, σ*) states was observed. That is, in most cases the phosphorescence from the higher triplet excited state occurs as the result of the thermal activation of the lower triplet state.

With the predicted increased frequency of drought events the industry is now considering breeding for drought adaptation after water stress inflicted yield losses of more than $400 million in the years 2002-2004, in one region alone. Defining drought adaptation broadly, including both short and long periods of water stress, we took the first step in improving sugarcane for such conditions by assessing the potential benefits of a number of traits in a simulation study. The APSIM-Sugarcane model was used to simulate the biomass yield response to traits that may confer adaptation to drought in a range of climates, some extremely dry at times, and in a shallow and a deep soil. Among the traits studied, increased rooting depth resulted in 0-21% increase in mean dry biomass yield depending on the climate and soil type. This trait was more beneficial in the shallow than the deep soil which had a smaller fraction of additional stored water to offer the more vigorous root system. The simulations showed that breeding for reduced stomatal or root conductance (conductance) would increase biomass yield by about 5% only in the driest climates and better soils. Other traits which conserved water such as leaf and stalk senescence were generally unsuccessful in conferring adaptation to the water-limited production environments considered. Simulations indicated that increased transpiration efficiency (TE) at the leaf level would nearly always help to improve sugarcane biomass yields in water-limited environments if the increased TE arose from up-regulation of intrinsic water use efficiency. However if increased TE was increased through reduced conductance, which effectively reduces VPD during transpiration, yields could be reduced in high rainfall climates and shallow soils and they could increase in moderate rainfall climates and deeper soils. Thus increased rooting depth, increased intrinsic water use efficiency and to a lesser extent, reduced conductance leading to increased TE, are suggested as the best traits to consider for selection of sugarcane clones in water-limited environments in the tropics and sub-tropics. © 2012.","APSIM; Crop simulation; G×E; Rooting depth; Transpiration efficiency","adaptation; agricultural modeling; biomass; clone; crop production; drought; plant breeding; rainfall; root system; rooting; senescence; soil type; sugar cane; theoretical study; transpiration; water availability; water stress; water use efficiency; yield response; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861852218

As irradiance levels increased from 225 to 900 μmol/m2/s, the production of plant secondary metabolites (total flavonoids, phenolics and antocyanin) was found to decrease steadily. Production of total flavonoids and phenolics reached their peaks under 225 followed by 500, 625 and 900 μmol/m2/s irradiances. Significant positive correlation of production of total phenolics, flavonoids and antocyanin content with Fv/Fm, Fm/Fo and photosynthesis indicated up-regulation of carbon-based secondary metabolites (CBSM) under reduced photoinhibition on the under low light levels condition. At the lowest irradiance levels, Labisia pumila extracts also exhibited a significantly higher antioxidant activity (DPPH) than under high irradiance. The improved antioxidative activity under low light levels might be due to high availability of total flavonoids, phenolics and anthocyanin content in the plant extract. It was also found that an increase in the production of CBSM was due to high PAL activity under low light, probably signifying more availability of phenylalanine (Phe) under this condition. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Carbon-based secondary metabolites; DPPH assay; Maximum efficiency of photosystem II; Net photosynthesis; PAL activity; Polyphenolics","1,1 diphenyl 2 picrylhydrazyl; anthocyanin; antioxidant; flavonoid; Labisia pumila extract; phenol; phenylalanine; phenylalanine ammonia lyase; plant extract; unclassified drug; antioxidant; phenol derivative; phenylalanine ammonia lyase; photosystem II; antioxidant activity; article; controlled study; drug determination; electron transport; enzyme activity; Labisia pumila; light irradiance; medicinal plant; metabolic inhibition; photochemical efficiency; photoinhibition; photosynthetic rate; photosystem II; phytoavailability; plant leaf; quantum chemistry; quantum yield; steady state; upregulation; chemistry; enzymology; light; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; Primulaceae; Anthocyanins; Antioxidants; Flavonoids; Light; Phenols; Phenylalanine Ammonia-Lyase; Photosynthesis; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Primulaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861509649

The information and communication technology today accounted for 3 and 2% global power consumption and global CO2 emissions, respectively, where a significant portion is a result of the power consumption in the radio frequency (RF) power amplifier device. Moreover, tomorrow amplifiers will need to be reconfigurable and host a plethora of modulated signals to support effective signal processing. Therefore performance metrics such as linearity, power efficiency and their trade-off should be at the forefront of the RF power amplifier design. This study proposes an energy-efficient power amplifier design based on the Doherty configuration as part of a green RF front end for mobile WiMAX. The authors extend the classical Doherty to incorporate a three-stage load modulation design with a proposed new output power combiner. The performance of the three-stage load modulation RF power amplifier is compared with the legacy two-stage load modulation technique. The experimental results show that 30 dBm output power can be achieved with 67% power-added efficiency, which represents a 14% improvement over the current state-of-the-art system while meeting the power output requirements for mobile WiMAX. © 2012 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.",,"Amplifier designs; Amplifier devices; CO2 emissions; Doherty; Energy efficient; Entire system; Holistic design; Information and Communication Technologies; Load modulation; Mobile WiMAX; Modulated signal; Multi-stage; Output power; Performance metrics; Power efficiency; Power out put; Power-added efficiency; Radio frequency front end; Radio frequency power; Radio frequency power amplifiers; RF front end; RF power amplifiers; State-of-the-art system; Wireless communication devices; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Design; Electric power utilization; Information technology; Power amplifiers; Radio waves; Wireless telecommunication systems; Modulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860856625

Diesel trucks are a significant source of emissions in ambient air, especially for NOx. Recently, China announces an aggressive target to reduce national NOx emissions by 10% from 2010 to 2015 in the ""Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2011-2015)"" and diesel vehicles are identified as a key target for NOx control. However, the understanding of the real-world emissions of diesel trucks is limited. In this study, we measured HC, CO, NOx, and PM 2.5 emissions from 175 diesel trucks of different sizes and technologies in five Chinese cities during 2007 and 2011, and generated emission factors on the basis of the measurements. The results show that the HC, CO, and PM 2.5 emission factors have been reduced significantly as the emission standards become more stringent from Euro 0 to Euro IV, but the NOx emission factors change differently. Euro II trucks have 3-6% higher NOx emission levels than Euro I technologies and Euro III trucks fail to show a reduction as regulated by the standards. More stringent NOx requirements (e.g. Euro IV) for diesel vehicles need to be enforced. The comparison with the emission factors used in recent emission inventory studies shows that these inventories may have overestimated or underestimated diesel emissions for the years after 2006. This study emphasizes the importance of conducting local measurement research to improve the accuracy of the estimates of mobile emissions in China. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Diesel trucks; Emission factors; Mobile emission inventory; On-board emission measurement","Ambient air; Atmospheric environment; Chinese cities; Diesel emission; Diesel truck; Diesel vehicles; Different sizes; Emission factors; Emission inventories; Emission measurement; Emission standard; Local measurement; NOx control; NOx emissions; On-board measurements; Real-world emission; Vehicle emission; Automobiles; Diesel locomotives; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Trucks; black carbon; carbon monoxide; hydrocarbon; nitrogen dioxide; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; diesel engine; emission inventory; standard (regulation); traffic emission; trucking; accuracy; air pollution control; ambient air; article; car driving; carbon balance; catalyst; China; cost; diesel engine; field emission; highway; motor vehicle; nonhuman; oxidation; particle size; priority journal; truck; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860625314

Terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) have become an integral tool for extrapolating local observations and understanding to much larger terrestrial regions. Although models vary in their specific goals and approaches, their central role within carbon cycle science is to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms currently controlling carbon exchange. Recently, the North American Carbon Program (NACP) organized several interim-synthesis activities to evaluate and inter-compare models and observations at local to continental scales for the years 2000-2005. Here, we compare the results from the TBMs collected as part of the regional and continental interim-synthesis (RCIS) activities. The primary objective of this work is to synthesize and compare the 19 participating TBMs to assess current understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle in North America. Thus, the RCIS focuses on model simulations available from analyses that have been completed by ongoing NACP projects and other recently published studies. The TBM flux estimates are compared and evaluated over different spatial (1°×1° and spatially aggregated to different regions) and temporal (monthly and annually) scales. The range in model estimates of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) for North America is much narrower than estimates of productivity or respiration, with estimates of NEP varying between -0.7 and 2.2PgCyr -1, while gross primary productivity and heterotrophic respiration vary between 12.2 and 32.9PgCyr -1 and 5.6 and 13.2PgCyr -1, respectively. The range in estimates from the models appears to be driven by a combination of factors, including the representation of photosynthesis, the source and of environmental driver data and the temporal variability of those data, as well as whether nutrient limitation is considered in soil carbon decomposition. The disagreement in current estimates of carbon flux across North America, including whether North America is a net biospheric carbon source or sink, highlights the need for further analysis through the use of model runs following a common simulation protocol, in order to isolate the influences of model formulation, structure, and assumptions on flux estimates. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon fluxes; Intercomparison; North American Carbon Program; Regional; Terrestrial biospheric models","Carbon cycles; Carbon exchange; Carbon fluxes; Carbon source; Continental scale; Current estimates; Driver data; Gross primary productivity; Heterotrophic respiration; Intercomparison; Intercomparisons; Model estimates; Model formulation; Model simulation; Net ecosystem productivities; North American; Nutrient limitations; Primary objective; Regional; Simulation protocols; Soil carbon; Temporal variability; Terrestrial biosphere; Terrestrial carbon cycle; Terrestrial ecosystems; Biospherics; Carbon; Ecosystems; Estimation; Forestry; Geologic models; Computer simulation; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; biogeochemistry; biosphere; carbon cycle; carbon flux; comparative study; ecological modeling; flux measurement; heterotrophy; net ecosystem production; photosynthesis; primary production; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859481023

Motorized vehicles in developing countries, both for passenger and freight transport, will contribute the lion share of the projected global increase in greenhouse gases from transport in the years to come. Rapid motorization is also associated with worsening air pollution, congestion and increased road accidents. Transport policy in developing countries generally is still focused on 'predict and provide' which stimulates the expansion of transport infrastructure to cater for increased numbers of vehicles. This is increasingly resulting in an unsustainable growth trajectory for the transport sector. There are however countries and cities which are taking measures, sometimes aided by external assistance, which if replicated widely and scaled up to sector wide policies could have a meaningful impact on lowering future greenhouse gas emissions from transport. Future policies on transport and climate change in developing countries will have to be comprehensive, coordinated and integrated. Policies will need to combine restraining the growth in vehicles and the demand for transport by providing alternatives to individualized motorized transport through for example better public transport. The emphasis in transport policy needs to be on avoiding future emission through smart land use and transport planning, preventing a shift away from more sustainable modes of transport to private motorized vehicles and improvements in vehicle engine and fuel technologies. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Parameters of emission source contribution ratio (ESCR) and normalized local ESCR were introduced to reflect the source contribution in terms of its total emission amount and per unit emission amount, and were used for identifying the emission sources for priority regulation. The proposed method was then applied to a case study in Beijing, China. Three scenarios were examined, including (a) analysis of only seven PM10 emission source categories for the entire Beijing; (b) analysis of just 13 emission districts in Beijing; and (c) comprehensive analysis of seven emission source categories in each emission district. The following emissions were identified for priority regulation: (a) stationary emissions from the urban center of Beijing and Fengtai districts; (b) industrial fugitive emissions from Chaoyang, Fengtai, and Shijingshan districts; (c) road dust emissions from the urban center of Beijing, Chaoyang, Fengtai, Shijingshan, and Haidian districts; (d) construction site dust emissions from the urban center of Beijing, Chaoyang, Fengtai, and Haidian districts; (e) bare land emissions from Chaoyang district; and (f) vehicle exhaust emissions from the urban center of Beijing, Chaoyang, Fengtai, and Haidian districts.

It consists of series of forest restoration projects that aim to address severe soil and water losses, and improve farmer's livelihoods. To assess the effectiveness of the program, systematic planning, integrated research and comprehensive monitoring were used to illustrate how forest restoration projects that consider both ecological, social and economic perspectives can improve both the environment and society, and eradicate the "" ecological-poverty trap"" We found that the overall ecological effects of the program are beneficial, and the socioeconomic effects are mostly positive. Forest plantations covering 4.92×10 6ha were established, which promoted increased forest coverage from a minimum of 26.98% to 60.05% at present. The amount of carbon storage in forest increased significantly, with net carbon sequestration of plantation forests increased from 2.29TgC/year to 10.52TgC/year. The results also indicated that the area of land affected by heavy and severe soil erosion has decreased by 55.2% and 53.6%, respectively, while the water holding capacity was 25.2% higher in 2009 than that in 1990. The net income for farmers was almost 6 times greater than that before the program, and the number of people living below the poverty line decreased from 10 million to 0.865 million. This assessment has confirmed that if we cannot improve the livelihood of local communities and encourage them to participate in such programs, we will be unable to restore and manage degraded environments. The continuing and future impacts of the program may be even greater, and will provide important lessons and experiences for other ecological restoration programs. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","China; Ecological and socioeconomic effects; Forest restoration; Mountain-River-Lake Program","Carbon sequestration; Carbon storage; China; Ecological effect; Ecological restoration; Economic perspective; Economic progress; Forest plantation; Forest restoration; Integrated research; Local community; Mountain-River-Lake Program; Net incomes; Number of peoples; Plantation forests; Poyang Lake; Soil and water loss; Soil erosion; Southern China; Systematic planning; Water holding capacity; Ecology; Forestry; Heavy water; Lakes; Restoration; Conservation; assessment method; carbon sequestration; economic analysis; forest cover; forest ecosystem; plantation; reforestation; restoration ecology; soil erosion; China; Ecology; Economic Analysis; Forestry; Heavy Water; Lakes; Restoration; Soil; China; Jiangxi; Poyang Lake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860312830

Using an electric vehicle mobile platform equipped with fast response instruments, real-time air pollutant concentrations were measured in BH in spring and summer of 2008. Pollutant concentrations varied significantly in the two seasons, on different days, and by time of day, with an overall average UFP concentration in the residential areas of ~33 000cm -3. The averaged UFP, BC, and NO concentrations measured on Soto St, a major surface street in BH, were 57 000cm -3, 5.1μgm -3, and 67ppb, respectively. Concentrations of UFP across the residential areas in BH were nearly uniform spatially, in contrast to other areas in the greater metropolitan area of Los Angeles where UFP concentrations exhibit strong gradients downwind of roadways. We attribute this "" UFP cloud"" to high traffic volumes, including heavy duty diesel trucks on the freeways which surround and traverse BH, and substantial numbers of high-emitting vehicles (HEVs) on the surface streets traversing BH. Additionally, the high density of stop signs and lights and short block lengths, requiring frequent accelerations of vehicles, may contribute. The data also support a role for photochemical production of UFP in the afternoon. UFP concentration peaks (5s average) of up to 9 million particles cm -3 were also observed immediately behind HEVs when they accelerated from stop lights in the BH neighborhood and areas immediately adjacent. Although encounters with HEV during mornings accounted for only about 6% and 17% of time spent monitoring residential areas and major surface streets, HEV contributed to about 28% and 53% of total ultrafine particles measured on the route, respectively. The observation of elevated pollutant concentrations across the Boyle Heights community highlights how multiple factors combine to create high pollutant levels, and has important human exposure assessment implications, including the potential utility of our data as inputs to epidemiological studies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Boyle Heights; Exposure assessment; Freeway; Mobile platform; New particle formation; Ultrafine particle; Vehicle emissions","Boyle Heights; Exposure assessment; Freeway; Mobile platform; New particle formation; Ultrafine particle; Vehicle emissions; Air pollution; Automobiles; Electric vehicles; Mobile phones; Hybrid vehicles; black carbon; nitric oxide; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); data set; electric vehicle; epidemiology; metropolitan area; motorway; neighborhood; observational method; particle size; photochemistry; pollution exposure; pollution monitoring; residential location; seasonality; street canyon; traffic emission; urban atmosphere; acceleration; air pollutant; article; concentration (parameters); diesel engine; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; photochemistry; priority journal; residential area; spring; summer; traffic; United States; California; Los Angeles [California]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857790375

Using a portable emissions measurement system, 16 diesel taxies were tested on different roads in Macao and the data were normalized with the vehicle specific power bin method. The 11 Toyota Corolla diesel taxies have very good fuel economy of (5.9 ± 0.6) L/100 km, while other five diesel taxies showed relatively high values at (8.5 ± 1.7) L/100 km due to the variation in transmission systems and emission control strategies. Compared to similar Corolla gasoline models, the diesel cars confirmed an advantage of ca. 20% higher fuel efficiency. HC and CO emissions of all the 16 taxies are quite low, with the average at (0.05 ± 0.02) g/km and (0.38 ± 0.15) g/km, respectively. The average NOx emission factor of the 11 Corolla taxies is (0.56 ± 0.17) g/km, about three times higher than their gasoline counterparts. Two of the three Hyundai Sonata taxies, configured with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) + diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) emission control strategies, indicated significantly higher NO2 emissions and NO2/NOx ratios than other diesel taxies and consequently trigger a concern of possibly adverse impacts on ozone pollution in urban areas with this technology combination.

The study took place several days after precipitation. Both physical and chemical hydrographs indicated that significant amounts of dissolved inorganic nutrients had either entered the inner lagoon through runoff drainage or regenerated from the bottom sediments of the inner lagoon. Although the variables (chlorophyll a, bacterial biomass and production, as well as dissolved and particulate organic carbon) had orders of variation, linear relationships were significant between variables. This could have been associated with high phytoplankton growth enhanced by enriched nutrients and its sequential responses. This study considered both phytoplankton and bacterial communities that are the most important components of organic carbon consumption; they accounted for more than 87% of the organic carbon consumption in this ecosystem. A large ratio of primary production to community respiration with a mean of 1.33 suggested that this lagoon was autotrophic during the study period.

A simple, flexible, potent, and credible compliance enforcement system for a post-Kyoto climate agreement, based on deposits, is proposed here: at ratification, each country deposits a significant amount of money, and continues to do so in the preparation stage each year until the start of the commitment period. At the end of this period, those countries that meet their emissions limitation targets receive a full refund of their deposit, while those that fail to do so forfeit part or all of it.

Staged air combustion is also an effective means of NOx reduction, especially in biomass combustion. This article reports results on NOx emissions in a set of experiments combining FGR and staged air combustion in a grate-fired laboratory-scale reactor. Two different compositions of the recirculated flue gas were used: CO2 and CO2 + NO. The CO2 concentration varied between 0-8 vol% of the total inlet flow rate and the NO concentration varied between 0 and 64 ppm. Two different FGR locations were also tested: above and below the grate. The results are compared with a reference experiment performed without FGR. The NOx reduction level from staged air combustion at the optimal primary excess air ratio is ∼70%, while employing FGR can reduce the NOx emissions by an additional 5%-10%. The optimal primary excess air ratio range is 0.9-1. However, FGR more effectively reduces NOx when employed outside of the optimum primary excess air ratio range, i.e., excess air ratios higher than 1 and less than 0.9. The experiments with FGR located above the grate exhibit higher reduction potential, while FGR located below the grate produces decreased reduction. The recycled-NO conversion factor, which gives a measure of maximal FGR efficiency, at the maximum point, is nearly 100% when FGR is applied below the grate and is 85%-100% in the case of recirculation above the grate. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Air combustion; Biomass combustion; Conversion factor; Excess air ratios; Flame temperatures; Flue gas recirculation; Laboratory-scale reactor; NO concentration; Optimal primaries; Oxygen concentrations; Recirculations; Reduction level; Reduction potential; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Experiments; Flue gases; Optimization; Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861727337

These methods require that the unmodified isotopic composition of meteoric water is recorded by authigenic minerals, a critical assumption that has not been tested across wide-ranging environmental and topographical contexts. Here, we show that Quaternary lake carbonate δ18O values are not strongly, nor significantly, correlated with regional elevation due to the isotopic modification of in-flow waters following entry into the lake environment. These modifications are largely caused by surface water evaporation, and can result in >3 km errors in paleoelevation estimates if not accounted for. However, our analysis suggests that positive shifts in surface water δ18O are accompanied by similar magnitude shifts in δ13C-DIC. This positive co-variation in δ 18O and δ13C may be used to detrend lake carbonate compositions for the effects of surface water evaporation using a parameter we define here as the 13C-excess. When Tibetan lakes are excluded from the data set, 13C-excess values are significantly correlated with mean up-slope hypsometric altitude with an error of 500 m. Application of the 13C-excess approach to Cenozoic lake carbonate records from the western U.S. Cordillera both challenges and reinforces previous paleoelevational interpretations based on δ18O alone. ©2012.

Evidences obtained from UV/Vis, Raman and FTIR spectroscopies, as well as atomic force microscopy, confirm that the reduction of exfoliated GO single sheets by hydrazine yields partially reduced graphene oxide featuring a high defect density. Two-dimensional assemblies of GO and rGO were formed through electrostatic adsorption at Au electrodes, sequentially modified with 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid (MUA) and poly-diallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDADMAC). The MUA:PDADMAC generates a strong blocking layer to the electron-transfer reaction involving the ferri/ferrocyanide redox couple. This blocking behaviour is not significantly affected upon adsorption of GO. However, adsorption of a sub-monolayer of rGO decreases the charge-transfer resistance by more than two orders of magnitude. Analysis of cyclic voltammograms and impedance spectra suggests that electron transfer in rGO assemblies is mediated by occupied states located just below the redox Fermi energy of the probe.

Based on the 21st century sea-level rise scenarios projected by the U.S. Climate Change Science Program (CCSP, 2009), the Chesapeake Bay was chosen as a prototype to study the responses of the estuary to potential future sea-level rise. The numerical model results show that the average salt content, salt intrusion length, and stratification will increase as sea level rises. The changes of these parameters have obvious seasonal and inter-annual variations. Both the salt content and stratification show more increase in spring (following the high-flow periods) and wet years than in autumn (following the low-flow periods) and dry years. The salt intrusion length has larger increase and greater standard deviation in autumn than in spring. The transport time scales are used to illustrate the variations of transport processes as sea level rises, and results indicate that (1) the exchange flow would be strengthened but the downstream transport of fresh water would be slower; (2) the residence time of the Bay would increase due to the increased volume and change of circulation; (3) the vertical transport time (reference to water surface) has more pronounced increase and the volume of water mass with different age groups increases with different rates. As a result, the retention time of dissolved substances in the Bay would increase. Although the increased tidal currents would strengthen the vertical mixing, the increased stratification would weaken the vertical exchange. The increase of vertical transport time is due to the impact of stratification changes, which overwhelms the impact of tidal changes. As the bottom dissolved oxygen (DO) supply is predominated by the vertical exchanges in the Chesapeake Bay, the increased upstream transport time has a weak impact on hypoxia conditions in the middle and upper portions of the Bay. The weakened vertical exchange would result in less DO supply from the surface to the bottom layer. © 2012.","Chesapeake bay; Salinity; Sea-level rise; Stratification; Time scale; Transport process","annual variation; bay; biogeochemistry; dissolved oxygen; estuarine environment; freshwater input; future prospect; hydrodynamics; hypoxia; numerical model; residence time; saline intrusion; salinity; sea level change; seasonal variation; stratification; tidal current; timescale; twenty first century; vertical mixing; water mass; Chesapeake Bay; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861462001

Biomass cofiring can also potentially contribute to meeting renewable portfolio standards (RPS), and result in reduced pollutant emissions, including sulfur oxides (SOx) and mercury. However, biomass fuels are widely variable in composition, particle size, and nitrogen content, which can make utilization of these fuels challenging. In this work, a numerical study was conducted for cofiring of pulverized coal and sawdust under air-fired and oxyfuel conditions to investigate the effects of cofiring on flame length and nitric oxide (NO) formation. Previous experiments have shown an increase in nitrogen conversion to NO when cofiring under both air-fired and oxyfuel combustion, despite the fact that the sawdust cofired had less fuel-bound nitrogen. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is used to determine the cause of the increased NO conversion and to identify differences between air-fired and oxyfuel cofired flames. The simulations reveal that cofired flames have longer volatile-flame regions (the flame envelope), and this length is influenced by the increased volatile fraction and particle size associated with the biomass. Flame length theory for turbulent, non-premixed gaseous diffusion flames was found to be useful in interpreting the observed results in both air-fired and oxyfuel combustion. Large biomass particles that are not entrained in the near-burner region breakthrough the flame envelope, and this was shown to be detrimental to controlling NO formation. During oxy-cofiring combustion, particle breakthrough occurs at smaller diameter, leading to increased nitrogen conversion to NO when compared to air-fired conditions. This is a direct result of a decreased flame envelope length and elevated oxygen concentrations. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomass; Coal combustion; Cofiring; Oxy-combustion; Oxy-fuel","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Computational fluid dynamics; Fuels; Mercury (metal); Nitric oxide; Nitrogen; Particle size; Sulfur; Atmospheric CO; Biomass cofiring; Biomass fuels; Biomass Particle; Carbon capture and storage; Cofired; Cofiring; Computational fluid dynamic (CFD); Flame length; Gaseous diffusion; Nitrogen content; Nitrogen conversion; NO conversion; NO formation; Non-premixed; Numerical studies; Oxy-combustion; Oxy-fuels; Oxyfuel combustion; Oxygen concentrations; Particle breakthrough; Pollutant emission; Pulverized coals; Renewable portfolio standard; Sulfur oxide; Volatile fractions; Biomass; biomass; carbon dioxide; combustion; computational fluid dynamics; emission; fractionation; mercury (element); numerical model; oxygen; particle size; pollutant removal; sulfur dioxide; volatile substance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857992857

The code includes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have important effects on the chemistry. All three ions generally have two peaks in abundance as a function of depth into the cloud, one at AV ≲ 1 and one at AV 3-8, the exact values depending on the ratio of incident ultraviolet flux to gas density. For relatively low values of the incident far-ultraviolet flux on the cloud (χ ≲ 1000; χ = 1 = local interstellar value), the columns of OH+ and H2O+ scale roughly as the cosmic-ray primary ionization rate ζcrp divided by the hydrogen nucleus density n. The H3O+ column is dominated by the second peak, and we show that if PAHs are present, N(H3O+) 4 × 1013cm-2 independent of ζcrp or n. If there are no PAHs or very small grains at the second peak, N(H 3O+) can attain such columns only if low-ionization potential metals are heavily depleted. We also model diffuse and translucent clouds in the interstellar medium, and show how observations of N(OH +)/N(H) and N(OH+)/N(H2O+) can be used to estimate ζcrp/n, χ/n and AV in them. We compare our models to Herschel observations of these two ions, and estimate ζcrp 4-6 × 10-16(n/100 cm-3)s -1 and χ/n = 0.03cm3 for diffuse foreground clouds toward W49N. © 2012.

The present review is thought to give an overview over recent developments with regard to treatment-induced changes in structural, functional and molecular neuroimaging. A number of studies could show that antidepressant treatment may lead to a partial restorage of primarily altered processes. This becomes evident in structural magnetic resonance imaging studies which point towards the reduction of volumetric differences between depressed patients and healthy controls during treatment, along with a normalization of neuronal functioning as assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging. On a molecular level positron emission tomography studies investigating targets which are fundamentally implicated in antidepressant action such as serotonergic and dopaminergic transporters and receptors have shown to be sustainably infl uenced by antidepressant treatment. However, it seems that not all dysfunctional processes can be reversed by antidepressant treatment and that state and trait factors are evident not only on a behavioral but also on a neurobiological level.

The case study indicates that adaptation and development interact better when policies are designed to integrate different needs, and that existing processes like the National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPA) can help to mainstream adaptation into development policies while keeping objectives separate. The assessment shows that synergies between development and adaptation can be promoted to increase adaptive capacity and implement adaptation measures. A Sustainable Development Policies and Measures (SD-PAM) mechanism, similar to the one more commonly discussed for mitigation, can also be used to identify, finance and monitor adaptation through development activities. NAPAs can further facilitate the identification of common resources, leverage mechanisms and activities required for success in adaptation and development interventions. Adaptation can be integrated into development interventions, as well as into institutional arrangements, resource management and legal frameworks. Integration of adaptation can also support sustainable development through a systemic consideration of the assumptions and interventions in development policies. The implementation of adaptation could be advanced through targeted development interventions that create traceable adaptation benefits through mechanisms that incentivize and support sustainable development policies and measures. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","adaptation; agriculture; co-benefits; IAASTD; mainstreaming; NAPA; rice; SD-PAM; system of rice intensification","climate change; crop production; intensive agriculture; local adaptation; resource management; rice; sustainable development; Mozambique",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84876015780

Trash burning is a common disposal method in poor areas, yet it is uncontrolled in many countries, and its contribution to air pollution is unclear due to uncertainties in its emissions. Here we develop a new trash burning emission inventory for Mexico City based on inverse socioeconomic levels and recently measured emission factors, and apply a chemistry-transport model to analyze the effects on pollutant concentrations. Trash burning is estimated to emit 25 tons of primary organic aerosols (POA) per day, which is comparable to fossil fuel POA emissions in Mexico City, and causes an increase in average organic aerosol concentrations of ∼0.3 μg m-3 downtown and up to 2 μg m-3 in highly populated suburbs near the sources of emission. An evaluation using submicrometer antimony suggests that our emission estimates are reasonable. Mitigation of trash burning could reduce the levels of organic aerosols by 2-40% and those of PM2.5 by 1-15% over the metropolitan area.

Better incorporation of socio-economic stress in local vulnerability assessments is important when planning for climate adaptation. This is rarely done due to insufficient understanding of their interaction, in both theory and practice. The omission leads to critical weaknesses in local adaptation strategies. This study analyses how socio-economic stress interact with climatic stress and shape local vulnerability to flooding, and how such stress can be more efficiently managed within local government organisations. A framework containing potential stresses was developed and applied to investigate how socio-economic stress affected exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity in two case studies, using interview and group exercise transcripts. Cases consisted of major development projects in two Swedish municipalities, Gothenburg and Lilla Edet. The cases were similarly exposed to climatic stress but differed in socio-economic context, and previous professional climate change experience. Fierce foreign competition and market structure were seen as the two most significant socio-economic stresses influencing local vulnerability to flooding through shaping the 'local' worldview. In falling order sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity were seen to be influenced by the socio-economic stresses. Two approaches to efficiently incorporate climatic and socio-economic stress in local management are proposed: shifting the focus of vulnerability assessments towards future sensitivity of people and settlements, rather than on the current infrastructure's sensitivity, would facilitate their use in planning and by 'mainstreaming' adaptation into long-term strategic planning vulnerability would be more dynamically addressed and periodically revised. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Adaptation strategies; Climate vulnerability; Flooding; Local government; Multiple stresses; Socio-economic stress","adaptive management; assessment method; climate change; community care; flooding; sensitivity analysis; socioeconomic status; state role; strategic approach; vulnerability; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860364711

While universities possess many resources that can facilitate such mitigation efforts, their potential contribution has been underexplored in academic literature. This article presents methods and results from a local-scale emissions inventory and mitigation planning process carried out in Pennsylvania's Centre Region by Penn State researchers. The inventory used innovative methods to estimate vehicle emissions and generate alternative local emissions scenarios. The mitigation planning process drew upon local knowledge of residents e who were informed by the emissions inventory e to generate and prioritize mitigation options they viewed as appropriate for the region. The publicly vetted options were presented to the regional government as a planning tool. Rather than create a single greenhouse gas mitigation plan for the region, the governing body decided each municipality should create its own energy-efficiency action plan based on its particular abilities and needs. This case study shows that politicians ultimately determine local climate change policy, but universities can play a valuable role in facilitating the process that leads to that policy. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions inventory; Local scale; Mitigation plan; Universities","action plan; climate change; emission inventory; energy efficiency; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; mitigation; planning process; traffic emission; university sector; Pennsylvania; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82055185681

Consequently, choice of fertilizer type, optimizing fertilizer application rates and timing, reducing microbial denitrification and improving soil carbon management are focus areas for mitigation. We have integrated separate models derived from global data on fertilizer-induced soil N 2O emissions, soil nitrification inhibitors, and the effects of tillage and soil inputs of soil C stocks into a single model to determine optimal mitigation options as a function of soil type, climate, and fertilization rates. After Monte Carlo sampling of input variables, we aggregated the outputs according to climate, soil and fertilizer factors to consider the benefits of several possible emissions mitigation strategies, and identified the most beneficial option for each factor class on a per-hectare basis. The optimal mitigation for each soil-climate-region was then mapped to propose geographically specific optimal GHG mitigation strategies for crops with varying N requirements. The use of empirical models reduces the requirements for validation (as they are calibrated on globally or continentally observed phenomena). However, as they are relatively simple in structure, they may not be applicable for accurate site-specific prediction of GHG emissions. The value of this modelling approach is for initial screening and ranking of potential agricultural mitigation options and to explore the potential impact of regional agricultural GHG abatement policies. Given the clear association between management practice and crop productivity, it is essential to incorporate characterization of the yield effect on a given crop before recommending any mitigation practice. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Agriculture; Climate; Fertilizer; Greenhouse gas; Mitigation; Modelling; Nitrous oxide; Soil carbon; Tillage","carbon emission; crop production; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; modeling; nitrous oxide; soil carbon; tillage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860678943

Emissions were analyzed from a subset of 18 vehicles tested in the Kansas City Light-Duty Vehicle Emissions Study (KCVES). The KCVES applied the LA92 Unified Driving Cycle (UDC), consisting of ""cold start"" , ""hot stabilized running"" , and ""warm start"" phases. The sensitivity of the TE-GC-MS analysis provided the opportunity to examine the emission rates and proportions of SVOCs (including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), hopanes, and steranes) in PM 2.5 on an individual vehicle basis for each UDC phase. Mean target SVOC emissions rates of 5.01μgkm -1, 0.28μgkm -1, and 0.63μgkm -1 were reported for the cold start, hot stabilized running, and warm start phases, respectively. Operating conditions as depicted by each UDC phase significantly affected SVOC emission rates and proportions in PM 2.5. The cold start phase emission rates were significantly higher than the hot stabilized running and warm start phases for 89% of the target SVOCs. An increase in SVOC proportions in PM 2.5 was observed during the warm start phase compared with the cold start and hot stabilized running phase. This observation was significant for 31% of the target compounds, including chrysene, benzo[a]anthracene, and pyrene. Vehicles tested in both summer and winter provided emissions data describing ambient temperature effects. Emission rates were significantly higher in the winter for 92% of the target SVOCs. Until now, observations of specific SVOCs in motor vehicle emissions produced under changing operating conditions were scant.

The Montreal process identified the ""maintenance of forest contribution to global carbon cycles"" as an essential component in sustainable management of forest ecosystems. Carbon sink evaluations provide reference information to policy-makers, stakeholders, resource managers and concerned citizens about the sustainable use of our forests for present and future generations. Two forest areas in northern and central Spain ('Páramos y Valles' and Central Mountain Range) were chosen as pilot areas to test the use of the National Forest Inventory to calculate carbon biomass forest sink at operational level. Data from the Second and Third National Forest Inventory (2NFI and 3NFI, respectively), together with biomass equations were used. Total carbon biomass sink was calculated as a balance between carbon dioxide inputs and outputs in forest biomass. Tree growth between 2NFI and 3NFI, new plots and ingrowth (recruitment and upgrowth) biomass were considered as inputs, while forest harvesting and natural mortality were considered as outputs. In 'Páramos y Valles', 2.46 Mg CO 2 ha -1 year -1 was fixed in the tree biomass of forest ecosystems from 2NFI to 3NFI, whereas in the Central Mountain Range the fixation was 0.72 Mg CO 2 ha -1 year -1 in the period between inventories. The balance of CO 2 in the two areas was positive in 3NFI, with more than four million Mg of CO 2 accumulated in 'Páramos y Valles' and more than 72 million Mg of CO 2 fixed in the Central Mountain Range.

The main contribution lies in providing a new approach to environmental efficiency estimation, in which the efficiency estimates quantify the distance from the policy objective of minimum emissions. We are able to examine a very large pool of nations and provide country-wise efficiency estimates. We estimate three econometric models, corresponding with alternative interpretations of the Cancun vision (Conference of the Parties 2011). The models reveal progress in global environmental efficiency during a preceding decade. The estimates indicate vast differences in efficiency levels, and efficiency changes across countries.

Australia has large areas of non-crop land that already produce grasses. However, there is currently no detailed assessment of Australia's grass production potential for bioenergy or carbon management. This paper provides an overview of grass production potential in Australia. Our approach is based on modeling native grass pastures net primary production (NPP) at a broad scale using the AussieGRASS NPP model. We assess the technical production potential of grasses for the whole of Australia; and, after excluding unsuitable production areas examine the bioenergy feedstock potential in seven regions around Australia. The paper identifies areas for grass feedstock production outside existing cropping and hay production areas. The analysis highlights areas of high production in north-east Australia around the Tropic of Capricorn. The non-cleared land in this extensive agricultural zone shows a promising technical production potential (266 Mt y -1) and if 15% of this land's NPP were to be transformed into ethanol, it could replace a significant part (54%) of current Australian petrol demand. We subsequently discuss these modeling results to identify areas for further improvement and future development for this approach that would produce a more robust spatial grass feedstock assessment. The paper investigates only a set of technical constraints for grass production. There will be many other constraints to consider, e.g. competing uses for grass resources from crop and animal production, and conservation needs, which will reduce the possible off-take of grasses for energy. © 2012 Commonwealth of Australia.","Agriculture; Bioelectricity; Biofuel; Carbon mitigation; Emission; Productivity","Agricultural zones; Animal production; Australia; Bio-energy; Biofuel production; Carbon management; Carbon mitigation; Feedstock production; Food crops; Modeling results; Native grass; Net primary production; Production area; Technical constraints; Agriculture; Bioelectric phenomena; Carbon; Crops; Electrophysiology; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Neutron emission; Productivity; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860918263

Two different compositions have been tested, corresponding to air and steam gasification processes (the latter leading to a better quality gas due to its higher CO and H2 concentration and its lower N2 content). The main objectives of the work have been the determination of the flame stability region (placed between the flashback and the blowoff limits) for each producer gas composition, as well as the study of the OH and CH radicals. The combustion experimental tests have been carried out by using an atmospheric burner and a chemiluminescence camera. The results obtained show that producer gas coming from biomass entrained-flow steam gasification seems to be more adequate to be used in combustion systems, since it provides a larger flame stability region, and its blowoff limit for a given relative producer gas/air ratio is higher (which enable to obtained more power). From the study of CH and OH radicals, it can be deduced that it is possible to reduce the nitrogen oxides emissions up to 18.6 and 15.2 % with producer gas from steam gasification and air gasification respectively by using lean mixtures (while keeping the flame stability).© 2012 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

This article presents a first achievement in the domain of electron microscopy. ANalysis of IMages for Automatic Targeting and Extraction of Data in Transmission Electron Microscopy (ANIMATED-TEM) is a software toolbox composed of a set of image analysis algorithms and an examination scenario. Combined with microscope software, it runs all the microscope tasks and manages the exploration strategy of the carbon-coated grids on which the sample of interest (viruses, proteins, bi-dimensional crystal of membrane proteins, etc.) has been deposited. ANIMATED-TEM realizes the automatic examination of biological samples, working at several magnifications without human intervention. Online image analysis of micrographs is an essential part both to extract characteristic data and to manage automation, as interesting regions need to be identified to trigger new acquisitions at higher magnifications. This toolbox has been developed to perform high-throughput screening of 2D-crystallization experiments. It is operational on amicroscope equipped with an automatic grid loading system, allowing the continuous and automatic analysis of up to 96 samples. Intensive testing over a period of several months confirms that ANIMATEDTEM achieves full automation with an efficient target selection and in a suitable computational time. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Automated image acquisition; Fully automated electron microscope; Specimen characterization; Target selection; Transmission electron microscope","Automatic analysis; Biological samples; Carbon-coated grids; Computational time; Exploration strategies; High-throughput screening; Human intervention; Image analysis algorithms; Image interpretation; Loading system; Membrane proteins; Microscope automation; Online image analysis; Software toolbox; Target selection; Transmission electron microscope; Automation; Biological membranes; Loading; Medical applications; Proteins; Transmission electron microscopy; Viruses; Image analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865356823

Consequently, there is value in investigating the connectivity of populations of species inhabiting different environments in order to evaluate dispersal as a potential strategy for persistence in the face of climate change. Here, we begin to investigate the processes that shape genetic variation within American pika populations from the northern periphery of their range, the central Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. At these latitudes, pikas inhabit sharp elevation gradients ranging from sea level to 1500 m, providing an excellent system for studying the effects of local environmental conditions on pika population genetic structure and gene flow. We found low levels of neutral genetic variation compared to previous studies from more southerly latitudes, consistent with the relatively recent post-glacial colonization of the study location. Moreover, significant levels of inbreeding and marked genetic structure were detected within and among sites. Although low levels of recent gene flow were revealed among elevations within a transect, potentially admixed individuals and first generation migrants were identified using discriminant analysis of principal components between populations separated by less than five kilometers at the same elevations. There was no evidence for historical population decline, yet there was signal for recent demographic contractions, possibly resulting from environmental stochasticity. Correlative analyses revealed an association between patterns of genetic variation and annual heat-to-moisture ratio, mean annual precipitation, precipitation as snow and mean maximum summer temperature. Changes in climatic regimes forecasted for the region may thus potentially increase the rate of population extirpation by further reducing dispersal between sites. Consequently, American pika may have to rely on local adaptations or phenotypic plasticity in order to survive predicted climate changes, although additional studies are required to investigate the evolutionary potential of this climate change sensitive species. © 2012 Henry et al.",,"article; climate change; density gradient; ecological genetics; environmental factor; gene control; gene flow; gene structure; genetic variability; glacial period; inbreeding; local adaptation; nonhuman; population dispersal; population distribution; structure analysis; Altitude; Animals; Climate Change; Gene Flow; Genetic Variation; Lagomorpha; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Quality Control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862491843

When the NH 3 molar fraction is increased, XPS measurements reveal the progressive formation of a silicon nitride layer on the target surface, thereby demonstrating a continuous transition to the reactive mode.

Design: Baseline and 17-months follow-up hearing status was examined with pure-tone audiometry, TEOAEs, and DPOAEs. Study sample: A total of 233 noise-exposed employees were measured, while 60 subjects from this group contributed to test-retest reliability measures. Results: Group-averaged changes and individual shifts followed similar patterns: decreases for audiometry at 68 kHz and DPOAE at 1.5 kHz, and enhancements for DPOAE at 3 kHz. TEOAEs showed an overall deterioration while both individual deteriorations and enhancements were larger than chance. DPOAE at 6 kHz showed the largest group-averaged change, while the number of individual shifts was not significant. There were no clear relations between changes in audiometry and changes in OAE. Conclusion: Significant individual OAE changes do not necessarily follow the same pattern as the group-averaged results. This limits the applicability of OAE testing for the monitoring of individual subjects. Furthermore, hearing deterioration might manifest itself in a local enhancement of otoacoustic emissions and not only in the form of decreases in amplitude. © 2012 British Society of Audiology, International Society of Audiology, and Nordic Audiological Society.","Audiogram; Hearing conservation; Monitoring; Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL); Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs); Significant emission shift; Significant threshold shift","adult; article; audiometry; comparative study; human; male; middle aged; noise injury; occupational exposure; standard; Adult; Audiometry; Hearing Loss, Noise-Induced; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Exposure; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859756848

However, city-level assessments are often incapable of producing data at a community or neighborhood level and thus they may heavily underestimate the emissions from new construction. This paper explores the implications of low-energy residential construction as an instrument of climate change mitigation in the built environment and demonstrates why city-level approaches easily fail to identify the significance of the emissions from construction. We employ a hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) approach to demonstrate that, when the temporal allocation of emissions from the construction and use phases is taken into account, construction phase emissions come to have a central role in finding effective GHG mitigation strategies-even when the emissions from all consumption activities during the use phase are included in the assessment. In fact, their role would seem to be so central that new residential construction cannot be utilized as an instrument of city carbon management, even over a relatively long period.

Two major reasons why this may be true are that the poor experience higher levels of exposure to air pollution, and they are more vulnerable to its effects--in other words, due to poorer nutrition, less access to medical care, and other factors, they experience more health impact per unit of exposure. The relations among health, air pollution, and poverty are likely to have important implications for public health and social policy, especially in areas such as the developing countries of Asia where air pollution levels are high and many live in poverty. The aims of this study were to estimate the effect of exposure to air pollution on hospital admissions of young children for acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI*) and to explore whether such effects differed between poor children and other children. ALRI, which comprises pneumonia and bronchiolitis, is the largest single cause of mortality among young children worldwide and is responsible for a substantial burden of disease among young children in developing countries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the health effects of air pollution in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), Vietnam. For these reasons, the results of this study have the potential to make an important contribution to the growing literature on the health effects of air pollution in Asia. The study focused on the short-term effects of daily average exposure to air pollutants on hospital admissions of children less than 5 years of age for ALRI, defined as pneumonia or bronchiolitis, in HCMC during 2003, 2004, and 2005. Admissions data were obtained from computerized records of Children's Hospital 1 and Children's Hospital 2 (CH1 and CH2) in HCMC. Nearly all children hospitalized for respiratory illnesses in the city are admitted to one of these two pediatric hospitals. Daily citywide 24-hour average concentrations of particulate matter (PM) < or =10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) and 8-hour maximum average concentrations of ozone (O3) were estimated from the HCMC Environmental Protection Agency (HEPA) ambient air quality monitoring network. Daily meteorologic information including temperature and relative humidity were collected from KTTV NB, the Southern Regional Hydro-Meteorological Center. An individual-level indicator of socioeconomic position (SEP) was based on the degree to which the patient was exempt from payment according to hospital financial records. A group-level indicator of SEP was based on estimates of poverty prevalence in the districts of HCMC in 2004, obtained from a poverty mapping project of the Institute of Economic Research in HCMC, in collaboration with the General Statistics Office of Vietnam and the World Bank. Poverty prevalence was defined using the poverty line set by the People's Committee of HCMC of 6 million Vietnamese dong (VND) annual income. Quartiles of district-level poverty prevalence were created based on poverty prevalence estimates for each district. Analyses were conducted using both time-series and case-crossover approaches. In the absence of measurement error, confounding, and other sources of bias, the two approaches were expected to provide estimates that differed only with regard to precision. For the time-series analyses, the unit of observation was daily counts of hospital admissions for ALRI. Poisson regression with smoothing functions for meteorologic variables and variables for seasonal and long-term trends was used. Case-crossover analyses were conducted using time-stratified selection of controls. Control days were every 7th day from the date of admission within the same month as admission. Large seasonal differences were observed in pollutant levels and hospital admission patterns during the investigation period for HCMC. Of the 15,717 ALRI admissions occurring within the study period, 60% occurred in the rainy season (May through October), with a peak in these admissions during July and August of each year. Average daily concentrations for PM10, O3, NO2, and SO2 were 73, 75, 22, and 22 microg/m3, respectively, with higher pollutant concentrations observed in the dry season (November through April) compared with the rainy season. As the time between onset of illness and hospital admission was thought to range from 1 to 6 days, it was not possible to specify a priori a single-day lag. We assessed results for single-day lags from lag 0 to lag 10, but emphasize results for an average of lag 1-6, since this best reflects the case reference period. Results were robust to differences in temperature lags with lag 0 and the average lag (1-6 days); results for lag 0 for temperature are presented. Results differed markedly when analyses were stratified by season, rather than simply adjusted for season. ALRI admissions were generally positively associated with ambient levels of PM10, NO2, and SO2 during the dry season (November-April), but not the rainy season (May-October). Positive associations between O3 and ALRI admissions were not observed in either season. We do not believe that exposure to air pollution could reduce the risk of ALRI in the rainy season and infer that these results could be driven by residual confounding present within the rainy season. The much lower correlation between NO2 and PM10 levels during the rainy season provides further evidence that these pollutants may not be accurate indicators of exposure to air pollution from combustion processes in the rainy season. Results were generally consistent across time-series and case-crossover analyses. In the dry season, risks for ALRI hospital admissions with average pollutant lag (1-6 days) were highest for NO2 and SO2 in the single-pollutant case-crossover analyses, with excess risks of 8.50% (95% CI, 0.80-16.79) and 5.85% (95% CI, 0.44-11.55) observed, respectively. NO2 and SO2 effects remained higher than PM10 effects in both the single-pollutant and two-pollutant models. The two-pollutant model indicated that NO2 confounded the PM10 and SO2 effects. For example, PM10 was weakly associated with an excess risk in the dry season of 1.25% (95% CI, -0.55 to 3.09); after adjusting for SO2 and O3, the risk estimate was reduced but remained elevated, with much wider confidence intervals; after adjusting for NO2, an excess risk was no longer observed. Though the effects seem to be driven by NO2, the statistical limitations of adequately addressing collinearity, given the high correlation between PM10 and NO2 (r = 0.78), limited our ability to clearly distinguish between PM10 and NO2 effects. In the rainy season, negative associations between PM10 and ALRI admissions were observed. No association with O3 was observed in the single-pollutant model, but O3 exposure was negatively associated with ALRI admissions in the two-pollutant model.",,"acute disease; air pollution; article; bronchiolitis; case control study; clinical trial; crossover procedure; environmental exposure; female; hospital; hospital admission; human; infant; male; multicenter study; newborn; pneumonia; poverty; preschool child; regression analysis; risk factor; season; statistics; Viet Nam; Acute Disease; Air Pollution; Bronchiolitis; Case-Control Studies; Child, Preschool; Cross-Over Studies; Environmental Exposure; Female; Hospitals, Pediatric; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Patient Admission; Pneumonia; Poverty; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; Seasons; Vietnam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865357172

As co-facilitators of this process based in a Northern research institution, we reflect upon the challenges, limitations and benefits of the approach used in order to identify potential areas for improvement and to understand how the dynamics of this partnership shaped collaboration. We also discuss how employing a systemic approach to action research helped to provide insights into the interactions between the physical and environmental impacts of climate change and related systems such as land tenure and agricultural production. A systemic approach to PAR, we argue, lends itself especially well to analysis of climate change adaptation and resilience, both of which are embedded within complex systems of institutions, assets, individuals and structures, and therefore not appropriate for narrow or one-dimensional analyses.

A parameterization of the simulation results is presented that provides approximations of both low-penetration carbon abatement rates and maximum carbon abatement potentials based on the temporal characteristics of the resource and the load. The results suggest that shallow carbon emissions reductions (up to 20% of the base case) can be achieved most efficiently with geothermal power and demand reductions via energy efficiency or conservation. Deep emissions reductions (up to 89% for this closed system), however, may require the build-out of very large fleets of intermittent renewables and improved power system flexibility, communications, and controls. At very high penetrations, combining wind and solar power improved renewable portfolio performance over individual build-out scenarios by reducing curtailment, suggesting that further reductions may be met by importing uncorrelated out-of-state renewable power.

Mineral components were enriched from bulk environmental samples by magnetic susceptibility or density separation techniques and used in subsequent molecular and microscopic analyses. Testing and optimization of the method was performed on geochemically-distinct sediment horizons from Eel River Basin methane seeps and pyrite and sphalerite-rich hydrothermal vent samples from the Lau Basin. Initial results show reproducible variations in microbial diversity between mineral fractions from marine sedimentary environments enriched in authigenic pyrite and/or transition metal-bearing clay minerals. Specifically, different archaeal clades associated with the anaerobic oxidation of methane and putative sulfate-reducing deltaproteobbacteria show preferential colonization patterns, suggesting potential ecophysiological differences between closely-related taxa. These results indicate that mineral colonization may influence the extent and distribution of microbial diversity throughout unconsolidated sediments of the marine subsurface. The combination of mineral separation and molecular analyses introduced here provide a new approach for revealing previously concealed patterns of mineral-associated microbial diversity across a wide range of environments, from hard rock habitats to fine-grained lithologies. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","hydrothermal vent; methane oxidation; mineral separation; sulfate reduction; sulfide mineralogy","biogeochemistry; clay mineral; colonization; hard rock; hydrothermal vent; magnetic susceptibility; microscopy; mineralogy; molecular analysis; optimization; sediment chemistry; separation; species diversity; sulfate-reducing bacterium; sulfide group; testing method; California; Eel Basin; United States; Archaea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859206556

Consequently, the 2010 United Nations International Standard for Determining Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Cities promotes a ""harmonized protocol for quantifying the GHG emissions attributable to cities and local regions."" The UN's common standard has important implications for comparison, benchmarking and policy assessment related to energy policies. This paper uses Hong Kong as a case study to illustrate these implications. Hong Kong's per capita contribution to GHG emissions are among the highest in the world, yet the local government's official statistics indicate emissions that are far below those reported by most affluent economies. This discrepancy arises from a reporting methodology that does not require inclusion of GHG emissions linked to consumption of imported goods or emissions from aviation and shipping. The Hong Kong case reveals that current inventories do not provide sufficient information to guide policymaking related to energy and climate change. They also do not provide adequate information for comparing policies of cities internationally.

Exposure scenarios are used to evaluate the degree of environmental contact experienced by people with different patterns of lifestyle activities, such as residence, recreation, or work. In 1994, U.S. President Bill Clinton's Executive Order 12898 recognized that disproportionately high exposures could be incurred by people with traditional subsistence lifestyles because of their more intensive contact with natural resources. Since then, we have developed several tribal exposure scenarios that reflect tribal-specific traditional lifeways. These scenarios are not necessarily intended to capture contemporary resource patterns, but to describe how the resources were used before contamination or degradation, and will be used once again in fully traditional ways after cleanup and restoration. The direct exposure factors for inhalation and soil ingestion rates are the same in each tribal scenario, but the diets are unique to each tribe and its local ecology, natural foods, and traditional practices. Scenarios, in part or in whole, also have other applications, such as developing environmental standards, evaluating disproportionate exposures, developing sampling plans, planning for climate change, or evaluating service flows as part of natural resource damage assessments. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","exposure scenarios; subsistence lifestyles; Superfund; traditional tribal practices; tribal risk assessment; tribal subsistence exposures",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863854986

It has been already reported that by changing the fuel from conventional EN590 diesel to HVO decreases exhaust emissions. However, as the fuels have certain chemical and physical differences, it is clear that the full advantage of HVO cannot be realized unless the engine is optimized for the new fuel. In this article, we studied how much exhaust emissions can be reduced by adjusting engine parameters for HVO. The results indicate that, with all the studied loads (50%, 75%, and 100%), particulate mass and NOx can both be reduced over 25% by engine parameter adjustments. Further, the emission reduction was even higher when the target for adjusting engine parameters was to exclusively reduce either particulates or NOx. In addition to particulate mass, different indicators of particulate emissions were also compared. These indicators included filter smoke number (FSN), total particle number, total particle surface area, and geometric mean diameter of the emitted particle size distribution. As a result of this comparison, a linear correlation between FSN and total particulate surface area at low FSN region was found. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Emission reduction; Engine parameter; Exhaust emission; Filter smoke numbers; Geometric mean; Linear correlation; Particle numbers; Particle surface area; Particulate mass; Surface area; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Emission control; Engines; Particle size analysis; Vegetable oils; Fuels; fuel; hydrotreated vegetable oil; nitric oxide; unclassified drug; vegetable oil; biofuel; diesel engine; emission control; exhaust emission; physicochemical property; reduction; size distribution; smoke; surface area; vegetable oil; article; diesel engine; particle size; Biofuels; Filtration; Gasoline; Motor Vehicles; Nitrates; Nitrites; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Plant Oils; Vehicle Emissions; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861889757

The microbes receiving 13C from the plant were assessed through RNA/phospholipid fatty acid analysis with stable isotope probing (PLFA-SIP) at three time-points (1, 5 and 12d after the start of labeling). The communities of Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Glomeromycota were analysed separately with RT-qPCR and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP). Ascomycetes and glomeromycetes received carbon from the plant as early as 1 and 5d after labeling, while basidiomycetes were slower in accumulating the labeled carbon. The rate of carbon allocation in the GM variety differed from that in its parental variety, thereby affecting soil fungal communities. We conclude that both saprotrophic and mycorrhizal fungi rapidly metabolize organic substrates flowing from the root into the rhizosphere, that there are large differences in utilization of root-derived compounds at a lower phylogenetic level within investigated fungal phyla, and that active communities in the rhizosphere differ between the GM plant and its parental cultivar through effects of differential carbon flow from the plant. © 2012 The Authors.

The study provides in-depth analyses of technological mitigation potentials and costs by sector and analyzes marginal abatement cost (MAC) curves from 0 to 200 US $/tCO 2 eq in major countries. An advantage of this study is that the technological feasibility of reducing GHG emissions is identified explicitly through looking at distinct technological options. However, the results of MAC curves using the bottom-up approach vary widely according to region and model due to the various differing assumptions. Thus, this study focuses on some comparable variables in order to analyze the differences between MAC curves. For example, reduction ratios relative to 2005 in Annex I range from 9 % to 31 % and 17 % to 34 % at 50 US $/tCO 2 eq in 2020 and 2030, respectively. In China and India, results of GHG emissions relative to 2005 vary very widely due to the difference in baseline emissions as well as the diffusion rate of mitigation technologies. Future portfolios of advanced technologies and energy resources, especially nuclear and renewable energies, are the most prominent reasons for the difference in MAC curves. Transitions toward a low-carbon society are not in line with current trends, and will require drastic GHG reductions, hence it is important to discuss how to overcome various existing barriers such as energy security constraints and technological restrictions. © 2012 The Author(s).","Bottom-up analysis; Low-carbon transition; Marginal abatement cost; Model comparison; Technological mitigation potential",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863316280

To understand the potential effects of various environmental constraints on the evolution of chlorophototrophy better, we studied the distribution, diversity, and abundance of chlorophylls and genes involved in their synthesis along geothermal gradients in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis were constrained to temperatures of less than ~70°C and were only detected at this elevated temperature when the pH was in the circumneutral to alkaline range. The upper temperature limit for the detection of chlL/bchL and bchY decreased systematically with increasingly acidic pH, an observation likely attributable to sulfide, which upon oxidation, generates acidic spring water and reduces the availability of bicarbonate the preferred source of inorganic carbon for phototrophs. Spring pH was also the best predictor of the phylogenetic diversity of chlL/bchL communities. The phylogenetic similarity of chlL/bchL genes between sites was significantly correlated with that of chlorophylls. The predominance of chlorophyll a and bacteriochlorophyll a among extracted pigments was consistent with predominance of chlL/bchL genes affiliated with the Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexiales, respectively, and might be related to the fact that the majority of these organisms are photoautotrophs. Together, these results suggest that a combination of temperature, pH, and/or sulfide influences the distribution, diversity, and evolution of chlorophotrophs and the chlorophylls that they synthesize. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"bacterial DNA; bacterial protein; chlL protein, bacteria; chlorophyll; ribosome DNA; RNA 16S; bacterium; bicarbonate; carbon dioxide; carbon fixation; chlorophyll; community composition; environmental conditions; evolutionary biology; geomicrobiology; geothermal gradient; national park; pH; photoautotrophy; phylogenetics; population distribution; sulfide; temperature effect; article; bacterial gene; biodiversity; chemistry; classification; cluster analysis; cyanobacterium; DNA sequence; energy metabolism; genetic variability; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; pH; phototrophy; phylogeny; physiology; thermal spring; United States; Bacterial Proteins; Biodiversity; Chlorophyll; Cluster Analysis; Cyanobacteria; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Energy Metabolism; Genes, Bacterial; Genetic Variation; Hot Springs; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Molecular Sequence Data; Phototrophic Processes; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Wyoming; United States; Wyoming; Yellowstone National Park; Cyanobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859441336

Combustion of regionally available material such as wood is considered a carbon-neutral alternative for oil and gas, but unregulated revival of wood stoves may cause detrimental health effects. For the prognosis of the health impact of air pollution due to the use of wood stoves, Upper Austria served for a case study. On the basis of recent measurements of particulate matter &lt;10 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and nitrous gases (NO x), we compared the air pollution attributable to present energy mix (termed scenario 1) with two alternatives: For scenario 2, we assumed replacement of light fuel oil by either fossil gas or biomass, and for scenario 3, replacement of light fuel oil by biomass only. Compared with the current exposure from scenario 1, the increased annual mean PM10 levels are estimated to lead to 101 (95% CI 56;146) and 174 (95% CI 92;257) additional deaths among 1.4 million inhabitants per year for scenarios 2 and 3, respectively.

In China, agricultural waste products, particularly manure from animal husbandry, represent a local source of rural energy, which can possibly be utilised through simple biogas digesters, thereby promoting rural development. For at least 50 years China has promoted this among farmers' not only with the goal of providing local clean energy for rural development, but also to improve health and reduce pressure on fuelwood. Until the early 2000s these policies failed or had limited impact, although substantial subsidy-based programmes in the past decade have led to considerable growth. However, our field trip interviews suggest that this growth hides deep-rooted problems. For biogas to fulfil its potential, it is crucial that the policy adapts to the changing realities of Chinese livestock production. Arguably, policies to promote rural biogas combine development goals with mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in a way that matches well with an SD-PAM mechanism. There are two main ways in which China could benefit from submitting its rural biogas policies to an SD-PAM-based regime. Such a biogas programme could get access to technology and funding for large-scale biogas systems and/or opportunities to sell credits. However, it would need to adapt to the international requirements and to accept international monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV).

Two heavy-duty engines, a 2006 engine with no exhaust aftertreatment, and a 2007 engine with a diesel particle filter (DPF), were tested on an engine dynamometer over four different test cycles. Emissions from soy- and animal-based biodiesels, a hydrotreated renewable diesel, and a gas to liquid (GTL) fuel were evaluated at blend levels from 5 to 100%. NOx emissions consistently increased with increasing biodiesel blend level, while increasing renewable diesel and GTL blends showed NOx emissions reductions with blend level. NO x increases ranged from 1.5% to 6.9% for B20, 6.4% to 18.2% for B50, and 14.1% to 47.1% for B100. The soy-biodiesel showed higher NOx emissions increases compared to the animal-biodiesel. NOx emissions neutrality with the CARB diesel was achieved by blending GTL or renewable diesel fuels with various levels of biodiesel or by using di-tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP). It appears that the impact of biodiesel on NOx emissions might be a more important consideration when blended with CARB diesel or similar fuels, and that some form of NOx mitigation might be needed for biodiesel blends with such fuels. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Biodiesel blends; California Air Resources Board; Di-tert butyl peroxide; Diesel particles; Emissions reduction; Exhaust aftertreatment; Gas to liquids; Heavy duty engines; Renewable diesels; Second generation; Test cycles; Animals; Blending; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Engines; Fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Biodiesel; biodiesel; biofuel; diesel fuel; nitrogen oxide; atmospheric pollution; biofuel; diesel engine; emission inventory; exhaust emission; mitigation; nitrogen oxides; renewable resource; animal; article; diesel engine; diesel particle filter; dynamometer; exhaust gas; filter; gas; gas to liquid fuel; human; liquid; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; renewable energy; soybean; Biofuels; California; Nitrogen Oxides; California; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865503234

If we fail to regulate greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, or use alternative strategies for addressing the problem, the damages could be significant, and perhaps catastrophic. After several international meetings in which nation states have tried unsuccessfully to address the climate change problem, there is a widespread sense of frustration and urgency: frustration at the slow pace at which countries are moving toward an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; urgency because of the growing evidence that climate change is a serious problem that should be addressed globally and quickly. The aim of this book is to take a close look at the fundamental political and economic processes driving climate change policy. It identifies institutional arrangements and policies that are needed to design more effective climate change policy. The book also examines ethical and distributional arguments that are critical in understanding and framing the climate debate. The book is built around a conference honouring Tom Schelling that took place at the Sustainable Consumption Institute at The University of Manchester in October 2010.

This claim is not just a question of working on urgent and relevant questions. This claim calls for new approaches in science. According to the proverb 'The world has problems, universities have faculties' - we have to overcome traditional boundaries of disciplines. Moreover we have to transgress the confinement to the ivory tower and invite the persons affected and potential future multipliers into the process of research. This need for transdisciplinary research and both its opportunities and challenges will be highlighted by introducing a holistic biochar approach for smallholder farmers in East Africa. Two decades after the re-discovery and scientific description of the extremely fertile and long-term carbon storing Amazonian Dark Earths, there seems to be a 'black gold rush'. Charcoal used as a soil amendment (biochar) might reproduce such soils. Small scale biochar production and its application to the soil offer opportunities for improvement of both human health and soil properties and for food security, climate change adaptation and mitigation especially in East Africa. But still these sound pre-conditions and even excellence in science do not guarantee success in terms of a benefit for farmers. A lot of work needs to be done to transform those multiple chances into a true solution. It will require a transdisciplinary and interactive form of development cooperation and research - a true cooperation between local farmers, organizations and willing researchers. © 2012 Wageningen Academic Publishers.

This offers an opportunity for an intensive clonal forestry system that closely emulates the natural life history of the species. In this paper, we assess the potential of genetic tree improvement and clonal deployment to enhance the productivity of aspen forests in Alberta. We further investigate geographic patterns of genetic variation in aspen and infer forest management strategies under uncertain future climates. Methodology/Principal Findings: Genetic variation among 242 clones from Alberta was evaluated in 13 common garden trials after 5-8 growing seasons in the field. Broad-sense heritabilities for height and diameter at breast height (DBH) ranged from 0.36 to 0.64, allowing 5-15% genetic gains in height and 9-34% genetic gains in DBH. Geographic partitioning of genetic variance revealed predominant latitudinal genetic differentiation. We further observed that northward movement of clones almost always resulted in increased growth relative to local planting material, while southward movement had a strong opposite effect. Conclusion/Significance: Aspen forests are an important natural resource in western Canada that is used for pulp and oriented strandboard production, accounting for~40% of the total forest harvest. Moderate to high broad-sense heritabilities in growth traits suggest good potential for a genetic tree improvement program with aspen. Significant productivity gains appear possible through clonal selection from existing trials. We propose two breeding regions for Alberta, and suggest that well-tested southern clones may be used in the northern breeding region, accounting for a general warming trend observed over the last several decades in Alberta. © 2012 Gylander et al.",,"agronomic trait; article; aspen; Canada; clonal forestry; clonal species; controlled study; forest management; forestry; genetic gain; genetic improvement; genetic selection; genetic variability; geographic distribution; harvest; heritability; nonhuman; plant breeding; plant height; productivity; pulp processing; tree growth; Alberta; Breeding; Forestry; Genetic Variation; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Populus; Regression Analysis; Selection, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865603454

This raises a number of ethical challenges. This paper, hence, addresses the question: 'What are the normative challenges at global level in the context of climate change, water, and forests and what does this imply for food?' This question is addressed through short case studies on the climate change negotiations, water negotiations, and forest negotiations which discuss the link of each with food, the key ethical issues involved, the state of current governance, and draws inferences for the food regime. It argues that the existing inequities in the food regime globally and locally will be exacerbated by the impacts of climate change, water and forest governance on agricultural productivity. This may, to some extent, be resolved through advances in technological knowledge; but such advances may not necessarily address the distribution problem which is at the heart of normative challenges. The paper argues that one way to try and solve these distributional problems globally, is to promote the adoption of a global constitution and the rule of law. © 2012 Wageningen Academic Publishers.

The multiple artificial neural networks (ANN) training with the data yielded a model for predicting the NO2 concentrations. In addition, the ANN made the measurement of the effect of ITS on NO2 concentrations in ambient air possible. Data pertaining to 59 U.S. cities (urbanized area) were used for this work. Input variables used were related to transportation, local characteristics, and ITS applications. Output variable was the annual average concentration of NO2 in ambient air. The K-fold cross-validation technique was used to train the ANN. There was an unusual finding: in contrast to the common assumptions, NO2 concentration increased with ITS intensity and that may be suggestive of causing conformity problems and may jeopardize the ITS project and the transportation program. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Air quality; ANN; Conformity; Data; EPA; Highway; ITS; Modeling; NO2; Non-attainment area; Regression; Training; VOCs","ANN; Conformity; Data; EPA; Highway; ITS; Non-attainment; Regression; VOCs; Air quality; Intelligent systems; Models; Neural networks; Nitrogen compounds; Personnel training; Nitrogen oxides; air quality; artificial neural network; intelligent transportation system; modeling; nitrogen dioxide; traffic emission; volatile organic compound; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861884727

In this report, we show that the ketoglutarate transport protein (KgtP) is secreted in an HpaB-independent manner through the T3SS of X. oryzae pv. oryzae PXO99A and localizes to the host cell membrane for α-ketoglutaric acid export. kgtP contained an imperfect PIP box (plant-inducible promoter) in the promoter region and was positively regulated by HrpX and HrpG. A kgtP deletion mutant was impaired in bacterial virulence and growth in planta; furthermore, the mutant showed reduced growth in minimal media containing α-ketoglutaric acid or sodium succinate as the sole carbon source. The reduced virulence and the deficiency in α-ketoglutaric acid utilization by the kgtP mutant were restored to wild-type levels by the presence of kgtP in trans. The expression of OsIDH, which is responsible for the synthesis of α-ketoglutaric acid in rice, was enhanced when KgtP was present in the pathogen.

According to recent estimates by various governmental agencies and climate researchers, the global sea level rise is likely to be between 0.6 and 2.1m by the year 2100. South Florida is a coastal community and much of its coastline is subject to sea level rise and potential impacts to wetlands and the water resources of the area. To understand what the impact of sea level rise would cause to the groundwater level and salinity intrusion, an integrated groundwater and surface water model was developed for North Miami-Dade and Broward Counties of South Florida. The model was calibrated against daily groundwater heads, base flows in canals, and chloride concentrations for a period of one year and six months. Three separate sensitivity analyses were conducted by increasing the sea level by 0.6, 0.9, and 1.22m. Results of the simulations shows increase of groundwater heads in some areas from 4 to 15%; whereas the average relative chloride concentrations increased significantly by 100-600% in some wells. The increase in groundwater elevations and chloride concentrations varies from location of the wells and its proximity to the coast. The model results indicate that even a 0.6m increase in sea level (which is the conservative estimate) is likely to impair the vital freshwater resources in many parts of South Florida. © 2012 American Water Resources Association.","Biscayne aquifer; Coastal aquifers; Density dependent model; Salt water intrusion; Sea level rise; Well field impacts","Baseflows; Broward County; Chloride concentrations; Coastal aquifers; Coastal communities; Density dependent; Fresh water resources; Global sea level rise; Governmental agency; Groundwater elevations; Groundwater heads; Model results; Potential impacts; Salinity intrusion; Sea level rise; South Florida; Aquifers; Chlorine compounds; Groundwater flow; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Salinity measurement; Salt water intrusion; Water; Wells; Sea level; baseflow; calibration; chloride; coastal aquifer; coastal zone; groundwater resource; groundwater-seawater interaction; hydraulic head; hydrological modeling; integrated approach; saline intrusion; salinity; sea level change; sensitivity analysis; water level; water quality; water resource; well water; Broward County; Florida [United States]; Miami-Dade County; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861788888

This research article provides stem volume and biomass equations applicable to five tree species, namely Afzelia africana Sm. (Caesalpiniaceae), Anogeissus leiocarpa (DC.) Guill. and Perr. (Combretaceae), Ceiba pentandra (L.) Gaertn. (Bombacaceae), Dialium guineense Willd. (Caesalpiniaceae), Diospyros mespiliformis Hochst. ex A.DC. (Ebenaceae) in natural protected tropical forests and, in addition, Tectona grandis L.f. (Verbenaceae) in plantations. In addition to the tree species specific equations, basic wood density, as well as carbon, nitrogen, organic matter and ash content were determined for these tree species in tropical conditions in West Africa. One hundred and sixty-two sample trees were measured through non-destructive sampling and analysed for volume and biomass. Stem biomass and stem volume were modelled as a function of diameter (at breast height; Dbh) and stem height (height to the crown base). Logarithmic models are presented that utilise Dbh and height data to predict tree component biomass and stem volumes. Alternative models are given that afford prediction based on Dbh data alone, assuming height data to be unavailable. Models that include height are preferred, having better predictive capabilities. Ranges in carbon, nitrogen and ash contents are given as well. The successful development of predictive models through the use of non-destructive methods in this study provide valuable data and tools for use in determining the contribution of these major African rainforest tree species to global carbon stocks, while ensuring the preservation of this valued African resource. This study needs to be expanded to further regions and tree species to complete a full inventory of all tree species, emphasising the relevance of African trees to carbon stocks at a global scale. © 2012 Copyright NISC (Pty) Ltd.","Afzelia africana; Anogeissus leiocarpa; Ceiba pentandra; Dialium guineense; Diospyros mespiliformis; greenhouse gas inventory; non-destructive sampling; stem biomass; Tectona grandis; wood C/N ratio; wood density","Afzelia africana; Anogeissus leiocarpa; Caesalpinioideae; Ceiba pentandra; Combretaceae; Dialium guineense; Diospyros; Diospyros mespiliformis; Ebenaceae; Malvaceae; Tectona grandis; Verbenaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864018403

The massive reconstruction provides a good opportunity for Guangyuan city to response to the National Council's call for tackling climate change by developing a harmonised and low-carbon economy. However, there are many arguments about the definition of 'low carbon' and the framework that low-carbon development should follow. Low-carbon development in an economically least developed region such as Guangyuan would provide evidence and contribute to the discussion. The paper employs CO 2 emissions as an environmental indicator in scenario analysis to investigate Guangyuan's future carbon performance in following the national call of reducing 40% of carbon intensity by 2020 and an alternative low-carbon development path. The results have demonstrated that a 'win-win' solution can be reached-keeping rapid economic growth while reducing CO 2 emissions, however, only by addressing the 'correct' determining factors. Technology improvements and production structure changes have been identified as the key determining factors to affect both carbon intensity and CO 2 emissions in the future. The two factors are also interdependent. Governmental policies should give appropriate guideline to address both factors but with strong emphasis on production structure decarbonisation in order to avoid the mistake of 'polluting first and deal with the pollution later' during the emission-intensive industrialisation processes that many western countries and China's coastal regions have followed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon intensity; China; CO 2 emission; Low-carbon development","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; earthquake damage; economic growth; environmental economics; future prospect; guideline; industrialization; policy approach; sustainable development; China; Guangyuan; Sichuan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860882874

Many of the species and ecosystems these plans were designed to conserve are now being affected by climate change, and there is a critical need to incorporate new and complementary approaches into these plans that will aid species and ecosystems in adjusting to potential climate change impacts. We propose five approaches to climate change adaptation that can be integrated into existing or new biodiversity conservation plans: (1) conserving the geophysical stage, (2) protecting climatic refugia, (3) enhancing regional connectivity, (4) sustaining ecosystem process and function, and (5) capitalizing on opportunities emerging in response to climate change. We discuss both key assumptions behind each approach and the trade-offs involved in using the approach for conservation planning. We also summarize additional data beyond those typically used in systematic conservation plans required to implement these approaches. A major strength of these approaches is that they are largely robust to the uncertainty in how climate impacts may manifest in any given region. © 2012 The Author(s).","Climate change adaptation; Climate refugia; Connectivity; Ecosystem function and process; Geophysical stage","biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; connectivity; conservation planning; ecosystem function; habitat conservation; nongovernmental organization; refugium; taxonomy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861757112

Targeting supply chain points and replacing disposable with reusable items are among recommendations to achieve this. Annually, US hospitals use 35 million disposable (DSC) or reusable sharps containers (RSC) generating GHG in their manufacture, use, and disposal. Using a life cycle assessment we assessed the global warming potential (GWP) of both systems at a large US hospital which replaced DSC with RSC. GHG emissions (CO 2, CH 4, N 2O) were calculated in metric tons of CO 2 equivalents (MTCO 2eq). Primary energy input data was used wherever possible and region-specific conversions used to calculate the GWP of each activity. Unit process GHGs were collated into manufacture, transport, washing, and treatment and disposal. The DSC were not recycled nor had recycled content. Chemotherapy DSC were used in both systems. Emission totals were workload-normalized per 100 occupied beds-yr and rate ratio analyzed using Fisher's test with P ≤0.05 and 95% confidence level. With RSC, the hospital reduced its annual GWP by 127 MTCO 2eq (-83.5%) and diverted 30.9 tons of plastic and 5.0 tons of cardboard from landfill. Using RSC reduced the number of containers manufactured from 34,396 DSC annually to 1844 RSC in year one only. The study indicates sharps containment GWP in US hospitals totals 100,000 MTCO 2eq and if RSC were used nationally the figure could fall by 64,000 MTCO2eq which, whilst only a fraction of total hospital GWP, is a positive, sustainable step. © The Author(s) 2012.","carbon footprint; global warming potential; greenhouse gases; hospital; life cycle assessment; reusable; Sharps containers; Sharpsmart; sustainable","Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); reusable; Sharpsmart; sustainable; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Chemotherapy; Containers; Global warming; Hospitals; Life cycle; Manufacture; Recycling; Supply chains; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; polypropylene; carbon emission; ecological footprint; global warming; greenhouse gas; hospital sector; landfill; life cycle analysis; recycling; sustainable development; waste disposal; article; carbon footprint; disposable equipment; environmental sustainability; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; hospital; hospital equipment; landfill; life cycle assessment; needle; priority journal; reusable equipment; sharps container; United States; waste management; Carbon Dioxide; Disposable Equipment; Equipment Reuse; Maintenance and Engineering, Hospital; Needles; United States; Waste Management; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862256408

The combination of coarse sand, fine sand, silt, and clay in soil determines its textural classification. This study used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and regression-tree modeling to precisely quantify the relationships between the soil texture fractions and different environmental parameters on a national scale, and to detect the most important parameters that can be used as weighted input data in soil environmental prediction models. Seven primary terrain parameters (elevation, slope gradient, slope aspect, plan curvature, profile curvature, flow direction, flow accumulation) and one compound topographic index (CTI) were generated from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) acquired using airborne LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) systems. They were used along with digital data collected from other sources (existing maps and available pluviometric stations), i.e. parent materials, landscape types, geographic regions, yearly precipitation, seasonal precipitation to statistically explain soil texture fractions field/laboratory measurements (45,224 sampling sites) in the area of interest (Denmark). The developed strongest relationships were associated with clay and silt, variance being equal to 60%, followed by coarse sand (54.5%) and fine sand (52%) as the weakest relationship. This study also showed that parent materials (with a relative importance varying between 47% and 100%), geographic regions (31-100%) and landscape types (68-100%) considerably influenced all soil texture fractions, which is not the case for climate and DEM parameters. Yearly and seasonal precipitation had a significant impact on clay and silt; elevation had higher influence on coarse sand (13%), fine sand (12%) and clay (10%) where; slope gradient influenced silt (11.5%); slope aspect (14%) and CTI (9%) influenced fine sand; and profile/plan curvatures and flow direction/ accumulation did not interfere in the building of the soil texture regression trees and associated relationships. The latter can be extrapolated to other areas sharing similar geo-environmental conditions. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

This body of evidence, it is claimed by the majority of scientists and politicians, is needed to understand how to protect the world from potential harms. However, there remains a minority of scientists and politicians who claim that there is no evidence for the human causation of global warming. This minority, the so-called climate change deniers, believes that policies to reduce emissions of climate-altering gases will have a devastating effect on jobs and the overall economy. In their attacks on these views of the climate change deniers, the majority not only blames them for an outright distortion of climate change science, but also claim that disinformation about the state of climate change science is extraordinarily morally reprehensible. Their argument is that climate change denial will lead to non-action in reducing climate change's threat and will cause severe consequences for the poorest people in the world.

The study area is across the western High Plains states east of the Rocky Mountains in an area which has a proven wind power resource. Policies and economic analyses involving the rapidly expanding wind power industry have often assumed a constant in the wind resource; however, any temporal pattern or trend in wind speeds can have a meaningful impact on the reliability of wind power as an energy resource. Using data provided by the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP) to analyze decadal and seasonal trends of wind data, this study shows that from 1971 to 2000 there were some notable changes in the NARCCAP simulated wind velocities over the study region. Wind speed trends across the central High Plains of the USA were most notable across the western portion of the study area along the higher terrain near the front range of the Rocky Mountains. The most significant changes occurred during winter and spring when a large portion of the study area experienced the most substantial decrease in wind speed, with a 20% reduction in wind power density during spring across the western portion of the study area. During summer and fall, the trends are less noticeable, with only very small changes in the summer. Fall was the only season that saw widespread increased values of wind power density from the 1970s to 1990s, with increases of nearly 10% in some southern areas of the study area. Based upon the analysis of the data and previous literature, it is theorized that these changes could be the result of changing synoptic patterns across the study region. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",,"alternative energy; decadal variation; seasonal variation; wind power; wind velocity; Great Plains; Rocky Mountains; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864436555

These results represent important step toward mass production of bioethanol in Serbian factories. The main goals of introducing the concept of sugar and bioethanol coproduction would be efficient use of available resources for the production of energy, reduction of greenhouse gases emission, decreased dependence on import and creation of new jobs. Besides that, it would provide flexibility in terms of variation of produced quantities of sugar and ethanol, depending on the conditions prevailing on the market. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

What is less clear is whether air pollution can contribute to the initiation of new cases of asthma. Mechanistic evidence from toxicological studies, together with recent information on genes that predispose towards the development of asthma, suggests that this is biologically plausible, particularly in the light of the current understanding of asthma as a complex disease with a variety of phenotypes. The epidemiological evidence for associations between ambient levels of air pollutants and asthma prevalence at a whole community level is unconvincing; meta-analysis confirms a lack of association. In contrast, a meta-analysis of cohort studies found an association between asthma incidence and within-community variations in air pollution (largely traffic dominated). Similarly, a systematic review suggests an association of asthma prevalence with exposure to traffic, although only in those living very close to heavily trafficked roads carrying a lot of trucks. Based on this evidence, the UK's Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants recently concluded that, overall, the evidence is consistent with the possibility that outdoor air pollution might play a role in causing asthma in susceptible individuals living very close to busy roads carrying a lot of truck traffic. Nonetheless, the effect on public health is unlikely to be large: air pollutants are likely to make only a small contribution, compared with other factors, in the development of asthma, and in only a small proportion of the population. © 2012 Crown Copyright.

In this study the parasitological data were analyzed: i) to identify climatic/environmental, socio-economic and interventions factors associated with child malaria risk and ii) to produce a contemporary, high spatial resolution parasitaemia risk map of the country. Bayesian geostatistical models were fitted to assess the association between parasitaemia risk and its determinants. Bayesian kriging was employed to predict malaria risk at unsampled locations across Tanzania and to obtain the uncertainty associated with the predictions. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation methods were employed for model fit and prediction. Parasitaemia risk estimates were linked to population data and the number of infected children at province level was calculated. Model validation indicated a high predictive ability of the geostatistical model, with 60.00% of the test locations within the 95% credible interval. The results indicate that older children are significantly more likely to test positive for malaria compared with younger children and living in urban areas and better-off households reduces the risk of infection. However, none of the environmental and climatic proxies or the intervention measures were significantly associated with the risk of parasitaemia. Low levels of malaria prevalence were estimated for Zanzibar island. The population-adjusted prevalence ranges from 0.29% in Kaskazini province (Zanzibar island) to 18.65% in Mtwara region. The pattern of predicted malaria risk is similar with the previous maps based on historical data, although the estimates are lower. The predicted maps could be used by decision-makers to allocate resources and target interventions in the regions with highest burden of malaria in order to reduce the disease transmission in the country. © 2012 Gosoniu et al.",,"adolescent; adult; article; controlled study; demography; disease transmission; female; geographic distribution; geostatistical analysis; household; human; major clinical study; malaria; male; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; parasitemia; Plasmodium falciparum; prevalence; probability; risk assessment; socioeconomics; Tanzania; temperature dependence; age; Bayes theorem; biological model; child; climate; computer simulation; demography; geography; risk factor; Tanzania; Age Factors; Bayes Theorem; Child; Climate; Computer Simulation; Demography; Geography; Humans; Malaria; Models, Biological; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861368638

Bayesian approaches are thus well-suited to understanding relationships between age and depth for use in paleoecological studies. Bayesian models for the accumulation of sediment and organic matter within basins combine dated material from one or more records with prior information about the behavior of deposition times (yr/cm) based on expert knowledge. Well-informed priors are essential to good modeling of the age-depth relationship, but are particularly important in cases where data may be sparse (e.g., few radiocarbon dates), or unclear (e.g., age-reversals, coincident dates, age offsets, outliers and dates within a radiocarbon plateau).Here we assessed Holocene deposition times using 204 age-depth models obtained from the Neotoma Paleoecology Database (www.neotomadb.org) for both lacustrine and palustrine environments across the northeastern United States. These age-depth models were augmented using biostratigraphic events identifiable within pollen records from the northeastern United States during the Holocene and late-Pleistocene.Deposition times are significantly related to depositional environment (palustrine and lacustrine), sediment age, and sediment depth. Spatial variables had non-significant relationships with deposition time when site effects were considered. The best-fit model was a generalized additive mixed model that relates deposition time to age, stratified by depositional environment with site as a random factor. The best-fit model accounts for 63.3% of the total deviance in deposition times. The strongly increasing accumulation rates of the last 500-1000 years indicate that gamma distributions describing lacustrine deposition times (α = 1.08, β = 18.28) and palustrine deposition times (α = 1.23, β = 22.32) for the entire Holocene may be insufficient for Bayesian approaches since there is strong variation in the gamma parameters both in the most recent sediments and throughout the Holocene. Time-averaged gamma distributions for lacustrine (α = 1.35, β = 19.64) and palustrine samples (α = 1.40, β = 20.72) show lower overall deposition times, but variability remains. The variation in gamma parameters through time may require the use of multiple gamma distributions during the Holocene to generate accurate age-depth models. We present estimates of gamma parameters for deposition times at 1000 yr intervals. The parameters generated in this study can be used directly within Bacon to act as Bayesian priors for sedimentary age models. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Age-depth modeling; Bayesian; Deposition; Holocene; Radiocarbon; Sedimentation; Uncertainty","Accumulation rates; Bayesian; Bayesian approaches; Bayesian model; Best-fit models; Deposition time; Depositional environment; Expert knowledge; Gamma distribution; Holocenes; Mixed models; Paleoecology; Prior information; Radiocarbon; Radiocarbon dates; Random factors; Sediment age; Sediment depth; Site effects; Spatial variables; Time-averaged; Uncertainty; Bayesian networks; Deposition; Probability distributions; Sedimentology; Sediments; Uncertainty analysis; Wetlands; Sedimentation; accumulation; age determination; Bayesian analysis; biostratigraphy; calibration; database; depositional environment; Holocene; numerical model; organic matter; paleoecology; Pleistocene; radiocarbon dating; sedimentation; uncertainty analysis; United States; Neotoma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863441964

As these are implemented, policy makers must understand the way these programs work. In this review, we describe the basic features of carbon offset markets, along with the potential supply of offsets from agricultural sources and associated cost considerations. In this discussion we highlight the role of institutional design of contracts and transactions costs. We then turn to the benefits of including offsets in policies to reduce GHGs and complete the review with a discussion of the challenges in implementing the programs. © 2012 by Annual Reviews.

The classic approach defines extreme events by their magnitude and they are quantified by certain deviation from a central value. Alternatively, we define extreme events as the largest events sorted by rank, whatever their absolute magnitude. In this case, events with equal rank from two different sites can be responsible for different magnitudes of geomorphic work, e.g., the amount of erosion. The new approach applied to soil erosion is that, whatever the magnitude of soil eroded, erosion is a time compressed process and the percentage contribution to total soil erosion by the few largest events (regardless of their magnitude) is negatively related to the total number of daily soil erosion events recorded. To verify and generalize this approach, we used the most extensive daily soil erosion dataset available (USLE database). In this paper, we present a geographical analysis of the effects of largest daily event on soil erosion by comparing 594 erosion plots located in agricultural fields under various climatic temperate conditions across the central-east of the USA. Plots differ in cover, soil types and length of records. Results indicate that: i) soil erosion in agricultural fields is a highly time compressed process and soil erosion mean values calculated over short time periods are biased, regardless of the magnitude of daily events recorded; ii) the relative effects of the n-largest daily events (whatever their magnitude) on total soil erosion depends on the length of records and, particularly, on the total number of events recorded; iii) the derived relationship of the required time length for records is generalized on a semi-continental scale; and iv) thus seems to be independent of climate conditions. This new approach can help us to define the minimum number of recorded soil events needed to avoid bias in soil erosion evaluation, in other words: the minimum period of field research on erosion should be evaluated not in years, but by the total number of daily erosive events. Thus, the number of daily erosive events is the key parameter for characterizing soil erosion processes at each measuring location. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Daily events; Regional analyses; Soil erosion; USLE database","agricultural land; data set; database; regional geology; soil erosion; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859799981

While some climate models predict an Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) strengthening in response to GIS melting, others simulate weakening, leading to cooling in Europe. Here, we present evidence from new proxy-based paleoclimate and ocean circulation reconstructions that show that the strongest warming in western Europe coincided with maximum GIS meltwater runoff and a weaker AMOC early in the Last Interglacial. By performing a series of climate model sensitivity experiments, including enhanced GIS melting, we were able to simulate this confi guration of the Last Interglacial climate system and infer information on AMOC slowdown and related climate effects. These experiments suggest that GIS melt inhibited deep convection off the southern coast of Greenland, cooling local climate and reducing AMOC by ~24% of its present strength. However, GIS melt did not perturb overturning in the Nordic Seas, leaving heat transport to, and thereby temperatures in, Europe unaffected. © 2012 Geological Society of America.",,"Atlantic meridional overturning circulations; Climate effects; Climate optima; Deep convection; Greenland; Greenland Ice Sheet; Heat transport; Last interglacial; Local climate; Model sensitivity; Nordic seas; Ocean circulation; Paleoclimates; Western Europe; Climate models; Experiments; Global warming; Melting; Oceanography; climate effect; climate modeling; GIS; global warming; heat transfer; interglacial; late glacial; meridional circulation; paleoclimate; runoff; Arctic; Arctic Ocean; Greenland; Norwegian Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864311483

Biostimulation with inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus increased TPH degraders in the treated soil by two orders of magnitude. The activity of microbial communities also increased markedly in the treated soil compared with that in the control. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Fluorescein diacetate activity; Metabolites; Nitrilotriacetic acid; Petroleum hydrocarbons","Biological treatment; Biostimulation; Bulking agents; Chemical oxidation; Combined treatment; Fenton oxidation; Fluorescein diacetate; Indigenous microbes; Inorganic nitrogen; Microbial communities; Microtox; Molar ratio; Nitrilotriacetic acid; Oil contaminated soil; Orders of magnitude; Peanut hull; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Total petroleum hydrocarbons; Treated soils; Biodegradation; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Crude oil; Dyes; Iron compounds; Metabolites; Microorganisms; Petroleum chemistry; Phosphorus; Soils; Soil pollution; bioremediation; chemical weathering; crude oil; laboratory method; legume; metabolite; microbial community; oxidation; phytotoxicity; soil microorganism; soil pollution; Arachis hypogaea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858727519

We quantified ecosystem-service values to help the largest private landowner in Hawaii, Kamehameha Schools, design a land-use development plan that balances multiple private and public values on its North Shore land holdings (Island of O'ahu) of ∼10,600 ha. We used the InVEST software tool to evaluate the environmental and financial implications of seven planning scenarios encompassing contrasting land-use combinations including biofuel feedstocks, food crops, forestry, livestock, and residential development. All scenarios had positive financial return relative to the status quo of negative return. However, tradeoffs existed between carbon storage and water quality as well as between environmental improvement and financial return. Based on this analysis and community input, Kamehameha Schools is implementing a plan to support diversified agriculture and forestry. This plan generates a positive financial return ($10.9 million) and improved carbon storage (0.5% increase relative to status quo) with negative relative effects on water quality (15.4% increase in potential nitrogen export relative to status quo). The effects on water quality could be mitigated partially (reduced to a 4.9% increase in potential nitrogen export) by establishing vegetation buffers on agricultural fields. This plan contributes to policy goals for climate change mitigation, food security, and diversifying rural economic opportunities. More broadly, our approach illustrates how information can help guide local land-use decisions that involve tradeoffs between private and public interests.","Conservation; Mapping; Private lands","biofuel; carbon; agricultural land; article; computer program; controlled study; crop; diversifying selection; ecosystem; financial management; food; food security; forestry; health care policy; land use; livestock; nonhuman; priority journal; storage; United States; water quality; Agriculture; Biofuels; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Food Supply; Forestry; Geography; Hawaii; Humans; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860830532

Forests typically lose carbon for several years to several decades following severe disturbance, but our understanding of the duration and dynamics of post-disturbance forest carbon fluxes remains limited. Here we capitalize on a recent North American Carbon Program disturbance synthesis to discuss techniques and future work needed to better understand carbon dynamics after forest disturbance. Specifically, this paper addresses three topics: (1) the history, spatial distribution, and characteristics of different types of disturbance (in particular fire, insects, and harvest) in North America; (2) the integrated measurements and experimental designs required to quantify forest carbon dynamics in the years and decades after disturbance, as presented in a series of case studies; and (3) a synthesis of the greatest uncertainties spanning these studies, as well as the utility of multiple types of observations (independent but mutually constraining data) in understanding their dynamics. The case studiesin the southeast U.S., central boreal Canada, U.S. Rocky Mountains, and Pacific Northwestexplore how different measurements can be used to constrain and understand carbon dynamics in regrowing forests, with the most important measurements summarized for each disturbance type. We identify disturbance severity and history as key but highly uncertain factors driving post-disturbance carbon source-sink dynamics across all disturbance types. We suggest that imaginative, integrative analyses using multiple lines of evidence, increased measurement capabilities, shared models and online data sets, and innovative numerical algorithms hold promise for improved understanding and prediction of carbon dynamics in disturbance-prone forests. © 2012 American Geophysical Union.

In spite of their low absolute altitude (1,000-1,600 m a.s.l), the Sudetes and the Silesian Beskid form a noticeable orographic barrier for the airflow of the humid Atlantic air masses. This results in the increase of cloudiness and fog frequency as well as both atmospheric precipitation and horizontal precipitation volume. Between January and December 2009 the daily samples of atmospheric precipitation and rime were collected on three selected mountain tops of similar height. The selected measurement sites were situated along a 300 km WNW-ESE profile parallel to the direction of the prevailing atmospheric circulation. High day-today variability of rime water volume, the total ionic content and chemical composition of the individual samples were typical of each measurement site and depended on the emission patterns, synoptic situation and the local climatic conditions influenced chiefly by terrain relief. Significantly larger rime efficiency and pollution deposition via fog were observed at the westernmost Szrenica Mt site rather than more to the southeast at Śnieznik Mt and Skrzyczne Mt. This difference should be explained by more intense orographic deformation of predominant airflow from the western sector as well as the higher liquid water content of fog in the vicinity of Szrenica. Both temporal and spatial variability of fog deposition correlates closely with the health status of the drilled trees of Norway Spruce (Picea Abies) in the Śnieznik Massif. The averaged annual tree rings width near the local tree line (1,350 m a.s.l.) on the summit dome of Śnieznik decreased by 71% between 1950 and the early 1980s. This is also the area of the highest rate of atmospheric pollutant deposition due to particularly important role of fog. At an altitude of 1,200 m a.s.l. The relevant changes of ring width were different depending on slope aspect: 60% on western slopes well exposed for orographic fog formation and 42% on eastern slopes where fog deposition is less intense. The results of the dendrochronological analysis provide the evidence for the upward trend of tree rings width since 1981-1984 break through up to date, which should be attributed to the progressive reduction of pollutant emission in Central Europe. © 2011 Springer Basel AG.","Air pollution; Fog deposition; Mountain climate; Rime; Spruce dendrochronology; Total ionic content","Fog deposition; Mountain climate; Rime; Spruce dendrochronology; Total ionic content; Air pollution; Atmospheric chemistry; Climatology; Deposition; Forestry; Landforms; Pollution; Fog; air mass; airflow; atmospheric circulation; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; chemical composition; dendrochronology; fog; mountain environment; orography; pollutant transport; precipitation (climatology); rime; spatial variation; synoptic meteorology; temporal variation; tree ring; Air Pollution; Climates; Fogging; Meteorology; Mountains; Picea; Precipitation; Atlantic Ocean; Beskydy Mountains; Carpathians; Poland; Sudetes; Picea; Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861120189

Meeting EU targets for the consumption of transport fuels from bioenergy by 2020 will require a large increase in the production of bioenergy feedstock. Initially an increase in 'first generation' biofuels was observed, however 'food competition' concerns have generated interest in second generation biofuels (SGBs). These SGBs can be produced from co-products (e.g. cereal straw) or energy crops (e.g. miscanthus), with the former largely negating food competition concerns. In order to assess the sustainability of feedstock supply for SGBs, the financial, environmental and energy costs and benefits of the farm system must be quantified. Previous research has captured financial costs and benefits through linear programming (LP) approaches, whilst environmental and energy metrics have been largely been undertaken within life cycle analysis (LCA) frameworks. Assessing aspects of the financial, environmental and energy sustainability of supplying co-product second generation biofuel (CPSGB) feedstocks at the farm level requires a framework that permits the trade-offs between these objectives to be quantified and understood. The development of a modelling framework for Managing Energy and Emissions Trade-Offs in Agriculture (MEETA Model) that combines bio-economic process modelling and LCA is presented together with input data parameters obtained from literature and industry sources. The MEETA model quantifies arable farm inputs and outputs in terms of financial, energy and emissions results. The model explicitly captures fertiliser: crop-yield relationships, plus the incorporation of straw or removal for sale, with associated nutrient impacts of incorporation/removal on the following crop in the rotation. Key results of crop-mix, machinery use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per kg of crop product and energy use per hectare are in line with previous research and industry survey findings. Results show that the gross margin - energy trade-off is £36GJ-1, representing the gross margin forgone by maximising net farm energy cf. maximising farm gross margin. The gross margin-GHG emission trade-off is £0.15kg-1 CO2 eq, representing the gross margin forgone per kg of CO2 eq reduced when GHG emissions are minimised cf. maximising farm gross margin. The energy-GHG emission trade-off is 0.03GJkg-1CO2 eq quantifying the reduction in net energy from the farm system per kg of CO2 eq reduced when minimising GHG emissions cf. maximising net farm energy. When both farm gross margin and net farm energy are maximised all the cereal straw is baled for sale. Sensitivity analysis of the model in relation to different prices of cereal straw shows that it becomes financially optimal to incorporate wheat straw at price of £11t-1 for this co-product. Local market conditions for straw and farmer attitudes towards incorporation or sale of straw will impact on the straw price at which farmers will supply this potential bioenergy feedstock and represent important areas for future research. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Bioenergy; Cereal straw; Farm systems; Greenhouse gas emissions; Modelling","bioenergy; carbon dioxide; cereal; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; energy crop; energy policy; environmental economics; environmental policy; European Union; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; linear programing; market system; numerical model; sensitivity analysis; straw; sustainability; Miscanthus; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860536541

High winds along and behind this frontal system led to an extraordinary, large-scale, and long-lived dust out reak, accompanied by significant precipitation over parts of Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya. This paper uses sensitivity simulations with the limited-area model developed by the Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling (COSMO) together with analysis data and surface observations to test several hypotheses on the dynamics of this case proposedin previous work. It is demonstrated that air over central Algeria is cooled by evaporation of frontal precipitation, substantially enhancing winds at the leading edge of the cold front. This process is supported by very drylow-level air in the lee of the Atlas Mountains associated with a foehn situation. Flattening the mountain chain in a sensitivity experiment, however, has complex effects on the wind. While reduced evaporative cooling weakens the front, the elimination of the orographic blocking accelerates its penetration into the Sahara. The simulations also indicate high winds associated with a hydraulic jump at the southern slopes of the Tell Atlas. Feedingthe simulated winds into a dust emission parameterization reveals reduced emissions on the order of 20%-30% for suppressed latent heating and even more when effects of the increased precipitation on soil moisture are considered. In the experiment with the Atlas removed, effects of the overall increase in high winds are compensated by an increase in precipitation. The results suggest that a realistic representation of frontal precipitation is an important requisite to accurately model dust emission in such situations. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.","Cold fronts; Cold pools; Dust or dust storms; Latent heating/cooling; Orographic effects; Regional models","Cold front; Cold pool; Dust storm; Latent heating/cooling; Orographic effects; Regional model; Computer simulation; Cooling; Evaporation; Evaporative cooling systems; Experiments; Soil moisture; Storms; Wind; Dust; cold front; cold pool; computer simulation; dust storm; evaporation; latent heat flux; orographic effect; Algeria; Atlas Mountains; Libyan Arab Jamahiriya; Sahara; Tunisia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867935482

Major driving forces are the increasing car use in developing countries and the global growth in air travel. Meeting the 2°C climate target, however, requires a deep cut in CO 2 emissions. In this paper, we explore how extensive emission reductions may be achieved, using a newly developed travel model. This bottom-up model covers 26 world regions, 7 travel modes and different vehicle types. In the experiments, we applied a carbon tax and looked into the model's responses in terms of overall travel demand, modal split shifts, and changes in technology and fuel choice. We introduce two main scenarios in which biofuels are assumed to be carbon neutral (not subject to taxation, scenario A) or to lead to some greenhouse gas emissions (and therefore subject to taxation, scenario B). This leads to very different outcomes. Scenario A achieves emission reductions mostly through changes in fuel use. In Scenario B efficiency improvement and model split changes also play a major role. In both scenarios total travel volume is affected only marginally. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy modelling; Low emission scenarios; Passenger transportation","A-carbon; Air travels; Car use; Carbon neutrals; Climate targets; Driving forces; Efficiency improvement; Emission reduction; Energy modelling; Fuel choices; Fuel use; Global growth; Low emission; Modal split; Passenger transportation; Travel demand; Travel models; Travel modes; Travel volumes; Vehicle types; Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Taxation; Motor transportation; bottom-up approach; car use; carbon emission; developing world; emission control; numerical model; pollution tax; travel demand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859752967

We assessed the early performance of J. thurifera in different global change scenarios with and without facilitation. Saplings were transplanted in three ecosystems types with different previous land use (woodlands, former agricultural fields, and former livestock pastures), microhabitats (open vs. understory of adult trees) and were subjected to two watering regimens. We characterized the abiotic environment and measured survival, growth and two ecophysiological parameters. Former livestock pastures were the least favorable ecosystem, where the nursing effect was greatest. Former agricultural fields had the highest survival, but were more sensitive than woodlands to water scarcity. Reduced rainfall decreased photochemical efficiency, particularly in the least favorable scenarios, but did not affect survival. Water use efficiency enhanced growth under the canopy, but not in the open, whereas photochemical efficiency enhanced growth and survival more in the open. Facilitation was critical for effective recruitment in the harshest scenarios: former livestock pastures and reduced rainfall. Comparison with previous studies suggests that establishment depends on infrequent wet episodes. In Mediterranean ecosystems, changes in land use and climate change are leading to woodland expansion due to the modulating effect of facilitation of the oncoming adverse drier conditions. Nevertheless, the positive effect of facilitation and the negative impact of aridity on tree recruitment are strongly influenced by previous land-use history. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","climate change; facilitation; global change; Juniperus thurifera; land-use change; Mediterranean-continental; photochemical efficiency (F v/F m); structural equation modelling (SEM); water use efficiency (WUE)","aridity; climate effect; coniferous forest; ecophysiology; endemic species; environmental factor; facilitation; field; global change; growth rate; historical geography; land use change; Mediterranean environment; microhabitat; pasture; photochemistry; phytochemistry; precipitation intensity; recruitment (population dynamics); sapling; survival; transplantation; water availability; water use efficiency; woodland; Mediterranean Region; Juniperus; Juniperus thurifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860699596

The methane saturation index obtained for the whole period (1.00. ± 0.04) evidenced that the equilibrium condition was reached and the methane loss with the effluent was reduced. The methane recovery efficiency obtained at 20. °C (53.6%) was slightly lower than at 33. °C (57.4%) due to a reduction of the treatment efficiency, as evidenced by the lower methane production and the higher waste sludge per litre of treated wastewater.

Recent studies identified two related pfkB-type carbohydrate kinases, named FRUCTOKINASE-LIKE PROTEIN (FLN1 and FLN2), as components of the thylakoid bound PEP complex in both Arabidopsis thaliana and Sinapis alba (mustard). Additional work demonstrated that RNAi-mediated reduction in FLN expression specifically diminished transcription of PEP-dependent genes.Results: Here, we report the characterization of Arabidopsis FLN knockout alleles to examine the contribution of each gene in plant growth, chloroplast development, and in mediating PEP-dependent transcription. We show that fln plants have severe phenotypes with fln1 resulting in an albino phenotype that is seedling lethal without a source of exogenous carbon. In contrast, fln2 plants display chlorosis prior to leaf expansion, but exhibit slow greening, remain autotrophic, can grow to maturity, and set viable seed. fln1 fln2 double mutant analysis reveals haplo-insufficiency, and fln1 fln2 plants have a similar, but more severe phenotype than either single mutant. Normal plastid development in both light and dark requires the FLNs, but surprisingly skotomorphogenesis is unaffected in fln seedlings. Seedlings genetically fln1-1 with dexamethasone-inducible FLN1-HA expression at germination are phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type. Induction of FLN-HA after 24 hours of germination cannot rescue the mutant phenotype, indicating that the effects of loss of FLN are not always reversible. Examination of chloroplast gene expression in fln1-1 and fln2-1 by qRT-PCR reveals that transcripts of PEP-dependent genes were specifically reduced compared to NEP-dependent genes in both single mutants.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that each FLN protein contributes to wild type growth, and acting additively are absolutely essential for plant growth and development. © 2012 Gilkerson et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Arabidopsis thaliana; Chloroplast transcription; FLN; PfkB-type carbohydrate kinase; PTAC complex","Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Sinapis alba; Arabidopsis protein; fructokinase; Arabidopsis; article; enzymology; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plastid; protein transport; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Fructokinases; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Plastids; Protein Transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863473762

Fuel cell technology has advanced to the stage where commercial field trials for both transport and stationary applications are in progress. The electric efficiency typically varies between 40 and 60% for gaseous or liquid fuels. About 30-40% of the energy of the fuel is available as heat, the quality of which varies based on the operating temperature of the fuel cell. The utilisation of this heat component to further boost system efficiency is dictated by the application and end-use requirements. Fuel cells utilise either a gaseous or liquid fuel with most using hydrogen or synthetic gas produced by a variety of different means (reforming of natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas, reforming of liquid fuels such as diesel and kerosene, coal or biomass gasification, or hydrogen produced via water splitting/electrolysis). Direct Carbon Fuel Cells (DCFC) utilise solid carbon as the fuel and have historically attracted less investment than other types of gas or liquid fed fuel cells. However, volatility in gas and oil commodity prices and the increasing concern about the environmental impact of burning heavy fossil fuels for power generation has led to DCFCs gaining more attention within the global research community. A DCFC converts the chemical energy in solid carbon directly into electricity through its direct electrochemical oxidation. The fuel utilisation can be almost 100% as the fuel feed and product gases are distinct phases and thus can be easily separated. This is not the case with other fuel cell types for which the fuel utilisation within the cell is typically limited to below 85%. The theoretical efficiency is also high, around 100%. The combination of these two factors, lead to the projected electric efficiency of DCFC approaching 80% - approximately twice the efficiency of current generation coal fired power plants, thus leading to a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The amount of CO 2 for storage/sequestration is also halved. Moreover, the exit gas is an almost pure CO 2 stream, requiring little or no gas separation before compression for sequestration. Therefore, the energy and cost penalties to capture the CO 2 will also be significantly less than for other technologies. Furthermore, a variety of abundant fuels such as coal, coke, tar, biomass and organic waste can be used. Despite these advantages, the technology is at an early stage of development requiring solutions to many complex challenges related to materials degradation, fuel delivery, reaction kinetics, stack fabrication and system design, before it can be considered for commercialisation. This paper, following a brief introduction to other fuel cells, reviews in detail the current status of the direct carbon fuel cell technology, recent progress, technical challenges and discusses the future of the technology. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

For the 2008/2009 period, it was found that secondary aerosols (sulphate- and nitrate-rich secondary aerosols, SSA and NSA) are the most abundant components of PM10 at sites north of the Alps. Road traffic and wood combustion were found to be the largest sources of PM10 at these sites. Except at the urban roadside site where road traffic is dominating (40% of PM10 -- including road salt), the annual average contribution of these two sources is of similar importance (17% and 14% of PM10, respectively). At a rural site south of the Alps wood combustion and road traffic contributions to PM10 were higher (31% and 24%, respectively), and the fraction of secondary aerosols lower (29%) than at similar site types north of the Alps.Comparison of PMF analyses for the two time periods (1998/1999 and 2008/2009) revealed decreasing average contributions of road traffic and SSA to PM10 at all sites. This indicates that the measures that were implemented in Switzerland and in neighbouring countries to reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide and PM10 from road traffic were successful. On the other hand, contributions of wood combustion did not change during this ten year period, and the contribution of nitrate-rich secondary aerosols has even increased. It is shown that PMF can be a helpful tool for the assessment of long-term changes of source contributions to ambient particulate matter. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Factor analysis; Receptor modelling; Road traffic emissions; Trend analysis; Wood combustion emissions","Ambient particulate Matter; Annual average; Long-term changes; Positive matrices; Receptor modelling; Road salts; Road traffic; Road traffic emissions; Rural site; Secondary aerosols; Site types; Source apportionment; Source contributions; SPECIATION Data; Sulphates; Switzerland; Time-periods; Trend analysis; Two sources; Wood combustion; Combustion; Factor analysis; Factorization; Wood; Atmospheric aerosols; nitrate; sulfate; aerosol composition; atmospheric pollution; combustion; comparative study; factor analysis; particulate matter; road transport; spatiotemporal analysis; speciation (chemistry); trend analysis; wood; aerosol; article; combustion; model; particulate matter; positive matrix factorisation; priority journal; Switzerland; Aerosols; Analysis Of Variance; Combustion; Emission; Mathematical Models; Switzerland; Trafficability; Wood; Alps; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860538229

The concentrations of main components of PM10 were found to be similar at different site types north of the Alps (i.e. urban background, suburban and rural sites). Secondary inorganic PM10 components (nitrate, sulphate and ammonium) constituted the largest PM10 mass fraction, followed by carbonaceous matter (OM and EC), while the abundance of mineral dust and trace elements was small (both &lt;10%). At a rural site south of the Alps the concentrations of secondary inorganic components were much lower and the concentrations of OM and EC clearly higher than north of the Alps. Enhanced concentrations of EC, trace elements and to a lesser extent of OM and mineral dust were found at an urban roadside site. At this site, typical traffic related trace elements like Cu, Fe, Mo, Sb and Ba were highly enriched.This paper indicates clear positive effects of emission reduction strategies for PM10 and precursors implemented during the past ten and more years. The concentrations of sulphate and EC declined during the considered time period, EC reductions were especially strong at the urban roadside site (-2.4μgm -3). In contrast, the concentration of nitrate slightly increased at all of the considered sites (0.2-0.5μgm -3). Large reductions in the concentrations of many trace elements in PM10 during the past ten years are evident. As an example, the observed relative decrease of Pb is about -80%, which is a success of the ban of leaded gasoline in Switzerland and in the EU. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Elemental composition; Long-term changes; PM10; Reduction measures; Trace metals","Carbonaceous matter; Chemical compositions; Elemental compositions; Emission reduction strategy; Inorganic components; Leaded gasoline; Long-term changes; Mass fraction; Mineral dust; PM10; Rural site; Site types; Sulphates; Switzerland; Time-periods; Trace metal; Traffic-related; Urban background; Ammonium compounds; Antimony; Emission control; Lead; Molybdenum; Roadsides; Dust; ammonia; antimony; barium; carbon; copper; iron; molybdenum; nitrate; sulfate; chemical composition; emission control; long-term change; particulate matter; roadside environment; spatiotemporal analysis; trace metal; urban atmosphere; article; chemical analysis; chemical composition; concentration (parameters); fractionation; mass; mineral dust; particulate matter; priority journal; rural area; Switzerland; urban area; Alps; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859357622

Here we examine the sky variation at intermediate and high latitudes using a cross-correlation technique. In particular, we compare the observed emission in several global partitions of the sky plus 33 selected sky regions to three 'standard' templates. The regions are selected using a criterion based on the morphology of these template maps. The synchrotron emission shows evidence of steepening between GHz frequencies and the WMAP bands. There are indications of spectral index variations across the sky, but the current data are not precise enough to accurately quantify this from region to region. The Hα template correlated emission derived from the global fits shows clear evidence of deviation from a free-free spectrum. If this spectrum is decomposed into a contribution from both free-free and spinning dust emission in the warm ionized medium of the Galaxy, the derived free-free emissivity corresponds to a mean electron temperature of ∼6000K (a value critically dependent on the impact of dust absorption on the Hα intensity), and the spinning dust emission has a peak emission in intensity typically in the range 40-50GHz. However, the analysis of the smaller regions is generally unrevealing and the analysis presented here does not unambiguously demonstrate the presence of spinning dust emission in the warm ionized medium, as advocated by Dobler & Finkbeiner. The anomalous microwave emission associated with dust is detected at high significance in most of the 33 fields studied. The anomalous emission correlates well with the Finkbeiner et al. model 8 predictions (FDS8) at 94 GHz, and is well described globally by a power-law emission model with an effective spectral index between 20 and 60 GHz of β≈-2.7. It is clear that attempts to explain the emission by spinning dust models require multiple components, which presumably relates to a complex mix of emission regions along a given line of sight. An enhancement of the thermal dust contribution over the FDS8 predictions by a factor ∼1.2 is required with such models. Furthermore, the emissivity varies by a factor of ∼50 per cent from cloud to cloud relative to the mean. The significance of these results for the correction of cosmic microwave background data for Galactic foreground emission is discussed. © 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2012 RAS.","Cosmology: observations; Diffuse radiation; Radiation mechanisms: general; Radio continuum: ISM",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861230188

In order to assess the flood characteristics at the basin and tributary scales, a physically based macro-scale distributed hydrological model (DHM) has been calibrated and validated for 9 wet years. The model performance has been evaluated in terms of prediction of the flood characteristics such as peak discharge, flood duration, arrival time of flood wave, timing of the peak flow and number of flood waves per season. Future changes in the flood wave characteristics of the basin have been evaluated using the validated model with bias-corrected future-projected meteorological scenario from a regional climate model (RCM). Likelihood analysis of the simulated flow time series reveals that significant increase in both peak discharge and flood duration is expected for both the pre-monsoonal and monsoonal seasons in the basin, but the number of flood waves per season would be reduced. Under the projected climate change scenario, it is expected that there will be more catastrophic floods in the basin. © Indian Academy of Sciences.","Brahmaputra basin; Climate change; Flood characteristics; Hydrology; Natural hazards; PRECIS","catastrophic event; climate change; climate effect; flood; flood forecasting; flood frequency; hazard assessment; hydrological modeling; monsoon; peak discharge; peak flow; performance assessment; seasonal variation; Brahmaputra Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863111905

Here we provide a tool which is useful to choose the supercell of the considered system such that it makes it appear to have either an as large as possible band gap (optimized for Car-Parrinello setup) or the metallic character reflected at the T point (e.g., fold the Dirac point to the T point for graphene and carbon nanotubes) in order to monitor the metallic character in a trajectory.

To that end, necessary measures should be identified and implemented, with the aim of progressively reducing pollution from priority substances. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate how a dynamic model of the integrated urban wastewater system (IUWS) can be used to test different emission reduction strategies for organic priority pollutants (PPs) in a semi-hypothetical case study on di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP). The IUWS is composed of coupled entities: sources, urban catchment surface (run-off/infiltration), sewer system, stormwater treatment unit, wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) including sludge handling, and receiving surface water (river). State-of-the-art dynamic fate models were selected from literature and extended with an organic pollutant fate sub-model. Dynamic DEHP release profiles were estimated using a dynamic model input generator and fed to the model to predict the fate and concentration of DEHP in each IUWS sub-system. The model was then used to test eight scenarios on environmental performance, namely (1) reduction of impervious urban area, (2) reduction of infiltration in the sewer system, (3) input reduction (excluding the main pollutant sources), (4) separating the combined sewer system, (5) treatment of stormwater by stormwater infiltration ponds (separate sewer systems), (6) placement of retention basins at main sewer junctions, (7) sand filtration of secondary effluent, and (8) pre-precipitation of phosphorous. The simulation results revealed that the most effective measure in terms of river water quality improvement for DEHP (annual average and spikiness reduction) and PP concentration in the disposed WWTP sludge, is reducing release of this substance into the environment, not surprisingly. In general, this will heavily depend on the parameterisation of the scenarios. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Dynamic modeling; Integrated urban wastewater system; Organic priority pollutant; Scenario analysis; Water Framework Directive","Annual average; Chemical quality; Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate; Effective measures; Emission reduction strategy; Environmental performance; Fate model; Infiltration pond; Pollutant sources; Priority pollutants; Receiving waters; Release profiles; Retention basins; River water quality; Sand filtration; Scenario analysis; Secondary effluent; Sewer system; Stormwater treatment; Stormwaters; Sub-systems; Urban areas; Urban catchment; Urban wastewater system; Wastewater treatment plants; Water Framework Directives; Water quality protection; Catchments; Combined sewers; Dynamic models; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Emission control; Environmental management; Integration; Organic pollutants; Phosphorus; Rain; Runoff; Source separation; Storms; Water conservation; Water quality; River pollution; organic compound; phthalic acid bis(2 ethylhexyl) ester; river water; runoff; storm water; surface water; catchment; emission control; organic pollutant; parameterization; pollution control; pollution policy; river water; strategic approach; wastewater; water quality; water treatment; article; case study; concentration (parameters); effluent; environmental protection; filtration; generator; integrated dynamic urban fate model; integrated urban wastewater system; precipitation; priority journal; quality control; river basin; sand; sewer; simulation; sludge treatment; statistical model; urban area; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; water contamination; water pollutant; water quality; Diethylhexyl Phthalate; European Union; Models, Theoretical; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution, Chemical; Water Quality; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864058676

This paper reviews the early evolution of the biofuel sector in Zambia to explore the extent to which the country is positioned to leverage future benefits of the emerging industry while forestalling negative social and environmental costs. In doing so, it sheds light on an under-researched dimension of the ongoing debate over large-scale land acquisitions and foreign investment: the role of legal and institutional frameworks in host countries in shaping outcomes. The analysis draws on the following: policy documents; stakeholder interviews with government departments, investors, and civil society stakeholders; and published and reported data on investments.

Therefore, our hopes are on a 'technological fix', which appears to evade tricky moral questions by finding a clean source of energy. This paper explores moral issues underneath the unproblematic appearance of this turn by looking into the relations between technological fixes, exploitation, and ethical extension. With the advent of fossil fuels in the late 19th and 20th century, the labour needed to provide the beneficiaries of the economy with goods largely shifted from the proletariat to the 'nature worker', the natural inputs which are consumed with the production of goods. This shift led to the emancipation of the proletariat, but it turned out to be at the expense of the global ecosystem. We now try to find a more sustainable nature-worker in order to unburden the ecosystem and avert a climate crisis. This framing sheds new insight in the dynamics of ethical extension. While ethical extension is typically understood as an intellectual development, the ideas of moral considerability appear to co-evolve with technological development and the negative side-effects of exploitation. The extension of the moral community tends to coincide with the exploitation of a new object. This will in time lead to new issues which are only solvable by finding yet another object to exploit. This perspective leads us to conclude that while technological fixes appear to evade moral dilemmas, they merely shift them to another level. If we mitigate climate change by rebuilding the economy around highly efficient algae to produce fuel and base materials, we ought to look into the issues that may be on the horizon. © 2012 Wageningen Academic Publishers.

A simplified energy system model based on linear programming is used to study the impact of introducing biomass based district heating in the community. Based on existing situation, some cases are outlined where district heating with varying degree is included as an option. Based on the assumed input data the analysis shows that district heating can play an important role in reshaping the municipal energy system which is dominated by electricity and fossil fuels. A substantial reduction of CO2 emissions can be achieved by replacing fossil fuels and electricity. There is also a possibility to improve local environment by replacing inefficient wood combustion which gives high values of particulate emissions and other harmful compounds.Unlike individual heating, district heating is associated with distribution costs that may be critical to its profitability (particularly in low heat demand areas). In addition, one should keep in mind the need for investment in possible building conversion (switching to hydronic heating system) measures. In relation to today's energy costs, the total distribution cost of district heat appears to be at such a low level that this together with the assumed fuel prices and investment cost could provide favourable conditions for district heating. If viable, there is also potential for local combined heat and power production. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","District heating; Emissions; Optimisation; System analysis","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Fossil fuels; Investments; Particulate emissions; Profitability; Systems analysis; Combined heat and power production; Distribution costs; Energy cost; Energy system analysis; Energy system model; Energy systems; Fuel prices; Global emissions; Heat demands; Hydronic-heating; Input datas; Investment costs; Local environments; Low level; Optimisations; Substantial reduction; Wood combustion; District heating; biomass; carbon dioxide; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; fossil fuel; heating; optimization; profitability; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859424207

Reduced sorbent and water consumption compared with pulverized coal (PC) plants and the ability to deal with corrosive fuel constituents while still meeting local regulations make a CFB boiler-based power plant particularly attractive. CFB-based power generation is particularly relevant in coal mining areas. During mining, a portion of the roof and floor material may be extracted along with the coal seam in order to create adequate working height for the equipment and miners. Therefore, run-of-mine coal which comes directly from the mine contains impurities. The raw coal can undergo a washing or screening process in order to improve its quality by reducing the ash content in the fuel in order to sell it on the export market or to comply with domestic customer requirements. The coal discarded from the washing process usually has a high ash content and difficult mechanical properties resulting from the initial properties, the mining, and the coal cleaning processes. It can contain a large volume of stones or can be very fine as a result of the washing treatment. To create value from burning this discarded coal, the boiler supplier has to meet several technical challenges in developing the appropriate design. This paper highlights the performance achieved with Alstom's CFB boilers developed for power generation over the last two decades to extract value from discarded coals. Emile Huchet Power Plant is the first 125 MWe CFB unit developed for burning coal slurries (called schlamms in France). The Emile Huchet discarded coal fuel is a very fine high-ash residue with an average particle diameter by mass (d50) of around 80 μm as received from the washing plant. The paper describes the performances and the basic design of the CFB boiler to manage such a fine fuel. The performances of two other CFBs of approximately 300 MWe output in operation in the USA and PR China are also mentioned to demonstrate the capability of this technology to burn either lowvolatile bituminous or anthracite waste coals. The significant issues experienced during commissioning are reported, and the conceptual choices for burning such fuels are mentioned. © The Southern African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, 2012.","CFB; Coal mines; Discarded coal; Performances","Ash contents; CFB; CFB boilers; Circulating fluidized bed boiler; Cleaning process; Coal fuel; Coal mining area; Coal seams; Combustion efficiencies; Customer requirements; Export markets; Floor materials; Local regulations; Low emission; Particle diameters; Performances; Pulverized coals; Raw coal; Screening process; Technical challenges; Washing process; Washing treatment; Waste coal; Water consumption; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal deposits; Coal mines; Coal slurries; Fuels; Mechanical properties; Pulverized fuel fired boilers; Sorption; Washing; Waste incineration; Water supply; Fossil fuel power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863698718

Great efforts have been made in order to reduce fossil energy consumption and mitigate its depletion by means of energy efficiency directives. The national transposition of such directives generates regional regulations that might be counterproductive if it is not clear which one is more restrictive. The main goal of this paper is to evaluate the potential of energetic savings of the dwellings in Catalonia and its economic impact, according to different scenarios of efficiency that have been defined according to current regulations at state and autonomic level. To achieve this objective, thirteen typologies of dwellings have been defined in order to categorize the stock of buildings in Catalonia. Simulations with LIDER software have been carried out in order to obtain the heating and cooling demand for each typology of dwelling in different climatic zones and orientations. The economic impact of each scenario has been stated as well. We show that the best normative scenario is not the regional but the national one, and only when full limitations imposed by the state regulations are fulfilled. Following the latter 6.4% reduction in CO 2 emissions would be achieved, whereas following the former gives us only 2.8% reduction for year 2015.

Consequently, great efforts are being made to prevent the growth of Aspergillus on grapes. However, the European Commission suggests that climate change may result in increased temperatures and longer drought periods in southern Europe. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate how ochratoxigenic fungal growth and the efficiency of fungicides used at present might be affected by environmental conditions predicted with climate change. Results: The effectiveness of grape field antifungals (Switch, Flint Max and Equisetum arvense extract) under two alternating temperature, photoperiod and relative humidity (RH) scenarios (current: 20/30 °C, 16 h light/8 h darkness, 80% RH; predicted: 25/37 °C, 16 h light/8 h darkness, 75% RH) on the growth and OTA production of two Aspergillus carbonarius isolates and one Aspergillus ochraceus isolate on grapes was investigated. Conclusion: Predicted conditions reduced A. carbonarius and limited A. ochraceus growth. Antifungals reduced fungal infection (by 40-84%), although no correlation between climatic conditions and effectiveness of the antifungals was found. However, Switch always showed the greatest reduction and E. arvense (0.02 g mL -1 extract) the least. Higher temperatures affected OTA production by the isolates in different ways. In general, Switch and Flint Max reduced OTA production, while E. arvense stimulated it. © 2011 Society of Chemical Industry.","Aspergillus; Environmental conditions; Grapes; Ochratoxin A","antifungal agent; ochratoxin; plant extract; article; Aspergillus; biosynthesis; darkness; drought; drug effect; environment; Equisetum; fruit; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; humidity; metabolism; microbiology; photoperiodicity; plant disease; Southern Europe; sunlight; temperature; Vitis; Antifungal Agents; Aspergillus; Darkness; Droughts; Environment; Equisetum; Fruit; Global Warming; Humidity; Mediterranean Region; Ochratoxins; Photoperiod; Plant Diseases; Plant Extracts; Sunlight; Temperature; Vitis; Aspergillus; Aspergillus carbonarius; Aspergillus ochraceus; Equisetum; Equisetum arvense; Fungi; Vitaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859420455

With the introduction of APB the absorption intensity and peak area of PF resin at 129.5 ppm was reduced, and the carbons in methylene bridges shifted from 65.8 to 73.5 ppm, which were the result of hydrogen bond formation between ammonium in APB and oxygen of phenolic hydroxyl, as well as coordination bond between the boron in APB and oxygen in phenolic hydroxyl and/or unreacted hydroxymethyl. In addition, the peak area at 152.7 ppm increased with the addition of poplar powder for the overlap of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin chemical shifts with the active groups in PF resin. However, the connection status of critically active chemical groups of condensed polymer structure in cured PF resin such as the existence of phenolic ring, phenolic hydroxyl, methylene bridges, and hydroxymethyl linkage are unchanged. Combined with relative increase in the amount of carbon in methylene bridges from 2.42 to 2.56, drop in number of carbons of unreacted hydroxyls from 1.19 to 1.07, and the reported increase in physical and mechanical properties, the nanosize copper oxide improved the curing degree of PF.

We present a simple operating model, AGG-PROD, that takes into account these drivers. AGG-PROD aggregates species into functional groups and applies exploitation rates to these groups, while accounting for the interactions between these groups and the environment. We loosely modeled the Northeast US Large Marine Ecosystem fish community, exploring a range of harvest, ecological interactions (competition and predation), and climate effects scenarios. We examined the independent effects of each of the triad of drivers at their base levels on the 3 main functional groups. We then explored the effects of targeted harvest on specific functional groups as well as different levels of total system harvest, both with and without climate effects. Our results indicate that the triad of drivers can lead to unanticipated, indirect effects on groups of species, and that all 3 should be taken into account by an operating model in a Management Strategy Evaluation context. Harvest tends to affect groups with a slower overall growth rate the most, while groups affected by strong ecological interactions often exhibit strong competitive or predatory release when other groups are reduced in biomass. Climate effects reduce primarily the biomass of groundfishes in our model, indicating the need for more conservative exploitation under future climate projections. © Inter-Research 2012.","Climate; Ecological interactions; Ecosystem-based fishery management; Exploitation; Management strategy evaluation; Northeast United States Large Marine Ecosystem; Production model; Triad of drivers","aggregation behavior; biomass; climate effect; ecological impact; exploitation; fishery management; fishery modeling; fishery production; fishing community; functional group; future prospect; management practice; marine ecosystem; numerical model; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863830204

Carrying out these reactions at rates that exceed the rate of solar insolation for the extended periods of time required for useful applications presents a major challenge. Water oxidation is the key ""other"" half reaction in these schemes and it is dominated by PCET given its multi-electron, multi-proton character, 2H2O → O2 + 4e- + 4H+. Identification of PCET was an offshoot of experiments designed to investigate energy conversion by electron transfer quenching of molecular excited states. The concepts ""redox potential leveling"" and concerted electron-proton transfer came from measurements on stepwise oxidation of cis-Ru II(bpy)2(py)(OH2)2+ to Ru IV(bpy)2(py)(O)2+. The Ru ""blue dimer"", cis,cis-(bpy)2(H2O)RuORu(OH 2)(bpy)24+, was the first designed catalyst for water oxidation. It undergoes oxidative activation by PCET to give the transient (bpy)2(O)RuVORuV(O)(bpy) 24+, O-atom attack on water to give a peroxidic intermediate, and further oxidation and O2 release. More recently, a class of single site water oxidation catalysts has been identified, e.g., Ru(tpy)(bpm)(OH2)2+ (tpy is 2,2′:6′, 2′′-terpyridine; bpm is 2,2′-bipyrimidine). They undergo stepwise PCET oxidation to RuIV=O2+ or Ru V(O)3+ followed by O-atom transfer with formation of peroxidic intermediates which undergo further oxidation and O2 release. PCET plays a key role in the three zones of water oxidation reactivity: oxidative activation, O⋯O bond formation, oxidation and O2 release from peroxidic intermediates. Similar schemes have been identified for electrocatalytic water oxidation on oxide electrode surfaces based on phosphonated derivatives such as [Ru(Mebimpy)(4,4′-(PO3H 2CH2)2bpy)(OH2)]2+. A PCET barrier to RuIII-OH2+ → RuIV=O 2+ oxidation arises from the large difference in pKa values between RuIII-OH2+ and RuIV(OH) 3+. On oxide surfaces this oxidation occurs by multiple pathways. Kinetic, mechanistic, and DFT results on single site catalysts reveal a new pathway for the O⋯O bond forming step (Atom-Proton Transfer, APT), significant rate enhancements by added proton acceptor bases, and accelerated water oxidation in propylene carbonate as solvent with water added as a stoichiometric reagent. Lessons learned about water oxidation and the role of PCET and concerted pathways appear to have direct relevance for water oxidation in Photosystem II (PSII) with PSII a spectacular example of PCET in action. This includes a key role for Multiple Site-Electron Proton Transfer in oxidative activation of the Oxygen Evolving Complex (OEC) in the S0 → S1 transition in the Kok cycle. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Bond formation; Bond-forming step; Carbon dioxide reduction; Electrocatalytic; Electron transfer quenching; Electron-proton transfers; Half reactions; Light driven; Multi-electron; Multiple pathways; Oxide electrodes; Oxide surface; Oxygen-evolving complexes; Photosystem II; Propylene carbonate; Proton acceptors; Proton coupled electron transfers; Rate enhancement; Redox potentials; Single sites; Single-site catalysts; Solar fuels; Solar insolation; Stepwise oxidation; Stoichiometric reagents; Terpyridines; Three zones; Water oxidation; Water splitting; Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Dimers; Electron transitions; Energy conversion; Hydrocarbons; Oxidation; Pollution control; Proton transfer; Redox reactions; Reaction intermediates; carbon dioxide; catalyst; electrode; electron; insolation; oxidation; reduction; solar power; stoichiometry",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863110439

Immunoblot and SDSPAGE analyses showed that transgenic lines from both gene constructs expressed the foreign Rubisco activase at high levels. The activation state of Rubisco in transgenic lines was slightly higher than that in non-transgenic plants (NT). In addition, light activation of Rubisco was significantly more rapid in transgenic lines compared with NT. These findings indicate that the overexpression of Rubisco activase can enhance Rubisco activation. However, despite enhanced activation of Rubisco in these transgenic plants, the CO 2 assimilation rate at ambient CO 2 conditions was decreased. This decrease in CO 2 assimilation rate was observed in both young developing and mature leaves independent of nitrogen nutrition. The contents of nitrogen and Chl did not differ significantly between transformants and NT; however, Rubisco content was substantially decreased in transgenic lines. There was no evidence for reduced transcription of RbcS or RbcL in these transgenic lines; in fact, transcript levels were marginally increased compared with NT.

Moreover the results in this study showed the availability of activated carbon as a feed additive owing to the reduction in the risk of food pollution by PCDDs/PCDFs and DL-PCBs. The concentration in the eggs of the Exposure group gradually increased following the start of egg-laying but reached a steady state after about 1month. In contrast, the concentration for the Exposure+C group was stationary and below the maximum EU level (6pgTEQg-1fat). In comparison to the Exposure group, the Exposure+C group showed a significant decline in the percentage of bioaccumulation into the egg. This reduction due to activated carbon was also observed in the muscle and abdominal fat. The reductions were compound- and congener-dependent for DL-PCBs as follows: PCDDs/PCDFs, non-ortho-PCBs, and mono-ortho-PCBs were more than 90%, 80%, and 50%, respectively, irrespective of the type of tissues. Fat soluble vitamin concentrations in the eggs of the Exposure+C group showed lower trends than the Exposure group.

The dye and one-to-five quenchers were tethered through D-threoninol to opposite strands of a DNA duplex. NMR analysis revealed that the clusters with a single fluorophore and two quenchers formed a sandwich-like structure (antiparallel H-aggregates). The melting temperatures of all the heteroclusters were almost the same, although structural distortion should become larger, as the number of quenchers increased. An asymmetric heterocluster of a single fluorophore and two quenchers showed larger excitonic interaction (i.e., hypochromicity of Cy3), than did a single Cy3 and a single quencher. Due to the larger exciton coupling between the dyes, the 1:2 heterocluster suppressed the background emission more efficiently than the 1:1 cluster. However, more quenchers did not enhance quenching efficiency due to the saturation of exciton coupling with two quenchers. Finally, this asymmetric 1:2 heterocluster was introduced into the stem region of a molecular beacon (MB; also known as an in-stem MB) targeting the fusion site in the L6 BCR-ABL fusion gene. With this MB design, the signal/background ratio was as high as 68 due to efficient suppression of background emission resulting from the maximized excitonic interaction. For reduction of the background emission with the DNA probes, asymmetric dye clusters were prepared by using D-threoninol as a dye-cluster scaffold in DNA. The cluster of a single fluorophore and two quenchers suppressed the emission more efficiently than the heterodimer due to the strong exciton coupling between the dyes. This design was used to prepare a highly-sensitive in-stem molecular beacon (see figure). Copyright © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Energy intensive industries, such as steel, cement, paper, and power plants, have great capacities to accept waste plastics and paper to substitute their fossil resource consumption and to reduce carbon emissions. We propose a ""smart recycling system"" that utilizes existing industrial facilities that have high energy efficiency, for establishing a cost-effective and robust recycling system. The core of the smart recycling system is the smart recycling center (SRC) that establishes a new recycling pathway connecting spatially diffuse municipal sources to facilities in energy intensive industries. This paper discusses the design and function of an SRC and estimates the CO 2 emissions and costs related to the operation and construction of the SRC. We also evaluated the cost effectiveness of the smart recycling system, taking into account sorted collection, incineration, processes in the SRC, and processes in industrial facilities. We estimated that the system could result in a reduction of approximately 100 kg of CO 2 emissions per capita per year without a significant increase in cost. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In order to better understand the sources and seasonal variations of sugars in aerosols, primary saccharides (fructose, glucose, sucrose, and trehalose) and sugar alcohols (arabitol and mannitol), together with levoglucosan, have been studied in ambient aerosols at Gosan, Jeju Island in the western North Pacific, the downwind region of the Asian outflow, using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that the sugar composition varied seasonally with a total concentration range of 6.8-1760 ng m -3 (mean 246 ng m -3). The total identified sugars had the highest concentration in April, the spring bloom season at Jeju Island, when sucrose contributed up to 80% of the total sugars. The dominance of sucrose was also detected in pollen samples, suggesting that pollen can contribute significantly to sucrose in aerosols during the spring bloom. The seasonal variation of trehalose is consistent with those of non-sea-salt Ca 2+ and δ 13C of total carbon with elevated levels during the Asian dust storm events. This study indicates that sugar compounds in atmospheric PM over East Asia can be derived from biomass burning, Asian dust, and primary biological aerosols such as fungal spores and pollen. Furthermore, this study supports the idea that sucrose could be used as a tracer for airborne pollen grains, and trehalose as a tracer for Asian dust outflow. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Airborne pollen; Asian dust; Organic aerosols; Saccharides; Sucrose","Airborne pollens; Ambient aerosols; Asian dust; Asian dust storm; Atmospheric particulate matter; Biological Aerosol; Biomass-burning; Concentration ranges; East Asia; Elevated level; Fungal spores; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Jeju island; Levoglucosan; Organic aerosol; Organic constituents; Saccharides; Seasonal variation; Spring blooms; Sugar alcohols; Sugar composition; Total carbon; Western North Pacific; Blooms (metal); Dust; Gas chromatography; Glucose; Storms; Sugar (sucrose); Atmospheric aerosols; arabinitol; calcium; carbohydrate; carbon 13; fructose; glucose; mannitol; sucrose; sugar; trehalose; airborne survey; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; dust; dust storm; seasonal variation; spore; spring (season); sucrose; sugar; aerosol; airborne particle; article; Asia; concentration (parameters); dust; Korea; Pacific islands; particulate matter; pollen; priority journal; seasonal variation; spring; Cheju [Cheju (PRV/ISL)]; Cheju [South Korea]; Gosan; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859922516

Switch includes an unprecedented amount of spatial and temporal detail, making it possible to address a new type of question about the optimal design and operation of power systems with large amounts of renewable power.

Extended leaf phenology, whereby understory species assimilate carbon in early spring before canopy closure or in late autumn after canopy fall, has been identified as a key feature of many forest species invasions, but it remains unclear whether there are systematic differences in the growth phenology of native and invasive forest species or whether invaders are more responsive to warming trends that have lengthened the duration of spring or autumn growth. Here, in a 3-year monitoring study of 43 native and 30 non-native shrub and liana species common to deciduous forests in the eastern United States, I show that extended autumn leaf phenology is a common attribute of eastern US forest invasions, where non-native species are extending the autumn growing season by an average of 4weeks compared with natives. In contrast, there was no consistent evidence that non-natives as a group show earlier spring growth phenology, and non-natives were not better able to track interannual variation in spring temperatures. Seasonal leaf production and photosynthetic data suggest that most non-native species capture a significant proportion of their annual carbon assimilate after canopy leaf fall, a behaviour that was virtually absent in natives and consistent across five phylogenetic groups. Pronounced differences in how native and non-native understory species use pre-and post-canopy environments suggest eastern US invaders are driving a seasonal redistribution of forest productivity that may rival climate change in its impact on forest processes. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The modern medicine pot could thus have had a prior use. The absence of C4 plant residues in the archaeological sherds suggests that either staple foodstuffs differed radically to today, or, more likely, were not prepared in vessels that were to be used for medicinal purposes. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Compound specific isotopic analysis; GC-C-IRMS; GC-MS; Ghana; Medicine pots","archaeology; artifact; boulder; carbon fixation; chemical analysis; gas chromatography; isotopic analysis; isotopic composition; mass spectrometry; medicine; organic geochemistry; Ghana; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860882266

For this purpose, a mechanistic-statistical-dynamical climate model with a bidirectional interaction between vegetation and climate is used. The results showed that climate change due to deforestation is more than that due to greenhouse gases in the tropical region. The warming due to deforestation corresponds to around 60% of the warming in the tropical region when the increase of CO2 concentration is included together. However, the global warming due to deforestation is negligible. On the other hand, with the increase of CO2 concentration projected for 2100, there is a lower decrease of evapotranspiration, precipitation and net surface radiation in the tropical region compared with the case with only deforestation. Differently from the case with only deforestation, the effect of the changes in the net surface radiation overcomes that due to the evapotranspiration, so that the warming in the tropical land region is increased. The impact of the increase of CO2 concentration on a deforestation scenario is to increase the reduction of the areas covered by tropical forest (and a corresponding increase in the areas covered by savanna) which may reach 7. 5% in future compared with the present climate. Compared with the case with only deforestation, drying may increase by 66. 7%. This corroborates with the hypothesis that the process of savannization of the tropical forest can be accelerated in future due to global warming. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",,"climate change; climate modeling; deforestation; evapotranspiration; global warming; greenhouse gas; land cover; precipitation (climatology); savanna; tropical forest; tropical region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862259567

The priorities in development are set to speed, easy handling and portability with a modular structure suitable for problem-dependent configuration. Adaptions exist for the planetary atmospheres of Mars and of Saturn’s moon Titan and are being extended. Common coupling interfaces enable the addition of ocean, ice, vegetation models and more. An interactive mode with a Model Starter and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) is available to select a configuration from the available model suite, to set its parameters and inspect atmospheric fields while changing the models’ parameters on the fly. This is especially useful for teaching, debugging and tuning of parameterizations. An updated overview of the model suite’s features is presented based on the Earth-like climate model Planet Simulator with mixed-layer ocean introducing static and memory hysteresis in terms of a parameter sweep of the solar constant and CO2 concentrations. The static hysteresis experiment demonstrates that the solar constant varying by 20% reveals warm and snowball Earth climate regimes depending on the history of the system. This hysteresis subjected to a thermodynamic analysis shows the following features: i) Both climate regimes are characterized by global mean surface temperature and entropy growing with increasing solar constant. ii) The climate system’s efficiency decreases (increases) with increasing solar constant in present-day warm (snowball) climate conditions. iii) Climate transitions near bifurcation points are characterized by high efficiency associated with the system’s large distance from the stable regime. Memory hysteresis evolves when changing the direct atmospheric radiative forcing which, associated with a well-mixed CO2 concentration, modifies the planetary thermodynamic state, and hence the surface temperature. The hysteresis effected by different CO2 change rates is analysed: i) The response is due to infrared cooling (for constant temperature lapse-rate) which, in turn, is related to the surface temperature through the Stefan-Boltzmann law in a ratio proportional to the new infrared opacity. Subsequent indirect effects, that are water-vapour-greenhouse and ice-albedo feedbacks, enhance the response. ii) Different rates of CO2 variation may lead to similar transient climates characterized by the same global mean surface temperature but different values of CO2 concentration. iii) Far from the bifurcation points, the model’s climate depends on the history of the radiative forcing thus displaying a hysteresis cycle that is neither static nor dynamical, but is related to the memory response of the model determined by the mixed-layer depth of the ocean.

The extent of these impacts depends largely on awareness and the level of adaptation in response to climate change. This study examines the perception of farmers in Sekyedumase district of Ashanti region of Ghana on climate change and analyzes farmers' adaptation responses to climate change. A hundred and eighty farming households were interviewed in February and October 2009. Results showed that about 92% of the respondents perceived increases in temperature, while 87% perceived decrease in precipitation over the years. The major adaptation strategies identified included crop diversification, planting of short season varieties, change in crops species, and a shift in planting date, among others. Results of logit regression analysis indicated that the access to extension services, credit, soil fertility, and land tenure are the four most important factors that influence farmers' perception and adaptation. The main barriers included lack of information on adaptation strategies, poverty, and lack of information about weather. Even though the communities are highly aware of climate issues, only 44. 4% of farmers have adjusted their farming practices to reduce the impacts of increasing temperature and 40. 6% to decreasing precipitation, giving lack of funds as the main barrier to implementing adaptation measure. Implications for policymaking will be to make credit facilities more flexible, to invest in training more extension officers and more education on climate change and adaptation strategies. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; Perception; Precipitation; Temperature","adaptation; agricultural worker; climate change; perception; physiological response; policy making; precipitation (climatology); regression analysis; socioeconomic conditions; temperature effect; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862176294

The analysis is based on the experimental results of a Greek state funded research project (Hi-Bred fuels), which investigated the integrated management of energy crops for both biofuel and energy production. Four crops, some new for Greek agriculture and other indigenous, namely rapeseed, soya, sunflower and cotton, were cultivated under ""real farming"" conditions, keeping detailed data of all important aspects affecting their environmental profile. The main industrial processes employed in Greece for extracting, processing and esterifying vegetable oil from the oleiferous seeds were also identified and studied in detail. The data collected during the various production steps were introduced in Global Emission Model for Integrated Systems (GEMIS) software in order to create production cycle models of both non-esterified (straight vegetable oil) and esterified (biodiesel) biofuel models. Dedicated experiments were performed on a diesel passenger car in order to investigate the applicability of the final products. Results indicate that sunflower has the optimal environmental characteristics with respect to biofuel production with potential GHG savings of 58-71% depending on the end product. Rapeseed followed with GHG savings potential of 48%-62%, soyabean oil (47%-60%) and cottonseed oil (35%-47%). For the different products, and production steps, the results of the analysis for energy, CO 2 equivalent emissions and other pollutant emissions are presented. Results concerning energy crops adaptability in Greek climate conditions and their product yields were quite promising, with the exception of the watering demands, which in some cases were not sustainable (GHG savings below 35%). Vehicle application results indicate that on a low level concentration (up to 10%v/v) all biofuels may be employed without important effects on vehicle emissions.

Two methods of deposition from the MoSe 2(Ni) target were used: deposition with unhindered expansion of the laser plume (standard PLD) and deposition of a plume scattered in collisions with Ar gas (pressure 2Pa) in the shadow of a mask (shadow-masked PLD - SMPLD). Doping with carbon by PLD was used in all cases, and carbon content in the composite Mo-Se-Ni-C coatings was varied in the range 35-85.5at.%. Pure MoSe x(Ni) coatings were also prepared by PLD and SMPLD. Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy of helium ions, scanning electron and atomic force microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, transmission electron microscopy and micro-diffraction, micro-Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and hardness evaluation were all used for comparative studies of the coatings obtained by PLD and SMPLD/PLD. In the PLD coatings, micron-sized particles were found, consisting of pure Ni or MoSe 2, as well as nanometre-sized particles of monocrystalline Mo. The nanoparticles were distributed on the surface and in an amorphous matrix in all PLD coatings. Within the amorphous matrix of the Mo-Se-Ni-C coatings, local ordering of atoms was detected, causing the formation of a mixture of amorphous carbon, Mo-C, and Mo-Se phases. Increasing the carbon content caused an increase in the content of sp 3 bonds in the carbon phase, and an increase in the hardness of the coatings. SMPLD/PLD coatings had no micro- and nanoparticles, but these coatings were characterized by high selenium content and reduced density. Doping with carbon in the SMPLD/PLD configuration caused the formation of composite coatings containing Mo-Se and amorphous carbon phases as in the PLD coatings, but the hardness of the composite SMPLD/PLD coatings was significantly lower than even the hardness of the pure PLD MoSe x(Ni) coatings. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Hardness; MoSe x-based coating; Nanocomposite; Particles; Pulsed laser deposition; Structure","Amorphous carbon phasis; Amorphous matrices; Carbon content; Carbon phase; Codeposition; Comparative studies; Helium ion; Laser plumes; Local ordering; Micron-sized particles; Monocrystalline; Scanning electrons; Shadow mask; Amorphous carbon; Argon lasers; Atomic force microscopy; Deposition; Electron probe microanalysis; Elementary particles; Film preparation; Hardness; Nanocomposites; Nanoparticles; Photoelectrons; Pulsed laser deposition; Raman spectroscopy; Selenium; Semiconducting selenium compounds; Structure (composition); Transmission electron microscopy; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Composite coatings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864124770

The purpose of this paper is to develop a systems-based bottom-up approach for this purpose, and to demonstrate its application in a case study of office building stock in the State of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia. A conceptual framework for the general method is developed based on a cross-typology matrix of energy consumption and supply on the one hand, and intervention schemes or policy instruments on the other. This is then tested and demonstrated using a case study of commercial office building stock, with building energy demand calculated using a validated computer energy simulation tool for a representative set of office buildings within a local government area (LGA). The energy consumption and associated GHG emissions are then aggregated up from LGA to the whole State. The impact projections of different intervention schemes are compared and mapped spatially across the State. Results have demonstrated the significance and capability of the proposed approach, in allowing quantitative comparisons of the relative effectiveness of a specific set of regulatory, technical and behavioral scenario settings on the spatial distribution and trends in energy consumption and GHG emissions of the NSW office building stock to 2020. Further case studies involving mixed building types and specific building types with greater granularity of modelling details, energy use and supply options, and spatial resolution are needed. The structured cross-typology approach is a novel contribution to bottom-up modelling approaches to designing and/or assessing the effectiveness of specific policy instruments, alone or in combination. It will enable policy makers, property portfolio owners, utility companies and building tenants to assess the broader impacts of their specific actions towards a common goal. © 2012, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","Australia; Bottom-up; Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Efficiency; Greenhouse gas; Spatial analysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993026863

In this study, the GIS-based Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (GEPIC) model was used to examine the effects of resampling input data from a resolution of 5. arcmin to 10 and 30. arcmin on simulated crop grain yields. Maize cultivation in the USA was used as a case study. The biggest impact was found to be the resampling of land use datasets. Rain-fed and irrigated areas are simulated separately and the yields are subsequently weighted according to irrigated and rain-fed fractions in each grid cell. The aggregation causes some grid cells to become rain-fed and irrigated at coarser resolutions after being only rain-fed or only irrigated at 5. arcmin. The estimated yield can increase or decrease largely in the affected grid cells due to the fact that irrigated areas generally have much higher yields than rain-fed agriculture in dry regions. The resampling of the climate data has a low impact on crop yields. However, changes in yield can still be large in regions with rain-fed agriculture and low precipitation. The aggregation of soil data by selecting the major soil type within neighboring grid cells has the lowest impact on crop yields. The impact of resampling input data from 5 to 10 and 30. arcmin is not significant when modeled maize yields were aggregated on the US national scale, and still quite comparable at the state level. Therefore, for estimating agricultural productivity over large areas, the coarser resolutions can be considered sufficient. Fine resolutions can be important when the goal is to make spatially detailed conclusions. Model performance shows that large deviations between simulated and reported yields can occur at all spatial resolutions in grid cells with harvested areas below 5% of the total cell area. This indicates that a sampling approach that uses representative pixels is preferable to a wall to wall approach using all grid cells. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","GIS-based EPIC; Model performance; Spatial aggregation; Uncertainty","Agricultural productivity; Climate data; Coarser resolution; Crop grain yields; Crop yield; Data sets; Dry region; Environmental policy; Fine resolution; GIS-based EPIC; Grid cells; Higher yield; Input datas; Large deviations; Large-scale modeling; Maize yield; Model performance; Resampling; Soil data; Soil types; Spatial aggregation; Spatial resolution; Uncertainty; Cells; Computer simulation; Cultivation; Cytology; Input output programs; Rain; agricultural modeling; agricultural production; agricultural soil; climate effect; climate modeling; crop yield; cultivation; data set; environmental policy; GIS; harvesting; irrigation system; maize; productivity; rainfed agriculture; sampling; soil type; yield response; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860362268

The specific forms of governance shaping the program, by contrast, have received much less attention. While the program, like PES in general, is commonly considered a paradigmatically neoliberal market-based conservation mechanism, its actual operation to date has deviated substantially from this description. Despite program planners' express intent to establish self-regulating markets for the direct transfer of payments from consumers of ecosystem services to their producers, such markets have yet to become widespread, and the program remains supported primarily by strong state intervention in various forms. Thus, while the program's ostensive success in combating deforestation has been widely praised, we suggest that its relative inability to establish a free-standing market to accomplish this aim may be equally instructive. For instance, the ambitious Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) mechanism envisioned to mitigate climate change on a global scale takes PES as one of its main sources of inspiration, a perspective that may be complicated by acknowledgment of such gaps between vision and execution in neoliberal conservation governance. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Conservation; Costa Rica; Governance; Neoliberalism; Payment for environmental services","climate change; deforestation; environmental degradation; environmental management; governance approach; nature conservation; neoliberalism; Costa Rica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858160610

The environmental impact of national and regional development plans must be assessed in compliance with the EU Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) Directive (2001/42/EC). Here, we quantify the environmental impact of an Irish Government bioenergy plan to replace 30% of peat used in three peat-burning power stations, located within the midlands region, with biomass. Four plan alternatives for supplying biomass to the power plant were considered in this study: (1) importation of palm kernel shell from south-east Asia, (2) importation of olive cake pellets from Spain and (3) growing either willow or (4) Miscanthus in the vicinity of the power stations. The impact of each alternative on each of the environmental receptors proposed in the SEA Directive was first quantified before the data were normalized on either an Irish, regional or global scale. Positive environmental impacts were very small compared to the negative environmental impacts for each of the plan alternatives considered. Comparison of normalized indicator values confirmed that the adverse environmental consequences of each plan alternative are concentrated at the location where the biomass is produced. The analysis showed that the adverse environmental consequences of biomass importation are substantially greater than those associated with the use of willow and Miscanthus grown on former grassland. The use of olive cake pellets had a greater adverse environmental effect compared to the use of peat whereas replacement of peat with either willow or Miscanthus feedstocks led to a substantial reduction in environmental pressure. The proposed assessment framework combines the scope of SEA with the quantitative benefits of life cycle assessment and can be used to evaluate the environmental consequences of bioenergy plans. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Miscanthus; Olive cake; Palm kernel; Peat; Strategic environmental assessment; Willow","Biomass; Environmental impact assessments; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Peat; Pelletizing; Regional planning; Miscanthus; Olive cake; Palm kernel; Strategic environmental assessments; Willow; Environmental impact; Miscanthus; Salix",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866608820

This cost can make the difference between an economically viable and an unviable CCS project. Therefore, optimising transport costs is important in minimising overall costs. Although the timing of the deployment of CCS network components is a highly relevant aspect of network design, it also increases the complexity of the design problem significantly. As a first approximation, this paper describes a procedure for obtaining near-optimal CO 2 pipeline networks with minimal cost per tonne of CO 2 avoided, under the simplifying assumption of fixed steady state flow. The effect of a staged deployment of CCS over time is therefore not considered for this analysis.The procedure presented in this paper is a high-level decision tool that can help determine which characteristics of a CO 2 transport network are most important from the point of view of reducing the cost of avoiding CO 2. The design procedure allows the specification of multiple emission sources, capture plants and injection locations, and does not assume a predefined fluid velocity inside the pipelines, but uses a genetic algorithm for minimising the cost of the network per tonne of CO 2 avoided. The total cost of the CCS network includes the costs of building, operating and decommissioning the capture plants, pipeline network and injection sites.As a case study, the procedure is used to design a CCS network for a set of emission sources in the south-eastern Queensland region in Australia. Different emission sources and injection locations are considered. All emission sources are assumed to commence deployment of CCS concurrently and all pipelines and injection facilities are assumed to begin operating at the same time. The pipeline network obtained from applying this procedure is compared to existing pipeline routes.The near-optimal network transports all of the captured CO 2 in a branching network and stores the CO 2 close to the emission sources. It was found that the near-optimal network design for this case is largely insensitive to variations of the modelling parameters within typical ranges. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","CCS economics; CCS network; CO 2 avoided; Optimization; Pipeline network","Australia; Branching Network; Decision tool; Design problems; Design procedure; Emission sources; Fluid velocities; Minimal cost; Network design; Overall costs; Pipeline networks; Queensland; Simplifying assumptions; Steady-state design; Steady-state flows; Total costs; Transport costs; Transport networks; Algorithms; Costs; Design; Economics; Optimization; Pipelines; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; complexity; cost-benefit analysis; genetic algorithm; network design; optimization; pipeline; Australia; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858219684

While many ground-based reports of declining vegetation productivity have been published over the last decades, a number of recent publications have shown a nuanced and, for some regions, positive picture. With this background, the paper provides an analysis of trends in vegetation greenness of semi-arid areas using AVHRR GIMMS from 1981 to 2007. The vegetation index dataset is used as a proxy for vegetation productivity and trends are analyzed for characterization of changes in semi-arid vegetation greenness. Calculated vegetation trends are analyzed with gridded data on potential climatic constraints to plant growth to explore possible causes of the observed changes. An analysis of changes in the seasonal variation of vegetation greenness and climatic drivers is conducted for selected regions to further understand the causes of observed inter-annual vegetation changes in semi-arid areas across the globe. It is concluded that semi-arid areas, across the globe, on average experience an increase in greenness (0.015 NDVI units over the period of analysis). Further it is observed that increases in greenness are found both in semi-arid areas where precipitation is the dominating limiting factor for plant production (0.019 NDVI units) and in semi-arid areas where air temperature is the primarily growth constraint (0.013 NDVI units). Finally, in the analysis of changes in the intra-annual variation of greenness it is found that seemingly similar increases in greenness over the study period may have widely different explanations. This implies that current generalizations, claiming that land degradation is ongoing in semi-arid areas worldwide, are not supported by the satellite based analysis of vegetation greenness. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Air temperature; AVHRR GIMMS NDVI; Incoming shortwave radiation; MODIS NDVI; Phenology; Precipitation; Semi-arid; Vegetation greenness","Air temperature; AVHRR GIMMS NDVI; MODIS NDVI; Phenology; Semi arid; Short-wave radiation; Vegetation greenness; Arid regions; Atmospheric temperature; Phenols; Precipitation (chemical); Productivity; Vegetation; Climate change; air temperature; annual variation; AVHRR; data set; generalist; global change; growth rate; land degradation; limiting factor; mathematical analysis; phenology; precipitation (climatology); primary production; satellite imagery; semiarid region; shortwave radiation; sustainability; vegetation index",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857414617

The vegetation and flora are dynamic, changing even now, and have changed dramatically during the past millennia, along with shifting climate and human presences. This is the first publication for any region of a comprehensive temporal flora and spans more than 43,000 years of plants inadvertently collected and curated by packrats (Neotoma spp.) and more recently by botanists. We document a present-day flora of 227 species in 175 genera and 46 families. We also document at least 119 species in 96 genera and 36 families from the fossil record and among these fossils at least 28 species in 17 genera and 6 families are no longer present in the region. The most diverse families, present-day and fossil taxa, are Asteraceae, Poaceae, Boraginaceae, Cactaceae, Brassicaceae, Fabaceae, Solanaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Polygonaceae, and Nyctaginaceae. The most diverse genera are Cryptantha, Ambrosia, and Erlogonum. There are 12 non-native species in the flora, representing only 5.3% of the modern flora, but only Sahara mustard (Brassica tournefortii) and Arabian grass (Schismus arabicus) are likely to negatively impact the native plants. The famous waterholes, the Tinajas Altas, were critical for desert travelers and prehistoric people. The Tinajas Altas Mountains, in one of the most arid parts of North America, have one of the richest fossil records for Ice Age plants in the world. The radiocarbon-dated plant assemblages provide a detailed record of dramatic changes in geographic ranges of species and the succession from Ice Age woodlands to modern desertscrub. Prior to 11,000 years ago in the middle and late Wisconsin, Ice Age woodlands with single-leaf pinyon (Pinus monophylla), California juniper (Juniperus californica), Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma), Sonoran scrub oak (Quercus turbinella), and Joshua tree (Yucca brevifolia) were at Tinajas Altas and elsewhere in Sonoran Desert lowlands. The earliest known creosotebush (Larrea divaricata) in North America, 18,000 years before present, from a Tinajas Altas midden, was already the modern tetraploid Sonoran Desert race. The Tinajas Altas region encompasses 80,000 acres (32,375 hectares) adjoining the western margin of the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and is within the Barry M. Goldwater Range.

Structural tests on carbon-epoxy laminate reveal that thermally-activated weakening of the fibre reinforcement is the dominant softening process which leads to failure in the event of a fire. This process is experimentally investigated by determining the reduction to the tensile properties and identifying the softening mechanism of T700 carbon fibre following exposure to simulated fires of different temperatures (up to 700°C) and atmospheres (air and inert). The fibre modulus decreases with increasing temperature (above ∼500°C) in air, which is attributed to oxidation of the higher stiffness layer in the near-surface fibre region. The fibre modulus is not affected when heated in an inert (nitrogen) atmosphere due to the absence of surface oxidation, revealing that the stiffness loss of carbon fibre composites in fire is sensitive to the oxygen content. The tensile strength of carbon fibre is reduced by nearly 50% following exposure to temperatures over the range 400-700°C in an air or inert atmosphere. Unlike the fibre modulus, the reduction in fibre strength is insensitive to the oxygen content of the atmosphere during fire. The reduction in strength is possibly attributable to very small (under ∼100 nm) flaws and removal of the sizing caused by high temperature exposure. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","A.

We studied the general biology, distribution and climatic limits of seven chestnut species from around the world. We provided climatic matching of Asiatic species to North America to assist the range-wide restoration of American chestnut [C. dentata (Marsh.) Borkh.] by incorporating blight-resistant genes from Asiatic species. Location North America, Europe and East Asia. Methods General chestnut biology was reviewed on the basis of published literature and field observations. Chestnut distributions were established using published range maps and literature. Climatic constraints were analysed for the northern and southern distribution limits and the entire range for each species using principal component analysis (PCA) of fourteen bioclimatic variables. Climatic envelope matching was performed for three Chinese species using Maxent modelling to predict corresponding suitable climate zones for those species in North America. Results Chestnuts are primarily distributed in the warm-temperate and subtropical zones in the northern hemisphere. PCA results revealed that thermal gradient was the primary control of chestnut distribution. Climatic spaces of different species overlap with one another to different degrees, but strong similarities are shown especially between Chinese species and American species. Climatic envelope matching suggested that large areas in eastern North America have a favourable climate for Chinese species. Main conclusions The general biological traits and climatic limits of the seven chestnut species are very similar. The predictions of Chinese species climatic range corresponded with most of the historical American chestnut range. Thus, a regionally adapted, blight-resistant, introgressed hybrid American chestnut appears feasible if a sufficiently diverse array of Chinese chestnut germplasm is used as a source of blight resistance. Our study provided a between-continent climate matching approach to facilitate the range-wide species restoration, which can be readily applied in planning the restoration of other threatened or endangered species. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","American chestnut; Climatic envelope matching; Conservation biogeography; Fagaceae; Restoration; Species distribution modelling","biogeography; climatic region; deciduous tree; economic analysis; endangered species; gene expression; germplasm; Northern Hemisphere; numerical model; population distribution; population modeling; principal component analysis; restoration ecology; subtropical region; temperate environment; Asia; North America; Castanea; Castanea dentata; Castanea mollissima; Fagaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863606266

The United States played a hegemonic leadership role in building the post-war multilateral order, but has been reluctant to embrace many recent multilateral treaty initiatives championed by its traditional European allies, such as the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, the International Criminal Court, or the verification protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention. European responses to US objections, however, have varied across these different transatlantic controversies. In some cases, European decision-makers watered down or abandoned contested treaties, whereas in others, they opted for regime-building excluding the US, that is, for a strategy of non-hegemonic cooperation. How Europeans choose to deal with the 'reluctant hegemon' has critical implications for how key global challenges are addressed-yet, the variation of their responses has been largely overlooked in a scholarly debate fixated on understanding US policy. This book fills this important gap by studying European strategic choices in five recent transatlantic conflicts over multilateral agreements. It argues that neither realist accounts of global power dynamics nor rational institutionalist models of cooperation can fully explain why Europeans opt for non-hegemonic cooperation in some cases but not others. To resolve this puzzle, we need to combine rationalist propositions with constructivist insights about normative constraints on states' institutional choices. By developing such an integrated model, the book sheds new light on the long-standing theoretical debate about the relationship between hegemony and international cooperation. © Caroline Fehl 2012.

However, wind energy has a larger land footprint per Gigawatt (GW) than most other forms of energy production and has known and predicted adverse effects on wildlife. The Northern Great Plains (NGP) is home both to some of the world's best wind resources and to remaining temperate grasslands, the most converted and least protected ecological system on the planet. Thus, appropriate siting and mitigation of wind development is particularly important in this region. Steering energy development to disturbed lands with low wildlife value rather than placing new developments within large and intact habitats would reduce impacts to wildlife. Goals for wind energy development in the NGP are roughly 30 GW of nameplate capacity by 2030. Our analyses demonstrate that there are large areas where wind development would likely have few additional impacts on wildlife. We estimate there are ~1,056 GW of potential wind energy available across the NGP on areas likely to have low-impact for biodiversity, over 35 times development goals. New policies and approaches will be required to guide wind energy development to low-impact areas. © 2012 Fargione et al.",,"article; biodiversity; conservation biology; energy resource; energy yield; environmental impact; geographic distribution; landscape ecology; wildlife; wind power; Biodiversity; Midwestern United States; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864338938

The authors evaluated the hormonal activities (estrogenic/anti-estrogenic activities, androgenic/anti-androgenic activities) and genotoxicity of various effluents from textile and dyeing plants, electronic and electroplate factories, pulp and paper mills, fine chemical factories, and municipal wastewater treatment plants in the Pearl River Delta region by using in vitro bioassays (yeast estrogen screen [YES]; yeast androgen screen [YAS]; and genotoxicity assay [umu/SOS]) combined with chemical analysis. The results demonstrated the presence of estrogenic, anti-estrogenic, and anti-androgenic activity in most industrial effluents, whereas no androgenic activities were detected in all of the effluents. The measured estrogenic activities expressed as estradiol equivalent concentrations (EEQs) ranged from below detection (3 of 26 samples) to 40.7ng/L, with a mean of 7.33ng/L in all effluents. A good linear relationship was found between the EEQs measured by YES bioassay and the EEQs calculated from chemical concentrations. These detected estrogenic compounds, such as 4-nonylphenol and estrone, were responsible for the estrogenic activities in the effluents. The genotoxic effects expressed as benzo[a]pyrene equivalent concentrations (BaP EQs) varied between below detection and 88.2μg/L, with a mean of 8.76μg/L in all effluents.

Agriculture is extremely vulnerable to these climatic changes, and in most regions of the world, productivity and yields are likely to suffer from shifting seasons and heightened weather variability. These changes could lead to higher food prices for the main food crops and undermine global food security. However, agriculture is also part of the problem of climate change. Together with land-use change and deforestation, it is a large contributor to global GHG emissions. In order to face the challenge of climate change, the carbon intensity of agriculture must be reduced in a way that will not compromise the food security of poor people. With the right innovations, investments, and policy incentives in place, low GHG emission agriculture practices can help mitigate the effects of climate change, reduce emissions while contributing to food security.

For this, bivalve mollusk, Anodonta cygnea, at three sites, with mixed agricultural and municipal activities (A), close to a municipal water inlet (F) and the cooling pond of a nuclear power plant (N), were studied in spring, summer, and autumn. The set of parameters included the characteristics of oxidative stress (activity of catalase (CAT), levels of protein carbonyls (PC)), levels of reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH, GSSG, respectively), activities of lactate dehydrogenase (LD), cholinesterase (ChE), ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the digestive gland, and concentrations of vitellogenin-like proteins (Vtg-LP) in gonads and also morphological indices. Although the discriminant functional analysis confirmed the general seasonal regularities for studied groups, it allowed to discriminate between sites (P < 0.05). At site A, oxidative stress; high levels of LD, EROD, and GST; and low levels of ChE and condition factor were reflected. This demonstrated the sensitivity of mussels to constant effect of mixed pollution. At site N, oxidative injury was shown that might be explained by the constantly high temperature. At site F, abrupt elevations of Vtg-LP and EROD levels in autumn were probably related to an emergency situation on the nearby dump. So, both chronic and temporal environmental effects were reflected by a set of markers in mollusk.

In this study, we attempted to answer the following questions: (i) how have the conditions during the last 2-3 centuries affected ATE tree growth (physiology) and recruitment (demography)? and (ii) how strong is synchrony between these two processes at the ATEs? 2. We used spatial sampling grids at different ATEs in two ecosystems on two subcontinents: Nothofagus pumilio in the Andes of Chilean Patagonia (46°SL) and Pinus albicaulis in the Rockies of Western Montana, USA (46°NL). Basal increment cores were extracted from trees to estimate the growth and recruitment date. An annual detrended basal area increment was estimated for each tree and was modelled against elevation and time. Tree growth improved over multiple centuries at all tree lines. Recently (c. 50years), however, improvements are disappearing or reversing. The uppermost tree line trees showed moderate declines in Montana and incipient declines in Patagonia. The declines are most dramatic slightly below current tree line (c. 200m). Tree recruitment patterns showed that tree lines have been moving uphill in both regions until at least 40-70years ago. These movements occurred primarily through abrupt pulses upward with infilling occurring concurrently (Patagonia) or at some time thereafter (Montana). Synchrony between growth and recruitment occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries in both regions. This synchrony was negative in Patagonia and positive in Montana, with varying lag periods. During the 20th century, these patterns of synchrony were lost at all sites. This loss of synchrony suggests that we could be entering a global period in which temperature is no longer the dominant driver of key features of tree lines. Synthesis. Our study shows that at two structurally different tree lines, recent and initial declines in growth and losses of long-term synchrony are occurring in the latter part of the 20th century. These findings are opposite to simplistic expectations of global warming effects on tree line dynamics and call for a model reformulation that uncouples drivers of growth and recruitment. © 2012 The Authors.

Integration of heat-driven absorption cooling (AC) technology in a district heating and cooling (DHC) system raises the district heat (DH) demand during low-demand periods and may thus contribute to a more efficient resource utilisation. In Sweden, AC expansion is a potentially interesting option since the cooling demand is rapidly increasing, albeit from low levels, and DH systems cover most of the areas with potential cooling demand. This study aims to assess the potential for cost and CO 2 emission reduction due to expansion of DH-driven AC instead of electricity-driven compression cooling in the DHC system of Göteborg, characterised by a high share of low-cost excess heat sources. The DHC production is simulated on an hourly basis using the least-cost model MARTES. Despite recent advances of compression chillers, the results show potential for cost-effective CO 2 emission reduction by AC expansion, which is robust with regards to the different scenarios applied of energy market prices and policies. While the effects on annual DHC system results are minor, the study illustrates that an increased cooling demand may be met by generation associated with low or even negative net CO 2 emissions - as long as there is high availability of industrial excess heat in the DHC system, or if e.g. new biomass-based combined heat and power capacity is installed, due to the avoided and replaced marginal power generation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The ability of a plant community to return to its original state after a disturbance (community resilience) depends on species composition and environmental conditions. The aim of this study is to analyze initial short-term effects of disturbance in alpine plant communities in contrasting climates (oceanic vs. continental; central Norway). We used a nested block-design to examine vegetative regrowth and seedling recruitment after experimental perturbation. Three plant community types along the snow pack gradient were exposed to (1) no disturbance, (2) clipping, and (3) clipping and uprooting. Slow vegetative regrowth and low seedling establishment rates were found in dry alpine ridges and late-melting oceanic snowbed communities. Leeside habitats with intermediate snow conditions were found more resilient. The difference was related to growth form and species diversity. Woody species, which dominated in ridges and oceanic snowbeds, showed the most negative response to disturbance. Species-rich plant communities dominated by graminoids and herbs showed higher rates of regrowth. Species richness seems to cause resilience to the plant communities through higher response diversity. Plant communities at the extreme ends of abiotic gradients, ridges and late-melting snowbeds, will be most sensitive to both disturbance and environmental change. In an up-scaled human-used landscape disturbance effects will be amplified and further limit recovery to a pre-disturbance state. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2012.","Climate gradients; Experimental perturbation; Linear effect models; Ordination analyses; Plant growth form; Revegetation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863635204

However, a major challenge with current state-of-the-art nickel-based anodes is their propensity to form deteriorous carbon deposits in DIR, unless excess steam is introduced in the fuel. Reduced fuel humidification levels are desirable from the viewpoints of cell performance, reliability and plant economics. This study explores the use of partial recycling of the anode exhaust as a mitigation strategy against carbon deposits at fuel steam-to-carbon ratios less than unity. Using a detailed computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model which couples momentum, heat, mass and charge transport with electrochemical and chemical reactions, the spatial extent of carbon deposition within a SOFC anode is analyzed by accounting for both the cracking and Boudouard reactions, for several fuel humidification and recycling conditions. At temperatures of approximately 1173K and for inlet fuel molar H2O/CH4 ratios between 0.5 and 1, 50% (mass%) fuel recycling is found to be an effective strategy against carbon deposition. For lower recycling levels at the same fuel compositions, or lower fuel humidification levels (regardless of the recycling level), fuel recycling reduces the risk of coking, but does not eliminate it. The analyses presented suggest that recycling of the anodic fuel stream could help extend the operational range of DIR-SOFCs to lower fuel humidification levels than typically considered, with reduced risks of carbon deposits, while reducing system cost and complexity in terms of steam production. For dry or weakly humidified fuels, additional mitigation strategies would be required. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon deposition; CFD; Internal reforming; Methane; Recycling; SOFC","Carbon; Computational fluid dynamics; Deposits; Methane; Nickel deposits; Numerical analysis; Recycling; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Carbon deposites; Carbon deposition; Cell performance; Computational fluid dynamic (CFD); Direct internal reforming; Fuel compositions; Fuel recycling; Fuel stream; Humidification levels; Internal reforming; Methane reforming; Mitigation strategy; Operational range; Plant economics; Reducing systems; SOFC anode; Spatial extent; Steam production; Steam-to-carbon ratio; Fuels; carbon; computational fluid dynamics; electrochemical method; electrode; fuel cell; mathematical analysis; methane; nickel; numerical model; oxide; recycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857997562

Such a problem is more striking in metropolitans where accumulating population, vehicles and industries, altogether produces large amounts of pollution. A discernible example is Isfahan city and province. Isfahan has one of the largest steel-producing facilities in the entire region as well as facilities for producing special alloys. Isfahan contains a major oil refinery and a large aircraft manufacturing plant. Unfortunately, on the other side, this city is one of most polluted cities in Iran. In recent years, this problem turned to be more severe due to climate changes. Consequently, finding clean and efficient solutions to contaminant industries is crucial. It should be noted that among the mentioned industries located in Isfahan, steel making plants play a major role in air pollution. In fact, in every metric ton of steel produced, 10 to 25 kilograms of dust is accumulated. Further, a large portion of exhaust gases of electric arc furnaces (EAF) consists of CO, NOx and Sox, which proved to be a threat to human health and environment. Thus, control and reduction of pollution production in steel making plants is essential. Until now, various clean air solutions to EAFs and fume de-dusting systems, have been developed. Definitely, there is no question that de-dusting systems are crucial. However, the costs and outlay of fume extraction systems operation should be no higher than absolute necessary. To be practical, the most important goals are high efficiency, compliance with prescribed threshold values and low consumption of energy. One reliable and feasible method to ensure the functionality and efficiency of these systems are Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations. In such a modeling, the effect of various parameters can be studied, which leads to improved designs and higher efficiencies. Therefore, developing models for de-dusting systems of steel making plants would be a useful practice. Despite several studies in the field of modeling and optimization of fume extraction systems, no one has addressed the problem of turbulent reactive two-phase flow in industrial fume de-dusting systems and investigations are limited to approximate zero or one dimensional thermodynamic solutions. The present study aims to fill this gap in literature. In this paper the Mobarakeh Steel Making Plant is examined and the effect of operating parameters on the overall fume de-dusting system performance and efficiency is investigated. Materials and Methods: The mathematical model of processes inside the fume extraction system is constituted of four different parts: swirling turbulent flow, Heat and mass transport by convection, chemical reactions and radiation. Hence, in order to model the problem, five sets of equations should be solved: continuity, momentum, energy (including radiation), species transport and turbulent flow modeling equations (in time averaged form). Further, in the aim of simplicity some assumptions including steady-state incompressible flow and negligible transient effects are made. Moreover, in the calculation of turbulence terms, in averaged form equations, boussinesq method is used. It should be noted that, the computational domain covered the entire system and a 3D model of the system is generated. A total number of 3,600,000 tetrahedral elements are used for simulation. Efforts were made to keep the wall parameter y+ in the desired range (30-60). Further, the number of meshes is tested to ensure the mesh independence of the numerical solutions. Results and Discussion: In the aim of model validation, fume extraction system of ""Mobarakeh Steel Making Paint"" of Iran has been selected. As there is no data available for fluid flow and properties inside the system, temperature and composition of exhaust gases were compared with operational parameters. This comparison showed a maximum error up to 3 percent in predicting temperature and up to 11 percent in predicting the mass fraction of oxygen in expelled gases. Therefore, an acceptable agreement between the developed model and the actual system was observed. After the validation of developed model, the model was implemented to study the effect of various system parameters and the flow patterns in different parts of the fume extraction system. Besides, the effect of gap size (as the most important controlling variable) was investigated on the temperature and composition of exhaust gases. In table 1, the variations in the mass fraction of various chemical species along the system different sections, is shown. (Table Presented) The obtained results show that, increasing the volume of excess air, leads to a change and reduction in the emission of CO. However, at the same time, in such a condition excess air will have a higher chance for reaction with Hydrogen and Carbon Mono-Oxide, which results in higher rates of exothermic reactions, higher temperatures and the increasing velocities of products. Consequently, the possibility of deposition and settlement of dust particles in gravitational settling chamber is reduced (due to its higher velocities) and efficiency of particle collection descends. The de-dusting system includes various types of filtration for dust particles. The bigger particles are separated from main flow in settling chamber which is gravitational settler and small particles are eliminated using bag filters. So it is very important to calculate the collection efficiency of settling/combustion chamber in a variety of particle size distributions. The results are depicted in a column diagram (see Fig. 1). A careful examination of this diagram reveals that only particles with a diameter greater than 5 μm are eliminated from the main flow in a significant percent and the collection efficiency falls below the 30 percents for the sizing of below 1μm. This incompetent behavior is due to the structure of gravitational settlers, which depend mainly on gravity for collection of the particles. In such systems, the particle-laden gas stream enters the expansion section of the system. Expansion of the gas stream causes the gas velocity to be reduced. At reduced gas velocities (in the range of 0.3-3.0 m/s) the larger particles are acted on preferentially by gravity and fall into the dust hoppers. However, the terminal velocity is much smaller for smaller particles and they have enough time to travel through the settling chamber and not to fall into the lower down dust collectors. As a result, this particles need to be omitted from bulk, in bag filters. (Figure Presented) Moreover, a careful examination of the flow patterns in settling chamber, distinct the effect of sharp edges in settling chamber geometry, on system performance. In other words, the abrupt changes of geometry, results in the formation of vortical flows inside the domain and thus an increase in residence time of particles and deposition performance. It should be noted that, the mentioned bag filters are very sensitive to high gas temperatures and might be damaged at excessive degrees. Consequently, controlling the gas temperature before theses filters is crucial. In fume extraction systems different control equipments are incorporated. One of the most efficient and effective devices is the air gap on the EAF tilting elbow which its size can be alternated by a sliding sleeve. It can be deduced from the simulation results that, the increase in air gap size, leads to the reduction of CO due to the increasing rate of combustion. This phenomenon, in turn, results in an increase in gas temperature, which is not desirable due to metallurgical consideration of different system elements.","Computational fluid dynamics; De-dusting solutions; Practical approach; Steel making plant","Auchenorrhyncha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921715321

Three biomass-tobiofuel processes are considered: anaerobic digestion of biomass (biogas), biomass gasification (synthesis gas) and alcoholic fermentation of biomass and dehydration (bioethanol), each of them with two different biomass substrates (energy crops and municipal solid waste) as input. The gas turbine behaviour in a Brayton cycle is simulated both in an isolated operation and in combined cycle. The differences in gas turbine performance when fired with the considered biofuels compared to natural gas are studied from different points of view related with the current complex energetic context: energetic and exergetic efficiency of the simple/combined cycle and CO2 emissions. Two different tools have been used for the simulations, each one with a different approach: while PATITUG (own software) analyses the behaviour of a generic gas turbine allowing a total variability of parameters, GT-PRO (commercial software) is more rigid, albeit more precise in the prediction of real gas turbine behaviour. Different potentially interesting configurations and its thermodynamic parameters have been simulated in order to obtain the optimal range for all of them and its variation for each fuel.

PTS activity has a crucial role in the global signaling system that controls the preferential consumption of glucose over other carbon sources. When the cell is exposed to carbohydrate mixtures, the PTS prevents the expression of catabolic genes and activity of non-PTS sugars transport systems by carbon catabolite repression (CCR). This process defines some metabolic and physiological constraints that must be considered during the development of production strains. In this review, we summarize the importance of the PTS in controlling and influencing both PTS and non-PTS sugar transport processes as well as the mechanisms of transcriptional control involved in the expression of catabolic genes of non-PTS sugars in E. coli. We discuss three main approaches applied efficiently to avoid these constraints resulting in obtaining PTS- glc+ mutants useful for production purposes: (1) adaptive selection in chemostat culture system of PTS- mutants, resulting in the selection of strains that recovered the ability to grow in glucose, along with the simultaneous consumption of two carbon sources and reduced acetate production; (2) replacement in PTS- strains of the native GalP promoter by strong promoters or the substitution of this permease by recombinant glucose transport system; and (3) enhancement of Crp (crp+) in mgsA, pgi, and ptsG mutants, resulting in derivative strains that abolished CCR, allowing the simultaneous consumption of mixtures of sugars with low acetate production. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","Carbon catabolite repression; Escherichia coli; Metabolite production; PTS","Genes; Glucose; Metabolites; Mixtures; Platinum; Adaptive selection; Carbon catabolite repression; Metabolite production; Phosphoenolpyruvates; Phosphotransferase system; Production strain; Transcriptional control; Transport systems; Escherichia coli; acetic acid; beta galactosidase; carbohydrate; carbon; glucose; glucose transporter; glycerol; glycerol kinase; lactose; mutant protein; permease; phosphoenolpyruvate; phosphotransferase; tricarboxylic acid; Escherichia coli protein; phosphoenolpyruvate sugar phosphotransferase; carbohydrate; carbon; catabolism; coliform bacterium; enzyme activity; growth rate; metabolite; regression analysis; bacterial cell; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bacterium culture; bacterium mutant; biotechnological production; carbon source; catabolite repression; chemostat; citric acid cycle; energy transfer; Escherichia coli; gene expression regulation; glucose transport; glucose transport system; nonhuman; promoter region; review; sugar intake; sugar transport; transcription regulation; enzymology; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Escherichia coli; Catabolite Repression; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Phosphoenolpyruvate Sugar Phosphotransferase System",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867322381

Temperatures in northern Europe are expected to increase considerably, although there is substantial uncertainty about both the seasonal and average changes that will occur. In Scandinavia, production is predicted to increase across most of the area covered by boreal forest, since the growth of trees in the region is currently limited by temperature. Therefore, we have analyzed the importance of adapting management practices to future climate changes and considered possible ways to address associated stand management problems. For this purpose, we simulated climate scenarios with temperature increases ranging from 2.5 to 6.0°C over a 100-year period, and effects on typical Swedish stands with several species, then optimized their management with simulated annealing. The results indicate that the maximum considered temperature trend would raise the economic value of the stands by almost 5% more than the minimum trend. However, the importance of optimizing management plans in accordance with the correct temperature scenario appears to be limited. The plan optimized for the minimum temperature trend was only marginally inferior to the plan optimized for the maximum temperature trend in the maximum trend scenario, and vice versa. It also seemed adequate to use a deterministic formulation of the problem, and in cases where a stochastic climate change model generated more robust plans, the advantage could be attributed to model artifacts rather than climate change per se. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Climate change; Forest management planning; Simulated annealing; Uncertainty","boreal forest; climate change; climate effect; forest ecosystem; forest management; forestry production; growth response; management practice; stand structure; temperature effect; uncertainty analysis; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860917041

The cross-country comparison of the freight transportation sector indicates that per capita CO 2 emissions span a wide range and are mostly determined by local needs without full knowledge or coordination with policies and practices in other countries. Over the last several decades, while many developed countries have experienced decreased coupling between total freight activity (measured in tonne-km) and income, no major indication of decreased coupling between trucking and income was found. Rather, the coupling has been strengthened in many countries due to a continued increase in the share of trucking in total freight activity. The energy intensity of trucking has exhibited very large variation among the countries, and its recent international trends are mixed, providing greater challenges to reduce freight CO 2 emissions. Modal shift toward rail away from truck presents a sizeable opportunity to reduce freight CO 2 emissions, although the potential gain varies widely among the countries. © 2012.","CO 2 emissions; Energy efficiency; Freight transportation","Carbon emissions; Data availability; Developed countries; Energy intensity; Energy use; Freight activity; Modal shifts; Per capita; Energy efficiency; Freight transportation; Trucks; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; freight transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859776295

This work focuses on investigating exhaust emission pollutants from passenger cars for idle and slow acceleration (stop-and-go) traffic conditions. We found that vehicle emissions are minimal during idle mode for all vehicle categories. However, it was interesting to observe that during the slow acceleration mode HC and CO emissions increased for light vehicles with relatively high mileage (higher than 40,000 km).

However, estimation of the amount of carbon dioxide (CO 2) that can be captured in a given reservoir and the long-term storage stability remain a challenge. One difficulty lies in the estimation of local capillary pressure effects that arise from mineral surface heterogeneity inherent in underground geological formations. As a preliminary step to address this issue, we have performed dynamic pore network modelling (PNM) simulations of two-phase immiscible flow in two-dimensional structured porous media with contact angle heterogeneity under typical reservoir conditions. We begin by characterizing the network with a single, uniform contact angle. We then present saturation patterns for networks with homogeneous and heterogeneous contact angles distributions, based on two common reservoir minerals: quartz and mica, both of which have been well-characterized experimentally for their brine-CO 2 contact angles. At lower flow rates, we found moderately higher saturations for the heterogeneous networks than for the homogeneous ones. To characterize the fingering patterns, we have introduced R as the ratio of filled throats to the total network saturation. Based on this measure, the heterogeneous networks demonstrated thicker fingering patterns than the homogeneous networks. The computed saturation patterns demonstrate the importance of considering surface heterogeneity in pore-scale modelling of deep saline aquifers. © 2012 the Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862203584

Regime-shift analysis was used to detect thresholds in tree establishment during the entire period of record (1580-2000), temperature variables significantly correlated with establishment during the 20th century, and cool-season precipitation. Tree establishment was significantly correlated with minimum temperature during the spring (March-May) and cool season. Regime-shift analysis identified an abrupt increase in regional tree establishment in 1950 (1950-1954 age class). Coincident with this period was a shift toward reduced cool-season precipitation. The alignment of these climate conditions apparently triggered an abrupt increase in establishment that was unprecedented during the period of record. Two main findings emerge from this research that underscore the critical role of climate in governing regeneration dynamics within upper treeline ecotones. (1) Regional climate variability is capable of exceeding bioclimatic thresholds, thereby initiating synchronous and abrupt changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of tree establishment at broad regional scales. (2) The importance of climate parameters exceeding critical threshold values and triggering a regime shift in tree establishment appears to be contingent on the alignment of favorable temperature and moisture regimes. This research suggests that threshold changes in the climate system can fundamentally alter regeneration dynamics within upper treeline ecotones and, through the use of regime-shift analysis, reveals important climate-vegetation linkages. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","Age structure; Climate change; Dendrochronology; Ecotone; Latitudinal gradient; Regeneration dynamics; Regime shift; Rocky Mountains; Threshold; Timberline; Treeline; USA","age structure; climate change; dendrochronology; ecotone; precipitation (climatology); reconstruction; regeneration; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature effect; terrestrial ecosystem; threshold; treeline; altitude; article; climate change; ecosystem; geographic and geological phenomena; growth, development and aging; physiology; population dynamics; season; time; tree; United States; Altitude; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Geological Phenomena; Population Dynamics; Seasons; Time Factors; Trees; United States; Rocky Mountains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864215419

The objectives of this study are to: 1.assess the climate for evidence use in policy; 2.explore views and practices about current processes and weaknesses of health policymaking; 3.identify priorities including short-term requirements for policy briefs; and 4.identify country-specific requirements for establishing KT platforms.Methods: Senior policymakers, stakeholders and researchers from Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, and Yemen participated in this study. Questionnaires were used to assess the climate for use of evidence and identify windows of opportunity and requirements for policy briefs and for establishing KT platforms. Current processes and weaknesses of policymaking were appraised using case study scenarios. Closed-ended questions were analyzed descriptively. Qualitative data was analyzed using thematic analysis.Results: KT activities were not frequently undertaken by policymakers and researchers in EMR countries, research evidence about high priority policy issues was rarely made available, and interaction between policymakers and researchers was limited, and policymakers rarely identified or created places for utilizing research evidence in decision-making processes. Findings emphasized the complexity of policymaking. Donors, political regimes, economic goals and outdated laws were identified as key drivers. Lack of policymakers' abilities to think strategically, constant need to make quick decisions, limited financial resources, and lack of competent and trained human resources were suggested as main weaknesses.Conclusion: Despite the complexity of policymaking processes in countries from this region, the absence of a structured process for decision making, and the limited engagement of policymakers and researchers in KT activities, there are windows of opportunity for moving towards more evidence informed policymaking. © 2012 El-Jardali et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Eastern Mediterranean Countries; Evidence-Informed Policy; Knowledge Translation","Algeria; article; Bahrain; climate; Egypt; health care management; health care policy; human; Iran; Jordan; knowledge; knowledge translation; Lebanon; Oman; questionnaire; Southern Europe; Sudan; Syrian Arab Republic; thematic analysis; Tunisia; Yemen; Evidence-Based Medicine; Health Policy; Humans; International Cooperation; Mediterranean Region; Policy Making; Questionnaires; Translational Medical Research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860524517

These communities, known as cryptogamic covers, comprise variable proportions of cyanobacteria, algae, fungi, lichens and bryophytes, and are able to fix carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the atmosphere. However, their influence on global and regional biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nitrogen has not yet been assessed. Here, we analyse previously published data on the spatial coverage of cryptogamic communities, and the associated fluxes of carbon and nitrogen, in different types of ecosystem across the globe. We estimate that globally, cryptogamic covers take up around 3.9 Pg carbon per year, corresponding to around 7% of net primary production by terrestrial vegetation. We derive a nitrogen uptake by cryptogamic covers of around 49 Tg per year, suggesting that cryptogamic covers account for nearly half of the biological nitrogen fixation on land. We suggest that nitrogen fixation by cryptogamic covers may be crucial for carbon sequestration by plants. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The main feature of the model is that new technologies are not just risky, but also ambiguous. Pessimistic agents are thus averse to adopting a new technology. Learning is induced by optimists, who are willing to try out technologies about which there is little evidence available. We show that both optimists and pessimists are crucial for a successful adaptation. While optimists provide the public good of information which gives pessimists an incentive to innovate, pessimists choose the new technology persistently in the long-run which increases the average returns for the society. Hence, the optimal share of optimists in the society is strictly positive. When the share of optimists in the society is too low, innovation is slow and the obtained steady-state is inefficient. We discuss two policies which can potentially alleviate this inefficiency: Subsidies and provision of additional information. We show that if precise and relevant information is available, pessimists would be willing to pay for it and consequently adopt the new technology. Hence, providing information might be a more efficient policy, which is both self-financing and results in better social outcomes. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.","adaptation; ambiguity; case-based decision throry; Climate change; learning; optimism; pessimism; technology adoption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878653460

Concern has recently been expressed, however, that management interventions to increase carbon stocks may conflict with biodiversity conservation. Focusing on a large-scale rainforest rehabilitation project in northern Borneo, we examine the broad impacts of selective logging and subsequent carbon enhancement across a wide range of invertebrate fauna by comparing the abundance of 28 higher-level taxa within two separate rainforest strata (leaf-litter and understorey) across unlogged, naturally-regenerating and rehabilitated forest. We additionally assess changes in functional composition by examining responses of different feeding guilds. Responses of individual taxa to forest management were idiosyncratic but logging resulted in more than a 20% increase in total invertebrate abundance, with fewer than 20% of taxa in either stratum having significantly lower abundance in logged forest. Rehabilitation resulted in a marked reduction in abundance, particularly among leaf-litter detritivores, but overall, there were much smaller differences between unlogged and rehabilitated forest than between unlogged and naturally regenerating forest in both total invertebrate abundance and the abundances of different feeding guilds. This applied to both strata with the exception of understorey herbivores, which were more abundant in rehabilitated forest than elsewhere. These results support previous data for birds suggesting that carbon stock enhancement in these forests has only limited adverse effects on biodiversity, but with some impacts on abundance within particular guilds. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Arthropods; Biodiversity; Higher-taxon approach; Restoration; Sustainable forest management; Vertical stratification","abundance; arthropod; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; ecological impact; ecosystem response; forest management; habitat restoration; logging (timber); rainforest; species conservation; taxonomy; tropical forest; Borneo; Arthropoda; Aves; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864278487

In the studies conducted in lowland secondary forests, the bacterium Frankia was found to be critical for nitrogen-fixation in the soils associated with nitrogen-fixing tree Pentaclethra macroloba, but Frankia, Rhizobium, Archaea, and Type II methanotrophs were also collectively important in recuperation of the soil N and in enhancing microbial biomass C via more efficient use of organic C. These same secondary forest soils had greater levels of inorganic P and N, organic carbon, and microbial activity, and were more fungal-dominant soil ecosystem than grasslands of the same age. In an adjacent primary forest, the bromeliad Bromelia pinguin was found to demonstrate significant antifungal effects on the forest soil, resulting in decreases in fungal abundance, microbial biomass, and efficiency of organic C use. Lastly, in the Monteverde cloud forests, microbial metrics were used to show that habitats with the greatest soil moisture had more fungal-dominated soils, and unique fungal and bacterial population compositions. Given the importance of tropical soils in global C storage, their degradation, and current restoration efforts in these forests, as well as the very clear threat of decreases in precipitation due to climate change, belowground metrics should be considered as early indicators of the effects of forest restoration and/or further environmental disturbances.

Provincial Government, PO Box 9515, Victoria, BC V8W 9C2, Canada","Background: The default international accounting rules estimate the carbon emissions from forest products by assuming all harvest is immediately emitted to the atmosphere. This makes it difficult to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) consequences of different forest management or manufacturing activities that maintain the storage of carbon. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) addresses this issue by allowing other accounting methods. The objective of this paper is to provide a new model for estimating annual stock changes of carbon in harvested wood products (HWP).Results: The model, British Columbia Harvested Wood Products version 1 (BC-HWPv1), estimates carbon stocks and fluxes for wood harvested in BC from 1965 to 2065, based on new parameters on local manufacturing, updated and new information for North America on consumption and disposal of wood and paper products, and updated parameters on methane management at landfills in the USA. Based on model results, reporting on emissions as they occur would substantially lower BC's greenhouse gas inventory in 2010 from 48 Mt CO2 to 26 Mt CO2 because of the long-term forest carbon storage in-use and in the non-degradable material in landfills. In addition, if offset projects created under BC's protocol reported 100 year cumulative emissions using the BC-HWPv1 the emissions would be lower by about 11%.Conclusions: This research showed that the IPCC default methods overestimate the emissions North America wood products. Future IPCC GHG accounting methods could include a lower emissions factor (e.g. 0.52) multiplied by the annual harvest, rather than the current multiplier of 1.0. The simulations demonstrated that the primary opportunities for climate change mitigation are in shifting from burning mill waste to using the wood for longer-lived products. © 2012 Dymond; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Building science; C-accounting; Forest products; Landfill emissions; Life-cycle analysis","carbon balance; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; emission inventory; forest ecosystem; forest management; forestry production; greenhouse gas; harvesting; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; landfill; life cycle analysis; methane; waste disposal; British Columbia; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84870341763

Penalties for carbon emitted at the time of undertaking various silvicultural activities and exponential decay of wood products were also considered. We used life-cycle assessment to evaluate carbon emissions from various silvicultural activities. We modified the traditional Faustmann forest rotation model to incorporate identified carbon payments and penalties. Slash pine (Pinus elliottii) was selected as a representative species. We found that the overall global warming impact (GWI) for managing a hectare of intensively managed slash pine plantation was 6539. kg carbon dioxide equivalent. The maximum land expectation value (LEV) for the scenario when all carbon payments and penalties along with payments for timber products were considered was $1299/ha using a 20. year rotation age. This value is about 71% higher than the LEV when only payments for timber products were taken into account ($760/ha using a 21. year rotation age).

Mesozooplankton abundance, community structure, and environmental quality were compared at two sites in the inner Bahía Blanca Estuary (BBE), Argentina, one receiving regional sewage discharge (Canal Vieja), and the other a non-impacted area (Bahía del Medio). Comparisons of mean abundance and multivariate analyses were performed to detect spatial and temporal variations in both environmental and biotic variables. Significantly higher amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus and lower oxygen and pH were recorded at Canal Vieja. Larvae of the detritivorous crab Neohelice granulata were more abundant at Canal Vieja, whereas the common estuarine copepod species Acartia tonsa was more abundant at Bahía del Medio, where the mesozooplankton community was typical for the estuary. Although mesozooplankton is likely to be adapted to the high organic matter content in the BBE, the environmental conditions at Canal Vieja appear to favour Neohelice granulata, and this species should be considered as a potential indicator of the impact of sewage in future monitoring programmes.

Its goal was to enhance the competency of in-service K-12 science and mathematics Vermont teachers in the atmospheric, climate, and geospatial sciences. The pilot program ran until 2010, during which time 14 teachers representing three cohorts were exposed to the eight training modules developed specifically for the program. The SWAC program is social constructivist in nature and implemented in such a way that participating teachers built upon prior SWAC content knowledge with each passing year in the program. SWAC modules were based on inquiry, problem, and project-based techniques and were presented in lectures, outdoor observation, and remote sensing laboratory settings. Participating teachers typically began the program during a weeklong, intensive summer program that covered the core SWAC concepts and skills. This was followed by two 1-h workshops every month during the academic year in which participants focused on a specific content module, geospatial skill, or technique. These content and skill workshops alternated with lesson planning sessions to allow teachers to develop lessons, units, or projects with SWAC materials. Program effectiveness was quantified by pre- and posttest evaluations of the modules, a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis in January 2010, and a comprehensive survey of participants' pedagogical changes, as well as the skills and attitudinal changes of the 927 students they taught during the pilot phase. Teachers reported that participation in SWAC transformed their pedagogical approaches and in-class effectiveness while dramatically improving their students' observational abilities, critical thinking skills, and understanding of geospatial technology. An additional outcome of the SWAC program was the Teacher Learning Community that developed, in which participants were able to share activities and challenges across grade levels, school systems, and institutional barriers in a setting not found anywhere else in their professional development environments. © 2012 National Association of Geoscience Teachers.","Climate literacy; Teacher professional development","climate; Earth science; education; literacy; remote sensing; teacher training; university sector; weather; United States; Vermont",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864446966

Methods to estimate the likely origin of recurrences after radiation therapy for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are compared.Methods and materials. A total of 25 patients meeting the following inclusion criteria were randomly selected: curatively intended intensity-modulated radiotherapy planned on a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) scan during the period 2005-2009; squamous cell carcinoma in the oral cavity, pharynx or larynx; complete clinical response followed by locoregional recurrence; and a CT scan at recurrence before any salvage therapy. Exclusion criteria were previous cancer in the area, surgery prior to radiotherapy, or a synchronous cancer. Three methods of estimating focal points of recurrence origin and two volume overlap methods assigning the recurrences to the most central target volumes encompassing at least 50% or 95% of the recurrence volumes were tested. Treatment planning and recurrence scans were rigid and deformable co-registered in order to transfer focal points to the treatment planning scan. Double determinations of all volumes, points, and co-registrations were made.Results. The volume overlap methods assigned the recurrences to significantly more peripheral target volumes than focal methods (p<0.0001 for all comparisons of 95% overlap vs. focal methods, p<0.028 for all comparisons of 50% overlap vs. focal methods). Repeated registrations of the same point had higher reproducibility with deformable registration than with rigid registration (median distance 0.31 vs. 0.35 cm, p=0.015). No significant differences were observed among the focal methods.Conclusion. Significant differences between methods were found which may affect strategies to improve radiotherapy based on pattern of failure analyses. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","Head and neck neoplasms; Intensity-modulated radiotherapy; Local; Neoplasm recurrence; Pattern of failure","fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; article; cancer recurrence; cancer surgery; clinical article; computer assisted emission tomography; computer assisted tomography; female; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; male; primary tumor; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Chemoradiotherapy; Combined Modality Therapy; Dose Fractionation; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Laryngeal Neoplasms; Male; Mouth Neoplasms; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasms, Unknown Primary; Otorhinolaryngologic Neoplasms; Pharyngeal Neoplasms; Positron-Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated; Salvage Therapy; Tumor Burden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864585875

The inverted U-shaped relationship between per capita CO 2 emissions and economic development level is not strongly supported by the estimation results. The impact of capital adjustment speed is significant.

Thus people all over the world are involved in a global social dilemma which calls for worldwide cooperation to reduce the risks of these extreme events and disasters. A collective target (threshold) is required to prevent such events. Everyone may lose their wealth once their total individual contributions fail to reach the threshold. To this end, we establish a model of threshold public goods games in a group-structured population and investigate its evolutionary process. We study multilevel public goods games with defectors, local cooperators, and global cooperators and are primarily concerned with how the global cooperative behavior evolves. We find that, compared with the standard public goods games, the strategy of global cooperation accounts for a bigger proportion in the stationary distribution of threshold public goods games. On the other hand, the fixation time of the global cooperation strategy is greatly shortened with increase of the probability of disaster striking. Therefore, global risks induced by the threshold can effectively promote global cooperation in environmental investment and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. © 2012 American Physical Society.",,"Co-operative behaviors; Environmental investments; Evolutionary process; Extreme events; Global cooperation; Global risks; Public goods games; Social dilemmas; Stationary distribution; Behavioral research; Climate change; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Distribution of goods",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861955695

To assess these land change dynamics and their causes in the Great Plains, we compare and contrast contemporary changes across 16 ecoregions using Landsat satellite data and statistical analysis. Large-area change analysis of agricultural regions is often hampered by change detection error and the tendency for land conversions to occur at the local-scale. To facilitate a regional-scale analysis, a statistical sampling design of randomly selected 10 km × 10 km blocks is used to efficiently identify the types and rates of land conversions for four time intervals between 1973 and 2000, stratified by relatively homogenous ecoregions. Nearly 8% of the overall Great Plains region underwent land-use and land-cover change during the study period, with a substantial amount of ecoregion variability that ranged from less than 2% to greater than 13%. Agricultural land cover declined by more than 2% overall, with variability contingent on the differential characteristics of regional human-environment systems. A large part of the Great Plains is in relatively stable land cover. However, other land systems with significant biophysical and climate limitations for agriculture have high rates of land change when pushed by economic, policy, technology, or climate forcing factors. The results indicate the regionally based potential for land cover to persist or fluctuate as land uses are adapted to spatially and temporally variable forcing factors. © 2011.","Agriculture; Great plains; Human-environment system; Land management; Land-cover change","agriculture; land cover; land management; land use change; Landsat; satellite data; statistical analysis; Great Plains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855284322

A new impetus for commitment was put in place for local regions, through the Covenant of Mayors (CoM) initiative by the EU communities. The key challenge is the penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES), since most rural communities have vast unexploited RES potential (solar, wind, biomass, etc.). RES promotion could also specifically support rural communities' challenges as regards growth, jobs and sustainability, which are also aggravated by the current financial and economic crisis. One of the most significant steps throughout participating in this initiative is the evaluation of the community's sustainable energy status. Aim of this paper is to assess rural communities' energy sustainability using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), based on the outputs of two European ""Intelligent Energy For Europe"" projects on the following regions: Mountainous and Agricultural Communities and Islands.

Findings indicate that SFI influenced quality improvements through 4 primary pathways: (a) Learning Networks, (b) the quality of training, (c) the engagement of program directors, and (e) the organizational climate at programs. SFI's multilevel model of implementation was key to its effectiveness. Two barriers to improving family partnership practices were identified: lack of cultural competence and a negative organizational climate. Practice or Policy: First, quality improvement and professional development efforts are likely to be more effective in promoting real change when they target multiple levels of the context in and around child care programs. SFI's multilevel implementation approach is a model. Second, quality improvement efforts in the area of family engagement may be more effective when specific attention is given to strategies for creating a supportive organizational climate and collegial relationships among staff. Relationships within programs set the tone for relationships with families. Third, cultural competence requires increased attention to efforts to improve the quality of family partnership practices. A focus on organizational cultural competence may provide the workplace environment necessary to support culturally competent practice among program staff. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860791543

Fire is one element of global change that may influence soil microbial communities and, in turn, their contribution to the C dynamics of ecosystems. In order to improve our understanding of how fire influences belowground communities, we conducted a meta-analysis of 42 published microbial responses to fire. We hypothesized that microbial biomass as a whole, and fungal biomass specifically, would be altered following fires. Across all studies, fire reduced microbial abundance by an average of 33.2% and fungal abundance by an average of 47.6%. However, microbial responses to fire differed significantly among biomes and fire types. For example, microbial biomass declined following fires in boreal and temperate forests but not following grasslands fires. In addition, wildfires lead to a greater reduction in microbial biomass than prescribed burns. These differences are likely attributable to differences in fire severity among biomes and fire types. Changes in microbial abundance were significantly correlated with changes in soil CO 2 emissions. Altogether, these results suggest that fires may significantly decrease microbial abundance, with corresponding consequences for soil CO 2 emissions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Biome; Fire; Fire severity; Fungi; Global climate change; Meta-analysis; Microbial biomass; Soil CO 2 emissions","abundance; biomass; biome; boreal forest; carbon dioxide; climate change; community structure; fire behavior; fungus; global change; grassland; meta-analysis; microbial activity; physiological response; soil emission; soil microorganism; temperate forest; terrestrial ecosystem; wildfire; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860155453

Data were collected during three measurement campaigns in spring, summer and winter periods. Measurements were taken with a high-resolution optical PM2.5 detector, coupled with a micrometeorological station that allowed the evaluation of the vertical turbulent fluxes of PM2.5 using the eddy-correlation technique. The main objective of this paper is to analyse the daily and seasonal pattern in PM2.5 concentrations and fluxes and to discuss their correlation with the main meteorological and micrometeorological parameters using high temporal resolution measurements. Observed data showed a seasonal pattern in turbulent fluxes with daytime average positive value during winter and negative during summer. Deposition velocities, ranged from -60 to 20 mm/s, appeared to be mainly influenced by atmospheric stability. There were larger emissions in cases of high wind velocities blowing from water sector indicating a significant potential contribution of sea spray to PM2.5 fluxes. The local atmospheric circulation, due to the orography of the area, was characterised by diurnal winds coming from the Adriatic Sea and nocturnal wind coming from the Alps. This circulation influenced deposition velocity creating an increase of negative fluxes in the morning at the starting of the sea breeze. A diurnal pattern in concentration has been observed and it is similar for all three measurement campaigns, with higher concentrations in nocturnal periods. The daily pattern was investigated in terms of its correlation with meteorological and micro-meteorological parameters, and was found highly correlated with the diurnal pattern of boundary layer height (BLH) and with relative humidity. © 2012 Gebrüder Borntraeger, Stuttgart.",,"Adriatic Sea; Atmospheric circulation; Atmospheric stability; Boundary layer heights; Deposition velocities; Diurnal pattern; Diurnal wind; Eddy correlations; High resolution; High temporal resolution measurement; High winds; Highly-correlated; Measurement campaign; Micrometeorological stations; Negative fluxes; Observed data; PM2.5 concentration; Positive value; Sea breeze; Sea spray; Seasonal patterns; Turbulent flux; Venice lagoon; Water sector; Climatology; Water supply; Atmospheric movements; atmospheric circulation; boundary layer; concentration (composition); deposition velocity; diurnal variation; optical method; orography; particulate matter; relative humidity; turbulent flow; wind velocity; Italy; Veneto; Venezia [Veneto]; Venice Lagoon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874614546

ORDI is based on the equation proposed by Stewart et al. (1977) and compatible with the MOPECO model. Once the equation is calibrated and validated, ORDI just requires adjusting the determining factors for optimization.Parameters required for the simulation of maize through the equation proposed by Stewart et al. (1977) were calibrated and validated using the experimental data from a three-year maize field trial (2001, 2002 and 2003) under deficit irrigation conditions in Castilla-La Mancha (Spain). The area is classified as semi-arid and the stress levels applied to the crop ranged between 0 and 60% of ET m. The same data were used to validate the use of ORDI in a maize crop through adjusting the determining factors for optimization. Climatic data from the years 2001-2008 were used for calculating the theoretical average distribution of stress, by growth stage, that leads to maximum yield for four overall stress levels (0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9). These results were inserted in MOPECO to simulate the behavior of a maize crop subjected to different deficit irrigation strategies under the climatic conditions of the years 2009-2011.Depending on the applied stress level and the restrictions imposed to the optimizer, ORDI may increase yield by 10-20% and gross margin up to 167€ha -1 compared with an irrigation strategy where the stress level remains constant during the whole growth cycle. Hence, for low water stress conditions, deficit irrigation should be applied during the initial and vegetative development stages. For medium and high water stress conditions, higher deficit should occur during the ripening and grain filling stages. Lastly, this methodology can be applied to schedule the levels of water stress to be applied in future experiments on deficit irrigation with herbaceous crops such as maize. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","Crop simulation; MOPECO; Water productivity; Water stress; Zea Mays L.","Crop simulations; MOPECO; Water productivity; Water stress; Zea mays; Crops; Evapotranspiration; Grain (agricultural product); Optimization; Water supply; Water management; agricultural modeling; calibration; crop yield; data set; environmental stress; evapotranspiration; herb; irrigation system; maize; optimization; semiarid region; water stress; Castilla-La Mancha; Spain; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860995982

The Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of CDM A/R were estimated by analyzing the case of Khorezm region in Uzbekistan, where a mixed-species tree plantation was established on marginal cropland. The dual purposes of carbon sequestration and production of fruits, leaves as fodder, and fuelwood were studied over a seven-year rotation period. We compared the opportunity costs of land in marginal agricultural areas between this short-rotation plantation forestry and the annual cultivation of the major crops in the region, i.e., cotton, winter wheat, rice, and maize. The analyses were performed considering different levels of irrigation water availability, from 0 to 30,000m 3/ha, to reflect the reality of a high variability of water supply in the region. The NPV of CDM A/R ranged between 724 and 5794USD/ha over seven years, depending on the tree species. Among the latter, Elaeagnus angustifolia L. had the highest profits due to the annually recurring cash flows generated from fruit production. Temporary Certified Emission Reductions (tCER) ranged within 399-702USD/ha after the assumed 7-year crediting period and would not suffice to cover initial investments and management costs of tree plantations. IRR peaked at 65% with E. angustifolia under the conventional afforestation and measured -10% and 61% when considering only the tCER and the CDM A/R, respectively. In contrast, other species had higher IRRs in case of the CDM A/R. The total profits from tree plantations exceeded those of both cotton and winter wheat, even with the assumption that there was an optimal irrigation supply for these crops. Rice production was overall the most profitable land use option but required water input of 26,500m 3/ha/year, which is not consistently available for marginal croplands. We argue that the current global average price of 4.76 USD/tCER is insufficient to initiate forestry-based CDM projects but, in the absence of other incentives, can still motivate forestation of degraded croplands for land rehabilitation and the provisioning of non-timber products. Given the low irrigation needs of trees, 3-30% of the crop water demand, a conversion of degraded cropland to forested areas could save up to 15,300m 3/ha/year at the current tCER price. Combining the monetary value of water and carbon would enlarge the scope for CDM A/R in irrigated drylands, thus enhancing the investments in marginal land rehabilitation and strengthening the resilience of rural populations to the repercussions of climate change. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Marginal croplands; Non-timber tree products; Short-rotation forestry; TCER; Water saving","Marginal croplands; Non-timber tree products; Short rotation; TCER; Water saving; Arid regions; Climate change; Costs; Cotton; Crops; Cultivation; Earnings; Economics; Emission control; Energy policy; Fruits; Profitability; Reforestation; Revegetation; Timber; Water conservation; Water resources; Water supply; Irrigation; Animalia; Elaeagnus angustifolia; Gossypium hirsutum; Nucleopolyhedrovirus; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861704022

The authors propose a conceptual framework for integrating DRR and CCA in managing climate-related risks and explain the need for joint implementation. Design/methodology/approach: The study is conducted through review and analysis of academic, government and non-government literature to determine the Indonesian experience in integrating DRR and CCA. Interviews were conducted with 26 DRR and CCA stakeholders in Indonesia. Findings: The authors make three propositions in this paper. First, there needs to be a re-orientation of the institutional arrangements for DRR and CCA, to increase the effectiveness of planning and implementation. Second, DRR and CCA activities needed to be stronger supported at the local level, with a specific aim to reduce the underlying causes of vulnerability of communities at risk. Third, non-government organisations play a very important role in integrating DRR and CCA through community-based initiatives. Research limitations/implications: While this paper focuses specifically on Indonesia, the findings are relevant to other countries with similar geographical and socio-economic conditions, as they are likely to face similar challenges. Practical implications: The paper provides practical suggestions on what steps government actors, at all political levels, can do to support the integration of DRR and CCA planning and implementation activities in Indonesia.

Currently, there is renewed interest in obtaining energy from wastes hitherto meant for disposal. Increased costs of disposal and their attendant problems of heavy environmental loading are some aspects making the disposal option unattractive. These wastes are sources of energy and among the several sources of generating this energy are the waste-to-energy (WTE) categories with potentials for useable fuel production. The WTE materials are mainly used domestic waste oils (UDWOs), municipal solid waste (MSW), agricultural and industrial wastes. However, the latter wastes are not attractive as they consist of innumerable hazardous contaminants. The UDWOs are arguably a safe and cost effective source of useable fuel. Their conversion offers the merits of a reduction in greenhouse gas emission (GHG), enhancing fuel diversification and a qualitatively comparable energy output to fossil diesel fuels. Thus, UDWOs could significantly contribute towards achieving the 2020 and 2030 goals of substituting approximately 20% and 30% of petro-diesel with biofuels in US and EU, respectively. Moreover, attaining the forecasted annual production rate of 227 billion liters of biofuel by most active stakeholders in the biodiesel industry could be easily achieved. This review aims to analyze the performance of biodiesel fuels obtained from UDWO and to demonstrate the suitability of applying these fuels as substitutes to mineral diesel in various industries. Benefits of UDWO as a biodiesel feedstock were as well highlighted. © 2012 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.","Biodiesel; Biodiesel feedstock; Used domestic waste oil; Waste treatment","Biodiesel; Cost effectiveness; Diesel fuels; Feedstocks; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Industrial wastes; Waste disposal; Waste treatment; Alternative sources of energy; Biodiesel feedstock; Environmental loadings; Fuel diversification; Hazardous contaminants; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Performance evaluations; Used domestic waste oil; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860709299

We illustrate the recent area evolution of a set of 249 glaciers in the area using three surface area records for 1991, 1999 and 2003. The 1999 and 2003 surface area data are processed by combining glacier limits manually digitized upon registered color orthophotos and differential GPS (DGPS) glaciers' surveys. Glaciers' area was 117. 4 km2 in 1991, 104. 7 km2 in 1999, and to 92. 4 km2 2003, with a 21% reduction. Glaciers smaller than 1 km2 accounted for 53% of the total loss in area (13. 1 km2 during 1991-2003). The area change rate was higher lately, with ca. 11. 7 % reduction during 1999-2003. We split Alps and fore Alps of Lombardy into six mountain groups, and we separately investigate relative area variations. We use climate series from local stations within each group to assess climate change during a 30-year window (1976-2005). We focus upon temperature and snow cover depth at thaw, known to impact glaciers' changes.

We determined the amount of volatized ammonia emitted from the solid and liquid fractions of raw pig slurry during its storage and after its broadcast to an alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) meadow under summer and winter conditions. The solid fraction accounted for the largest NH 3 losses during both storage and land application. Chemical-mechanical separation of raw pig slurry under winter conditions caused a slight (-2%) reduction in NH 3 emissions during manure management (storage+broadcast application), as opposed to an emission increase of as much as 17% for separation under summer conditions. Evidence from this study suggests that environmental benefits are possible if solid and liquid fractions are managed using state-of-the-art NH 3 mitigation options, such as covered manure storage and band spread slurry application. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Ammonia volatilization; Land application; Polyacrilamide; Slurry separation; Storage","alfalfa; ammonia; biogenic emission; manure; separation; slurry; Medicago sativa; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858742578

In order to achieve this target, fuel economy standards for cars and low carbon standards for fuels should be tightened significantly, and minimum taxes on petrol and diesel should be raised. But the primary purpose of the paper is to make specific recommendations on how vehicle and fuel policy should be designed to facilitate such deep emissions cuts in the future. The CO2 standards for cars the EU agreed in 2008 are a big step forward compared to the flawed voluntary commitment of the industry; it has taken CO2 from a Corporate Social Responsibility issue to a bottom line issue and once again demonstrated that emissions can be cut more quickly and cheaply than previously thought possible. But apart from a still-too-low level of ambition, the law suffers from a couple of design flaws. First, the evidence is that the rather impressive recent cuts in official CO2 emissions do not yet translate to equally impressive savings on the road. Carmakers have gained a lot of grams by testing their cars' consumption more cunningly, instead of making them really more efficient. Second, future standards should not be weight-based but rather size-based. Third, tailpipe CO2 emissions as the regulated metric will have to be replaced by something more resembling energy efficiency. On taxation, Europe's major problem is too low a level of taxation of diesel. This is to a large extent explained by a fear member states have of losing revenue through diesel tourism by trucks if they raise diesel taxes. EU-level efforts to raise minimum levels of diesel taxation should be applauded. But North America's International Fuel Tax Agreement offers a structural way out - essentially it taxes truck diesel on the basis of fuel used in a state rather than sold, making it possible for states to raise diesel taxes without losing any of the extra revenue to other countries. But it is Europe's climate policy in transport fuels that is in most need of a clean-up. Current policy increases rather than reduces greenhouse gas emissions of a liter of fuel. Scrapping the 10% biofuels target, leaving only a low carbon fuel standard in place, and getting the carbon accounting right for both biofuels and fossil fuels are the two top priorities. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Critics of such a program have raised concerns about its ability to identify allowance prices that minimize the cost of achieving a given reduction and the ultimate acceptability of those prices, even if they are cost minimizing. As a result, legislation has been proposed that includes policies to limit the cap-and-trade market through restrictions on participants, transactions, or allowance prices. Some of these restrictions are in place in other cap-and-trade programs around the world. This article evaluates those limits according to whether they accomplish their desired objective and the extent to which they might generate unintended consequences. We conclude that prohibitions on participants and transactions are unlikely to achieve their objectives and could, in fact, generate costly unintended consequences; however, some restrictions could prove useful. The use of price controls may achieve policymakers' objectives but, depending on how they are implemented, might also have unanticipated and undesirable effects.

The modified biological simulator (TOMGRO) that used for case studies of the experiment has been developed and validated according short cropping period, cultivation techniques and climate conditions of countries and growers near Mediterranean. Sensitivity analysis was necessary in order to test simulator's behaviour according to different climate scenarios. Case studies were focused in the influence of temperature in tomato growth and production. For this purpose experiments were carried out in the farm of the University of Thessaly in the region of Velestino. Climate data were recorded inside and outside of the greenhouse area. Simultaneously biological data for tomato growth and production were recorded. Results showed that climate variation inside the greenhouse area causes of modification in tomato growth rate and production. It was found that temperature increase leads to: i) increasing the number of nodes, leaves and trusses of the plants, ii) reduction of dry weight of leaves, stems, fruits and plant leaf area, iii) simultaneous reduction of mature fruits number and iv) early production. The management of greenhouse climate can be made more efficient by using the case studies results from the biological model. A part of the conclusions will contribute to balance of earnings of a product's nominal value into the market, according to the management cost of the greenhouse equipment during the production process.","Crop model; Decision-making; Growth; Temperature; Tomato production","Lycopersicon esculentum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863702358

While there may not be unique tracers of aircraft emissions, examination of multipollutant concentration patterns in combination with flight activity can facilitate source attribution. In this study, we examine concentrations of continuously monitored air pollutants measured in 2008 near a departure runway at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), considering single-pollutant associations with landing and takeoff (LTO) of the aircraft (LTO activity, weighted by LTO cycle fuel burn), as well as multipollutant predictors of binary LTO activity. In the single-pollutant analyses, one-minute average concentrations of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide are positively associated with fuel burn-weighted departures on the runway proximate to the monitor, whereas ozone is negatively associated with fuel burn-weighted departures. In analyses in which the flight departure is predicted by pollutant concentrations, carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides are the best individual predictors, but including all five pollutants greatly increases the power of prediction compared to single-pollutant models. Our results demonstrate that air pollution impacts from aircraft departures can be isolated using time-resolved monitoring data, and that combinations of simultaneously measured pollutants can best identify contributions from flight activity. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Air pollutants; Air pollution impact; Aircraft departure; Aircraft emissions; Average concentration; Concentration patterns; Flight activity; Los angeles international airports; Multiple pollutants; Pollutant concentration; Source attribution; Source contributions; Statistical approach; Time-resolved monitoring; Aircraft; Airports; Aviation; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; fuel; nitrogen oxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; aircraft; airport; atmospheric pollution; flight activity; pollutant source; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; aircraft; airport; article; exhaust gas; pollution monitoring; Air Pollutants; Aircraft; Environmental Monitoring; Los Angeles; California; Los Angeles [California]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864659126

This study shows that the injection of hot, supercritical CO2 is particularly promising. The addition of heat triggers the dissociation of CH4-hydrate while the CO2, once thermally equilibrated, reacts with the pore water and is retained in the reservoir as immobile CO2-hydrate. Furthermore, optimal reservoir conditions of pressure and temperature are constrained. Experiments were conducted in a high-pressure flow-through reactor at different sediment temperatures (2 °C, 8 °C, 10 °C) and hydrostatic pressures (8 MPa, 13 MPa). The efficiency of both, CH4 production and CO2 retention is best at 8 °C, 13 MPa. Here, both CO2- and CH4-hydrate as well as mixed hydrates can form. At 2 °C, the production process was less effective due to congestion of transport pathways through the sediment by rapidly forming CO2-hydrate. In contrast, at 10 °C CH4 production suffered from local increases in permeability and fast breakthrough of the injection fluid, thereby confining the accessibility to the CH4 pool to only the most prominent fluid channels. Mass and volume balancing of the collected gas and fluid stream identified gas mobilization as equally important process parameter in addition to the rates of methane hydrate dissociation and hydrate conversion. Thus, the combination of heat supply and CO2 injection in one supercritical phase helps to overcome the mass transfer limitations usually observed in experiments with cold liquid or gaseous CO2. © 2012 by the authors.","Carbon dioxide; CCS; Energy; Gas hydrates; Methane","Carbon; Deposits; Dissociation; Gas hydrates; Gases; Hydration; Hydrostatic pressure; Mass transfer; Methane; Natural gas deposits; Petroleum deposits; Energy; Mass transfer limitation; Methane hydrate dissociation; Permafrost environment; Pressure and temperature; Reservoir conditions; Supercritical phase; Transport pathways; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864626954

A sharp change of sedimentological, compositional and geochemical characteristics was observed from the onset of the MSC onward, suggesting strong differences in the mechanisms responsible for carbonate precipitation. Pre-MSC beds are mainly composed of dolomite and are interpreted as the product of early diagenesis, formed by bacterial sulphate reduction in the shallow subsurface along the sulphate-methane interface. Dolomite precipitation was temporarily enhanced by an upward flux of methane-rich fluids, possibly sourced by gas hydrate destabilisation. Conversely, from the onset of the MSC onward, carbonate beds are thinly laminated and show abundant filaments interpreted as Beggiatoa-like bacteria, while calcite (and aragonite) are the dominant authigenic phases. These beds are interpreted as microbialites, resulting from the lithification of chemotrophic bacterial mats dominated by sulphide-oxidizing bacteria. The carbonate necessary for their preservation was provided by bacterial sulphate reduction. These microbialites, that appear as the deeper water counterpart of bottom-grown selenite layers deposited in the marginal part of the basin, formed on an anoxic sea bottom under a density stratified water column. The high sulphate concentration in the pore waters, related to the presence of concentrated brines and to the regeneration of sulphate by sulphide-oxidizing bacteria, is considered as the driving factor controlling the mineralogical change from dolomite to calcite and aragonite. Finally, the sharp shift towards negative δ 18O values of carbonates, observed from the onset of the MSC onward, was probably related to fractionation processes operated by sulphate-reducing bacterial communities in the pore waters. This suggests that care must be taken, when dealing with microbial carbonates, in the interpretation of the oxygen isotope values in terms of fluctuating salinity condition of the water mass. In conclusion, this study suggests that the onset of the MSC had a strong impact on microbial populations governing carbonate precipitation, in a sector of the basin dominated by depositional conditions not suitable for gypsum precipitation. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Bacterial sulphate reduction; Bacterial sulphide oxidation; Messinian salinity crisis; Microbial mats; Tertiary Piedmont Basin","bacterium; brine; calcite; carbonate; depositional environment; dolomite; gas hydrate; gypsum; lithification; marl; Messinian; microbial activity; microbial community; microbial mat; oxygen isotope; porewater; precession; precipitation (chemistry); preservation; salinity; seafloor; sedimentology; shale; sulfate; sulfide; Tertiary; Italy; Piedmont Basin; Bacteria (microorganisms); Beggiatoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862754961

The source displayed a 0.5-10keV quiescent X-ray luminosity of L q∼ 10 33(D/5.5kpc) 2ergs -1, which was completely dominated by hard non-thermal emission. This is at odds with other non-pulsating neutron stars that typically show detectable soft thermal emission at such quiescent luminosities. Here we use three additional Chandra observations, performed in 2009 and 2011, to further study the quiescent properties of EXO 1745-248. We find that the power-law intensity varies considerably up to a factor of ∼3 within hours and by about one order of magnitude between the different epochs. We discuss the implications of the observed change in quiescent flux for the interpretation of the hard power-law emission. We constrain the neutron star surface temperature as seen by a distant observer to kT ∞≲ 42eV and the thermal bolometric luminosity to L th q, bol≲ 7 × 10 31(D/5.5kpc) 2ergs -1. This confirms that EXO 1745-248 harbours a relatively cold neutron star and suggests that, for example, enhanced cooling mechanisms are operating in the stellar core or that the binary on average resides in quiescence for hundreds of years. © 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2012 RAS.","Accretion, accretion discs; Globular clusters: individual: Terzan 5; Stars: neutron; X-rays: binaries; X-rays: individual: EXO 1745-248",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859812168

All experimental isotherms can be nicely described by using the Tòth isotherm model and show the preferred adsorption of CO2 over CH4. At low pressures the Tòth isotherm equation exhibits a Henry region, wherefore Henry's law constants for CO2 and CH4 uptake could be determined and ideal selectivity αCO2/CH4 has been calculated. Secondly, selectivities were calculated from mixture data by using nearly equimolar binary mixtures of both gases by a volumetric-chromatographic method to examine the IFPs. Results showed the reliability of the selectivity calculation. Values of αCO 2/CH4 around 7.5 for IFP-5 indicate that this material shows much better selectivities than IFP-1, IFP-2, IFP-3, IFP-4 and IFP-6 with slightly lower selectivity αCO2/CH4 = 4-6.

We identify the major affects of commercial forestry initiated over recent decades on Tasmanian primary-forest carbon (C), and search for means to mitigate its ongoing impacts. Spatio-temporal trends were derived from records of commercial operations combined with biomass data. Over the last two decades, the majority of forest C destined for short- or long-term emission (LTE, i.e. over several centuries and multiple harvests) was from clearfelling the higher-biomass wet-eucalypt forests on public land. Carbon dynamics at the unit-area-level for logging two disparate, wet-eucalypt forests were modelled. Parameters were varied to determine management options and model sensitivities under conversion by clearfell and intense burn to either eucalypt plantation or forest regeneration from local eucalypt seed. The first cycle of conversion of primary-forests contributed 43(±5)% to the LTE, and the LTE constituted ∼50% of the primary-forest C stock. Whether the first logging of even-aged primary-forests was prior to or after maturity, the LTEs were equivalent, although short-term emissions (STEs) were ∼2× higher from old-growth. Minor variations in soil organic carbon efflux during operations significantly altered LTEs. Conversion of wet-eucalypt by clearfell from 1999 to 2009 incurred an LTE of 2(±1.6)Tg from each year's logging. Lengthening the harvesting interval for sown forests from 80 to 200 years reduced LTEs by 42% and eucalypt wood-products by 26%; but yielded 40(±20)Mgha -1 of C in rainforest understorey-helping to sustain mixed-forest ecosystems and their products. Using 200-yr cycles for the wet-eucalypt already clearfelled could avoid LTEs of ∼15Tg. Long-term C dynamics under harvest cycles were constrained by mathematical precepts that facilitate climate change modelling, e.g. the time to reach the harvesting-cycle's asymptote is correlated to the half-life of the longer-lived C pool. Emissions are not recovered by sequestration in wood-products unless their half-lives are ∼10× contemporary values-requiring 200-1000 years for recovery, during which time emissions would augment global climate change. Emissions can be reduced by product substitution, and by recycling wood-products, in a stable wood market. Primary-forest is part of a global commons. Comprehensive C accounting cannot occur if logging effects are omitted. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emission; Carbon sequestration; Clearfell; Climate change positive feedback; Old-growth; Wood products","carbon emission; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; clearcutting; climate change; dicotyledon; forest management; global change; harvesting; logging (timber); mixed forest; old-growth forest; phytomass; rainforest; soil organic matter; understory; wood; Australia; Tasmania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859932814

Formic acid was used for this purpose for the in situ generation of CO2 and its subsequent reduction to CO. In the absence of Pt modification, H2 was not obtained in the gas products evolved. These results were compared with those obtained with acetic acid in place of formic acid. The combustion process was simulated by thermogravimetry and the synthesized powder was characterized using transmission electron microscopy, diffuse reflectance UV/Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, surface area measurements, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Tauc plots derived from the diffuse reflectance data yielded an optical band gap of 2.74 eV. The photocatalytic activity of these nanoparticles was superior to a sample prepared by solid-state synthesis.

The leachate is composed of NH 4 + and Na + (0.25M) balanced by Cl - (0.25M), acetate (0.1M) and HCO3- (0.15M). The pH is 7.8 and it is typical of the mature stage of organic matter degradation within an urban landfill. Laboratory scale diffusion tests were performed over 4months (long term experiment, LT) and 2weeks (short term experiment, ST). The ST experiments were designed to allow the measurement of the Cl - gradient as a diffusion tracer in the compacted clay. In the LT experiments the chemical gradients were already at steady state, but geochemical reactions involving dissolution of gypsum and precipitation of calcite were observed. Evolution of pore-water chemistry, mineralogy, cation exchange properties, and the specific surface of clays were determined. Numerical simulations were carried out using the geochemical code RETRASO. Chloride transport, precipitation of carbonates, pH buffering, and Ca 2+/NH 4 +cation exchange reactions took place in the laboratory tests. Apparent Cl - diffusion coefficients were determined by direct modeling of the ST tests and validated with the LT experiments. These coefficients were considered in the simulation of transport coupled with experimentally calculated exchange constants and dissolution/precipitation reactions of gypsum and carbonates. Sulfate reduction coupled with acetate oxidation has been proven to be relevant in the sample with significant concentration of SO 4 2- (Bailén). This process also includes significant precipitation of carbonates (mainly calcite) and causes a decrease of SO 4 2- in the porewater. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,"Acetate oxidation; Cation exchange properties; Cation exchange reactions; Chemical gradients; Compacted clays; Direct modeling; Exchange constants; Geochemical behaviors; Geochemical reaction; Laboratory scale; Laboratory test; Landfill leachates; Leachates; Long-term experiments; Natural clays; pH buffering; Pore waters; Pore-water chemistry; RETRASO; Short term; Soluble ions; Specific surface; Steady state; Sulfate reduction; Calcite; Carbonate minerals; Chlorine; Chlorine compounds; Crystallography; Diffusion; Experiments; Geochemistry; Gypsum; Leachate treatment; Mineralogy; Precipitation (chemical); Volatile fatty acids; Clay minerals; carbonate; chloride; clay; diffusion; dissolution; experimental study; geochemistry; gypsum; illite; ion exchange; landfill; leachate; organic matter; precipitation (chemistry); sulfate; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860383227

Among these plants, the scarlet starglory is a spontaneous plant adapted to the climatic and soil conditions of the region, with high biomass production, rapid growth and low C/N ratio. We evaluated the agroeconomic performance of carrot (cv. Brasília) depending on added amounts of scarlet starglory under the ground and of its moment of incorporation. The study was carried out in a rural area, in Mossoró, Rio Grande do Norte state, Brazil, from September to December 2009. The experimental design was randomized complete blocks with the treatments arranged in a factorial scheme (4×4) + 1, with three replications. The first factor was comprised of amounts of scarlet starglory placed between the carrot rows, in a depth of 15 cm (5.4, 8.8, 12.2 and 15.6 t ha -1 on a dry basis) and the second factor, of the incorporation moment of this material (0, 15, 30 and 45 days after sowing carrots). The additional treatment (control) was 40 t ha -1 of cattle manure applied 10 days before sowing. We evaluated the marketable and total yield of roots, percentage of the different classes of roots and the economic indicators of gross income, net income, rate of return and profit margin. No significant interaction between the amounts of scarlet starglory under the soil and the incorporation moment was determined in any of the characteristics examined for carrot. The best agroeconomic performance of carrot cropping was obtained by adding 15.6 t ha -1 of scarlet starglory to the soil. The optimization of this performance was achieved with the incorporation moment of 26 days after carrot sowing.","Agronomic efficiency; Daucus carota; Green manure",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867593997

It theoretically captures the changes in the world economy from an era of economic nationalism of the orthodox kind, when infant-industry protection was intellectually justified and routinely practiced, to an era of deep international integration. Rather than see states retreating from the economy, the chapter underscores the significance of states in coping with the new opportunities and challenges offered by the world economy. The chapter argues that states are active in promoting national capitalist development and hence cannot be expected to withdraw from intervening from the economy even if the climate for intervention is not receptive.

It was previously demonstrated that in vitro exposure to fine particulate matter (aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5μm, PM 2.5) induces endothelial dysfunction in isolated pulmonary arteries. We aimed to investigate the effects of in vivo exposure to urban concentrated PM 2.5 on rat pulmonary artery reactivity and the mechanisms involved. For this, adult Wistar rats were exposed to 2 weeks of concentrated São Paulo city air PM 2.5 at an accumulated daily dose of approximately 600μg/m 3. Pulmonary arteries isolated from PM 2.5-exposed animals exhibited impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine without significant changes in nitric oxide donor response compared to control rats. PM 2.5 caused vascular oxidative stress and enhanced protein expression of Cu/Zn- and Mn-superoxide dismutase in the pulmonary artery. Protein expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) was reduced, while tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α was enhanced by PM 2.5 inhalation in pulmonary artery. There was a significant positive correlation between eNOS expression and maximal relaxation response (E max) to acetylcholine. A negative correlation was found between vascular TNF-α expression and E max to acetylcholine. Plasma cytokine levels, blood cells count and coagulation parameters were similar between control and PM 2.5-exposed rats. The present findings showed that in vivo daily exposure to concentrated urban PM 2.5 could decrease endothelium-dependent relaxation and eNOS expression on pulmonary arteries associated with local high TNF-α level but not systemic pro-inflammatory factors. Taken together, the present results elucidate the mechanisms underlying the trigger of cardiopulmonary diseases induced by urban ambient levels of PM 2.5. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.","Inflammatory cytokines; Nitric oxide; Oxidative stress; Particulate matter; Pulmonary artery","acetylcholine; copper; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; manganese superoxide dismutase; nitric oxide; tumor necrosis factor alpha; zinc; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; superoxide dismutase; tumor necrosis factor alpha; animal experiment; animal model; anticoagulation; article; blood cell count; controlled study; disease association; endothelial dysfunction; in vivo study; inflammation; male; nonhuman; oxidative stress; particulate matter; priority journal; protein expression; pulmonary artery; rat; vascularization; animal; chemically induced disorder; drug effect; metabolism; particulate matter; physiology; vascular endothelium; Wistar rat; Animalia; Rattus; Rattus norvegicus; Animals; Endothelium, Vascular; Inflammation; Male; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; Oxidative Stress; Particulate Matter; Pulmonary Artery; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Superoxide Dismutase; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861126116

In the present study, we distinguish among formal civic education, an open classroom climate, and active learning strategies, and we explore their relation with political interest, efficacy, trust, and participation. To analyze these relations, we rely on the results of a two-year panel study among late adolescents in Belgium. The results indicate that formal civic education (classroom instruction) and active learning strategies (school council membership and, to a lesser extent, group projects) are positively related to political attitudes and behavior.

In most of these countries, adaptation measures are yet to be implemented in legislation and are, therefore, in practice voluntary undertakings. At the local level of the government, this means that adaptation has to compete with other non-mandatory issues. This raises the question as to what degree adaptation can and will be implemented. This paper examines how the implementation of climate adaptation measures has proceeded in eight Norwegian municipalities. These municipalities were among the first movers on adaptation to climate change in Norway. In order to measure the degree of implementation, a set of indicators has been developed and the eight case municipalities have been analysed according to these indicators. We found that seven of eight municipalities have implemented or have specific plans to implement adaptation measures. These findings show that municipalities are able to implement adaptation policies that are not initiated at the central level, but are contingent upon a number of factors: the efforts of individuals within the municipal organisation, municipal size, and the use of external expertise. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","adaptation; climate change; climate policy; municipalities; new public management; policy implementation","climate change; environmental legislation; environmental policy; policy implementation; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863930269

This approach considers the electrical and thermal energy delivery subsystems for which the cost considerations were based on the present market values. A sensitivity study based on capacity utilization factor (CUF) was carried out to evaluate the unit cost of electricity produced. Other financial figures of merit like simple payback and internal rate of return were also calculated. It is observed that when the system utilization was 0.3, the payback of the system is attained within the CHAPS' lifetime of 20 years. Based on the economic evaluation, it is evident that favorable financial benefits for a typical system with a collector area of 4.5 m 2 will occur if the system cost is limited in the range of Rs 100,000 to Rs 120,000. A comparison with the actual CHAPS system cost based on the current market price is done and the difference is off set by the carbon credits earned by the CHAPS system during its lifetime due to CO 2 mitigation. The carbon credits earned by the CHAPS system caused a reduction of the unit cost of electricity generated from Rs 11.02/kWh to Rs 9.0973/kWh. This study further helps to introduce the CHAPS system in the Indian market at an acceptable price for the consumers.

Most of the analyses that have been done to date, however, are biological, ignoring the effects of market adaptations through substitution, net imports, and timber investments. This paper uses a dynamic model of forest and land use management to estimate the impact of United States energy policies that emphasize the utilization of forest biomass on global timber production and carbon stocks over the next 50 years. We show that when market factors are included in the analysis, expanded demand for biomass energy increases timber prices and harvests, but reduces net global carbon emissions because higher wood prices lead to new investments in forest stocks. Estimates are sensitive to assumptions about whether harvest residues and new forestland can be used for biomass energy and the demand for biomass. Restricting biomass energy to being sourced only from roundwood on existing forestland can transform the policy from a net sink to a net source of emissions. These results illustrate the importance of capturing market adjustments and a large geographic scope when measuring the carbon implications of biomass energy policies. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Bio-mass energy; Carbon emissions; Carbon stocks; Economic approach; Forest biomass; Forest land; Global carbon emission; Harvest residues; Land-use management; Market factors; Roundwoods; Supply sources; Timber prices; Timber production; Wood prices; Carbon; Carbon capture; Economics; Energy policy; Factor analysis; Forestry; International trade; Timber; Biomass; carbon; carbon emission; economic analysis; energy policy; global change; land use change; timber; article; biomass; biomass energy; cost; environmental economics; environmental planning; forest; geography; harvest; land use; United States; wood; Biofuels; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Commerce; Conservation of Energy Resources; Electricity; Environmental Policy; Internationality; Models, Theoretical; Trees; United States; Wood; Biomass; Carbon; Economics; Foreign Trade; Forestry; Forests; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861890246

Since methane is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, the abatement of the emission is necessary to achieve a more sustainable urban water management. This requires thorough knowledge of the amount of methane that is emitted from a plant, but also of the possible sources and sinks of methane on the plant. In this study, the methane emission from a full-scale municipal wastewater facility with sludge digestion was evaluated during one year. At this plant the contribution of methane emissions to the greenhouse gas footprint were slightly higher than the CO2 emissions related to direct and indirect fossil fuel consumption for energy requirements. By setting up mass balances over the different unit processes, it could be established that three quarters of the total methane emission originated from the anaerobic digestion of primary and secondary sludge. This amount exceeded the carbon dioxide emission that was avoided by utilizing the biogas. About 80% of the methane entering the activated sludge reactor was biologically oxidized. This knowledge led to the identification of possible measures for the abatement of the methane emission. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Activated sludge; Climate footprint; Digestion; Greenhouse gas; Methane","Anaerobic digestion; Bioactivity; Carbon dioxide; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Wastewater treatment; Water management; Activated sludge; Activated sludge reactors; Carbon dioxide emissions; Climate footprints; Municipal wastewater treatment; Municipal wastewater treatment plants; Municipal wastewaters; Urban water management; Sludge digestion; biogas; fossil fuel; methane; abatement cost; activated sludge; anoxic conditions; biogas; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; ecological footprint; fossil fuel; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; methane; sustainability; urban drainage; wastewater; water management; water treatment; activated sludge; anaerobic digestion; article; carbon footprint; energy; priority journal; reactor; sludge digestion; waste water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861330644

In order to address the general poor condition of the building stock and resulting inefficiency in energy use, from 1990 onwards, the government and local authorities initiated energy efficiency support programmes in the residential buildings sector. Furthermore, technical assistance and loan guarantee schemes by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) helped to establish a market for financing energy efficiency investments. EU funds also played a role in the modernisation of non-residential buildings. Residential energy efficiency support programmes entered a new phase in 2009 with the start of the Green Investment Scheme (GIS). While Hungary was a front-runner in establishing the legal framework for GIS, the success of early AAU sales (the financing source of the scheme) were overshadowed by reputation concerns in terms of additionality and the disbursement of funds. At the same time the GIS brought with it improved environmental integrity compared to earlier programmes in terms of monitoring and verification of results, establishing a focus on GHG emission reductions in addition to energy savings, and introducing incentives for deeper refurbishment. The aim of the paper is to provide an overview of the evolution of energy efficiency support programmes for residential buildings in the Hungarian context, pointing out prevailing problematic elements, as well as areas of improvement and good practice. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Energy efficiency support programmes; Green Investment Scheme; Hungary; Loan guarantee for energy efficiency; Residential buildings","Building stocks; Energy efficiency investments; Energy use; Environmental integrity; Final energy; GHG emission; Good practices; Green Investment Scheme; Hungarians; Hungary; International finance corporations; Legal frameworks; Loan guarantees; Local authorities; Residential building; Residential energy efficiency; Residential sectors; Technical assistance; Total carbon; Buildings; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Investments; carbon dioxide; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; European Union; modernization; residential energy; sustainable development; Hungary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858297580

Knowing the current level of emission is only one variable in this complex picture. While the rate of emissions is clearly a problem, the overall increase in GHG concentration in the atmosphere is ultimately the main driver of anthropogenic warming. Therefore, it is also important to understand the cumulative emissions, those which have taken us to the current condition. This research presents a case study of six countries to compare the emissions per capita and cumulative emissions during the past 200 years. It is known that carbon emissions are closely related to economic activities, but here we show that some countries have reached per capita emissions plateaus at different levels while others are still rising. Specifically, one approach toward socioeconomic development, in terms of energy-economy, reaches a plateau at 10 Mt carbon per person, which the United Kingdom and South Korea have attained. The US occupies another emission regime at 20 Mt carbon per person. Developing economies such as India and China are considerably below these levels, and unless they follow other integrated economic/environmental solutions, they will continue to increase their per capita emissions during development. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Carbon emissions; Climate change; Cumulative emissions; Development; Economy; Per capita emissions","anthropogenic effect; carbon emission; climate change; concentration (composition); economic development; environmental economics; global warming; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; socioeconomic status; stabilization; sustainable development; South Korea; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859823372

Remote sensing remains an attractive tool for estimating tropical forest biomass but relationships and methods used at one site have not always proved applicable to other locations. This lack of a widely applicable general relationship limits the operational use of remote sensing as a method for biomass estimation, particularly in high biomass ecosystems. Here, multispectral Landsat TM and JERS-1 SAR data were used together to estimate tropical forest biomass at three separate geographical locations: Brazil, Malaysia and Thailand. Texture measures were derived from the JERS-1 SAR data using both wavelet analysis and Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix methods, and coupled with multispectral data to provide inputs to artificial neural networks that were trained under four different training scenarios and validated using biomass measured from 144 field plots. When trained and tested with data collected from the same location, the addition of SAR texture to multispectral data showed strong correlations with above ground biomass (r= 0.79, 0.79 and 0.84 for Thailand, Malaysia and Brazil respectively). Also, when networks were trained and tested with data from all three sites, the strength of correlation (r= 0.55) was stronger than previously reported results from the same sites that used multispectral data only. Uncertainty in estimating AGB from different allometric equations was also tested but found to have little effect on the strength of the relationships observed. The results suggest that the inclusion of SAR texture with multispectral data can go someway towards providing relationships that are transferable across time and space, but that further work is required if satellite remote sensing is to provide robust and reliable methodologies for initiatives such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+). © 2012 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Reactive lipid aldehydes and their derivatives are detoxified via a variety of phase I and phase II systems, and when antioxidant defenses are compromised or oxidative conditions are increased, protein carbonylation is increased. The resulting modification has been implicated as causative in a variety of metabolic states including neurodegeneration, muscle wasting, insulin resistance, and aging. Although such modifications usually result in loss of protein function, protein carbonylation may be regulatory and activate signaling pathways involved in antioxidant biology and cellular homeostasis. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","4-hydroxy trans-2,3-nonenal; Carbonylation; Metabolism; Neurodegeneration; Reactive lipid aldehydes; Steatosis","aldehyde dehydrogenase; apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; creatine kinase; cysteine; electron transferring flavoprotein; fatty acid binding protein 4; glucose regulated protein 78; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione transferase A4; histidine; hydroxyl radical; kelch like ECH associated protein 1; lysine; proteasome; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; ribosome protein; superoxide dismutase; transcription factor Nrf2; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adipose tissue; aerobic metabolism; aging; alcohol liver disease; alkylation; Alzheimer disease; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; apoptosis; cell death; chronic obstructive lung disease; citric acid cycle; degenerative disease; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; detoxification; diabetes mellitus; DNA modification; fast muscle; fatty acid metabolism; fatty liver; Fenton reaction; glucose metabolism; homeostasis; human; innate immunity; insulin resistance; intracellular signaling; lipid peroxidation; macrophage; mass spectrometry; metabolic regulation; Michael addition; mild cognitive impairment; multiple sclerosis; muscle atrophy; muscle mitochondrion; nerve degeneration; neuropathy; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative phosphorylation; oxidative stress; Parkinson disease; priority journal; protein carbonylation; protein folding; protein function; protein modification; quantitative analysis; reperfusion injury; review; sepsis; slow muscle fiber; Aging; Aldehydes; Antioxidants; Homeostasis; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Metabolism; Metabolic Detoxication, Phase I; Metabolic Detoxication, Phase II; Metabolism; Muscular Atrophy; Nerve Degeneration; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Protein Carbonylation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864321927

This paper investigates reactivity controlled compression ignition operation on a four-cylinder light-duty diesel engine with production-viable hardware using conventional gasoline and diesel fuel. Experimental results are presented over a wide speed and load range using a systematic approach for achieving successful steady-state reactivity controlled compression ignition combustion. The results demonstrated diesel-like efficiency or better over the operating range explored with low engine-out nitrogen oxide and soot emissions. A peak brake thermal efficiency of 39.0% was demonstrated for 2600 r/min and 6.9 bar brake mean effective pressure with nitrogen oxide emissions reduced by an order of magnitude compared to conventional diesel combustion operation.

These changes can impact human health and well-being in a variety of ways: increased risk of foodborne and waterborne diseases; increased frequency and distribution of vector-borne disease; increased mortality and injury due to extreme weather events and heat waves; increased respiratory and cardiovascular disease due to changes in air quality and increased allergens in the air; and increased susceptibility to mental and emotional health challenges. While climate change is a global phenomenon, the impacts are experienced most acutely in place; as such, a sense of place, place-attachment, and place-based identities are important indicators for climate-related health and adaptation. Representing one of the first qualitative case studies to examine the connections among climate change, a changing sense of place, and health in an Inuit context, this research draws data from a multi-year community-driven case study situated in the Inuit community of Rigolet, Nunatsiavut, Canada. Data informing this paper were drawn from the narrative analysis of 72 in-depth interviews conducted from November 2009 to October 2010, as well as from the descriptive analysis of 112 questionnaires from a survey in October 2010 (95% response rate). The findings illustrated that climate change is negatively affecting feelings of place attachment by disrupting hunting, fishing, foraging, trapping, and traveling, and changing local landscapes-changes which subsequently impact physical, mental, and emotional health and well-being. These results also highlight the need to develop context-specific climate-health planning and adaptation programs, and call for an understanding of place-attachment as a vital indicator of health and well-being and for climate change to be framed as an important determinant of health. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Canada; Climate change; Determinants of health; Indigenous health; Inuit; Physical, mental, and emotional health; Place; Place attachment","cardiovascular disease; climate change; health impact; sense of place; waterborne disease; adolescent; adult; aged; article; Canada; child; climate change; emotional attachment; emotional stability; environmental change; environmental impact; Eskimo; female; health; human; human activities; male; mental health; physical capacity; place preference; qualitative analysis; school child; wellbeing; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Climate Change; Emotions; Food Supply; Health Status; Humans; Inuits; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Newfoundland and Labrador; Nunavut; Qualitative Research; Young Adult; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861662466

However the causes of deforestation are rooted in current economic and development paradigms. The causes of deforestation also vary across different geographical regions and have implications for the forest transition. Attempts to reach an international agreement on curbing deforestation have achieved little success despite over 30. years of UN negotiations. New initiatives from REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) could provide financial incentives to curb deforestation. Hence, alternative development paths for forest cover changes and forest transition are analyzed for the REDD policy within the framework of an environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) for deforestation. The EKC models are estimated for geographical regions of Latin America, Africa and Asia. The results based on the panel data analysis of 43 countries, covering the period 1970-1994, provides evidence that an inverted U-shaped EKC fits for Latin America and Africa, while a U-shaped EKC applies to Asia. The results also indicate that strengthening agricultural and forestry sector policies are important for curbing deforestation. The EKC models' estimates could provide guidance for decisions on financing the REDD policy as specific to each region. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","Climate change; Deforestation; Environmental Kuznets curve; Forest transition; REDD","climate change; deforestation; emission control; forest cover; forest ecosystem; geographical region; numerical model; paradigm shift; policy making; pollution policy; United Nations; Africa; Asia; Latin America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862177042

An integrated model, previously developed by the authors, for regional biomass energy network optimisation is used as a basis, and now extended for simultaneous assessment of the supply-chain performance based on LCA (Life cycle assessment). Several total FPs are introduced for "" cradle"" to "" grave"" evaluation, which, besides direct, comprises also indirect effects caused by products' substitutions. In the MCO approach, the annual profit is maximised against each FP generating different sets of Pareto optimal solutions, one for each FP. With this approach the aggregation of different environmental and/or social pressures is thus avoided. The results indicate that total FPs enable the obtaining of more realistic solutions, than in those cases when only direct FPs are considered. More profitable and less environmentally harmful solutions can be gained with significant reduction in total carbon and total energy FPs. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Biomass energy generation; Footprints; LCA; Multi-criteria optimisation; Regional energy supply chains; Total footprints","Energy resources; Life cycle; Optimization; Profitability; Supply chains; Bio-mass energy; Energy supply chains; Footprints; LCA; Optimisations; Total footprints; Biomass; biomass power; ecological footprint; electricity generation; electricity supply; life cycle; optimization; total organic carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864348457

The report also acknowledges insights from life-cycle assessments, which characterize biofuels as a potential source of significant greenhouse-gas emissions and environmental harm. The SRREN made considerable progress in bringing together contrasting views on indirect land-use change from inductive bottom-up studies, such as life-cycle analysis, and deductive top-down assessments.

But, unlike the latter, they are generally presented in terms of units of mass or weight (kilograms per functional unit), rather than in spatial units (such as global hectares). These carbon footprints have become the 'currency' of debate in a climate-constrained world. They are increasingly popular ecological indicators, adopted by individuals, businesses, governments, and the media alike. The influence of economic wealth, population density, and pollutant emission intensity upon national carbon footprints has been correlated using a 'power-law' equation. This analysis provides a greater understanding of the carbon footprint concept and its national determinants in a bipolar world: one embracing the countries of the prosperous or industrialised North of the planet and the other covering the developing, 'Majority' South, where some 80% of the global population resides. Such a bipolar world is depicted by highlighting the countries that make up some of the largest economies in the form of the G-20 nations. This international grouping encompasses nation states from both the North and South. Emerging countries from the South with large populations (such as China and India) now have economies whose overall size rivals those of the North. Here the factors that are principally responsible for driving national carbon footprints are illustrated in the context of their potential consequences for global warming. An insight into these parameters is important in a period when the international community is seeking to agree a successor regime to the Kyoto Protocol on climate change mitigation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon footprints; Carbon weights; International development; Nation states; Sustainability","Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon footprint; Carbon footprints; Climate change mitigation; Ecological indicators; Economic wealth; Environmental footprints; Functional units; Global hectares; Global population; International community; International development; KYOTO protocol; Large population; Nation states; Pollutant emission; Population densities; Power-law; Carbon dioxide; Ecology; Economics; Emission control; Global warming; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; developing world; ecological footprint; global warming; Kyoto Protocol; mitigation; power law; sustainable development; China; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855511483

For example, the Environmental Protection Agency recently estimated that the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendment (CAAA) will produce human health benefits in 2020, from reduced mortality rates, valued at nearly $2 trillion per year, compared to compliance costs of $65 billion ($0.065 trillion). However, while compliance costs can be measured, health benefits are unproved: they depend on a series of uncertain assumptions. Among these are that additional life expectancy gained by a beneficiary (with median age of about 80 years) should be valued at about $80,000 per month; that there is a 100% probability that a positive, linear, no-threshold, causal relation exists between PM 2.5 concentration and mortality risk; and that progress in medicine and disease prevention will not greatly diminish this relationship. We present an alternative uncertainty analysis that assigns a positive probability of error to each assumption. This discrete uncertainty analysis suggests (with probability &gt;90% under plausible alternative assumptions) that the costs of CAAA exceed its benefits. Thus, instead of suggesting to policymakers that CAAA benefits are almost certainly far larger than its costs, we believe that accuracy requires acknowledging that the costs purchase a relatively uncertain, possibly much smaller, benefit. The difference between these contrasting conclusions is driven by different approaches to uncertainty analysis, that is, excluding or including discrete uncertainties about the main assumptions required for nonzero health benefits to exist at all. © 2011 Society for Risk Analysis.","Air pollution health effects; Clean Air Act Amendment 1990; Risk-cost-benefit analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Weibull distribution","Causal relations; Clean air act amendments; Compliance costs; Disease prevention; Health benefits; Health effects; Human health; Life expectancies; Mortality rate; Mortality risk; Policy makers; Pollution emissions; Positive probability; Risk-cost-benefit analysis; Air cleaners; Air pollution; Costs; Environmental Protection Agency; Health; Uncertainty analysis; Weibull distribution; Health risks; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; cost-benefit analysis; emission; health risk; mortality; pollution effect; public health; uncertainty analysis; Weibull theory; air pollution; article; government; human; mortality; particle size; practice guideline; probability; risk assessment; uncertainty; United States; Air Pollution; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Mortality; Particle Size; Probability; Risk Assessment; Uncertainty; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860498206

Although trees may act as a conduit for methane release from soils to atmosphere, the debate centers on whether vegetation directly produces methane by an uncharacterized, abiotic mechanism. A second mechanism of direct methane production in plants occurs when methanogens-microorganisms in the domain Archaea-colonize the wood of living trees. In the debate this biotic mechanism has largely been ignored, yet conditions that promote anaerobic activity in living wood, and hence potentially methane production, are prevalent across forests. We find average, growing season, trunk-gas methane concentrations >15,000 LL-1 in common, temperate-forest species. In upland habitat (where soils are not a significant methane source), concentrations are 2.3-times greater than in lowland areas, and wood cores produce methane in anaerobic, lab-assays. Emission rate estimates from our upland site are 52 9.5 ng CH4 m-2 s-1; rates that are of a similar magnitude to the soil methane sink in temperate forest, and equivalent in global warming potential to ∼18% of the carbon likely sequestered by this forest.

We examined the influence of two different modeling techniques (random forests and beta regression), two different Landsat imagery normalization processes, and eight different sampling intensities across five different pilot areas. We found that random forest out-performed beta regression techniques and that there was little difference between models developed based on the two different normalization techniques. Based on these results we present a prototype study design which will test canopy cover modeling approaches across a broader spatial scale. © 2012 American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.",,"Carbon; Decision trees; Carbon storage; Fundamental component; Landsat imagery; Modeling technique; Normalization process; Pollution mitigation; Regression techniques; Tree canopy covers; Forestry; atmospheric pollution; canopy architecture; ecosystem modeling; empirical analysis; fire behavior; Landsat; pollution policy; regression analysis; sampling; satellite imagery; tree; Decision Theory; Forest Canopy; Mathematical Models; Research; United States; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864263454

The value of 40 W m22 was estimated in an ad hoc manner. A more detailed calculation of this component, termed here the surface transmitted irradiance (STI), is presented, using a lineby-line radiation code and 3D climatologies of temperature, humidity, cloudiness, etc. No assumption is made as to the wavelengths at which radiation from the surface can reach the top of the atmosphere. The role of the water vapor continuum is highlighted. In clear skies, if the continuum is excluded, the global- and annualmean STI is calculated to be about 100 W m22 with a broad maximum throughout the tropics and subtropics. When the continuum is included, the clear-sky STI is reduced to 66 W m22, with a distinctly different geographic distribution, with a minimum in the tropics and local peaks over subtropical deserts. The inclusion of clouds reduces the STI to about 22 W m22. The actual value is likely somewhat smaller due to processes neglected here, and an STI value of 20 W m22 (with an estimated uncertainty of about620%) is suggested to be much more realistic than the previous estimate of 40 W m22. This indicates that less than one-tenth of the OLR originates directly from the surface. © 2012 American Meteorological Society.","Irradiance; Longwave radiation; Radiation budgets; Water vapor","Atmospheric window; Clear sky; Energy budgets; Geographic distribution; Irradiance; Long-wave radiation; Midinfrared; Outgoing longwave radiation; Radiation budget; Surface emissions; Top of the atmospheres; Arid regions; Climatology; Earth atmosphere; Uncertainty analysis; Vapors; Water vapor; Tropics; cloud cover; humidity; irradiance; longwave radiation; radiation budget; temperature; three-dimensional modeling; water vapor; wavelength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862668002

I argue that the years before, during, and after the legislation's passage and the strength of the labor market represent two contexts of reception in which immigrants reside, which determine naturalization decisions. Event history models show that California's naturalization rates dramatically increased after the legislation's passage, a pattern that is most pronounced among Latinos, while rates declined during difficult times, a pattern more pronounced among Asians. Thus, Latinos' naturalization rates are affected more by the state policy climate, while Asians rates are affected more by long-term economic health. © 2012 by the Center for Migration Studies of New York.",,"historical perspective; immigrant; immigration policy; international migration; labor market; labor migration; naturalization; California; Los Angeles [California]; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862852954

The effect of CO2 is independent of changes in intracellular and extracellular pH, independent of the mechanism used to activate the cAMP signaling pathway, and is independent of cell context. A combination of pharmacological and genetic tools demonstrated that the effect of elevated CO2 on cAMPlevels required the activity of the IP3 receptor. Consistent with these findings, CO2 caused an increase in steady state cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations not observed in the absence of the IP3 receptor or under nonspecific acidotic conditions. We examined the well characterized cAMP-dependent inhibition of the isoform 3 Na+/H+ antiporter (NHE3) to demonstrate a functional relevance for CO2-mediated reductions in cellular cAMP.

For each option, emissions of active pharmaceutical ingredients to the environment (API emissions) are estimated along with nine other types of emissions to air and water (non-API emissions). Under a scenario with 50% take-back to a pharmacy and 50% trash disposal, current API emissions are expected to be reduced by 93%. This is within 6% of a 100% trash disposal scenario, which achieves an 88% reduction. The 50% take-back scenario achieves a modest reduction in API emissions over a 100% trash scenario while increasing most non-API emissions by over 300%. If the 50% of unused pharmaceuticals not taken-back are toileted instead of trashed, all emissions increase relative to 100% trash disposal. Evidence suggests that 50% participation in take-back programs could be an upper bound. As a result, we recommend trash disposal for unused pharmaceuticals.

Due to their high biological activity, antibiotics may have more environmental impacts than other pharmaceuticals. Wetlands are often used to treat or polish wastewater, with the goals of reducing nutrient and carbon loading into the environment. Nitrogen and carbon processing in wetlands is largely associated with microbial activity, however impacts to microbial activity due to antibiotic loading into treatment wetlands is relatively unknown. Two wetland soils (mineral and peat) were individually spiked with ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole or tetracycline ranging from 1-1000 ppb to examine effects on microbial mediated evolution of CH4, CO2 and N2. The antibiotics both positively and negatively affected microbial respiration (a proxy for microbial activity) rates in the two wetland soils depending on soil properties and concentration. Sulfamethoxazole reduced CO2 and N2O respiration rates at higher concentrations (500, 1000 ppb) in the mineral soil. However, the CO2 rates recovered within 48 hours, while N2O suppression continued through the end of the incubation. Ciprofloxacin and sulfamethoxazole also demonstrated the ability to suppress respiration at low spiking concentrations (1, 50 ppb) for several treatments. The results demonstrate the ability of antibiotics to impact soil respiration at environmentally relevant concentrations. Parameters that appear to affect the impacts of antibiotics were sorption, length of exposure and soil carbon content. Future studies are needed to provide further insight into antibiotic effects to microbial community structure. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","carbon dioxide; denitrification; sulfamethoxazole; Wastewater treatment","Antibiotic effects; Biologically active compounds; Carbon loadings; Ciprofloxacin; Microbial activities; Microbial community structures; Microbial respiration; Mineral soils; Respiration rate; Soil carbon; Soil property; Soil respiration; Spiking concentration; Sulfamethoxazole; Treated wastewater; Treatment wetlands; Wetland soils; Antibiotics; Bioactivity; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Denitrification; Loading; Soils; Sorption; Wastewater treatment; Wetlands; Soil pollution; carbon; carbon dioxide; ciprofloxacin; methane; mineral; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; peat; sulfamethoxazole; tetracycline; article; controlled study; drug effect; environment; microbial activity; microbial respiration; nonhuman; nutrient; screening; soil property; waste water management; wetland; Analysis of Variance; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Carbon Dioxide; Chromatography, Gas; Ciprofloxacin; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Environmental Pollutants; Louisiana; Methane; Nitrogen; Oxygen Consumption; Soil Microbiology; Sulfamethoxazole; Tetracycline; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861418280

Over the next ~100 years, increased temperature and aridity are projected for the region, as well as a reduction in forested areas. All 30 species were considered vulnerable with respect to at least some criteria comprising the decision-support tool. The elegant trogon (Trogon elegans) and Tarahumara frog (Rana tarahumarae) were tied for the largest vulnerability score. The Slevin's bunchgrass lizard (Sceloporus slevini) had the smallest vulnerability score. While species varied in their expected responses to climate change, most appeared to be vulnerable relative to one or more expected negative impacts to their habitat, such as an overall reduction in suitable habitat. The assessment results can be used by USFS managers in climate change adaptation planning for these species and their habitats by helping to identify goals for adaptation planning.","Climate change; Coronado National Forest; Decision-support tool; Vulnerability assessment; Wildlife management","aridity; biotic factor; bird; climate change; conservation planning; decision support system; frog; habitat selection; lizard; phenology; physiology; vulnerability; wildlife management; Arizona; Coronado National Forest; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862572258

Soil biocrust communities (consisting of cyanobacteria, lichen, and mosses) are ubiquitous to desert ecosystems, play an array of ecological roles, and display a strong sensitivity to environmental changes. Crust mosses are particularly responsive to changes in precipitation and exhibit rapid declines in biomass and mortality following the addition of small rainfall events. Further, loss of the moss component in biocrusts leads to declines in crust structure and function. In this study, we sought to understand the physiological responses of the widespread and often dominant biocrust moss Syntrichia caninervis to alterations in rainfall. Moss samples were collected during all four seasons and exposed to two rainfall event sizes and three desiccation period (DP) lengths. A carbon balance approach based on single precipitation events was used to define the carbon gain or loss during a particular hydration period. Rainfall event size was the strongest predictor of carbon balance, and the largest carbon gains were associated with the largest precipitation events. In contrast, small precipitation events resulted in carbon deficits for S. caninervis. Increasing the length of the DP prior to an event resulted in reductions in carbon balance, probably because of the increased energetic cost of hydration following more intense bouts of desiccation. The season of collection (i.e., physiological status of the moss) modulated these responses, and the effects of DP and rainfall on carbon balance were different in magnitude (and often in sign) for different seasons. In particular, S. caninervis displayed higher carbon balances in the winter than in the summer, even for events of identical size. Overall, our results suggest that annual carbon balance and survivorship in biocrust mosses are largely driven by precipitation, and because of the role mosses play in biocrusts, changes in intra-annual precipitation patterns can have implications for hydrology, soil stability, and nutrient cycling in dryland systems. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","Biocrust; Carbon balance; Colorado Plateau; Deserts; Desiccation; Global change; Moab; Moss; Nutrient cycling; Precipitation; Syntrichia caninervis; USA; Utah","rain; annual variation; carbon balance; desert; environmental change; global change; hydration; moss; nutrient cycling; physiological response; population decline; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; seasonality; soil microorganism; article; carbon cycle; desert climate; ecosystem; moss; oxygen consumption; physiology; season; United States; Bryophyta; Carbon Cycle; Desert Climate; Ecosystem; Oxygen Consumption; Rain; Seasons; Utah; Moab; United States; Utah; Bryophyta; Cyanobacteria; Syntrichia caninervis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864255478

As a group, our CO powder spectra have some similarities and differences. COs have experienced varying degree of thermal metamorphism, with petrologic subgrades ranging from ~CO3.0 to ~CO3.8. Their reflectance spectra are characterized by a ubiquitous absorption feature in the 1μm region, and a nearly ubiquitous feature in the 2μm region that appears in CO &gt;3.1 spectra. The 1μm region feature is attributable to abundant Fe-bearing amorphous phases (and Fe-poor olivine) in the lower petrologic subtypes, which gradually transforms to more abundant and Fe-rich olivine with increasing metamorphism. The increase in depth and decrease in wavelength position of this feature are consistent with this transformation.All but the least-altered COs also exhibit an absorption feature in the 2μm region whose depth also generally increases with increasing metamorphic grade, resulting in increasingly blue-sloped spectra and larger band area ratios. The wavelength position and change in depth of this feature (ranging from 0% to 12.2%) is consistent with increasing Fe 2+ in spinel, which is present in calcium-aluminum and ameboid olivine inclusions. Reflectance of a local reflectance maximum near 0.8μm increases with increasing thermal metamorphism and this is likely due to the loss and aggregation of carbonaceous phases. The increasing reflectance is negatively correlated with various measures of spectral slope (i.e., brighter=bluer), and while this cannot be uniquely attributed to any one cause, it is consistent with increasing spinel Fe 2+ content and decreasing carbonaceous material abundance or aggregation. With decreasing grain size, CO spectra normally become brighter and more red-sloped. The 0.6/0.5μm ratios of CO falls are consistently higher than CO finds, suggesting that terrestrial weathering has affected the visible wavelength region spectral properties of finds.Unmetamorphosed CO spectra may be difficult to distinguish from the least altered CM chondrites. However above petrologic grade ~3.1, COs can be uniquely discriminated from CI, CM, metamorphosed CI and CM, and CR chondrites, by the presence of both olivine and spinel absorption bands. Some K-class asteroids exhibit olivine and spinel absorption bands, consistent with CO chondrites, although modeled olivine:spinel ratios are generally lower in these asteroids than in CO chondrites. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","Asteroids, Composition; Meteorites; Mineralogy; Spectroscopy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862688947

U.S. public policy is progressively driven by divisive symbols and dominated by morality debates often articulated in the form of emotional narratives. One such issue that has gained attention in the U.S., partially due to efforts of First Lady Michelle Obama, is the increasing levels of obesity. Obesity policy advocates warn that the U.S. is facing a crisis that impacts not only our health, but our national competitiveness; not only our military preparedness, but our national security. Our goal is not to get involved in the scientific debate over obesity and its costs to society but rather to explore the role that policy narratives and causal attribution play in determining attitudes toward obesity and obesity policy. We contend that an individual's view of obesity is shaped by their view of individual rights and responsibilities and of individual morality; and determined more by stories (especially narratives that ""fit"" with those views) than by science. Our paper seeks to test whether science or other factors primarily shape one's view of government's appropriate role relative to the obesity issue and to examine which of two foundational moral narratives is more convincing in the obesity policy realm. Using a sample of 172 respondents at two institutions of higher education in the United States, we find that a ""Strict Father Morality"" narrative was more convincing than a science statement in influencing an individual's view of obesity. Respondents believed that obesity was a serious problem, but they were deeply divided over government's role in addressing the obesity issue. Female respondents were the most supportive of governmental efforts to address obesity.

Krill feeding is thus important to ecosystem carbon cycling. Traditional approaches to determining in-situ krill feeding require a priori assumptions, and may have prey-type detection biases. We took a DNA-based approach to measuring in-situ feeding by northern krill Meganyctiphanes norvegica. The diversity of prey consumed by M. norvegica in situ was analyzed for 80 krill at 8 stations throughout the Gulf of Maine (North Atlantic) using peptide nucleic acid mediated polymerase chain reaction (PNA-PCR) clone library sequencing of 18S rDNA. Relative abundance of the 2 most common prey types was measured with quantitative PCR (qPCR) in the guts of 16 krill. The 245 prey sequences recovered from krill gut contents included copepods, salps, phytoplankton, and a poorly known organism found to be sediment associated. Calanus finmarchicus and the sediment- associated organism were found most commonly, at 7 and 8 stations, respectively, and their 18S rDNA was present in nearly equal quantities in individual krill guts. M. norvegica, like most krill, are typically considered planktivorous; thus krill feeding on sediment organisms represents an unrecognized pathway for carbon flow from the sediment to the pelagic. Calculations suggest that this unrecognized pathway could potentially bring over 100 000 t of carbon annually back into the Gulf of Maine pelagic ecosystem, equivalent to 4% of annual primary production, or the energy demands of 80% of the region's fin whale population. © Inter-Research 2012.","18S rDNA; Benthic-pelagic coupling; Gut contents; Meganyctiphanes norvegica; PNA-PCR","benthic-pelagic coupling; carbon cycle; fish; marine ecosystem; marine sediment; net primary production; pelagic ecosystem; phytoplankton; polymerase chain reaction; seabird; whale; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Maine; Balaenoptera physalus; Calanus finmarchicus; Cetacea; Copepoda; Euphausiacea; Meganyctiphanes norvegica; Salpida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861887082

In all cases, species richness expansion followed an essentially logistic curve typical of that associated with ecologically closed habitats, with niche saturation being achieved in about three million years. The resulting steady-state (""climax"") coal swamp vegetation had a local-scale (within an area of c. 0.1ha) species diversity in South Wales of 16±7 and Simpson Diversity Indices of 4.53±2.55, which are very similar to values obtained from studies on North American coal swamp vegetation. Landscape diversity (within an area 105km2) varied between 50 and 100 species in the lower to middle Westphalian Stage, falling to about 40-50 species in the upper Westphalian Stage. Regional-scale diversity (within an area&gt;105km2) is difficult to estimate but was at least 120 species. Species turn-over was typically very low, at about 4 species per million years, but there were a number of intervals of more rapid species turn-over in the early Langsettian, late Duckmantian, early Bolsovian and middle Asturian times, which are recognised today as biozonal boundaries. The swamps were mostly subject to ecological stasis during early and middle Westphalian times, although they contracted locally in response to drying of substrates. Later in Westphalian times, however, the swamps were subject to regional-scale changes in composition and aerial extent, probably in response to climate change. The coal swamps had a much lower species diversity compared to modern-day tropical rain forests. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","Palaeoclimates; Palaeoecology; Palaeotropical; Pennsylvanian; Vegetation","biodiversity; paleobotany; paleoclimate; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; Pennsylvanian; species diversity; species richness; vegetation; Canada; Cape Breton Island; England; Germany; North Rhine-Westphalia; Nova Scotia; Pennines; Ruhr; Saarland; South Wales; Sydney [Cape Breton Island]; United Kingdom; Wales",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864824677

Notwithstanding, models within an ensemble will have varying degrees of similarity for different outputs of interest. Multi-model ensembles have been used to increase forecast skill by using simple or weighted averages where weights have been obtained by considering factors such as estimated model bias and consensus with other models (Giorgi and Mearns, J.

In this respect, we should consider the opportunities to reduce carbon footprint for small and large wastewater treatment plants. The use of anaerobic rather than aerobic treatment processes would achieve this aim because no aeration is required and the generation of methane can be used within the plant. High-rate anaerobic digesters receive great interests due to their high loading capacity and low sludge production. Among them, the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors have been most widely used. However, there are still unresolved issues inhibiting the widespread of this technology in developing countries or countries with climate temperature fluctuations (such as subtropical regions). A large number of studies have been carried out in order to enhance the performance of UASB reactors but there is a lack of updated documentation. In face of the existing limitations and the increasing importance of this technology, the authors present an up-to-date review on the performance enhancements of UASB reactors over the last decade.

The global community is taking immediate action to reduce the CO 2 and green house gases (GHG) that are being produced due to global warming. The Kyoto protocol agreement has set binding targets for 37 industrialized countries and the European community to reduce their GHG emissions by an average of 5%, back to 1990 levels, within the years of 2008-2012. The global community is making many efforts to reduce CO 2 and green house gases (GHG). The building construction industry is responsible for approximately 40% of the carbon dioxide emissions. There are currently more than four super tall, more than 100 story, high rise building construction projects in metropolitan Seoul, and this ranks Korea in the top four countries worldwide for the number of high rise buildings. Reducing the amount of structural steel in these high rise buildings by using an optimum structural design would reduce CO 2 and green house gas (GHG) emissions. This aim of this study was to analyze the lateral load resisting structural systems in a high rise steel building in order to select the optimum structural system under the equivalent allowable lateral drift. The environmental impact was assessed using the LCA tool, and the results are discussed along with possible recommendations that may improve the current LCA tools. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It aims to describe the main climate changerelated policies and to discuss the role of China in international climate change negotiations. A qualitative method has been used for this paper. A preliminary desk study based on the analysis of the primary and secondary sources published in both English and Chinese (Mandarin) has been conducted. Literature on policy analysis and evaluation and the role of political actors in it, as well as examples of energy efficiency studies in other countries has been studied to develop an analytical framework for the empirical data interpretation. The main sources for information about China's situation are books, articles, as well as internet resources and newspapers covering China's politics, the climate change regime, and Chinese climate policy. The paper provides insights into China's climate change policy making process and outlines the main challenges that policy implementation in China is facing today. It was appreciated that some sources should be used with caution as information given in Chinese is subject to censorship and governmental control in China and therefore may be biased. It is not possible to avoid this problem totally when dealing with a state like China, but using multiple sources and personal observation may improve the reliability of the information. The paper includes suggestions on policy improvements such as strengthening of supervision mechanisms and creating a Ministry of Energy.

We studied here the bi- and tri-partite relationships between and among the plant diversity, productivity and climate variables (i.e., temperature, precipitation and moisture) in a tropical ecosystem in India by analyzing three forest types for the year 2010. Comparison of productivity (Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model derived-net primary productivity, NPP) and climate condition with respect to 2001 showed significant increase in NPP and temperature and overall decrease in precipitation and moisture condition in last decade. The NPP for sal forest ranged from 579.4 to 1,142 for the year 2001 and 557.2 to 1231.6 g Cm -2year -1 for the year 2010. The mean monthly temperature varied from 18 to 21.8°C and 26 to 27°C; and the annual precipitation varied from 15 to 45 and 32 to 76 cm/year for the year 2001 and 2010 respectively. Strong correlation was observed between monthly mean temperature and productivity during 2001, while a decrease was observed during the year 2010. The ecosystem has shown a trend of rapid drying in last decade, triggering more detail studies for understanding of the eco-climatology. In general, sal forest, a natural forest sowed higher diversity and productivity followed by mixed deciduous (MD) forest and teak plantation. Though, areas with higher NPP are well correlated with higher temperature, precipitation and moisture; they seem to be related to species density rather than diversity. However, there is a need to have year-on-year assessments in order to ascertain if this difference represents a real phenomenon rather than an artefact of sampling. The pilot study helps in understanding the complex relationships and is very useful in the fast changing climate. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","India; Natural and managed ecosystem; NDMI; Sal; Teak; Terai","biodiversity; climatology; conservation management; deciduous forest; mixed forest; moisture flux; net primary production; plantation; precipitation (climatology); temperature profile; tropical environment; tropical region; India; Tarai; Tectona grandis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859590333

Engine manufacturers routinely use one-dimensional engine cycle simulation for performance and emissions prediction, and accurate engine-turbocharger matching is a key aspect. Turbocharger turbines are subject to the highly unsteady, pulsating flow inherent to reciprocating engines, however standard 1D turbine models rely on steady state test measurements. Simplification of turbine geometry is unavoidable, especially in 1D performance studies, yet this must not be taken so far that it prohibits acceptable prediction accuracy. This paper presents the geometrical effects of 1D numerical models of a twin entry turbocharger turbine under full admission pulsating flow conditions. Several turbine volute models of increasing complexity were developed and the corresponding performance predicted using a 1D compressible flow solver. The predicted mass flow rate is strongly dependent on local total state flow parameters, and higher secondary mass flow rate fluctuation was noticed as model complexity increased. Finally, a two-inlet constant cross-section model with junction tongue gave the best compromise of flow prediction accuracy and geometrical complexity. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Ocean-atmospheric changes caused by greenhouse gas emissions are likely to affect future fish and shellfish production, and lead to increasing challenges in ensuring long-term sustainable fisheries management. The paper reviews existing knowledge and understanding of the exposure of marine ecosystems to ocean-atmospheric changes, the consequences of these changes for marine fisheries in the UK and Ireland, and the adaptability of the UK and Irish fisheries sector. Ocean warming is resulting in shifts in the distribution of exploited species and is affecting the productivity of fish stocks and underlying marine ecosystems. In addition, some studies suggest that ocean acidification may have large potential impacts on fisheries resources, in particular shell-forming invertebrates. These changes may lead to loss of productivity, but also the opening of new fishing opportunities, depending on the interactions between climate impacts, fishing grounds and fleet types. They will also affect fishing regulations, the price of fish products and operating costs, which in turn will affect the economic performance of the UK and Irish fleets. Key knowledge gaps exist in our understanding of the implications of climate and ocean chemistry changes for marine fisheries in the UK and Ireland, particularly on the social and economic responses of the fishing sectors to climate change. However, these gaps should not delay climate change mitigation and adaptation policy actions, particularly those measures that clearly have other 'co-benefits'. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Acidification; Climate change; Coastal; Disturbance; Ecosystem services; Estuary; Fish; Invertebrates; Ocean","acidification; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; coastal zone; economic activity; ecosystem service; emission inventory; fish; fishery management; fishing effort; greenhouse gas; marine ecosystem; nature-society relations; productivity; regulatory framework; shellfish fishery; sustainable development; warming; Ireland; United Kingdom; Invertebrata",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861987576

With the aid of the Fermi's golden rule, the spontaneous emission of the emitter can be calculated from the local density of states, which can be further expressed by the imaginary part of the dyadic Green's function of the whole electromagnetic system. To obtain this Green's function numerically, a surface integral equation is established taking into account the scattering from the metallic nanoscatterers. Particularly, the modeling of the planar multilayered structure is simplified by applying the layered medium Green's function to reduce the computational domain and hence the memory requirement.

In this article, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we report the formation of trans-polyacetylene on single-walled carbon-doped boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) through their adsorption of a series of C2H 2 molecules. The results show that, rather than through [2+2] cycloaddition, an individualmolecule would preferentially attach to a carbon-doped BNNT via ""carbon attack"" (i.e., a carbon in the C 2H2 attacks a site on the BNNT). The adsorption energy gradually decreases with increasing tube diameter. The free radical of the carbon-doped BNNT is almost completely transferred to the carbon atom at the end of the adsorbed C2H2 molecule. When another C 2H2 molecule approaches the carbon-doped BNNT, it is most energetically favorable for this C2H2 molecule to be adsorbed at the end of the previously adsorbed C2H2 molecule, and so on with extra C2H2 molecules, leading to the formation of polyacetylene on the nanotube. The spin of the whole system is always localized at the tip of the polyacetylene formed, which initiates the adsorption of the incoming species. The present results imply that carbon-doped BNNT is an effective ""metal-free"" initiator for the formation of polyacetylene. © Springer-Verlag 2011.","Carbon-doped boron nitride nanotubes; DFT; Polyacetylene","boron nitride nanotube; carbon; polyacetylene derivative; single walled nanotube; adsorption; article; chemical structure; cycloaddition; density functional theory; energy; priority journal; Adsorption; Boron Compounds; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Nanotubes, Carbon; Polyacetylenes; Polymerization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864689108

In the majority of such efforts, upper limits are set for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by utilities and industries, and exchangeable permits are made available to emitters in the form of allocations based on past emissions, auctions, or a combination of both. In this complicated atmosphere, the environmental problems related to climate change have turned into a sensitive international political topic that has been discussed at the United Nations General Assembly since 1988, and the threat of global warming has received increasing attention. In 1994, 150 countries made agreements under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Since then, the United Nations (UN) has held a UNFCCC convention annually. Because Taiwan is not a signatory nation to the Kyoto Protocols, we may not be ""legally"" compelled to obey the regulations on carbon dioxide reduction. However, the total production of GHGs by our country represents one percent of that for the entire world, and with respect to our responsibilities as members of the so-called ""Global Village"" and the restrictions of the international contract, it is truly wise to consider and develop measures for GHG reduction as soon as possible. To coincide with the co-related missions of being a ""Healthy City,"" a ""City of Continual Development"", and the ""Green Society City of Tainan,"" the Tainan city government has created a set of ideal institutional mission-statements called the ""Healthy Continually Developing City"" and has planned a series of GHG impetuses, which include pushing outreach activities on energy conservation and carbon dioxide reduction, such as environmentally-friendly hotels, green energy stores, energy conserving temples, vegetarian restaurants and waste reduction. Because of activities such as using the four methods of energy conservation at department stores and applying energy-conserving light sources at Ta-Tien-Hou temple, carbon emissions have been reduced to 1,176,792 kg (56.1%) and 148,016 kg (96.0%), respectively, per year. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

This paper provides an overview of the economic and environmental performance of biogas-linked agrosystem (BLAS) in China by focusing on efficiency, emission mitigation effect and sustainability. An emergy synthesis combing emergy accounting and emergetic ternary diagram are utilized to evaluate the overall BLAS and its four subsystems (i.e., planting subsystem, breeding subsystem, aquaculture subsystem and biogas subsystem) in terms of current status and future development. Our findings indicate that despite a high energy transformity at system scale and a great dependence on economic input, BLAS advantages itself with high biogas production efficiency and significant emission mitigation effect. Furthermore, the sustainability zone analysis shows that the overall BLAS, planting and aquaculture subsystems maintain medium-term sustainability under all policy scenarios, despite the fact that breeding and biogas subsystems stay in an unsustainable situation due to their relatively severe environmental load. Among all the studied future options, continual biogas construction and effective technological revolution instead of expanding investment in traditional agriculture are preferable routes to further improve the system performance. Last but not least, emissions mitigation, energy efficiency and system sustainability are unveiled to be positively correlated within BLAS, which entitles it a promising energy alternative to enhance biogas energy utilization in the local agriculture in face of today's energy crisis. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite acceptance and usage worldwide, TBZ was only recently approved in the United States for the treatment of Huntington chorea. This review focuses on the use of TBZ in various hyperkinetic movement disorders, which are considered ""rare"" or ""orphan"" diseases, to help practitioners better understand its clinical role and use. Objective: This review describes the clinical efficacy and tolerability of TBZ in the management of dystonia, Huntington chorea, tardive dyskinesia (TDk), and tic disorders. Methods: A Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MedlinePlus, PubMed, and clinical trials database search (up to May 2012) was conducted to identify articles and studies using the subject terms tetrabenazine, Huntington disease, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, Tourette, tics, and hyperkinetic movement. Only English-language articles were reviewed. Results: TBZ variably undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism to active metabolites, some of which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 2D6 isozyme. Pharmacology studies demonstrate that TBZ reversibly inhibits the activity of vesicular monoamine transporter 2, resulting in depletion of central dopamine. For management of dystonias, 1 of 3 small prospective blinded studies and 4 of 5 retrospective studies reported clinical benefit with TBZ use in pediatrics and adults. For Huntington chorea, 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies along with open-label studies demonstrate the effectiveness of TBZ in adults. For TDk, 9 of 11 studies (prospective controlled and retrospective) reported positive benefit. For Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, 9 of 11 studies (prospective controlled and retrospective) reported positive benefit on motor and phonic tics in pediatric and adult patients. Overall, adverse effects are dose and age related and include depression, fatigue, parkinsonism, and somnolence. Conclusions: TBZ is an effective oral therapy for chorea of Huntington disease and may be considered as an alternative agent for the management of dystonia, TDk, and tic disorders (these latter 3 conditions are off-label uses in the United States). The drug possesses an acceptable tolerability profile and has been used in pediatric and adult populations. © 2012 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc.","Dystonia; Huntington disease; Tardive dyskinesia; Tetrabenazine; Tics","amantadine; antidepressant agent; aripiprazole; botulinum toxin; carbonyl reductase; cholinergic receptor blocking agent; clonidine; clozapine; cytochrome P450 2D6; dihydrotetrabenazine; dopamine; drug metabolite; fluoxetine; fluphenazine; haloperidol; molindone; muscle relaxant agent; olanzapine; paroxetine; pimozide; placebo; quetiapine; quinidine; risperidone; tetrabenazine; thioridazine; tiotixene; trifluoperazine; unindexed drug; vesicular monoamine transporter 2; akathisia; anxiety disorder; attention deficit disorder; clinical effectiveness; clinical trial (topic); Cochrane Library; decreased appetite; depression; disorders of carbohydrate metabolism; disorders of lipid metabolism; dopamine brain level; double blind procedure; drowsiness; drug cost; drug dose reduction; drug dose titration; drug efficacy; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; dyskinesia; dystonia; Embase; fatigue; first pass effect; focal dystonia; generalized dystonia; Gilles de la Tourette syndrome; hemiballism; human; Huntington chorea; impulsiveness; loading drug dose; medical record review; Medline; metabolic disorder; metabolite; motor activity; observational study; obsessive compulsive disorder; parkinsonism; primary health care; prospective study; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); retrospective study; review; sedation; segmental dystonia; side effect; somnolence; suicidal behavior; tardive dyskinesia; weight gain; Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors; Animals; Chorea; Dystonia; Humans; Huntington Disease; Hyperkinesis; Movement Disorders; Rare Diseases; Tetrabenazine; Tic Disorders",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863825952

Two approaches were used to study the ozone formation potentials or source reactivities of different anthropogenic organic compounds emission categories in California's South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB). The first approach was based on the combination of total organic gases (TOG) emission speciation profiles and the maximum incremental reactivity (MIR) scale of organic species. The second approach quantified ozone impacts from different emission sources by performing 3-dimensional air quality model sensitivity analysis involving increased TOG emissions from particular sources. The source reactivities derived from these two approaches agree reasonably well for 58 anthropogenic organic compounds emission categories in the SoCAB. Both approaches identify TOG emissions from mobile sources as having the highest reactivity. Source reactivities from both approaches were also combined with TOG emissions from each source category to produce a 2005 reactivity-based anthropogenic TOG emission inventory for the SoCAB. The top five reactivity-based anthropogenic TOG emission sources in the SoCAB during 2005 were: light-duty passenger cars, off-road equipment, consumer products, light-duty trucks category 2 (i.e., 3751-5750 lb), and recreational boats. This is in contrast to the mass-based TOG emission inventory, which indicates that livestock waste and composting emission categories were two of the five largest mass-based anthropogenic TOG emission sources. The reactivity-based TOG emission inventory is an important addition to the mass-based TOG emission inventory because it represents the ozone formation potentials from emission sources and can be used to assist in determining targeted sources for developing organic compounds reduction policies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","CAMx; Maximum incremental reactivity; SAPRC; Total organic gases","3-dimensional; Air quality models; California; CAMx; Emission inventories; Emission sources; Light-duty; Livestock wastes; Maximum incremental reactivities; Mobile sources; Off-road equipments; Organic species; Ozone formation; Ozone formation potentials; SAPRC; South Coast Air Basin of California; South Coast Air basins; Agriculture; Air quality; Automobiles; Consumer products; Ozone; Organic compounds; acetaldehyde; diesel fuel; formaldehyde; methane; organic compound; ozone; air quality; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric pollution; coastal zone; emission inventory; organic compound; ozone; pollutant source; pollution policy; aerosol; agricultural worker; air pollution; air quality; air quality control; article; car; chemical analysis; chemical reaction; controlled study; diesel engine; environmental impact assessment; exhaust gas; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; sewage treatment; United States; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859936726

With the goal of increasing carbon sequestration, a Congressional project has been planned to afforest about 18million acres by 2020 in the SoutheastUnited States (SEUS), theGreat Lake states, and the Corn Belt states. However, biophysical feedbacks of afforestation have the potential to counter the beneficial climatic consequences of carbon sequestration. To assess the potential biophysical effects of afforestation over the SEUS, the authors designed a set of initial value ensemble experiments and long-term quasi-equilibrium experiments in a fully coupled Community Climate System Model, version 3.5 (CCSM3.5). Model results show that afforestation over the SEUS not only has a local cooling effect in boreal summer [June-August (JJA)] at short and long time scales but also induces remote warming over adjacent regions of the SEUS at long time scales. Precipitation, in response to afforestation, increases over the SEUS (local effect) and decreases over adjacent regions (remote effect) in JJA. The local surface cooling and increase in precipitation over SEUS in JJA are hydrologically driven by the changes in evapotranspiration and latent heat flux.

Here, we report actual maize yields in the Huanghuaihai region over the past 50 years (1957-2007), simulated yields of major varieties in different years (Baimaya in the 1950s, Zhengdan-2 in the 1970s, Yedan-13 in the 1990s, and Zhengdan-958 in the 2000s), and factors that influence yield. The results show that, although each variety change has played a critical role in increasing maize yields, the contribution of variety to yield increase has decreased steadily over the past 50 years (42.6%-44.3% from the 1950s to the 1970s, 34.4%-47.2% from the 1970s to the 1990s, and 21.0%-37.6% from the 1990s to the 2000s). The impact of climatic conditions on maize yield has exhibited an increasing trend (0.67%-22.5% from the 1950s to the 1970s, 2.6%-27.0% from the 1970s to the 1990s, and 9.1%-51.1% from the 1990s to the 2000s); however, interannual differences can be large, especially if there were large changes in temperature and rainfall. Among climatic factors, rainfall had a greater positive influence than light and temperature on yield increase. Cultivation measures could change the contribution rates of variety and climatic conditions. Overall, unless there is a major breakthrough in variety, improving cultivation measures will remain important for increasing future summer maize yields in the Huanghuaihai region. © 2011 ISB.","Climatic condition; Cultivation measure; Summer maize (Zea mays L.); Variety; Yield-influencing factor","rain; article; China; climate change; growth, development and aging; light; maize; season; temperature; theoretical model; China; Climate Change; Light; Models, Theoretical; Rain; Seasons; Temperature; Zea mays; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862904104

This model was used to represent interactions between regional climate and crop growth processes. The effects of crop growth and development processes on regional climate were then studied based on two 20-year simulations over the East Asian monsoon area conducted using the original regional climate model RegCM3, and the coupled RegCM3_CERES model. The numerical experiments revealed that incorporating the crop growth and development processes into the regional climate model reduced the root mean squared error of the simulated precipitation by 2.2-10.7% over north China, and the simulated temperature by 5.5-30.9% over the monsoon region in eastern China. Comparison of the simulated results obtained using RegCM3_CERES and RegCM3 showed that the most significant changes associated with crop modeling were the changes in leaf area index which in turn modify the aspects of surface energy and water partitions and lead to moderate changes in surface temperature and, to some extent, rainfall. Further analysis revealed that a robust representation of seasonal changes in plant growth and developmental processes in the regional climate model changed the surface heat and moisture fluxes by modifying the vegetation characteristics, and that these differences in simulated surface fluxes resulted in different structures of the boundary layer and ultimately affected the convection. The variations in leaf area index and fractional vegetation cover changed the distribution of evapotranspiration and heat fluxes, which could potentially lead to anomalies in geopotential height, and consequently influenced the overlying atmospheric circulation. These changes would result in redistribution of the water and energy through advection. Nevertheless, there are significant uncertainties in modeling how monsoon dynamics responds to crop modeling and more research is needed. © 2011 The Author(s).","Crop growth and development; East Asian monsoon area; Regional climate","atmospheric circulation; atmospheric convection; boundary layer; climate modeling; computer simulation; crop; evapotranspiration; growth response; heat flux; leaf area index; moisture flux; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; surface temperature; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861823057

Through a detailed spectral analysis for each lens we find that simple power-law models plus Gaussian emission lines give good fits to the spectra. We detect intrinsic spectral variability in two epochs of Q2237+0305, and differential absorption between images in QJ0158-4325 and Q2237+0305. We also detect the FeKα emission line in all six lenses, and the Ni XXVII Kα line in two images of Q2237+0305. The rest-frame equivalent widths of the FeKα lines are measured to be 0.4-1.2keV, significantly higher than those measured in typical active galactic nuclei of similar X-ray luminosities.

Aquifer sediments were analyzed for hydroxylamine and NaOH-extractable organic carbon, yielding a probable underestimate of potentially bioavailable organic carbon (PBOC). Aquifer sediments were also analyzed for total organic carbon (TOC) using an elemental combustion analyzer, yielding a probable overestimate of bioavailable carbon. Concentrations of PBOC correlated linearly with TOC with a slope near one. However, concentrations of PBOC were consistently five to ten times lower than TOC. When mean concentrations of dissolved oxygen observed at each site were plotted versus PBOC, it showed that anoxic conditions were initiated at approximately 200 mg/kg of PBOC. Similarly, the accumulation of reductive dechlorination daughter products relative to parent compounds increased at a PBOC concentration of approximately 200 mg/kg. Concentrations of total hydrolysable amino acids (THAA) in sediments also increased at approximately 200 mg/kg, and bioassays showed that sediment CO2 production correlated positively with THAA. The results of this study provide an estimate for threshold amounts of bioavailable carbon present in aquifer sediments (approximately 200 mg/kg of PBOC; approximately 1,000 to 2,000 mg/kg of TOC) needed to support reductive dechlorination in groundwater systems. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Plants were analyzed for their capability to remove nutrient-pollution in parallel with the study of ecological dynamics. Experiments were carried out in cylindrical mesocosms of 5m diameter and 1.2m height, above-ground pools with a water volume of 14m3. The design parameters tested were for 5% and 10% vegetated floating island coverage of the mesocosm, both with and without shoreline plants called littoral zone. This littoral shelf was 0.5m thick, graded at a downward slope of 1:5 toward the center using loamy soil with low organic matter content, excavated from below turf grass. Endemic plant species were chosen for the experimental location in central Florida based on a wetland identification manual by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to ensure the study was not compromised by unique climate requirements of the plants. Nutrient and aquatic chemical conditions such as pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, turbidity, and chlorophyll a were monitored to understand their relationships to the general wetland ecosystem. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis identified the microbial activity near the rhizospheric zone. Logistical placement considerations were made using spatial sampling across the horizontal plane of the mesocosms, beneath and around the root zone, to determine if nutrients tend to aggregate around the floating island. This study concluded that the application of floating islands as a stormwater technology can remove nutrients through plant uptake and biological activity. The most cost-effective size in the outdoor mesocosms was 5% surface area coverage of the mat. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Floating treatment wetland; Mesocosm; Nutrient aggregation; Nutrient removal; Stormwater management","Aquatic ecosystems; Bioactivity; Cost effectiveness; Dissolved oxygen; Polymerase chain reaction; Storms; Wetlands; Floating treatment wetlands; Mesocosms; Nutrient aggregations; Nutrient removal; Storm-water managements; Nutrients; chlorophyll; dissolved oxygen; storm water; aggregation; aquatic plant; best management practice; bioactivity; chlorophyll; cost-benefit analysis; dissolved gas; endemic species; environmental protection; littoral environment; loam; mesocosm; microbial activity; nutrient; nutrient uptake; organic matter; pH; pollutant removal; polymerase chain reaction; real time; rhizosphere; shoreline; stormwater; turbidity; wetland; article; chemical analysis; littoral; mesocosm; nonhuman; pH; temperature; turbidity; wetland; Florida [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861479134

Our study area, the SW Barents Sea, is unique in its evolution due to the effect of glaciations which removed thick layers of sediment from the seabed. Unloading due to erosion and deglaciation resulted in opening of pre-existing faults and creation of new ones, facilitating fluid migration and eventually escape into the water from the subsurface. Expressions of hydrocarbon gas accumulation and fluid flow such as gas hydrates and pockmarks are widely distributed in the Barents Sea.Several gas flares, some of them 200m high in echograms, occur along a segment of the Ringvassøy Loppa Fault Complex, indicating open fractures and active fluid flow. Observation of gas flares along regional fault complexes outside pockmark regions indicates that present gas escape occurs along faults only. The pockmark formation and gas flares belong to different episodes of fluid flow. The pockmarks are absent outside soft sediment depocentres indicating that their existence is related to the presence of recording medium. The thin sediment cover in pockmarks and their penetration down into glaciomarine sediments indicate that they formed after deposition of these sediments and that fluid escape was active to the very recent past. Methane hydrate stability zone (MHSZ) modelling shows that after the last glacial maximum 18000-20000 14Cyears ago, the MHSZ has thinned from 600m to zero in most parts of the SW Barents Sea. The fluid expulsion probably happened after retreat of the glaciers causing release of methane from dissociation of methane hydrates through fluid escape processes which lasted until recently. Bottom simulating reflectors (BSR) observed are probably due to structure II hydrates formed from gas containing higher order hydrocarbon components such as ethane, propane, etc. along with methane. The study area falls close to the new gigantic oil discoveries, Skrugard and Havis, and north of the Snøhvit hydrocarbon field. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Barents Sea; BSR; Gas flares; Gas hydrate; Pockmarks; Seismic","Barents sea; BSR; Gas flares; Pockmarks; Seismic; Climate change; Ethane; Flow of fluids; Gases; Glacial geology; Hydration; Methane; Organic compounds; Propane; Sedimentology; Sediments; Tin; Unloading; Gas hydrates; climate change; climate effect; deposition; fluid composition; fluid flow; gas hydrate; geoaccumulation; glaciomarine deposit; pockmark; seafloor; seawater; sediment chemistry; Arctic Ocean; Barents Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860223471

The situation is likely to become exacerbated under the impact of climate change. The purpose of this paper is to quantify the vulnerability of the farmers in Assam to floods in the scenario of the present climate variability taking a case study of the Majuli Island of Jorhat district. Design/methodology/approach: The current vulnerability of the farmers in the Majuli Island of Jorhat district of Assam is quantified using the ""indicator method"". A Composite Vulnerability Index is calculated taking into account various indicators reflective of the exposure, sensitivity and the adaptive capacity of the farmers' community to floods. The indicators have been quantified based on the data obtained from household surveys and participatory rural appraisals (PRAs) in the villages and secondary data sources. Findings: The results show that biophysical factors have the greatest impact on the overall vulnerability of the study area and that strengthened adaptive capacity, proper scientific planning and management is required to protect the Majuli Island from the adverse effects of recurrent floods. Originality/value: This paper shows that the more decentralized the spatial unit of vulnerability assessment is, the more helpful it would be for policy makers and stakeholders to formulate efficient mitigation measures, plan apposite developmental programmes and improve the adaptive capacity of Assam as a whole to face the natural phenomenon of floods. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Composite Vulnerability Index; Floods; India; Indicators; Risk assessment; Vulnerability assessment","adaptation; agricultural worker; biophysics; climate change; decentralization; flood; household survey; mitigation; participatory rural appraisal; policy making; vulnerability; Assam; India; Jorhat; Majuli Island",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864567624

The UK, like many other countries, has set its target to achieve a 12.5% reduction in levels of six greenhouse gases (GHG) by 2010, relative to 1990 levels. In order to gain a complete understanding of the costs and benefits of GHG reductions, the public's willingness-to-pay (WTP) must be considered. In this study the preference and WTP for GHG emissions reductions involving one of the major UK water companies' customers were investigated using a Bayesian mixed logit analysis of survey-based choice experiment data. Advanced econometric techniques were employed to accommodate indifference and multi-modality in preferences and WTPs across various customer segments. Results show that average per unit WTP to avoid increased GHG emissions is larger than that for efforts to reduce them. In addition, customers are less likely to be indifferent to the former compared to the latter; this is particularly true when GHG emission reductions are relatively small. In this case a relatively large proportion of customers are found to be indifferent with a near-zero per unit WTP. On the other hand, as reductions in GHG emissions increase more customers become sensitized as reflected by the smaller proportion of customers with a near-zero per unit WTP. The implications of these results as related to cost-effective investment planning aimed at mitigating climate change risks are further discussed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Bounded distributions; Choice experiment; Greenhouse gas emissions; Mixed logit; Willingness-to-pay","air pollution control; article; Bayes theorem; cost; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; priority journal; statistical model; United Kingdom; willingness to pay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859497240

The origins of third order NLO polarizability and TPA are analyzed in terms of the charge transfer process, which indicates that tetra-coordinate carbons in M-GNRs have an important role in the third-order NLO response. The dynamic nonlinear reflectivity of the M-GNR presents a resonant characteristic due to the large third order NLO polarizability. Moreover, the third order NLO polarizability and TPA cross section values increase as the ribbon size increases in the low frequency region of incident light, which indicates that their NLO properties can be tailored by controlling the ribbon size.

The study emphasizes the role of local governance through an agreement aimed at re-orienting land use activities and forest management. We also present the technical, methodological, and cost-benefit studies behind the proposed framework. For instance, we found that cattle raising profitability in Apuí offers an opportunity for implementing such a pilot project. The framework proposed by the project engage stakeholders and bind together interests of governmental, non-governmental, and local civilian institutions in an agreement mechanism of mutual commitments. We highlight the related challenges and caveats, and the steps identified to overcome these hurdles.

I locate both in the dynamics of capital accumulation on a world-scale, drawing on the ideas of Marx, Karl Polanyi and James O'Connor. I ask whether the recent profusion of ""crisis talk"" in the public domain presents an opportunity for progressive new ideas to take hold now that ""neoliberalism"" has seemingly been de-legitimated. My answer is that a ""post-neoliberal"" future is probably a long way off. I make my case in two stages and at two geographical scales. First, I examine the British social formation as currently constituted and explain why even a leading neoliberal state is failing to reform its ways. Second, I then scale-up from the domestic level to international affairs. I examine cross-border emissions trading-arguably the policy tool for mitigating the very real prospects of significant climate change this century. The overall conclusion is this: even though the ""first"" and ""second"" contradictions of capital have manifested themselves together and at a global level, there are currently few prospects for systemic reform (never mind revolution) led by a new, twenty-first century ""redgreen"" Left. © 2010 the Authors, Book Compilation © 2010 Editorial Board of Antipode and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Britain; Climate change; Economic crisis; Emissions trading; Environmental crisis; Social formation; The EU",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84886046916

To reduce the exhaust gas emissions, many efforts have been carried out to reformulate fuels and design new catalytic converters; however, it is well known that other variables such as socio-economic and transport structure factors also play an important role around this problem. The present study analyzes the roles played by several commonly-used three-way catalytic converters (TWC) and the average traffic speed in the emission of N 2O as greenhouse gas. According to this study, by increasing the average traffic flow and avoiding constant decelerations (frequent stops) during common trips, remarkable environmental and economic benefits could be obtained due to the diminution of N 2O and other contaminant emissions such as ammonia (NH 3) and even CO 2 with the concomitant reduced fossil fuel consumption. The actions mentioned above could be highly viable to diminish, in general, the global warming effects and contamination problems. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Deactivation; Driving cycles; Exhaust emissions; Greenhouse gas; Nitrous oxide; Three-way catalytic converters","ammonia; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; nitrous oxide; ammonia; carbon dioxide; catalysis; economic analysis; emission control; exhaust emission; fossil fuel; global warming; greenhouse gas; metropolitan area; nitrous oxide; urban area; air pollution control; article; deceleration; environmental impact; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; traffic; urban area; velocity; Air Pollution; Cities; Greenhouse Effect; Mexico; Motor Vehicles; Nitrous Oxide; Palladium; Vehicle Emissions; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855764362

The impacts of climate change will be the most severe and immediate for billions of poor people, especially for those whose livelihoods are based on agriculture and subsistence activities and are directly dependent on weather patterns. Thus, equity and vulnerability considerations must be central to GHG emissions reduction strategies. A case study of a carbon abatement cost curve for an electricity system in two Nicaraguan rural villages is presented and is complemented with assessments based on the poverty metrics of the poverty headcount, the Gini coefficient, and the Kuznets ratios.

Emission concentration and car activity were simultaneously measured by a Portable Emissions Measurement System. Real life tests carried out at different times and on different days were performed with a turbo-diesel engine light vehicle equipped with an oxidizer catalyst and using different driving styles with a previously trained driver. The results show that by reducing the speed limit from 50 km h-1 to 30 km h-1, using a normal driving style, the time taken for a given trip does not increase, but fuel consumption and NOx, CO and PM emissions are clearly reduced. Therefore, the main conclusion of this work is that reducing the speed limit in some narrow streets in residential and commercial areas or in a city not only increases pedestrian safety, but also contributes to reducing the environmental impact of motor vehicles and reducing fuel consumption. In addition, there is also a reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the combustion of the fuel. © 2012 Global NEST Printed in Greece.

Decomposition is regulated by a set of interacting hierarchically organized factors. As spatial and temporal scales decrease, decomposition is largely dependent on the quality of resources and the decomposer community, but whether and how these factors manifest via historical legacy effects is not well understood. We tested whether the history of plant litter inputs had short-term legacy effects on contemporary litter and soil organic matter carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization. Using a field/laboratory microcosm approach, we exposed soils to two litters of contrasting chemistry and, after adding fresh substrates, we monitored C and N dynamics. In a parallel experiment, we manipulated the soil community to reduce litter-history impacts on its composition and size to investigate whether the soil community could be an important contributor to legacy effects We found strong short-term litter legacy effects on contemporary litter and soil N mineralization, the duration of which was dependent on the contemporary substrate for decomposition. These strong effects were not consistent with the home field advantage phenomenon, as exposure to a specific litter did not favor the decomposition of the same litter when it was applied as a contemporary substrate. Reduction of the litter-history effects on soil biota decreased the impact of litter history on N immobilization, suggesting that plant litter impacts on the soil community may be an important component of plant litter legacies on N decomposition. In contrast to N, litter legacies appeared to be much less important for C decomposition, suggesting that legacy effects might uncouple contemporary C and N dynamics. © 2012 Elsevier GmbH.","Coupled biogeochemical cycles; Decomposition; Ecological legacies; Home-field advantage; Microarthropods; Soil biota","arthropod; bioactivity; biogeochemical cycle; decomposition; litter; microcosm; mineralization; nutrient dynamics; soil biota; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; soil organic matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862018346

While industry is limited, over 70% of the territory is covered by forests, which can potentially be used to attract investment through forest-based projects that promote reductions in carbon emissions and sustainable management. These can be leveraged by producing accurate maps of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) at national level and by developing cost-effective mapping methods that allow reliable future updating for management and engagement in international mechanisms such as the United Nations (UN) Collaborative Program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) in developing countries.Using data from Japan's Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), this study compared a semi-empirical and machine learning algorithm, with the latter based on bagging stochastic gradient boosting (BagSGB), for retrieving the AGB of woody vegetation thereby supporting estimation of national carbon stocks. AGB was estimated by using measurements of tree size collected from112 forest plots during two field campaigns (2007 and 2008) as input to published allometric equations.The BagSGB outperformed the semi-empirical algorithm, resulting in a coefficient of correlation (R) between observed and cross-validation predicted forest AGB values of 0.95 and in a root mean square error (RMSE) of 26.62Mgha -1. Furthermore, the BagSGB model produced also a measure of forest AGB prediction variability (coefficient of variation) on a pixel-by-pixel basis, with values ranging from 7 to 250% (mean=42%). An estimate of total forest AGB carbon stock of 96.93Mt C was obtained in this study for Guinea-Bissau, with a mean forest AGB value of 65.17Mgha -1. Although the mean error associated with this forest AGB map is still undesirably high, several issues were addressed. The heterogeneity of forest structural types, presence of palm trees, and dimension and type of field plots were identified as potential source of uncertainty that must be tackled in future studies.

Slow Food and Cittaslow (Slow Cities) are allied Slow Movement networks operating in over 150 countries, including the United States (US). These two networks involve the interrelationship of numerous place-based factors important to social-ecological resilience: local and regional food markets, recovery and protection of biodiversity and local ecologies, support for cultural traditions, agricultural policy reform, climate adaptation planning, economic development, social inclusion, quality of life in the built environment, and the politics of land development.

The article then describes Sonoma Valley's Cittaslow Pollinator Stewardship Collaborative to show how the nascent organization has begun its work by facilitating the participation of environmental professionals in community life. In its first year, Cittaslow Sonoma Valley has used a combination of pleasure and responsibility to increase both the visibility of environmental concerns and the opportunities for diverse residents to act locally and globally on issues integrating environmental and economic support. Because it offers a different approach to environmental responsibility, the Slow Movement may be of particular interest to environmental professionals who are concerned about societal response to the complexity and uncertainty of global environmental change.

Due to difficulty to cope with this complexity, Decision Support Systems (DSSs) are essential tools to help Environmental Authorities to plan air quality policies that fulfill EU Directive 2008/50 requirements in a cost-efficient way. To implement these DSSs the common approach is to describe the air quality indices using linear models, derived through model reduction techniques starting from deterministic Chemical Transport Model simulations. This linear approach limits the applicability of these surrogate models, and while these may work properly at coarse spatial resolutions (continental/national), where average values over large areas are of interest, they often prove inadequate at sub national scales, where the impact of non linearities on air quality are usually higher.The objective of this work is to identify air quality models able to properly describe the relation between emissions and air quality indices, at a sub national scale. In this context, artificial neural networks, identified processing long-term simulation output of a 3D deterministic multi-phase modelling system, are used to describe the non-linear relations between the control variables (precursor emissions reduction) and a pollution index. These models can then be used with a reasonable computing effort to solve a multi-objective (air quality and emission reduction costs) optimization problem, that requires thousands of model runs and thus would be unfeasible using the original process-based model.

GHG emissions associated with adoption of reduced tillage, organic and integrated systems of field crop production across the UK and selected regions are compared with emissions from conventional arable farming to assess their potential for climate change mitigation. The reduced tillage system demonstrated a modest (<20%) reduction in emissions in all cases, although in practice it may not be suitable for all soils and it is likely to cause problems with control of diseases spread on crop debris. There were substantial increases in GHG emissions associated with the organic and integrated systems at national level, principally due to soil organic carbon losses from land use change. At a regional level the integrated system shows the potential to deliver significant emission reductions. These results indicate that the conventional crop production system, coupled to reduced tillage cultivation where appropriate, is generally the best for producing high yields to minimise greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to global food security, although there may be scope for use of the integrated system on a regional basis. The control of crop disease will continue to have an essential role in both maintaining productivity and decreasing GHG emissions. © 2012 KNPV.","Arable farming systems; Climate change mitigation; Crop disease control; Greenhouse gases; Soil fertility; Soil organic carbon","arable farming; climate change; comparative study; crop production; disease control; emission control; emission inventory; fertilizer application; food security; greenhouse gas; land use change; nutrient use efficiency; soil carbon; soil fertility; soil organic matter; tillage; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863393709

Although fire was the primary proximate cause of 1989-2008 deforestation (93%) and net carbonemissions (69%), by 2007-2008, oil palm directly caused 27% of total and 40% of peatland deforestation. Plantation land sources exhibited distinctive temporal dynamics, comprising 81% forests on mineral soils (1994-2001), shifting to 69% peatlands (2008-2011). Plantation leases reveal vast development potential. In 2008, leases spanned ∼65%of the region, including 62% on peatlands and 59% of community-managed lands, yet <10% of lease area was planted. Projecting business as usual (BAU), by 2020 ∼40% of regional and 35% of community lands are cleared for oil palm, generating 26% of net carbon emissions. Intact forest cover declines to 4%, and the proportion of emissions sourced from peatlands increases 38%. Prohibiting intact and logged forest and peatland conversion to oil palm reduces emissions only 4% below BAU, because of continued uncontrolled fire. Protecting logged forests achieves greater carbon emissions reductions (21%) than protecting intact forests alone (9%) and is critical for mitigating carbon emissions. Extensive allocated leases constrain land management options, requiring trade-offs among oil palm production, carbon emissions mitigation, and maintaining community landholdings.","Agribusiness; Elaeis guineensis; Greenhouse gas emissions; Moratorium; REDD+","carbon; article; commercial phenomena; community ecology; controlled study; deforestation; Elaeis; forest; greenhouse gas; Indonesia; land use; nonhuman; peatland; plantation; priority journal; Agriculture; Arecaceae; Borneo; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Geography; Plant Oils; Trees; Elaeis; Elaeis guineensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860807235

Although fuel treatments such as thinning and burning are known to immediately reduce forest carbon stocks, there are suggestions that these losses may be paid back over the long-term if treatments sufficiently reduce future wildfire severity, or prevent deforestation. Although fire severity and post-fire tree regeneration have been indicated as important influences on long-term carbon dynamics, it remains unclear how natural variability in these processes might affect the ability of fuel treatments to protect forest carbon resources. We surveyed a wildfire where fuel treatments were put in place before fire and estimated the short-term impact of treatment and wildfire on aboveground carbon stocks at our study site. We then used a common vegetation growth simulator in conjunction with sensitivity analysis techniques to assess how predicted timescales of carbon recovery after fire are sensitive to variation in rates of fire-related tree mortality, and post-fire tree regeneration.Results: We found that fuel reduction treatments were successful at ameliorating fire severity at our study site by removing an estimated 36% of aboveground biomass. Treated and untreated stands stored similar amounts of carbon three years after wildfire, but differences in fire severity were such that untreated stands maintained only 7% of aboveground carbon as live trees, versus 51% in treated stands. Over the long-term, our simulations suggest that treated stands in our study area will recover baseline carbon storage 10-35 years more quickly than untreated stands. Our sensitivity analysis found that rates of fire-related tree mortality strongly influence estimates of post-fire carbon recovery. Rates of regeneration were less influential on recovery timing, except when fire severity was high.Conclusions: Our ability to predict the response of forest carbon resources to anthropogenic and natural disturbances requires models that incorporate uncertainty in processes important to long-term forest carbon dynamics. To the extent that fuel treatments are able to ameliorate tree mortality rates or prevent deforestation resulting from wildfire, our results suggest that treatments may be a viable strategy to stabilize existing forest carbon stocks. © 2012 Carlson et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Forest carbon; Forest Vegetation Simulator; Fuel reduction treatment; Sensitivity analysis; Thinning; Tree mortality; Tree regeneration; Wildfire","aboveground biomass; biomass burning; deforestation; disturbance; fire behavior; forest fire; fuelwood; mortality; regeneration; sensitivity analysis; thinning; wildfire; California; Lake Tahoe Basin; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862774997

Glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) pose risks to exposed and vulnerable populations and can be linked in part to long-term post-Little Ice Age climate change because precariously dammed glacial lakes sometimes formed as glaciers generally retreated after the mid-1800s. This paper provides an interdisciplinary and historical analysis of 40 years of glacier hazard management on Mount Hualcán, at glacial Lake 513, and in the city of Carhuaz in Peru's Cordillera Blanca mountain range. The case study examines attempted hazard zoning, glacial lake evolution and monitoring, and emergency engineering projects to drain Lake 513. It also analyzes the 11 April 2010 Hualcán rock-ice avalanche that triggered a Lake 513 GLOF; we offer both a scientific assessment of the possible role of temperature on slope stability and a GIS spatial analysis of human impacts. Qualitative historical analysis of glacier hazard management since 1970 allows us to identify and explain why certain actions and policies to reduce risk were implemented or omitted. We extrapolate these case-specific variables to generate a broader socio-environmental framework identifying factors that can facilitate or impede disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. Facilitating factors are technical capacity, disaster events with visible hazards, institutional support, committed individuals, and international involvement. Impediments include divergent risk perceptions, imposed government policies, institutional instability, knowledge disparities, and invisible hazards. This framework emerges from an empirical analysis of a coupled social-ecological system and offers a holistic approach for integrating disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climate change adaptation; Empirical analysis; Engineering project; Glacial lake outburst flood; Glacial lakes; Hazard management; Historical analysis; Holistic approach; Human impact; Ice age; Institutional support; Mountain ranges; Mountain regions; Risk reductions; Social-ecological systems; Spatial analysis; Technical capacity; Hazards; Lakes; Risk perception; Slope stability; Societies and institutions; Climate change; anthropogenic effect; avalanche; climate variation; flooding; GIS; glacial lake; hazard management; holistic approach; interdisciplinary approach; Little Ice Age; local adaptation; mountain region; paleoclimate; risk perception; Ancash; Cordillera Blanca; Cordillera Occidental [Peru]; Peru",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860916502

Here, direct in situ measurements of BC absorption enhancements (Eabs) and mixing state are reported for two California regions. The observed Eabs is small - 6% on average at 532 nm - and increases weakly with photochemical aging. The Eabs is less than predicted from observationally constrained theoretical calculations, suggesting that many climate models may overestimate warming by BC.

Assessing patterns of carbon (C) partitioning (C flux as a fraction of GPP) between above- and belowground components is essential to understand mechanisms driving the C budget of these plantations. Better knowledge of fluxes and partitioning to woody and non-woody tissues in response to site characteristics and resource availability could provide opportunities to increase forest productivity. Our study aimed at investigating how C allocation varied within one apparently homogeneous 90ha stand of Eucalyptus grandis (W. Hill ex Maiden) in Southeastern Brazil. We assessed annual aboveground net primary production (ANPP: stem, leaf, and branch production) and total belowground C flux (TBCF: the sum of root production and respiration and mycorrhizal production and respiration), GPP (computed as the sum of ANPP, TBCF and estimated aboveground respiration) on 12 plots representing the gradient of productivity found within the stand. The spatial heterogeneity of topography and associated soil attributes across the stand likely explained this fertility gradient. Component fluxes of GPP and C partitioning were found to vary among plots. Stem NPP ranged from 554g C m -2 year-1 on the plot with lowest GPP to 923g C m -2 year-1 on the plot with highest GPP. Total belowground carbon flux ranged from 497 to 1235g C m-2 year-1 and showed no relationship with ANPP or GPP. Carbon partitioning to stem NPP increased from 0.19 to 0.23, showing a positive trend of increase with GPP (R2=0.29, P=0.07). Variations in stem wood production across the gradient of productivity observed at our experimental site were a result of the variability in C partitioning to different forest system components. © The Author 2011.

Five distinct seagrass beds were sampled for leaf nitrogen, leaf phosphorus, and rhizome carbohydrate content from 1997 to 1999. All variables displayed marked intra- and inter- regional variation. Elemental ratios (meanN:P±S.E.) were lowest for Charlotte Harbor (9.9±0.2) and highest for Florida Bay (53.5±0.9), indicating regional shifts in the nutrient content of plant material. Rhizome carbohydrate content (mean±S.E.) was lowest for Anclote Keys (21.8±1.6mgg -1 FM), and highest for Homosassa Bay (40.7±1.7mgg -1 FM). Within each region, significant negative correlations between plant nutrient and rhizome carbohydrate content were detected; thus, nutrient-replete plants displayed low carbohydrate content, while nutrient-deplete plants displayed high carbohydrate content. Spearman's rank correlations between nutrient and carbohydrate content varied from a minimum in Tampa Bay (ρ=-0.2) to a maximum in Charlotte Harbor (ρ=-0.73). Linear regressions on log-transformed data revealed similar trends. This consistent trend across five distinct regions suggests that nutrient supply may play an important role in the regulation of carbon storage within seagrasses.

Utility-scale renewable energy development (>1 MW capacity) is a key strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but development of those facilities also can have adverse effects on biodiversity. Here, we examine the synergy between renewable energy generation goals and those for biodiversity conservation in the 13 M ha Mojave Desert of the southwestern USA. We integrated spatial data on biodiversity conservation value, solar energy potential, and land surface slope angle (a key determinant of development feasibility) and found there to be sufficient area to meet renewable energy goals without developing on lands of relatively high conservation value. Indeed, we found nearly 200,000 ha of lower conservation value land below the most restrictive slope angle (<1%); that area could meet the state of California's current 33% renewable energy goal 1.8 times over. We found over 740,000 ha below the highest slope angle (<5%) - an area that can meet California's renewable energy goal seven times over. Our analysis also suggests that the supply of high quality habitat on private land may be insufficient to mitigate impacts from future solar projects, so enhancing public land management may need to be considered among the options to offset such impacts. Using the approach presented here, planners could reduce development impacts on areas of higher conservation value, and so reduce trade-offs between converting to a green energy economy and conserving biodiversity. © 2012 Cameron et al.",,"article; biodiversity; carbon footprint; climate change; conservation biology; desert; environmental impact; environmental management; habitat; renewable energy; solar energy; United States; Arizona; Biodiversity; California; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Desert Climate; Ecosystem; Geography; Greenhouse Effect; Nevada; Renewable Energy; Reproducibility of Results; Solar Energy; Utah",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862017665

However, it has not been assessed how local adaptation and phenotypic plasticity contribute to photoprotection mechanisms in response to contrasting climatic conditions in Mediterranean tree species.We analyzed photoprotection mechanisms in mature trees of the Mediterranean evergreen oak Quercus ilex at three sites with contrasting climatic conditions, i.e. xeric, continental and mesic sites. We studied morphological and physiological parameters indicative of photoprotection in adult trees in the field. In order to establish whether these parameters were genetically determined we compared adults with seedlings germinated from acorns of the three sites and grown under common greenhouse conditions.In the field we found no significant differences in most of the physiological parameters in summer, but in winter the adult trees from the continental site were photoinhibited. In contrast, there were significant differences between seedlings in most photoprotective parameters evaluated.

Urban energy and carbon models are emerging as a vital tool for local authorities that wish to understand the greenhouse gas emissions of their city and how to reduce them. The linkage between policy processes and tools is rarely recognized and tools are deployed ad hoc. A set of policy-relevant assessment criteria is proposed and used to review the emergent state-of-the-art in UK urban energy and carbon modelling. Drawing on the authors' own experience and the literature, a differentiation is made between accounting-style inventory tools and policy modelling tools. It is argued that although part of the same overall policy process, these two approaches lack consistency in methods and implementation. A comparison with local air pollution modelling makes this contrast apparent. A lack of clarity exists for the use of modelling in urban energy and carbon policy processes. A normalized urban modelling practice would ensure consistency while preserving local flexibility. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.","built environment; carbon reduction; cities; climate policy; energy; local authorities; modelling; research challenges","Built environment; Carbon reduction; cities; Climate policy; energy; Local authorities; Research challenges; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Models; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864033212

Through quantitatively reflecting interactive relationships among various renewable energy resources under climate change, not only the impacts of climate change on each individual renewable energy but also the combined effects on power-generation sector from renewable energy resources could be incorporated within a general modeling framework. Also, discrete probability levels associated with various climate change impacts on the REM system could be generated. Moreover, the ICEM could facilitate capacity-expansion planning for energy-production facilities within a multi-period and multi-option context in order to reduce energy-shortage risks under a number of climate change scenarios. The generated solutions can be used for examining various decision options that are associated with different probability levels when availabilities of renewable energy resources are affected by the changing climatic conditions. A series of probability levels of hydropower-, wind- and solar-energy availabilities can be integrated into the optimization process. The developed method has been applied to a case of long-term REM planning for three communities. The generated solutions can provide desired energy resource/service allocation and capacity-expansion plans with a minimized system cost, a maximized system reliability and a maximized energy security. Tradeoffs between system costs, renewable energy availabilities and energy-shortage risks can also be tackled with the consideration of climate change, which would have both positive and negative impacts on the system cost, energy supply and greenhouse-gas emission. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd..","Climate change; Decision making; Energy systems; Greenhouse-gas; Renewable energy","Climate change impact; Climate change scenarios; Climatic conditions; Combined effect; Energy model; Energy security; Energy supplies; Energy systems; Greenhouse-gas emissions; Interactive relationships; Modeling approach; Modeling frameworks; Multi-period; Optimization process; Probability levels; Renewable energies; System costs; System reliability; Costs; Decision making; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouses; Probability; Renewable energy resources; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859868429

It mainly introduced and analyzed low carbon development which was addressed as crucial initiative for implementation of LCS in China. A comparative analysis was carried out on concepts and experiences of LCS between China and developed countries. The trends and characteristics of CO2 emissions in China have also been analyzed. Because of large amount of CO2 emissions generated in the production process and relatively small amount of CO2 emissions in the consumption process, China is facing a severe challenge of imbalance in economic growth and CO2 emissions. If the consumption and production pattern of developed countries are duplicated, China is very likely to experience a development pattern of boosting economic growth and improving living standards significantly but meanwhile risking and suffering by large amount of resources consumption and CO2 emissions. Thus, a comprehensive, systematic and scientific scheme for implementing a low carbon society is urgently needed in China. Through literature research, mainstream perspectives of scholars with respect to development of LCS are concluded. In the meantime, CO2 emissions reduction target, carbon taxation and different debated issues are also presented. The achievements, China has made, consist of concrete actions taken by local governments, some new policies and regulations for carbon reduction at national level, in particular energy-saving and renewable energy policies proposed in the 11th Five-Year Plan (2005-2010). Carbon trading markets and carbon capture and starage technology have also made progress in China. There are still many limitations and barriers remaining and in need to be solved in the next steps.","China; Low carbon society; Practice; Research",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893008942

We offer a detailed picture-disaggregated by country-of the social changes necessary to reduce the rate and risk of climate change. We recognize two broad types of social change-changes that either reduce energy intensity or reduce carbon intensity. Through the Kaya identity, we demonstrate that the current business as usual scenario expects a carbon concentration of approximately 660 ppm by 2100, which corresponds to a potentially catastrophic 4.9°C temperature increase. Through a low-carbon-emissions scenario built on principles used by the Center for Energy and Environmental Policy over the past 20 years, we show the social changes required to realize a hopefully sustainable 450 ppm carbon dioxide concentration with an equitable 3.3 ton/capita annual carbon emissions budget. We conclude that all members of the international community-even Non-Annex 1 members-face major and immediate challenges in any common effort to address climate change. Our analysis supports exploratory efforts for the formulation of menus of social change.

In terms of combating desertification and restoration of ecosystems, two pilot-projects recently are aiming at the reforestation of Haloxylon ecosystems. Hereby, two of the internationally discussed climate change mitigation activities may be of higher relevance: (I) to sequester CO 2 through afforestation and reforestation and (II) to substitute fossil fuels by sustainable utilization of regenerative bio-fuels. With particular focus on Central Asian desert ecosystems, the questions arose: (I) to which extent Haloxylon species - the dominant shrub species - sequester CO 2, (II) what the recent carbon pool related to Haloxylon ecosystems is, and (III) in which magnitude the existing and/or reforested ecosystems could be utilized for bio-fuels sustainably. Therefore, this study aims at the derivation of allometric models including carbon contents for the two Haloxylon species in Central Asian desert ecosystems. A first application to measured transect data across Central Asia is carried out to reflect the recent biomass variability of the two study species. We found, that above- and below-ground biomass for both species is best modeled when taking growth height, basal area, and canopy area of shrubs into account (0.87&lt;r 2&lt;0.97 for the top-models). Regarding the transect data, Haloxylon aphyllum showed a significantly higher variability of measured and modeled variables as well as higher maximum and average biomass estimates when compared to Haloxylon persicum. As our study sites partly include regions with moderate to strong human impact, the observed biomass variability represents differing ecological conditions as well as anthropogenic effects, with the latter also being reflected in the observed shrub species compositions. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","Allometry; Carbon contents; Desert ecosystems; Haloxylon aphyllum; Haloxylon persicum","Allometry; Carbon content; Desert ecosystem; Haloxylon aphyllum; Haloxylon persicum; Carbon dioxide; Climatology; Ecosystems; Fossil fuels; Reforestation; Revegetation; Temperature measurement; Biomass; allometry; anthropogenic effect; biofuel; biomass; carbon dioxide; climate change; community composition; data set; desertification; environmental degradation; habitat restoration; numerical model; reforestation; restoration ecology; shrub; sustainability; vegetation structure; Central Asia; West Asia; Haloxylon; Haloxylon aphyllum; Haloxylon persicum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858954240

The papers all address in one way or another aspects of how federal-type systems are dealing with the collective action and multilevel governance issues of climate change policy. The comparative study of federal systems provides insight into how domestic authority is so often overlapping and divided when dealing with greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Federal arrangements offer a rich array of norms, institutions, and practices for tackling these problems. Federal systems grapple continuously with the kinds of issues that are the most intractable in the climate change case, such as overcoming interregional differences of interests and values. A common federal feature is competition among subnational governments and between them and national or federated governments over climate change policy, which has been especially significant in the United States and in Canada in the relative absence of national action--although soberingly, the whole is as yet nowhere near as great as the sum of the parts. More significant, but rarer is the achievement of tighter coordination in federal systems achieved through intergovernmental co-decision, as seen in the European Community and Australia. This has been accomplished in large part due to a consensus among all intergovernmental parties on the nature of the problem and congruence with the existing international regime, characteristics missing in the North American context. © 2012 by The Policy Studies Organization.","Australia; Canada; Climate change; Co-decision; Collective action; Comparative federalism; Competitive federalism; European Union (EU); Federalism; Intergovernmental relations; Multilevel governance; United States","climate change; collective action; comparative study; decision making; environmental policy; European Union; federal system; governance approach; intergovernmental relations; Australia; Canada; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860616679

The sudden brightening persisted as a plateau of Fe XIX intensity that endured more than 11 minutes. The Fe XIX emission at the rise and during the life of the plateau showed no evidence of significant bulk velocity flows, and hence cannot be attributed to chromospheric evaporation. However, the line width showed a significant broadening at the rise of the plateau, corresponding to nonthermal velocities of at least 89kms-1 due to reconnection outflows or turbulence. During the plateau He I, O V, and Si XII brightened at successively later times starting about 3.5 minutes after Fe XIX, which suggests that these brightenings were produced by thermal conduction from the plasma that produced the Fe XIX line emission; however, we cannot rule out the possibility that they were produced by a weak beam of nonthermal particles. We interpret an observed shortening of the O V wavelength for about 1.5 minutes toward the middle of the plateau to indicate new upward motions driven by the flare, as occurs during gentle chromospheric evaporation; relative to a quiescent interval shortly before the flare, the O V upward velocity was around -10kms-1. © 2012.

Chronology for Abernethy Forest was derived from radiocarbon dates of terrestrial plant macrofossils deposited in the lake sediments. Chronology for Loch Ashik was derived from tephra layers of known ages, the first age-depth model of this kind. Chironomid-inferred temperatures peak early in the Lateglacial Interstadial and then gradually decline by about 1 °C to the beginning of the Younger Dryas (YD). At Abernethy Forest, the Lateglacial Interstadial is punctuated by three centennial-scale cold oscillations which appear to be synchronous with the Greenland Interstadial events GI-1d, when temperatures at Abernethy fell by 5.9 °C, GI-1c, when temperatures fell by 2.3 °C, and GI-1b, when temperatures fell by 2.8 °C. At Loch Ashik only the oscillation correlated with GI-1d is clearly defined, when temperatures fell by 3.8 °C. The start of the YD is clearly marked at both sites when temperatures fell by 5.5 °C at Abernethy Forest and 2.8 °C at Loch Ashik. A warming trend is apparent during the late-YD at Abernethy Forest but at Loch Ashik late-YD temperatures became very cold, possibly influenced by its close proximity to the Skye ice-field. The rapidly rising temperatures at the YD - Holocene transition occur about 300 years earlier at both sites than changes in sediment lithology and loss-on-ignition. The temperature trends at both sites are broadly similar, although between-site differences may result from the influence of local factors. Similar climate trends are found at other sites in the northern British Isles. However, the British summer temperature records differ in detail from trends in the oxygen-isotope records from the Greenland ice-cores and from other chironomid-inferred temperature records available from Scandinavia, north-west Europe and central Europe, which suggest important differences in the influence of climatic forcing at regional scales. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Chironomid-inferred temperatures; Climate change; Lake sediments; Tephra age-depth model; Tephra chronology","Air temperature; British Isles; Central Europe; Climate trends; Close proximity; Greenland; High resolution; Holocenes; Inference models; Lake sediments; Lateglacial; Loss-on-ignition; Macrofossils; Radiocarbon dates; Regional scale; Rising temperatures; Scandinavia; Scotland; Summer temperature; Temperature trends; Tephra chronology; Tephra layers; Terrestrial plants; Younger Dryas; Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Forestry; Glacial geology; Isotopes; Lakes; Sedimentology; Sediments; air temperature; climate variation; Holocene; ice core; insect; lacustrine deposit; late glacial; paleotemperature; radiocarbon dating; temperature effect; tephrochronology; Climates; Forestry; Isotopes; Lakes; Mathematical Models; Scotland; Sediments; Temperature; Scandinavia; Scotland; United Kingdom; Chironomidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859635342

We applied general additive models to study the impact of temperature, humidity, and wind, as well as long-wave and short-wave radiant heat fluxes as summarised by the recently developed Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) on the choice of clothing insulation by fitting LOESS smoothers to observations from 944 males and 710 females aged from 13 to 91 years. We further analysed votes of thermal sensation compared to predictions of UTCI. The results showed that females chose less insulating clothing in warm conditions compared to males and that observed values of clothing insulation depended on temperature, but also on season and potentially on solar radiation. The overall pattern of clothing choice was well reflected by UTCI, which also provided for good predictions of thermal sensation votes depending on the meteorological conditions. Analysing subgroups indicated that the goodness-of-fit of the UTCI was independent of gender and age, and with only limited influence of season and body composition as assessed by body mass index. This suggests that UTCI can serve as a suitable planning tool for urban thermal comfort in sub-tropical regions. © 2011 ISB.","Clothing; Model; Outdoor climate; Survey; Thermal comfort; Urban planning","adolescent; adult; aged; article; biological model; body mass; Brazil; climate; clothing; female; human; male; meteorological phenomena; middle aged; temperature sense; thermoregulation; urban population; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Mass Index; Body Temperature Regulation; Brazil; Climate; Clothing; Female; Humans; Male; Meteorological Concepts; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Thermosensing; Urban Population; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860372030

To study this relationship we present a spatially explicit approach based on the assumption that the distribution of water within the landscape is an essential component of local environmental conditions. Here, we analyze the relation of wetness and human landuse patterns from the Upper Paleolithic (UP) and Epipaleolithic (EP) of Western Syria. In particular the spatially explicit character of the approach enables the detection of a significant change in landuse patterns during the UP and EP accompanied by a significant shift in the wetness characteristics of the preferentially used areas. These results are discussed against the background of published data on climatic conditions in order to identify both a possible time frame and triggers for this change in landuse. While we conclude an increased influence of natural conditions on the spatial behavior for the UP, we suggest an additional influence of cultural circumstances in shaping EP spatial behavior. For the region studied we argue that the bounded pattern observed during the UP changes to a spatially flexible pattern during the Late Natufian. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Human landuse; Paleolithic; PAW; Spatial analysis; TWI","detection method; historical geography; land use; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; Paleolithic; resource use; spatial analysis; water availability; Syrian Arab Republic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860886401

Biopower, which comprised about 1% of electricity generation in 2008, may reduce greenhouse gas emissions, provide energy security, and promote economic development. A large range of feedstocks can be used, from woody and herbaceous biomass to agricultural residues. Each feedstock has technical and economic advantages and challenges compared to fossil fuels. Unlike wind or solar energy, a biopower plant is considered to be a baseload power source because some biomass feedstocks can be used for continuous power production. However, ensuring a sustainable supply of biomass feedstocks is a major challenge. Although there are multiple biopower technologies, few of them except combustion have been deployed at commercial scale nationwide. Federal policymakers are supporting biopower through feedstock supply analysis and biopower technology assessments. However, there is limited comprehensive data about the type and amount of biomass feedstock available to meet U.S. biopower needs at a national level. If the use of dedicated biomass feedstocks to generate biopower were to develop into a sizeable industry, concerns would likely include the effect of the industry on land use (i.e., how much land would it take to grow the crops needed to fuel or co-fuel power plants) and the effect on the broader economy, including farm income and food prices. To date, these have not been issues: most existing biomass feedstocks have been waste products generated by the forest products industry or by farms, or municipal solid waste for which combustion served as both a disposal method and a source of energy. Growing crops for use as a power source would be different from using waste. Under generally accepted assumptions regarding crop yields and energy content, approximately 31 million acres- roughly the amount of land in farms in Iowa-would be needed to supply enough biomass feedstock to satisfy 6% of total 2008 U.S. electricity retail sales. When added to the amount of land needed to meet the requirements of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), a federally mandated transportation fuel requirement, the potential impacts could be significant: the RFS already consumes 35% of the nation's corn crop, and its requirements will triple between 2010 and 2022 (although much of this fuel will come from feedstocks other than corn). Beyond land use and economic impacts, others are concerned that the use of biomass feedstocks to generate biopower, particularly through combustion, could add to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission levels and exacerbate climate change concerns. They fear that certain areas may be unsustainably harvested to meet biomass feedstock demand, or that less biomass may be left for other purposes (e.g., wood and paper products). The concerns exist partly because biomass used for biopower does not face the same constraints as biomass used for liquid transportation fuels under the RFS. In addition, the idea that biomass combustion is carbon-neutral is under scrutiny. The Environmental Protection Agency has not exempted biomass combustion emissions from the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V Greenhouse Gas Tailoring Rule, although it announced plans to defer for three years GHG permitting requirements for carbon dioxide emissions from biomass-fired and other biogenic sources (those produced by living organisms). In the PSD and Title V Permitting Guidance for Greenhouse Gases issued in 2010, EPA noted that biomass could be considered a best available control technology (BACT)-a pollution control standard mandated by the Clean Air Act. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Eighty-three percent of this expansion occurred in the Amazon and this trend is expected to continue as the industry bounces back from a recent agricultural downturn. Intensification of the cattle industry has been suggested as one way to reduce pressure on forest margins and spare land for soybean or sugarcane production, and is the cornerstone of Brazil's plan for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. To this end, federal credit programs and research and development activities in Brazil are aligning to support intensification goals, but there is no guarantee that this push for intensification will decrease the demand for land at the forest margin and as result curb CO 2 emissions from deforestation. In this paper we use a spatially explicit rent model which incorporates the local effects of biophysical characteristics, infrastructure, land prices, and distance to markets and slaughterhouses to calculate 30-year Net Present Values (NPVs) of extensive cattle ranching across the Brazilian Amazon. We use the model to ask where extensive ranching is profitable and how land acquisition affects profitability. We estimate that between 17% and 80% of land in the Amazon would have moderate to high NPVs when ranched extensively if it were settled, i.e. if the rancher does not buy the land but acquires it through land grabbing. In addition, we estimate that between 9% and 13% of land in the Amazon is vulnerable to speculation (i.e. areas with positive NPVs only if land is settled and not purchased), which suggests that land speculation is an important driver of extensive ranching profitability, and may continue to be in the future. These results suggest that pro-intensification policies such as credit provision for improved pasture management and investment in more intensive production systems must be accompanied by implementation and enforcement of policies that alter the incentives to clear forest for pasture, discourage land speculation, and increase accountability for land management practices if intensification of the cattle sector is to deter new deforestation and displace production from low-yield, extensive cattle production systems in frontier regions of the Brazilian Amazon. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Cattle intensification; Deforestation; Environmental responsibility; Land speculation; Spatial rent model","cattle; credit provision; demand analysis; intensive agriculture; land management; landownership; livestock farming; pastoralism; policy implementation; profitability; ranching; trend analysis; Amazonia; Brazil; Bos; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84855279704

A potential intervention for mitigating stream temperature rise is the use of wooded riparian zones to increase shade and reduce direct warming through solar radiation. To assess the effectiveness of this intervention, we conducted a systematic review of the available evidence for the effects of wooded riparian zones on stream temperature. Methods: We searched literature databases and conducted relevant web searches. Inclusion criteria were: subject - any stream in a temperate climate; intervention - presence of trees in the riparian zone; comparator - absence of trees in the riparian zone; outcome measure - stream temperature. Included studies were sorted into 3 groups based on the scale of the intervention and design of the study. Two groups were taken forward for synthesis; Group 1 studies comparing water temperature in streams with and without buffer strips/riparian cover and Group 2 comparisons of stream temperatures in open and forested landscapes. Temperature data were extracted and quantitative synthesis performed using a random effects meta-analysis on the differences in mean and maximum temperature. Results: Ten studies were included in each of Groups 1 and 2. Results for both groups suggest that riparian wooded zones lower spring and summer stream temperatures. Lowering of maximum is greater than lowering of mean temperature. Further analysis of environmental variables that might modify the effects of the intervention was not possible using the limited set of studies. Conclusions: Wooded riparian zones can reduce stream temperatures, particularly in terms of maximum temperatures. Because temperature is known to affect fish, amphibian and invertebrate life history, the reported effect sizes are likely to have a biological significance for the stream biotic community. Consequently investment in creation of wooded riparian zones might provide benefits in terms of mitigating some of the ecological effects of climate change on water temperature. Considerable uncertainty lies in the environmental variables that may modify the cooling effect of wooded riparian zones, and therefore it is not possible to identify when the use of this intervention for cooling would be most valuable. © 2012 Bowler et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Climate change; Fish; Riparian buffer; Stream temperature; Systematic review",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84869026732

It will have greatest, and generally earliest, impact on the poorest and most disadvantaged populations on the planet. Changes in climatic conditions and increases in weather variability affect human wellbeing, safety, health and survival in many ways. Some impacts are direct-acting and immediate, such as impaired food yields and storm surges. Other health effects are less immediate and typically occur via more complex causal pathways that involve a range of underlying social conditions and sectors such as water and sanitation, agriculture and urban planning. Climate change adaptation is receiving much attention given the inevitability of climate change and its effects, particularly in developing contexts, where the effects of climate change will be experienced most strongly and the response mechanisms are weakest. Financial support towards adaptation activities from various actors including the World Bank, the European Union and the United Nations is increasing substantially. With this new global impetus and funding for adaptation action come challenges such as the importance of developing adaptation activities on a sound understanding of baseline community needs and vulnerabilities, and how these may alter with changes in climate. The global health community is paying heed to the strengthening focus on adaptation, albeit in a slow and unstructured manner. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of adaptation and its relevance to global health, and highlight the opportunities to improve health and reduce health inequities via the new and additional funding that is available for climate change adaptation activities. © 2012 Bowen and Friel; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Adaptation; Adaptation funding; Climate change; Equity; Global health; Social determinants; Sustainable development","water; adaptive management; anthropogenic effect; climate change; financial provision; food production; global perspective; health care; health impact; health services; nature-society relations; safety; sanitation; storm surge; sustainable development; adaptation; climate change; disaster; environmental factor; financial management; food security; health; health care policy; health care quality; priority journal; review; social status; environmental protection; health disparity; human; Adaptation, Physiological; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Health Policy; Health Status Disparities; Humans; World Health",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861380971

In Lao PDR, despite the implementation problems, it is still seen as a lever for securing land tenure, rationalizing extension services provision, and more recently, for implementing 'Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation' (REDD) schemes. Impact assessments of past LUP have revealed weaknesses of local institutions in the effective implementation of land policies. In order to avoid the blind trust placed in delusive LUP success stories, methods for monitoring community participation and understanding of LUP activities have been developed in order to assess the quality of the process. Expanding on this perspective, this article proposes a method to assess the quality of LUP outputs and to visualize the gap between planning objectives and their actual achievements. This method, based on a refined analysis of past and present land zoning practices in Lao PDR, gives full prominence to the complexity of landscape mosaics and the way local populations actually use the land. Furthermore, this approach, developed and tested under real planning conditions, can also be seen as a safeguard and support for inexperienced implementers in their land-use planning practices, as a diagnostic instrument for quality assessment, i.e. level of accuracy of a land-use plan, and may finally pave the way toward becoming a tool for land-use planning certification. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Land-use planning; Lao PDR; Participatory landscape simulations; Sustainable land management","complexity; deforestation; degradation; land management; land tenure; land use planning; landscape; sustainable development; Laos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82055202893

The phenomenon has taken different forms and character as compared to processes that occur in other regions of the world, especially Africa. It puts into question some of the assumptions in the emerging literature on land grabbing, suggesting these are too food-centered/too food crisis-centered, too land-centred, too centred on new global food regime players - China, South Korea, Gulf States and India - and too centred on Africa. There are four key mechanisms through which land grabbing in Latin American and the Caribbean has been carried out: food security initiatives, energy/fuel security ventures, other climate change mitigation strategies, and recent demands for resources from newer hubs of global capital. The hallmark of land grabbing in the region is its intra-regional character: the key investors are (Trans-)Latin American companies, often in alliance with international capital and the central state. Initial evidence suggests that recent land investments have consolidated the earlier trend away from (re)distributive land policies in most countries in the region, and are likely to result in widespread reconcentration of land and capital. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","dispossession; food-feed-fuel complex; intra-regional land grabbing","capitalism; food security; investment; landownership; peasant agriculture; rural policy; Africa; Caribbean Islands; China; India; Latin America; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861865383

Most of these emitters are electrical power generation and mining companies and heavy industry manufacturers. To compensate households for projected rising costs, due to the increased taxing pricing caused by this Carbon Tax, the government will cut income tax for smaller industries, boost payments to pensioners and offer various lump sum payments to small companies.

Increases in productivity achieved in the past are attributed in part to the significant use of fossil fuels. Energy use in agriculture is therefore also expected to rise in the future, further contributing to greenhouse emissions. At the same time, more than two-fifths of the world's population still depends on unsustainably harvested wood energy for cooking and heating. Both types of energy use have detrimental impacts on the climate and natural resources. Continuing on this path is not an option as it will put additional pressure on the already stressed natural resource base and local livelihoods, while climate change is further reducing the resilience of agro-ecosystems and smallholder farmers. Ecosystem approaches that combine both food and energy production, such as agroforestry or integrated crop-livestock-biogas systems, could substantially mitigate these risks while providing both food and energy to rural and urban populations. Information and understanding on how to change course through the implementation of the practices outlined in this paper are urgently needed. Yet the scientific basis of such integrated systems, which is essential to inform decision-makers and to secure policy support, is still relatively scarce. The author therefore argues that new assessment methodologies based on a systems-oriented analysis are needed for analyzing these complex, multidisciplinary and large-scale phenomena. © 2012 Bogdanski.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Adaptation; Agro-ecology; Agroforestry; Biogas; Climate-smart agriculture; Ecosystem services; Energy access; Food security; Integrated food-energy systems; Landscape approach; Mitigation; Multi-purpose farming systems; Systems thinking approach; Upscaling",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006410575

Therefore to investigate the structural and photosynthetic responses to changes in solar UV-B we conducted a 5-year UV-B exclusion study in high arctic Greenland. During the growing season, the gas exchange (H 2O and CO 2) and chlorophyll-a fluorescence were measured in Vaccinium uliginosum. The leaf dry weight, carbon, nitrogen, stable carbon isotope ratio, chlorophyll and carotenoid content were determined from a late season harvest. The net photosynthesis per leaf area was on average 22% higher in 61% reduced UV-B treatment across the season, but per ground area photosynthesis was unchanged. The leaf level increase in photosynthesis was accompanied by increased leaf nitrogen, higher stomatal conductance and F v/F m. There was no change in total leaf biomass, but reduction in total leaf area caused a pronounced reduction of specific leaf area and leaf area index in reduced UV-B. This demonstrates the structural changes to counterbalance the reduced plant carbon uptake seen per leaf area in ambient UV-B as the resulting plant carbon uptake per ground area was not affected. Thus, our understanding of long-term responses to UV-B reduction must take into account both leaf level processes as well as structural changes to understand the apparent robustness of plant carbon uptake per ground area. In this perspective, V. uliginosum seems able to adjust plant carbon uptake to the present amount of solar UV-B radiation in the High Arctic. © 2011 Physiologia Plantarum.",,"carbon; carotenoid; chlorophyll; nitrogen; Arctic; article; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; radiation exposure; ultraviolet radiation; Vaccinium; Arctic Regions; Carbon; Carotenoids; Chlorophyll; Nitrogen; Photosynthesis; Ultraviolet Rays; Vaccinium; Vaccinium; Vaccinium uliginosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863766690

A key issue in this context is the optimal breakdown of reduction targets among different world regions or even countries. Using the European Commission-funded PLANETS project, cost-optimal global burden sharing to reach global GHG reduction targets was analysed, and an optimal allocation of GHG reductions was identified, relative to the global target, to the commitments of different world regions and the trade possibilities for emission certificates. Specifically, it is evaluated how Europe can contribute in a cost-optimal way to keeping the global concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere below 530 parts per million equivalent (ppme) or below a stricter global reduction target of 500 ppme. Based on the energy system model TIMES PanEU, the potentials for emissions reduction in the different energy sectors and EU Member States and the role of key technologies are analysed. The most cost-effective potentials for GHG reductions in Europe are in the conversion/production, residential and industrial sectors. Substantial reductions in the transport sector occur only under very stringent reduction targets. Achieving ambitious reduction targets requires considerable contributions from all EU Member States until 2050. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","climate policy scenarios; energy system modelling; EU burden sharing; EU emissions reduction","carbon emission; climate change; environmental policy; European Union; greenhouse gas; modeling; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861172482

These ecosystems have not been extensively explored in the Tyrrhenian sector of the Italian peninsula, particularly in the Submediterranean climatic region. In order to address this issue and to define the synecology, syndynamics and syntaxonomy of calcareous grasslands in this area, we considered 127 phytosociological relevés. Our sampling was performed in the Lazio region according to a stratified sampling scheme based on homogeneous land units, defined by means of an ecological land classification process. We analyzed the vegetation data using multivariate methods. Two new associations, whose typical aspects occur in the mesotemperate phytoclimatic belt, were identified:Erysimo pseudorhaetici-Dasypyretum villosi (Taenianthero-Aegilopion) and Scorpiuro muricati-Brometum erecti (Phleo-Bromion). Phytoclimatic belts within the Submediterranean region cause a significant degree of differentiation within Scorpiuro-Brometum, which was described at the subassociation and variant levels. The overall relevance of therophytes represents the most important feature distinguishing Scorpiuro-Brometum from the published Bromus erectus associations. At a finer scale, the presence of the two physiognomically different grassland communities is related to different soil types. All these communities are dynamically linked to Quercus virgiliana and Q. pubescens woods, and contribute to the coenological differentiation of the vegetation series related to such woodlands. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","Ecological land classification; Festuco-Brometea; Lazio region; phytosociology; Stellarietea","Bromus; Bromus erectus; Quercus virgiliana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863494458

Polymorphisms in CBR1 and CBR3 influence synthesis of these metabolites. We examined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms in CBR1 (CBR1 1096G&gt;A) and/or CBR3 (CBR3 V244M) modified the dose-dependent risk of anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy in childhood cancer survivors. Patients and Methods: One hundred seventy survivors with cardiomyopathy (patient cases) were compared with 317 survivors with no cardiomyopathy (controls; matched on cancer diagnosis, year of diagnosis, length of follow-up, and race/ethnicity) using conditional logistic regression techniques. Results: A dose-dependent association was observed between cumulative anthracycline exposure and cardiomyopathy risk (0 mg/m 2: reference; 1 to 100 mg/m 2: odds ratio [OR], 1.65; 101 to 150 mg/m 2: OR, 3.85; 151 to 200 mg/m 2: OR, 3.69; 201 to 250 mg/m 2: OR, 7.23; 251 to 300 mg/m 2: OR, 23.47; &gt; 300 mg/m 2: OR, 27.59; P trend &lt; .001). Among individuals carrying the variant A allele (CBR1:GA/AA and/or CBR3:GA/AA), exposure to low- to moderate-dose anthracyclines (1 to 250 mg/m 2) did not increase the risk of cardiomyopathy. Among individuals with CBR3 V244M homozygous G genotypes (CBR3:GG), exposure to low- to moderate-dose anthracyclines increased cardiomyopathy risk when compared with individuals with CBR3:GA/AA genotypes unexposed to anthracyclines (OR, 5.48; P = .003), as well as exposed to low- to moderate-dose anthracyclines (OR, 3.30; P = .006). High-dose anthracyclines (&gt; 250 mg/m 2) were associated with increased cardiomyopathy risk, irrespective of CBR genotype status. Conclusion: This study demonstrates increased anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy risk at doses as low as 101 to 150 mg/m 2. Homozygosis for G allele in CBR3 contributes to increased cardiomyopathy risk associated with low- to moderate-dose anthracyclines, such that there seems to be no safe dose for patients homozygous for the CBR3 V244M G allele. These results suggest a need for targeted intervention for those at increased risk of cardiomyopathy. © 2011 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,"anthracycline; carbonyl reductase; daunorubicin; doxorubicin; epirubicin; idarubicin; alcohol dehydrogenase; anthracycline; antineoplastic antibiotic; CBR1 protein, human; CBR3 protein, human; acute granulocytic leukemia; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adolescent; adult; allele; article; bone tumor; cancer diagnosis; cancer survivor; cardiomyopathy; case control study; child; childhood cancer; controlled study; drug megadose; female; follow up; gene; genetic polymorphism; genotype; Hodgkin disease; human; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; nonhodgkin lymphoma; priority journal; race; risk; school child; single nucleotide polymorphism; soft tissue sarcoma; age; biotransformation; cardiomyopathy; chemically induced disorder; chi square distribution; clinical trial; dose response; enzymology; genetic predisposition; genetics; homozygote; infant; metabolism; multicenter study; neoplasm; newborn; pharmacogenetics; phenotype; preschool child; risk assessment; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; statistical model; survivor; time; United States; Adolescent; Age Factors; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Anthracyclines; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Biotransformation; Cardiomyopathies; Case-Control Studies; Chi-Square Distribution; Child; Child, Preschool; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Homozygote; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Logistic Models; Male; Neoplasms; Odds Ratio; Pharmacogenetics; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Survivors; Time Factors; United States; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-81855225220

The approach apportions combined gas-phase and condensed-phase concentrations of individual compounds as well as PM2.5 mass. Because the NEI is used to provide source emission profiles for CMB analysis, the method generates information on the consistency of the NEI with ambient monitoring data. The method also tracks secondary species to primary source emissions, permitting a more complete accounting of the impact of aggregated source types on PM 2.5 mass concentrations. An example application is presented using four years of monitoring data collected at eight sites in the Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization (SEARCH) network. Including both primary and secondary species, area sources contributed 2.0-3.7 μg m-3 (13-26%), point sources contributed 3.0-4.6 μg m-3 (22-33%), and mobile sources contributed 1.0-6.0 μg m-3 (9-42%) to mean PM 2.5 mass concentrations.

This is an important concern for current society, as the deterioration of biodiversity will have dire implications for agriculture and the provision of food. At the same time, we see many conventional agricultural practices (i.e. deforestation and monoculture) serve to exert their own stresses on biodiversity, while also compounding the issue of climate change. In this context, an increasing number of scientific research projects are being funded to further understand the complex interrelations between climate and biodiversity, and support society's collective decision-making on this issue. Faced with the complexity and uncertainty inherent to climate change, this paper begins from an assertion that interdisciplinary science, bringing together scientists working within the fields of biodiversity, climate and agriculture, is key to generate socially-relevant knowledge, and presents thus one component of society's response to this issue. On this basis, the paper introduces the idea of 'reflexive interdisciplinarity' as one way for better nesting science in society. Nesting science in society is a long-term, dialogic, reflexive and evolving process. Hence, the results presented here only represent the first steps of this process, that was initiated in 2010 through participatory action research within the interdisciplinary 'HUMBOLDT' project; funded by the French 'Scientific Consortium for Climate, Environment and Society', and exploring the relationship between climate change and biodiversity in the Alps. In the HUMBOLDT project, reflexive interdisciplinarity was given expression through 'reflexive tools'. In presenting its findings, the paper argues that attitudes of reflexivity were important in helping scientists to conceptualise their place in a wider scientific community, and in turn, how this community is nested in society. By recognising the normative and political nature of their research, reflexive interdisciplinarity improved scientists' ability to engage in the negotiations that constitute the science-policy interface for climate change. © 2012 Wageningen Academic Publishers.

In England and Wales, housing contributes significantly to the emissions and many properties are at risk of flooding. This paper investigates the preparedness of homeowners in England and Wales to make changes to their homes in response to the predicted effects of climate change. A telephone survey of 961 homeowners investigated their interest in purchasing mitigation and adaptation improvements against their concern about climate change, awareness of flood risk and attribution of responsibility for action. Whilst the majority of homes had some energy-saving improvements, few were found to have property-level flood protection. The high levels of awareness about climate change and flooding were coupled with the perception of risks as low. Whilst some respondents accepted personal responsibility for action, most believed that the authorities were responsible for flood protection, and would not pay the costs required to make their home more energy-efficient and better prepared for the eventuality of floods. The results suggest that there is scope for further improvement of energy-saving measures, and that the levels of adoption of flood-protection measures are very low. Multi-faceted strategies, including more effective communication of risks and responsibilities, incentives, and material support for the poorest, will need to be developed to overcome the current reluctance by homeowners to invest in flood-protection measures and further energy conservation solutions in the future. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climate change impact; Effective communication; Energy efficient; Energy-saving measures; England; Flood protection; Flood risks; Personal responsibility; Telephone survey; Energy conservation; Flood control; Floods; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Risk perception; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; flooding; greenhouse gas; homeowner; local adaptation; mitigation; England; United Kingdom; Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860917862

Although discharging of manure nutrients or other contaminants may have a long-term effect, i.e. water eutrophication phenomena, airborne emissions have an immediate negative effect on health and welfare both of animals and workers in the livestock area, exposed to high concentration of VOCs (NH3, CH4, H2S, NOx, etc.), dust, and a variety of bioaerosol (bacteria, viruses, endotoxin, parasites, fungi, mycotoxin etc.). Any proximity of livestock facilities to residential area enhances the problem, involving a great number of people. Major pig and poultry producing areas can be found in the north of Italy, as well as in several other regions in Europe (i.e. Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, some areas in France, Germany, and Spain). In order to evaluate properly those airborne emissions, field air sampling and analytical methods should be chosen carefully as they play a fundamental role. In addition, the quantification of the odour-causing compounds is useful for the development and assessment of odour and VOCs mitigation technologies, aimed at the enhancement of the environmental sustainability of livestock production systems. First, the paper describes the development of air analytical methods; then, some approaches for emission abatement are presented.","Air analyses; Emission abatement; Livestock; Odour emission","Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Suidae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866362756

This financial incentives-based climate change mitigation strategy proposed by the UNEP, World Bank, GEF and environmental NGOs seeks to integrate forests into carbon sequestration schemes. Its proponents view REDD+ as part of an adaptive strategy to counter the effects of global climate change. This paper combines the theoretical approaches of market environmentalism and environmental narratives to examine the politics of environmental knowledge that are redefining socio-nature relations in the Rufiji Delta, Tanzania to make mangrove forests amenable to markets. Through a case study of a ""REDD-readiness"" climate change mitigation and adaptation project, we demonstrate how a shift in resource control and management from local to global actors builds upon narratives of environmental change (forest loss) that have little factual basis in environmental histories. We argue that the proponents of REDD+ (Tanzanian state, aid donors, environmental NGOs) underestimate the agency of forest-reliant communities who have played a major role in the making of the delta landscape and who will certainly resist the injustices they are facing as a result of this shift from community-based resource management to fortress conservation. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon forestry; Environmental history; Environmental justice; Global climate change; REDD+","adaptation; carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation management; environmental justice; environmental management; forest ecosystem; forest management; forestry; landscape; mangrove; nongovernmental organization; resource management; Pwani; Rufiji Delta; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860231218

Numerous studies have used only climate variables to predict future potential species range shifts and have omitted environmental factors important for determining species distribution. Here, we assessed the importance of the edaphic dimension in the niche-space definition of Quercus pubescens and in future spatial projections under global change over the metropolitan French forest territory. We fitted two species distribution models (SDM) based on presence/absence data (111 013 plots), one calibrated from climate variables only (mean temperature of January and climatic water balance of July) and the other one from both climate and edaphic (soil pH inferred from plants) variables. Future predictions were conducted under two climate scenarios (PCM B2 and HadCM3 A2) and based on 100 simulations using a cellular automaton that accounted for seed dispersal distance, landscape barriers preventing migration and unsuitable land cover. Adding the edaphic dimension to the climate-only SDM substantially improved the niche-space definition of Q. pubescens, highlighting an increase in species tolerance in confronting climate constraints as the soil pH increased. Future predictions over the 21st century showed that disregarding the edaphic dimension in SDM led to an overestimation of the potential distribution area, an underestimation of the spatial fragmentation of this area, and prevented the identification of local refugia, leading to an underestimation of the northward shift capacity of Q. pubescens and its persistence in its current distribution area. Spatial discrepancies between climate-only and climate-plus-edaphic models are strengthened when seed dispersal and forest fragmentation are accounted for in predicting a future species distribution area. These discrepancies highlight some imprecision in spatial predictions of potential distribution area of species under climate change scenarios and possibly wrong conclusions for conservation and management perspectives when climate-only models are used. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bio-indication; Cellular automaton; Downy oak; Generalized additive model (GAM); Migration; simRShift; Soil pH; Spatial fragmentation; Species refugia","bioindicator; cellular automaton; climate change; climate modeling; ecological modeling; environmental factor; global change; niche partitioning; prediction; spatial distribution; species diversity; tree; Quercus pubescens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863625721

To evaluate the possible acute health effects of air pollution due to the emissions of a cement plant in two small municipalities in Italy (Mazzano and Rezzato), a case-control study design was used. The risks of hospital admission for cardiovascular or respiratory diseases for increasing levels of exposure to cement plant emissions were estimated, separately for adults (age > 34. years) and children (0-14. years). Odds ratios (OR) were estimated using unconditional regression models. Attributable risks were also calculated.Statistically significant risks were found mainly for respiratory diseases among children: OR 1.67 (95% CI 1.08-2.58) for the moderately exposed category (E1), OR 1.88 (95% CI 1.19-2.97) for the highly exposed category (E2), with an attributable risk of 38% of hospital admissions due to the exposure to cement plant exhausts. Adults had a weaker risk: OR 1.38 (95% CI 1.18-1.61) for group E1, OR 1.31 (95% CI 1.10-1.56) for group E2; the attributable risk was 23%. Risks were higher for females and for the age group 35-64.

HCPs have become a vital means of protecting endangered and threatened species and their habitats throughout the United States, particularly on private land. The scientific consensus that climate is changing and that these changes will impact the viability of species has not been incorporated into the conservation strategies of recent HCPs, rendering plans vulnerable biologically. In this paper we review the regulatory context for incorporating climate change into HCPs and analyze the extent to which climate change is linked to management actions in a subset of large HCPs. We conclude that most current plans do not incorporate climate change into conservation actions, and so we provide recommendations for integrating climate change into the process of HCP development and implementation. These recommendations are distilled from the published literature as well as the practice of conservation planning and are structured to the specific needs of HCP development and implementation. We offer nine recommendations for integrating climate change into the HCP process: (1) identify species at-risk from climate change, (2) explore new strategies for reserve design, (3) increase emphasis on corridors, linkages, and connectivity, (4) develop anticipatory adaptation measures, (5) manage for diversity, (6) consider assisted migration, (7) include climate change in scenarios of water management, (8) develop future-oriented management actions, and (9) increase linkages between the conservation strategy and adaptive management/ monitoring programs. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.","Adaptation strategy; Biological conservation; Climate change; Conservation planning; Ecosystem management; Endangered species act; Habitat conservation plans; Reserve design","Aquatic ecosystems; Conservation; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Water management; Adaptation strategies; Biological conservation; Conservation planning; Ecosystem management; Endangered Species Act; Habitat conservation; Reserve design; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; conservation planning; ecosystem management; endangered species; Endangered Species Act; habitat conservation; integrated approach; private land; adaptation; aquatic environment; aquatic species; Article; climate change; environmental management; habitat; law; migration; nonhuman; species distribution; United States; water management; article; ecosystem; endangered species; environmental protection; government regulation; legal aspect; United States; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Endangered Species; Government Regulation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866776077

GPS and visualisation tools can be used to monitor grazing animal movements at the farm scale and observe interactions with the environment. Modelling the spatial-temporal movements of grazing animals in response to environmental conditions provides input for the design of paddocks with the aim of improving management procedures, animal performance and animal welfare. The term ""biological shepherding"" is associated with the re-design of environmental conditions and the analysis of responses from grazing animals. The combination of biological shepherding with geo-visual analytics (geo-spatial data analysis with visualisation) provides a framework for improving landscape design and supports research in grazing behaviour in variable landscapes, heat stress avoidance behaviour during summer months, and modelling excreta distributions (with respect to nitrogen emissions and nitrogen return for fertilising the paddock). Nitrogen losses due to excreta are mainly in the form of gaseous emissions to the atmosphere and leaching into the groundwater. In this study, background and context are provided in the case of biological shepherding and tracking animal movements. Examples are provided of recent applications in regional Australia and New Zealand. Based on experimental data and computer simulation, and using data visualisation and feature extraction, it was demonstrated that livestock excreta are not always randomly located, but concentrated around localised gathering points, sometimes separated by the nature of the excretion. Farmers require information on the nitrogen losses in order to reduce emissions to meet local and international nitrogen leaching and greenhouse gas targets and to improve the efficiency of nutrient management.","agent-oriented modelling; biological shepherding; Geo-visual analytics; nitrogen emissions; spatial analysis",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048921588

Further, peak oil and energy security are only partially integrated into either climate or water policy discourse. In effect, despite some far-sighted words about the meaning of climate change, uncertainty is largely met with a 'business as usual' mantra. Farmer narratives are used to demonstrate their systemic and increasing vulnerability and likelihood of perverse outcomes. The Future Farming strategy and Our Water Our Future are briefly analyzed, as are potential implications of the rhetoric of newly elected conservative government. Using ideas from Bourdieu and Bhabha we suggest that the reliance on farmers being able to innovate and take up opportunities associated with the uncertainty of large scale changes in climate and energy availability are misguided. It is more likely that current policy directions entrench the values of the global market and its elite, leaving farmers locked-in to historical structural responses that will not be successful in the long-term and will diminish their ability to imagine radical and diverse ways of avoiding the maladaptive structures currently surrounding their production systems. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Climate change; Innovation; Maladaptation; Peak oil; Policy analysis; Water","adaptation; climate change; climate effect; emission control; environmental policy; flooding; food production; food security; global change; innovation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860256756

The interactions of existing aerosols and meteorology with the transformation mechanism have also been investigated. The specific objective was to discern the kinetics for the gas-to-particle conversion processes where the reactions of NH3 with H2SO4, HNO3, and HCl take place to form (NH4)2SO4, NH4NO3, and NH4Cl, respectively, in PM2.5. Materials and methods: A Teflon-based outdoor environmental chamber facility (volume of 12.5 m3) with state-of-the-art instrumentation to monitor the concentration-time profiles of precursor gases, ozone, and aerosol and meteorological parameters was built to simulate photochemical reactions. Results and discussion: The reaction rate constants of NH3 with H2SO4, HNO3, and HCl (i. e., kS, kN, and kCl) were estimated as (1) kS = 2.68 × 10-4 (±1.38 × 10-4) m3/μmol/s, (2) kN = 1.59 × 10-4 (±8. 97 × 10-5) m3/μmol/s, and (3) kCl = 5.16 × 10-5 (±3.50 × 10-5) m3/μmol/s. The rate constants kS and kN showed significant day-night variations, whereas kCl did not show any significant variation. The D/N (i. e., daytime/nighttime values) ratio was 1.3 for kS and 0.33 for kN. The significant role of temperature, solar radiation, and O3 concentration in the formation of (NH4)2SO4 was recognized from the correlation analysis of kS with these factors. The negative correlations of temperature with kN and kCl indicate that the reactions for the formation of NH4NO3 and NH4Cl seem to be reversible under higher temperature due to their semivolatile nature. It was observed that the rate constants (kS, kN, and kCl) showed a positive correlation with the initial PM2.5 levels in the chamber, suggesting that the existing surface of the aerosol could play a significant role in the formation of (NH4)2SO4, NH4NO3, and NH4Cl. Conclusions: Therefore, this study recommends an intelligent control of primary aerosols and precursor gases (NOx, SO2, and NH3) for achieving reduction in PM2.5 levels. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Acid gases; Ammonia; Existing particle surface; Gas-to-particle conversion; Rate constants; Secondary aerosols","ozone; quaternary ammonium derivative; aerosol; ammonia; chloride; concentration (composition); high temperature; inorganic acid; meteorology; nitrate; ozone; reaction kinetics; solar radiation; sulfate; transformation; aerosol; air pollutant; article; chemistry; gas; humidity; particle size; particulate matter; sunlight; surface property; temperature; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Gases; Humidity; Ozone; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Sunlight; Surface Properties; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860516029

In this article, the viability of trigeneration system in Mashad city, the main tourist destination in Iran, has been studied. For this aim, two scenarios have been proposed to meet thermal energy demand which is about 80 MW th at peak time. In the first scenario, the plan is developed on the basis of heat recovery opportunity from hot exhaust gases of two gas turbines installed near Mashad town center, and in the second scenario, an onside CHCP plant with optimum capacity is considered. Then, some performance criteria are investigated to assess the effectiveness of projected scenarios. Finally, both options are analyzed from technical and financial point of view. Finally, although CO 2 abatement is approximately 311,500 ton per year for the first scenario, and four times lower for the second one, the latter presents better economic features (internal rate of return: 14.27% versus 12.93%). Accordingly, the onside CHCP proposal is recommended to be installed. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This was undertaken separately in Great Britain and London, for all of the major roads, and by road type and location. The emissions trends were created using different emissions factors, those used in UK emissions inventories (Base case), the Swiss-German handbook (HBEFA), and those created from recent remote sensing measurements in the UK (RSD). An alternative assumption for use of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) in the articulated Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) fleet was also tested. For all scenarios traffic flows, speeds and vehicle age were kept constant. Comparison between the emissions scenarios in Great Britain showed that by 2009, NOx emissions estimates from road traffic could be as much as 25% greater than current UK estimates and 31% greater in London. The RSD emissions inventory gave the smallest downward trend in NOx emissions, from 2004 to 2009, of between 3 and 4%/year and this compared with a reduction of ∼6%/year from the Base Case and HBEFA scenarios. All scenarios compared poorly with roadside NOx measurement trends from UK sites, which typically reduce by between 1% and 2%/year. We have shown that the differences in NOx emissions trends were driven, partially at least, by the relative contribution from light duty diesel vehicles. An analysis from 2700 NOx measurement sites throughout Europe has shown that this problem is unlikely to be limited to the UK, and identifies a difficulty in meeting EU limit values for NO2, obligations under the National Emission Ceilings Directive (NECD, 2001) and the Gothenburg Protocol (UNECE, 1999) and for forecasting future changes in PM2.5. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Emissions inventory; Emissions trends; NO2; NOx; Remote sensing","Diesel vehicles; Emissions factors; Emissions inventory; Emissions scenarios; Great Britain; Heavy goods vehicles; Light-duty; Limit values; Measurement trends; Relative contribution; Road traffic; Traffic flow; Vehicle age; Remote sensing; Roadsides; Selective catalytic reduction; Nitrogen oxides; nitric oxide; nitrogen oxide; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; emission control; emission inventory; environmental legislation; European Union; forecasting method; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; remote sensing; road transport; roadside environment; traffic congestion; traffic emission; trend analysis; air quality; article; diesel engine; Europe; human; measurement; nitrous oxide emission; priority journal; remote sensing; rural area; traffic; uncertainty; United Kingdom; urban area; velocity; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860541881

Field trapping studies were performed to determine the blends ability to attract adult NOW. The blend comprised racemic 1-octen-3-ol, ethyl benzoate, methyl salicylate, acetophenone, and racemic (E)-conophthorin. Ethyl acetate was used as a solvent with a blend component concentration of 100 mg/mL. The blend attracted both sexes of NOW when tested in five 2-week intervals spanning the first three flights of NOW in commercial almond orchards in the southern Central Valley of California. The blend demonstrated consistently higher capture rates for female NOW throughout the evaluation period, but unlike almond meal it significantly attracted males. Reported is a survey of the major and minor volatiles emitted from almonds at hull split, the key period of vulnerability to NOW infestation. Also reported is the attractancy of a formulated test blend based on the host plant volatile emissions, electroantennographic screening experiments, and field trapping studies.

However, renewable energy technologies cannot be considered totally clean because they require energy consumption and have environmental impacts that cannot be neglected during their life cycle. In this paper, the life cycle assessment methodology was applied to assess resource use and other environmental burdens related to the entire life-cycle steps of a solar cooling plant. The investigated system works with an absorption chiller assisted by a solar plant. Two back-up configurations (hot back-up and cold back-up) were examined in two localities: Palermo (southern Italy) and Zurich (Switzerland).The benefits in terms of primary energy savings and greenhouse gases emission reduction were demonstrated by comparing the use of this innovative plant in substitution of a conventional one. Energy and CO 2eq emission payback times and the energy return ratio of the system were calculated. For all the analysed configurations they ranged from 4 to 6years. A sensitivity analysis related to the calculation of the energy payback time was carried out to assess the influence of various system performance parameters on the payback index. The analysis stressed the following:. -LCA of renewable energy technologies has to include a detailed analysis of the use phase to assess the benefits that arise from the energy produced by the system during its useful life and to obtain reliable and high-quality LCA results.-The use phase is responsible of about 70-90% of the energetic and environmental impacts of the plant life cycle.-The innovative plant has a lower environmental impact than the conventional plant.-The advantages of renewable energy technologies strongly depend on the climate of the installation site. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Absorption chiller; Emission payback time; Energy payback time; Life cycle assessment; Primary energy; Solar heating and cooling system","Absorption chillers; Energy pay back time; Life cycle assessment; Primary energies; Solar heating and cooling system; Absorption cooling; Climate change; Cooling systems; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Innovation; Refrigerators; Solar heating; Technology; Thermoelectric equipment; Life cycle; absorption; ammonia; assessment method; carbon emission; climate change; cooling; emission control; energy conservation; environmental impact; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; heating; life cycle analysis; renewable resource; Italy; Switzerland; Zurich [Switzerland]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859445606

Relying on climate alone may limit a model's success when additional variables contribute to invasion. While a climate-based model may predict the future spread of an invasive plant, we hypothesized that a model that combined climate with human influences would most successfully explain its present distribution. We used the ecological niche model MaxEnt to test our hypothesis with Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), a common invasive horticultural plant in the United States. We first predicted the future range expansion of the species in the United States using a model that was trained on the climate conditions in its native range. We then tested the ability of a climate-based model, which was trained on climate conditions in the invaded range, to predict the current distribution in the United States. Finally, we tested whether including a measure of human influence would improve this model. Our results indicate that, despite L. japonica's 200-year invasion history, it is expected to spread beyond its current US range. Climate and human influence combined explain the current distribution. Modeling the spread of invasive horticultural plants using climate alone risks under-predicting areas with poor climates and high human influence. Therefore, planting invasive horticultural species should be discouraged as even suboptimal climates may result in further range expansion. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Ecological niche model; Horticultural industry; Human footprint; Invasive species; Lonicera japonica; Range expansion","anthropogenic effect; biological invasion; climate effect; horticulture; hypothesis testing; invasive species; range expansion; vine; United States; Lonicera japonica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865755335

However, because commercially viable biofuels are currently produced primarily from agricultural feedstocks, higher production volumes increase pressure on land resources. Thus, large-scale biofuels production has important implications for the forest and agriculture sectors, land use, trade, and net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Competition for land is expected to continue growing in the future as mandated biofuels volumes increase along with rising demand for food, feed, and fiber, both domestically and internationally. In response to heightened concern regarding impacts such as indirect land-use change and higher food prices, the U.S. policy is focusing on second-generation (cellulosic) feedstocks to contribute the majority of the mandated increase in biofuels volume through 2022. However, there has been little work exploring the logistics of supplying these feedstocks or examining feedstock mix and net GHG effects of combining renewable fuels mandates with climate policy. In this paper, we apply the recently updated Forest and Agricultural Sector Optimization Model with GHGs (FASOMGHG) to explore the implications of alternative assumptions regarding feedstock storage costs and carbon price for renewable energy production mix, land use, and net GHG emissions. The model is used to quantify the magnitude and regional distribution of changes in the optimal mix of bioenergy feedstocks when accounting for storage costs. In addition, we find that combining the biofuels volume mandate with a carbon price policy has additional implications for feedstock mix and provides a substantially larger net reduction in GHG than a renewable fuels mandate alone. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Agriculture; bioenergy; biomass storage; FASOMGHG; forests; GHG mitigation; transportation costs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84889564683

The climate factors considered in this research were annual precipitation (PRECIP), annual evapotranspiration (ET), land surface temperature (LST), annual minimum air temperature (T min), annual maximum air temperature (T max) and solar radiation (SOLRAD). The ground factors considered were elevation, aspect, groundwater, and topsoil depth. A standard multiple regression model detected and eliminated SOLRAD and (T max) as the independent variables causing the multi-collinearity in the regression models for grasslands and croplands. The spatial autocorrelation of errors in the regression models was detected using the semi-variogram modeling of regression residuals. This required the use of the global spatial regression model (GSRM) based on the maximum likelihood model of spatial errors. GSRM determined for grasslands that PRECIP, ET, and LST were the most significant factors controlling NDVI. In the case of croplands, PRECIP, ET, and T min were observed to be the strongest controlling factors, and LST was not significant. Geographically weighted regression (GWR) determined the ranges of variable regression coefficients predicting NDVI of grasslands and croplands on the local level along the corridor of pipelines. Although no strong correlation was observed between elevation and NDVI, the largest vegetation distribution was identified in the areas with an elevation higher than 150 m. The percentage of high NDVI spatial coverage within the aspect categories was decreasing in the southern directions of slope faces. The threshold of groundwater depth controlling NDVI of grasslands was 1-12 m in the areas lower than 100 m in elevation. Topsoil depth was determined as one of the main ground factors having direct control of NDVI of grassland and croplands. Precipitation was also identified as one of the main factors controlling formation of topsoil depth. The results of GSRM and GWR were validated using low- and high-resolution remotely sensed data. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.","Geographically weighted regression; NDVI; Spatial regression","Air temperature; Annual maxima; Annual precipitation; Caucasus; Climate factors; Controlling factors; Direct control; Geographically weighted regression; High resolution; Independent variables; Land surface temperature; Multiple regression model; NDVI; Oil-and-Gas pipelines; Regression coefficient; Regression model; Regression residuals; Remotely sensed data; Right of way; Semivariograms; Slope faces; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatial coverage; Spatial errors; Spatial regression; Spatial regression model; Strong correlation; Vegetation cover; Vegetation distribution; Vegetation index; Atmospheric temperature; Errors; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Remote sensing; Revegetation; Soil conservation; Sun; Vegetation; Water supply; Regression analysis; agricultural land; air temperature; autocorrelation; climate effect; elevation; environmental factor; error analysis; evapotranspiration; gas pipeline; grassland; maximum likelihood analysis; model validation; NDVI; oil pipeline; precipitation (climatology); regression analysis; regrowth; remote sensing; revegetation; slope angle; soil depth; solar radiation; surface temperature; topsoil; variogram; vegetation cover; water depth; Adana [Turkey]; Azerbaijan; Baku; Caucasus; Ceyhan; Georgia (republic); Tbilisi; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864079106

As scenario-based approaches result in a wide range of outcomes, the role of probabilistic-based estimates of climate change impacts for policy formulation has been increasingly advocated by researchers and policy makers. This study evaluates the impact of climate change on seasonal river flows by propagating daily climate time series, derived from probabilistic-based climate scenarios using a weather generator (WGEN), through a set of conceptual hydrological models. Probabilistic scenarios are generated using two different techniques. The first technique used probabilistic climate scenarios developed from statistically downscaled scenarios for Ireland, hereafter called SDprob. The second technique used output from 17 global climate models (GCMs), all of which participated in CMIP3, to generate change factors (hereafter called CF). Outputs from both the SDprob and the CF approach were then used in combination with WGEN to generate daily climate scenarios for use in the hydrological models. The range of simulated flow derived with the CF method is in general larger than those estimated with the SDprob method in winter and vice versa because of the strong seasonality in the precipitation signal for the 17 GCMs. Despite this, the simulated probability density function of seasonal mean streamflow estimated with both methods is similar. This indicates the usefulness of the SDprob or probabilistic approach derived from regional scenarios compared with the CF method that relies on sampling a diversity of response from the GCMs. Irrespective of technique used, the probability density functions of seasonal mean flow produced for four selected basins is wide indicating considerable modelling uncertainties. Such a finding has important implications for developing adaptation strategies at the catchment level in Ireland. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE); Hydrological models; Probabilistic climate change scenario; Weather generators","Adaptation strategies; Climate change impact; Climate change scenarios; Climate scenarios; Global climate model; Hydrological models; Hydrological response; Ireland; Policy formulation; Policy makers; Probabilistic approaches; Probabilistic estimates; River flow; Seasonal mean; Seasonality; Uncertainty estimation; Weather generator; Catchments; Climate change; Estimation; Probability density function; Runoff; Uncertainty analysis; catchment; climate change; climate modeling; hydrological response; policy making; probability; river flow; seasonal variation; stochasticity; time series; Ireland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863867472

The analysis emphasizes competition between conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, including hybrids, and electric vehicles (EVs), represented by both plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles. We find that EV market penetration could double relative to our baseline case with policies to extend consumers' effective payback period to 7 years. EVs can also reduce per vehicle petroleum consumption by up to 5% with opportunities to increase that fraction at higher adoption rates. However, EVs have limited ability to reduce LDV greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the current energy source mix. Alone, EVs cannot drive compliance with the most aggressive GHG emission reduction targets, even if the electricity grid shifts towards natural gas powered sources. Since ICEs will dominate the LDV fleet for up to 40 years, conventional vehicle efficiency improvements have the greatest potential for reductions in LDV GHG emissions and petroleum consumption over this time. Specifically, achieving fleet average efficiencies of 72. mpg or greater can reduce average GHG emissions by 70% and average petroleum consumption by 81%. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Electric vehicle; Greenhouse gas; Oil consumption","Battery electric vehicles; Current energy; Electricity grids; GHG emission; Light duty vehicles; Market penetration; Oil consumption; Parametric analysis; Payback periods; Petroleum consumption; Plug-in hybrids; Primary energy source; Supply-demand; Vehicle efficiency; Electric lighting; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Fleet operations; Greenhouse gases; Internal combustion engines; Investments; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; carbon emission; competition (economics); electric vehicle; electricity; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; technology adoption; trade-off; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861225751

However, perception and acceptance towards climate change is a significant barrier to voluntary adoption of best practice techniques. A number of countries have set targets for reducing emissions, of which Scotland has one of the most ambitious agendas. This paper presents results from an extensive survey of 540 dairy farmers, conducted in 2009, with the aim of understanding attitudes, values and intentions towards climate change. Only half of these farmers agreed that temperatures would rise in the future and this could significantly hinder adoption of voluntary measures to meet emissions targets. To explore this further a typology was developed on the responses to attitude and value statements, using principal components and cluster analysis methods. Six distinct types were found to exist which had a range of outlooks towards the impact of climate change in the future. However, five of the six types stated no intention to adopt practices which would reduce emissions. The typology approach supports diversified engagement strategies and a more innovation-led or resource maximisation view towards farming was expressed by several of these types. This may indicate that policy makers should focus on 'win-win' technologies as a means to effectively engage with these. However, a number of types were disengaged from the process which was driven by uncertainties towards projections for global warming and this needs to be addressed by both scientists and policy makers to ensure greater participation within the farming community. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Dairy farming; Farmer perception; Policy makers; Principal Components; Scotland; Value statements; Win-win; Cluster analysis; Decision making; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Agriculture; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; cluster analysis; dairy farming; emission control; global warming; greenhouse gas; local participation; perception; policy making; principal component analysis; public attitude; typology; voluntary approach; Scotland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859218654

While the need to understand how climate change will impact on society is valid, the challenge for many vulnerable communities, especially some of the most marginalised, such as remote indigenous communities of north-west South Australia, need to be couched in the context of both immediate risks to livelihoods and long-term challenges of sustainable development. An integrated review of climate change vulnerability for the Alinytjara Wilurara Natural Resources Management region, with a focus on the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands, suggests that targeted analysis of climate change impacts and adaptation options can overlook broader needs both for people and the environment. Climate change will add to a range of complex challenges for indigenous communities, especially in relation to hazards, such as fire and floods, and local environmental management issues, especially in association with invasive species. To respond to future socio-ecological risk, some targeted responses will need to focus on climate change impacts, but there also needs to be a better understanding of what risk is already apparent within socio-ecosystems and how climate interacts with such systems. Other environmental, social and economic risks may need to be prioritised, or at least strongly integrated into climate change vulnerability assessments. As the capacity to learn how to adapt to risk is developed, the value attributed to traditional ecological knowledge and local indigenous natural resource management must increase, both to provide opportunities for strong local engagement with the adaptation response and to provide broader social development opportunities. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Anangu pitjantjatjara yankunytjatjara lands; Climate change; Indigenous; Natural resource management; South australia; Vulnerability","adaptive management; climate change; community care; environmental issue; environmental management; indigenous population; natural resource; physiological response; policy making; risk factor; social development; sustainable development; vulnerability; Australia; South Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865764328

This recent US trend, of signing environmental treaties but failing to ratify them, could thwart attempts to come to a future climate agreement. Two complementary explanations of this trend are proposed. First, the political system of the US has distinct institutional features that make it difficult for presidents to predict whether the Senate will give its advice and consent to multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) and whether Congress will pass the required enabling legislation. Second, elected for a fixed term, US presidents might benefit politically from supporting MEAs even when knowing that legislative support is not forthcoming. Four policy implications are explored, concerning the scope for unilateral presidential action, the potential for bipartisan congressional support, the effectiveness of a treaty without the US, and the prospects for a deep, new climate treaty. Policy relevance Why does the failure of US ratification of multilateral environmental treaties occur? This article analyses the domestic political mechanisms involved in cases of failed US ratification. US non-participation in global environmental institutions often has serious ramifications. For example, it sharply limited Kyoto's effectiveness and seriously hampered international climate negotiations for years. Although at COP 17 in Durban the parties agreed to negotiate a new agreement by 2015, a new global climate treaty may well trigger a situation resembling the one President Clinton faced in 1997 when he signed Kyoto but never obtained support for it in the Senate.

This reactivity is quantified by the Maximum Incremental Reactivity, MIR. However, if comparing different fuels or engine conditions, weighing the emissions generated with their respective MIR is necessary. This weighed parameter is the specific reactivity, SR. The sampling procedure varies from author to author, since it is not normalized. In this paper, exhaust samples were pumped directly through the 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine cartridges, without any air dilution ratio. A diesel engine Nissan Euro 5 M1D-Bk, equipped with intercooler, diesel oxidation catalyst and diesel particle filter was used. Four operating modes were chosen from the New European Driving Cycle, two from the urban subcycle and two from the extra-urban one. Samples were collected at three different points along the exhaust pipe, to study the effect of two post-treatment systems. A pure diesel fuel, as reference, and two blends, one with a 10% v/v of bioethanol and another with a 16% v/v of butanol, were used during experiments. For the analysis, a High Performance Liquid Chromatograph, with a C-18 column and ultraviolet-visible detector, was used. Results showed that the emissions of the blends tested were higher than the diesel ones. Besides, in all fuels, urban mode (U10) was the mode with highest emissions. The reduction of emissions due to the post-treatment systems was detected in all fuels too. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Passive damping concepts were first validated on carbon fibre reinforced epoxy composite plates and then implemented in a 1:5 model of an open rotor blade manufactured by resin transfer moulding (RTM).

In all four cores, the measured Pb concentration (up to 460mgkg-1) lies significantly above the natural background (27-40mgkg-1), although a significant decrease (down to 75mgkg-1) was observed during the second half of the 20th century which can be explained by the reduction of lead emissions. The 206Pb/207Pb ratio measured in these samples indicates that the main source of Pb used in the Paris conurbation is characterized by a ""Rio Tinto"" signature (defined as 206Pb/207Pb=1.1634±0.0001). A high contribution, up to 25%, from the leaded gasoline (characterized by 206Pb/207Pb=1.08±0.02) is revealed in the Seine River downstream Paris, indicating that lead from the leaded gasoline is preferentially released to the river. The dominating Pb signature in the Paris conurbation that is currently sampled through incinerators fumes (206Pb/207Pb=1.1550±0.0005) and waste water treatment plant (206Pb/207Pb=1.154±0.002), represents a mixture of highly recycled lead from the Rio Tinto mine and lead from leaded gasoline (imprinted by the low 206Pb/207Pb of the Broken Hill mine). This signature is called ""urban"" rather than ""industrial"", because it is clearly distinct from the Pb that is found in areas contaminated by heavy industry, i.e. the heavy industries located on the Oise River which used lead from European ores characterized by high 206Pb/207Pb ratios (∼1.18-1.19) and possibly a minor amount of North American lead (206Pb/207Pb ratios&gt;1.20). The ""urban"" signature is also found in a rural area upstream of Paris in the 1970's. At the Seine River mouth in 2003, Pb with an urban signature represents 70% of the total Pb sediment content, with the 30% remaining corresponding to natural Pb. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Industrial lead; Isotope; Metals; Pollution; Rio Tinto; Urban lead","Fume control; Gasoline; Isotopes; Lead removal (water treatment); Metals; Pollution; Rivers; Waste treatment; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Historical perspective; Industrial leads; Isotopic composition; Lead concentration; Lead contamination; Natural backgrounds; Rio Tinto; Urban leads; River pollution; gasoline; lead; concentration (composition); emission; fluvial deposit; incineration; isotopic composition; lead; pollution effect; sediment core; sediment pollution; twentieth century; urban pollution; article; concentration (parameters); France; fume; geochemical analysis; geochemistry; mining; river; river basin; urban area; waste water treatment plant; water contamination; France; Oise River; Seine Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858753858

When the N 2-H 2O flow gas was used, α-Li 5AlO 4 showed a water vapor sorption because of two different processes: superficial hydration and hydroxylation. However, if CO 2 was used as the water vapor carrier gas, the α-Li 5AlO 4 carbonation process was observed at low temperatures (30-80 °C), although this reaction is only produced at high temperatures (200-700 °C) under dry conditions. In this case, the carbonation process was induced by the lithium ceramic superficial hydroxylation. The results clearly showed that α-Li 5AlO 4 is capable of chemisorbing up to 8.4 mmol of CO 2/g of ceramic, a considerably high capture at low temperatures compared to different materials. Finally, a kinetic analysis indicated that the CO 2 chemisorption in α-Li 5AlO 4 is highly favored in the presence of water vapor. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbonation process; Carrier gas; Dry condition; High temperature; Kinetic analysis; Lithium ceramics; Low temperatures; Presence of water; Water sorption; Water vapor sorption; Ceramic materials; Chemisorption; Hydroxylation; Lithium; Solid state reactions; Vapors; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862059666

Like many other developing countries, Indonesia has experienced a dramatic increase in the number of passenger cars. The number of passenger cars has increased from 1,170,103 in 1987 to 9,859,926 in 2008 and expected to reach 38,869,926 in the year 2030. This increase in the number of cars will have an impact on fuel consumption and emission production. Therefore, fuel economy standards for passenger car have been suggested as a proper solution to reduce fuel consumption and emissions such as CO2, HC, NOx and CO. The first part of this paper presents an overview of the current fuel economy standards and test methods around the world besides ASEAN region to highlight the importance of this energy saving measure. The second part of this study attempts to estimate the amount of fuel saving and emission reductions in the Indonesian transportation sector by implementing fuel economy standards for passenger cars. The calculations were made based on the government, manufacturer and ownership data of passenger cars. The study found that fuel economy standards for passenger cars would save money, fuel and most importantly mitigate a significant amount of emissions to protect the environment. It has been found that, a total amount of 32 billion litres, IDR 190,640 billion (USD 19 billion), 1,457,918 ton CO2, 32,587,345 kg HC, 27,021,296 kg NOx and 69,122,843 kg CO could be saved between 2015 and 2023 due to implementation of fuel economy standards. As a conclusion, the author would like to emphasise the importance of adopting this policy in a highly populated and developing country such as Indonesia which will help it to save fuel and mitigate emissions. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Parameters such as changing waste generation quantities, diversion rates and waste composition were also considered. Two scenarios were assessed in this study on how to treat the waste that remains after diversion. The first scenario is the status quo, where the entire residual waste was landfilled whereas in the second scenario approximately 50% of the residual waste was incinerated while the remainder is landfilled. Electricity was produced in each scenario. Data from the City of Toronto was used to undertake this study. Results showed that the waste diversion initiatives were more effective in reducing the organic portion of the waste, in turn, reducing the net electricity production of the landfill while increasing the net electricity production of the incinerator. Therefore, the scenario that incorporated incineration performed better environmentally and contributed overall to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions because of the displacement of power plant emissions; however, at a noticeably higher cost. Although landfilling proves to be the better financial option, it is for the shorter term. The landfill option would require the need of a replacement landfill much sooner.

The flux of organic matter into the sediment is rather low; therefore, other researchers have introduced plants for a continuous supply of organic matter to the anode electrode. Until now only interconnected materials have been considered as anode materials in S-MFCs. Here, granular carbon materials were investigated for their suitability as an anode material in S-MFCs. Materials and methods: Laboratory microcosms with eight different electrode materials (granules, felts and cloths) were examined with controlled organic matter addition under brackish conditions. Current density, organic matter removal and microbial community composition were monitored using 16S rRNA gene PCR followed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The main parameters investigated were the influence of the amount of electrode material applied to the sediment, the size of the granular material and the electrode configuration. Results and discussion: Felt material had an overall superior performance in terms of current density per amount of applied electrode material; felt and granular anode obtained similar current densities (approx. 50-60 mA m-2), but felt materials required 29 % less material to be applied. Yet, when growing plants, granular carbon is more suited because it is considered to restore, upon disturbance, the electrical connectivity within the anode compartment. Small granules (0. 25-0. 5 mm) gave the highest current density compared to larger granules (1-5 mm) of the same material. Granules with a rough surface had a better performance compared to smooth granules of the same size. The different granular materials lead to a selection of distinct microbial communities for each material, as shown by DGGE. Conclusions: Granular carbon is suitable as an anode material for S-MFCs. This opens the possibility for application of S-MFCs in cultivated areas. In a wider context, the application of granular carbon electrodes can also be an option for in situ bioremediation of contaminated soils. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.","16S rRNA gene; Bio-energy; Electron transfer; In situ bioremediation; Wetlands","bioenergy; bioremediation; brackish water; carbon; electrochemical method; electrode; electrokinesis; fuel cell; gene; granular medium; microbial activity; microbial community; microcosm; organic matter; RNA; soil pollution; wetland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864078261

A considerably higher bacterial contribution to total microbial plankton community respiration (CR) has been observed in oligotrophic systems compared to more productive systems. Classical BR estimation procedures, typically oxygen consumption measurements, comprise pre-incubation filtration to separate bacteria from the rest of the plankton community and long incubation times (24 h). The resulting disruption of the community linkages over long time periods might affect BR measurements, especially in oligotrophic systems characterized by tightly coupled microbial food webs. In this study, BR data were compiled from 2 con - trasting environments: the highly productive Ría de Vigo (NW Spain) and the North Atlantic oligotrophic gyre. Standard procedures or in vivo electron transport system (ETS) activity (non prefiltered and short-time incubation) procedures were used to obtain a total of 209 BR estimations. Bacterial contribution to plankton CR was significantly higher in oligotrophic than in highly productive conditions (155% and 42%, respectively) when using standard procedures, while similar values were observed (31% and 30%) with in vivo ETS procedures. The relation between plankton CR and BR along the studied productivity gradient suggests that bacterial contribution to total CR varies less than previously assumed with an average value approximating 30% through different trophic situations. © 2012 Inter-Research.","Bacterial respiration; Oligotrophic plankton communities; Pre-filtration","bacterium; carbon flux; estimation method; filtration; food web; gyre; marine ecosystem; microbial community; oligotrophic environment; oxygen consumption; plankton; respiration; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Galicia [Spain]; Pontevedra [Galicia]; Ria de Vigo; Rias Bajas; Spain; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861034347

To determine the potential for indigenous trees as plantation species for their ability to foster forest species regeneration, this study was undertaken in a mixed indigenous plantation stand. Understories of the stand at 8 years of age were surveyed for plant diversity. The species richness increased by 24% per 1,000 m 2 between 2001 and 2008 and the number of families represented increased by 48%. The Shannon Diversity and Simpson Index values confirm a greater diversity 8 years after the plantation was established. The most abundant species in study plots were Chromolaena odorata and Cedrela odorata, which collectively represent about 54% of all species identified in the plots. The most species-rich families were Fabaceae and Euphorbiaceae representing 31% of the total species recorded. Asteraceae and Meliaceae were the two most dominant families, which collectively represent about 55% of all species identified in the plots. 47 forest tree species were found per 1,000 m 2 but those classified as 'saplings' occurred in low densities. The 47 tree species included pioneer species such as Entandrophragma angolensis, Milicia excelsa, and Ceiba pentandra. Growth rates of planted species were differed, with half of the tested species having similar growth capacity to the exotic species. Generally, planted indigenous species enhanced habitats for other forest tree species in degraded sites. The observed growth of indigenous species, if planted and protected, shows that they may help in biodiversity recovery within agricultural landscapes. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Agroecosystem; Biodiversity; Dry semi-deciduous forest; Indigenous tree species growth; Regeneration; Succession","abundance; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; agroforestry; biodiversity; community composition; deciduous tree; diversity index; growth rate; legume; microclimate; native species; plantation forestry; regeneration; shrub; species richness; understory; Ghana; Asteraceae; Cedrela; Cedrela odorata; Ceiba pentandra; Chromolaena; Chromolaena odorata; Entandrophragma; Euphorbiaceae; Fabaceae; Meliaceae; Milicia excelsa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861233296

However, little is known about the combined toxic effects of TCDD and As(III) in vivo. Previous reports from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that As(III), by itself or in the presence of AhR ligands, such as TCDD, is capable of differentially altering the expression of various phase I and phase II AhR-regulated genes in in vitro systems. Thus, the objective of the current study was to investigate whether or not similar effects would occur at the in vivo level. Therefore, we examined the effect of exposure to As(III) (12.5 mg/kg) in the absence and presence of TCDD (15 μg/kg) on the AhR-regulated genes using C57Bl/ 6 mice. Our results demonstrated that As(III) alone inhibited Cyp1a1 and Cyp1a2 in the kidney, while it induced their levels in the lung and did not affect their mRNA levels in the heart. As(III) also induced Nqo1 and Gsta1 in all tested tissues. Upon co-exposure to As(III) and TCDD, As(III) inhibited the TCDD-mediated induction of Cyp1a1 in the kidney and heart, Cyp1a2 in the kidney and heart, while it potentiated TCDD-mediated induction of Cyp1a1 in the lung, and Nqo1 and Gsta1 in the kidney and lung. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates for the first time that As(III) modulates constitutive and TCDD-induced AhRregulated genes in a time-, tissue-, and AhR-regulated enzyme-specific manner. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","AhR; Arsenite; Cyp1a1; Cyp1a2; Gsta1; Nqo1","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; arsenic trioxide; cytochrome P450 1A1; cytochrome P450 1A2; glutathione transferase A1; heme oxygenase 1; messenger RNA; oxidoreductase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate quinone oxidoreductase; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal tissue; article; catalysis; controlled study; cytochrome P450 1a1 gene; cytochrome p450 1a2 gene; enzyme induction; enzyme inhibition; enzyme localization; gene; gene expression regulation; glutathione transferase a1 gene; heart; heme oxygenase 1 gene; in vivo study; kidney; lung; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate quinone oxidoreductase gene; Animals; Arsenites; Complex Mixtures; Enzyme Activation; Gene Expression Regulation; Kidney; Lung; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Myocardium; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin; Mus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866023429

The paper has important relevance for academic researchers who intend to study the awareness/attitude gap in a tourist setting. © 2012, MCB UP Limited","Attitudes; Awareness; Climate change; Consumer behaviour",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84993033368

Based on experimental solubility data, the Henry's law constant of the carbon dioxide in these solvents was then deduced and compared with reported values from the literature, as well as with those predicted by using COSMO-RS methodology within COSMOthermX software and those calculated by the Peng-Robinson equation of state implemented into Aspen plus. From this work, it appears that the CO 2 solubility is higher in linear carbonates (such as DMC, EMC, DEC) than in cyclic ones (EC, PC, γBL). Furthermore, the highest CO 2 solubility was obtained in MP and EA solvents, which are comparable to the solubility values reported in classical ionic liquids. The precision and accuracy of the experimental values, considered as the per cent of the relative average absolute deviations of the Henry's law constants from appropriate smoothing equations and from literature values, are close to (1% and 15%), respectively. From the variation of the Henry's law constants with temperature, the partial molar thermodynamic functions of dissolution such as the standard Gibbs free energy, the enthalpy, and the entropy are calculated, as well as the mixing enthalpy of the solvent with CO 2 in its hypothetical liquid state. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

This process is currently being carried out partially. The benefits and drawbacks that DG will provide to the end-user and to the community have also been analyzed in both technical and scientific literature. All over the world researchers are strongly involved in the so-called ""hydrogen economy"" scenario that expects a geographically widespread system of production, storage, transportation and use of hydrogen. Furthermore, the actual industrial trend towards the miniaturization of the energy conversion equipment, due mainly to reducing manufacturing costs, results in the availability of a wide variety of small scale power, refrigeration and heat pump systems in the market. Very soon, small, micro and nano mechanical and thermal devices will be used in actual applications. In many sectors, small scale energy conversion plants (Polygeneration, Trigeneration, Combined Cooling Heating and Power) allow for the satisfaction of different energy requirements (electricity, cooling and heating) with a great potential for primary energy saving and greenhouse gas emission reduction. The ""core"" of these technologies is a prime mover based on different technologies (Stirling, Reciprocating Internal Combustion, Fuel Cell, Gas Turbine,...), specially designed to operate in stationary conditions for a long time. This operation is accompanied by high efficiency output and very low pollutant emissions with regards to the reference separate ""production"" by large thermal power stations. At the moment, the most common technology, the gas-fired Reciprocating Internal Combustion (RIC) engine, has very good features e.g. in terms of installation space, thermal efficiency, low noise and vibration and maintenance. These engines can drive electric generators and/or electric heat pumps, absorption heat pumps and so on in different ways (mechanically, electrically and thermally), thereby allowing a wide range of operating conditions to match thermal (heating and cooling) and electric enduser requirements. The aim of this paper is to study the Energy, Economic and Environmental implications (3-E analysis) of using these complex small scale trigeneration energy conversion systems, starting with the results of an intensive theoretical and experimental research activity. In particular these systems, in comparison with conventional system, based on separate energy production, can guarantee a primary energy saving up to 28% and a reduction of equivalent CO2 emissions up to 36% when the trigeneration system is based on a small scale cogeneration system (Micro Combined Heat and Power, MCHP) coupled to a Heat Pump (HP). Satisfactory results can be achieved considering a cogeneration system which interacts with an Electric Heat Pump (EHP). On the contrary, small scale trigeneration systems based on Thermally activated Heat Pump (THP) show low efficiency, with respect to conventional systems. This is due to the low COP of small scale cooling devices which is the reason why these systems require further improvements to be able to compete with traditional one. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Decentralized trigeneration; Energy saving; MCCHP; Microtrigeneration","Carbon dioxide; Cooling; Distributed power generation; Electric generators; Electric heating; Emission control; Energy conservation; Engines; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heat pump systems; Hydrogen storage; Industrial refrigeration; Power generation; Research; Separation; Thermoelectric power plants; Absorption heat pumps; Cogeneration systems; Combined cooling heating and power; Conventional systems; Conversion equipment; Cooling devices; Electric heat; End users; Energy conversion systems; Energy productions; Energy requirements; Environmental implications; Equivalent co; Gas-fired; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Heat pumps; Heating and cooling; Hydrogen economy; Internal combustion; Low noise; Manufacturing cost; MCCHP; Micro-combined heat and power; Microtrigeneration; Operating condition; Pollutant emission; Poly-generation; Primary energy savings; Prime movers; Research and application; Scientific literature; Small scale; Stationary conditions; Stirling; Theoretical and experimental; Thermal devices; Thermal efficiency; Thermal power stations; Thermally activated; Tri-generation; Trigeneration systems; Cooling systems",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874270142

Objectives: We examined the air quality and health benefits of 14 specific emission control measures targeting BC and methane, an ozone precursor, that were selected because of their potential to reduce the rate of climate change over the next 20-40 years. Methods: We simulated the impacts of mitigation measures on outdoor concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone using two composition-climate models, and calculated associated changes in premature PM2.5- and ozone-related deaths using epidemiologically derived concentration-response functions. Results: We estimated that, for PM2.5 and ozone, respectively, fully implementing these measures could reduce global population-weighted average surface concentrations by 23-34% and 7-17% and avoid 0.6-4.4 and 0.04-0.52 million annual premature deaths globally in 2030. More than 80% of the health benefits are estimated to occur in Asia. We estimated that BC mitigation measures would achieve approximately 98% of the deaths that would be avoided if all BC and methane mitigation measures were implemented, due to reduced BC and associated reductions of nonmethane ozone precursor and organic carbon emissions as well as stronger mortality relationships for PM2.5 relative to ozone. Although subject to large uncertainty, these estimates and conclusions are not strongly dependent on assumptions for the concentration-response function. Conclusions: In addition to climate benefits, our findings indicate that the methane and BC emission control measures would have substantial co-benefits for air quality and public health worldwide, potentially reversing trends of increasing air pollution concentrations and mortality in Africa and South, West, and Central Asia. These projected benefits are independent of carbon dioxide mitigation measures. Benefits of BC measures are underestimated because we did not account for benefits from reduced indoor exposures and because outdoor exposure estimates were limited by model spatial resolution.","Air quality; Climate change; Health impact analysis; Outdoor air; Particulate matter","black carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrogen oxide; organic carbon; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; air pollution control; air quality; article; climate change; environmental impact; geographic distribution; human; nonbiological model; ozone layer; particulate matter; premature mortality; priority journal; public health; respiratory tract disease; Air Pollution; Climate Change; Computer Simulation; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Methane; Models, Theoretical; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Public Health; Soot",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862027750

In the commercial vehicle and industrial equipment markets, emissions are evaluated using engine test cycles. For the on-highway market in the United States, these cycles include the transient heavy duty engine FTP test, and the steady state heavy duty engine SET test. Evaluation of engine only emissions is a practical approach given the diversity of applications, small volumes, and lack of vertical integration in the commercial vehicle market. However certain vehicle and powertrain characteristics can contribute significantly to fuel consumption and emissions. A number of approaches have been proposed to evaluate vehicle performance, and all of these vehicle evaluation methodologies require the selection of a vehicle cycle. If the engine test cycles and vehicle test cycles are not aligned, a technology evaluation will give different results depending on whether an engine test or vehicle test is used. With future regulations potentially allowing engine or vehicle test options, the alignment of the vehicle and engine test cycles is especially important. In this work, a vehicle FTP cycle and a vehicle SET cycle were created based on the transient engine FTP and engine SET tests. The vehicle cycles are the same duration and have similar power requirements to the engine cycles. Simulation and test results are presented showing similar performance over the engine and vehicle cycles. Alignment of vehicle test cycles with the engine FTP and engine SET cycles will maintain consistency of vehicle and engine emissions evaluations, and will provide a link between future vehicle evaluations and existing experience with engine emissions testing. © 2012 SAE International.",,"Engine emission; Engine test; Evaluation methodologies; Heavy duty engines; Industrial equipment; Power requirement; Steady state; Technology evaluation; Vehicle tests; Vertical integration; Alignment; Automobiles; Commerce; Commercial vehicles; Internet protocols; Transients; Vehicle performance; Engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84871317379

Yet, some communities accept these projects with relative ease. The term acceptance implies passivity and as such does not necessarily reflect community approval or support. If acceptance is passive, what are the characteristics of a community in which the acceptance of CCS is achieved with relative ease; and what best-practice public participation processes are most appropriate for it? This paper attempts to answer these questions through a case study of Australia's Otway Project. Qualitative research methods were used to conduct a human and social capital analysis of the Otway community. An assessment of the project's public participation process was made in light of that analysis. The study found that the community needed capacity-building to enable it to become well-informed about CCS; and to help it develop the negotiation skills necessary to have the proponent address its concerns about the project in a timely manner. An assessment of the Otway public participation process found that while it implemented the majority of best practice principles in public participation, it lacked an adherence to three: transparency, fairness and capacity. A mindfulness of all principles of best practice in public participation would have ensured a fairer and more transparent process. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Acceptance; Carbon capture and storage; Community; Human capital; Public participation; Social capital","carbon sequestration; nuclear power plant; participatory approach; social capital; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864288987

However, it is unknown how these various systems will respond to such a temperature increase because their relevant spatial scales are much different than those represented by numerical global climate models-the standard tool for climate change studies. This deficiency can be addressed by using higher-resolution regional climate models, but at great computational expense. The research presented here seeks to determine how a 2°C global-mean temperature increase might change the frequency of seasonal temperature extremes, both in the United States and around the globe, without necessarily resorting to these computationally-intensive model experiments. Results indicate that in many locations the regional temperature increases that accompany a 2°C increase in global mean temperatures are significantly larger than the interannual-to-decadal variations in seasonal-mean temperatures; in these locations a 2°C global mean temperature increase results in seasonal-mean temperatures that consistently exceed the most extreme values experienced during the second half of the 20th Century. Further, results indicate that many tropical regions, despite having relatively modest overall temperature increases, will have the most substantial increase in number of hot extremes. These results highlight that extremes very well could become the norm, even given the 2°C temperature increase target. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"20th century; Computational expense; Extreme value; Global climates; Global-mean temperature; Model experiments; Near surface temperature; Pre-industrial; Regional climate models; Seasonal temperature; Socio-economic systems; Spatial scale; Standard tools; Temperature increase; Tropical regions; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Global warming; annual variation; climate change; climate modeling; decadal variation; emission control; experimental study; extreme event; global warming; greenhouse gas; socioeconomic impact; temperature gradient; twentieth century",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84859218799

There have been significant developments in automotive and business fields, particularly in diesel engines. Nowadays, the method, which is widely used in reducing emissions of a Diesel engine, is the dilution factor called EGR through which it is possible to lower NOx levels. With the reduction of NOx also the performance of a diesel engine (e.g. the stable combustion and engine power) should be evaluated. This paper presents a useful methodology for analysing the change of the dynamic of the entire engine system, which is due to small changes in EGR dilution ratio. The adoption of systems with sophisticated signal processing such as the one presented in this paper, allows easier control of complex systems, such as diesel systems HCCI. © 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All right reserved.","Discriminating analysis; EGR control; NOx reduction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867860828

Following an upgrade of the RRL data reduction technique, which improves significantly the quality of the final RRL spectra, we have extended the analysis to three times the area covered in Alves et al. The final RRL map has an angular resolution of 14.8arcmin and a velocity resolution of 20kms -1. The electron temperature (T e) distribution of the ionized gas in the area under study at 1.4GHz is derived using the line and continuum data from the present survey. The mean T e on the Galactic plane is 6000K. The first direct measure of the free-free emission is obtained based on the derived T e distribution. Subtraction of this thermal component from the total continuum leads to the first direct measurement of the synchrotron emission at 1.4GHz. A narrow component of width 2° is identified in the latitude distribution of the synchrotron emission. We present a list of Hii regions and supernova remnants (SNRs) extracted from the present free-free and synchrotron maps, where we confirm the synchrotron nature of the SNRs G42.0-0.1 and G41.5+0.4 proposed by Kaplan et al. and the SNR G35.6-0.4 recently re-identified by Green. The latitude distribution for the RRL-derived free-free emission shows that the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) maximum entropy method is too high by ~50 per cent, in agreement with other recent results. The extension of this study to the inner Galaxy region ℓ=-50° to 50° will allow a better overall comparison of the RRL result with WMAP. © 2012 The Authors.

Low ambient temperatures can affect the overall HEV powertrain operation under warm-up and hot driving conditions and, consequently, affect fuel consumption and emission performance. The present study investigates the influence of low ambient temperatures on HEV fuel consumption and pollutant and CO 2 emissions for five in-use HEV models. Chassis dynamometer measurements have been conducted at different set ambient temperatures using a real-world driving cycle suitable for investigating vehicle cold-start emissions. The main observation is that the amount of HEV cold-start extra emissions (CSEEs) of regulated pollutants are reduced by 30% to 85% on average in comparison to sample CSEEs of conventional gasoline vehicles. The results for HEV CSEEs of CO 2 and fuel consumption are mainly similar than those of conventional gasoline vehicles except for CSEEs of some HEVs at the ambient temperature of 23 °C. There, increased CSEEs are observed that exceed maximum sample CSEEs of conventional gasoline vehicles, reaching values for CO 2 between 155 [g/start] and 300 [g/start] even though the test runs were initiated with maximum initial state of charge (SOC) of the HSB. Because SOC of the HSB considerably influences the fuel consumption of HEVs, this aspect should be further investigated in regard to the effect of low ambient temperatures on HEV fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions. Moreover, no particular influence of low ambient temperatures on HSB performance was observed during hot-phase operation. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

FA were extracted from three different soil samples and two commercial composts. Electron carrying capacity (ECC) was determined in all FA samples in order to select the appropriate source of redox-mediating compounds for CT dechlorination. TiO 2, Al(OH) 3, and γ-Al 2O 3 particles were tested as immobilizing materials for the extracted FA. FA extracted from a temperate pine forest soil showed the highest ECC (291.72 μmol g -1). The highest adsorption capacity of FA, measured as total organic carbon (TOC), was achieved by alumina (γ-Al 2O 3) particles (12 mg TOC-FA g -1). Results suggest that the transfer of electrons rather than their microbial generation through glucose fermentation was the ratelimiting factor during dechlorination of CT. Immobilized FA increase up to 10.4-fold the rate of CT dechlorination as compared with the control lacking FA. Immobilization of FA on alumina particles was very stable, and spectrophotometric screening did not detect any detachment of FA during dechlorination of CT, thus confirming that the enhanced dechlorination achieved could exclusively be linked to the redoxmediating capacity of immobilized FA. The present study constitutes the first demonstration that immobilized FA on alumina particles could serve as a solidphase RM in dechlorination reactions. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2011.","Alumina; Carbon tetrachloride; Fulvic acids; Immobilization; Redox mediator","Adsorption capacities; Alumina particles; Anaerobic sludge; Catalytic effects; Dechlorination reaction; Fulvic acids; Glucose fermentation; Pine forest; Rate limiting factors; Redox mediators; Reductive dechlorination; Soil sample; Solid-phase; TiO; Total Organic Carbon; Alumina; Aluminum; Biological materials; Carbon tetrachloride; Composting; Glucose; Organic acids; Radioactive waste vitrification; Soils; Titanium dioxide; Dechlorination; aluminum hydroxide; aluminum oxide; carbon tetrachloride; fulvic acid; organic carbon; titanium dioxide; aluminum oxide; carbon; dechlorination; forest soil; fulvic acid; sludge; spectrophotometry; total organic carbon; adsorption kinetics; article; catalysis; compost; controlled study; dechlorination; electron transport; extraction; forest soil; immobilization; microbial growth; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; sludge; soil analysis; spectrophotometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861809753

The paper follows a comparative approach in reviewing car parking standard requirements according to different types of land use in the UK, the USA, and the KSA. The article illustrates that transportation planners in the UK and the USA use parking policies, especially the application of car parking standards, along with other planning and transport measures to promote sustainable transport choices, to reduce reliance on cars, and to reduce traffic and air pollution. Local authorities in the UK and the USA have moved from requiring minimum standards for car parking to maximum standards. The aim of maximum parking standards is to decrease the number of trips made by private cars whilst seeking to maintain and enhance the viability of economic centres and support sustainable development. In the KSA, authorities still adhere to minimum car parking standards. Moreover, the car parking requirements are not correlated with city zoning systems.

Until now, the extent to which species' climatic limits differ on introduction to a new range has not been experimentally tested. Here, we investigate fitness responses to temperature and low-temperature limits to reproduction of native and introduced populations of the widespread forb Plantago lanceolata. We recorded fitness parameters of P. lanceolata accessions collected from nearly complete latitudinal gradients in the species' native and introduced ranges and grown in five common gardens arranged along an elevational gradient in the native range (European Alps). The highest garden was located outside the low-temperature limit of the species. Native populations exhibited clear clinal genetic differentiation along temperature gradients, while any differentiation in introduced populations was much weaker; however, the introduced populations displayed higher average fitness and broad climatic tolerance. Despite these differences, both native and introduced plants failed to set seed beyond the elevational range margin and so shared a similar low-temperature limit to reproduction. Synthesis. Our experimental data support observational studies of niche-limit conservatism in non-native plants, which has important implications for their management. Specifically, it suggests that efforts to predict the extent of an invasion based on knowledge of the native niche are likely to be accurate at the level of the species, even if populations undergo genetic changes or respond differently to climatic gradients in the new range. © 2012 The Authors.

The geology of carbonate reservoirs in Saudi Arabia is well understood. Reservoir porosity estimation is essential and needs to be determined for flow simulation and reservoir management. A major component of this study is establishing the relation between the P-impedance and porosity using well-log data. An amplitude-versus-angle seismic inversion algorithm was used to invert the three-dimensional impedance volumes (i.e., P-impedance and S-impedance) given partial angle stacks of seismic traces representing reflection amplitude variations with angle of incidence. These impedance volumes were used to estimate porosity between the well locations. The seismic and log data provided a-priori information (i.e., the initial starting model and source wavelet estimate) necessary for obtaining geologically consistent results. Copyright © 2012.

We assessed GHG emission reduction potentials and costs in 2020 and 2030 by country and sector, using a GHG emission reduction-assessment model of high resolution regarding region and technology, and of high consistency with intertemporal, interregional, and intersectoral relationships. Global GHG emission reduction potentials relative to baseline emissions in 2020 are 8.4, 14.7, and 18.9 GtCO 2eq. at costs below 20, 50, and 100 $/tCO 2eq., corresponding to +19, -2, and -7 %, respectively, relative to 2005. The emission reduction potential for 2030 is greater than that for 2020, mainly because many energy supply and energy-intensive technologies have long lifetimes and more of the current key facilities will be extant in 2020 than in 2030.

We also perform a detailed analysis of the contribution of low-carbon technologies to GHG emission reduction over mid- and long-term timeframes, and evaluate the required technological cost. For the analysis we use AIM/Enduse[Global], a techno-economic model for climate change mitigation policy assessment. The results show that a 50 % GHG emission reduction target is technically achievable. Yet achieving the target will require substantial emission mitigation efforts. The GHG emission reduction rate from the reference scenario stands at 23 % in 2020 and 73 % in 2050. The marginal abatement cost to achieve these emission reductions reaches $150/tCO 2-eq in 2020 and $600/tCO 2-eq in 2050. Renewable energy, fuel switching, and efficiency improvement in power generation account for 45 % of the total GHG emission reduction in 2020. Non-energy sectors, namely, fugitive emission, waste management, agriculture, and F-gases, account for 25 % of the total GHG emission reduction in 2020. CCS, solar power generation, wind power generation, biomass power generation, and biofuel together account for 64 % of the total GHG emission reduction in 2050. Additional investment in GHG abatement technologies for achieving the target reaches US$ 6.0 trillion by 2020 and US$ 73 trillion by 2050. This corresponds to 0.7 and 1.8 % of the world GDP, respectively, in the same periods. Non-Annex I regions account for 55 % of the total additional investment by 2050.

Books commonly treated by mass deacidification have undergone natural aging of up to 150 years. The risk of alkali-induced degradation of cellulosic material upon mass deacidification remains uncertain. In the present study, the extent of β-elimination-type degradation reactions was investigated by comparing deacidified and non-deacidified counterparts, using deacidified library materials and identical issues of non-deacidified books from second-hand book shops. The study dealt with only naturally-aged papers focusing on investigation of immediate effects of mass deacidification rather than a long-term impact. Gel permeation chromatography coupled with carbonyl group labeling gave insight into cellulose chain cleavage as well as into the behavior of oxidized functionalities. Processes occurring under natural aging conditions were compared to those upon artificial oxidation of model pulps. Library books did not show a significant reduction in molecular weight after mass deacidification compared to the non-deacidified controls, which stands in contrast to oxidized model pulps. The models showed a more pronounced loss of molecular weight upon deacidification treatments. A decrease in carbonyl groups other than reducing ends was found to occur. Thus, oxidized functionalities were found to be reactive in mass-deacidification reactions; the different behavior was traced down to particular regions of oxidative damage along the cellulose chains. In general, β-elimination processes did not pose a large risk factor upon mass deacidification treatments of the naturally-aged library material tested. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","β-Elimination; Carbonyl groups; Cellulose degradation; Historic books; Mass deacidification; Molecular weight; Oxidation; Paper","Carbonyl groups; Cellulose chain; Cellulose degradation; Cellulosic material; Deacidification; Degradation reaction; Elimination process; Historic books; Mass deacidification; Natural aging; Oxidative damage; Reducing ends; Risk factors; Cellulose; Degradation; Gel permeation chromatography; Libraries; Molecular weight; Oxidation; Paper; Pulp; Carbonyl Groups; Cellulose; Degradation; Molecular Weight; Oxidation; Paper; Pulps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862240169

Therefore, strategies are needed for the sustainable management of the peatlands and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This research was conducted on 464 642 ha of peatland varying in depth between 200 and 680 cm, in the districts of Kubu Raya and Pontianak, in the West Kalimantan province of Indonesia. It was aimed at: (i) evaluating land use changes in the peatland of the two districts and assessing the CO2 emissions these entail; and (ii) recommending options for mitigation of the CO2 emissions. Satellite images in the years 1986, 2002 and 2008 were used for the evaluation of land use changes. This was followed by ground-truthing of recent land cover in 2009. Interviews were conducted with stakeholders to develop emission reduction strategies. The results show that the peatlands were used for various purposes, including the traditional slash-and-burn agriculture for maize, pineapple plantations, intensive vegetable farming, and rubber and oil palm plantations. The peat forest area decreased by 16% from 393 000 ha in 1986 to 329 390 ha in 2008, while shrubland increased by 153% from 9427 ha to 23 814 ha over the same period of time. Oil palm plantations and paddy fields also increased rapidly in expansion. The main sources of emissions were from peat burning, especially for the slash-and-burn farming, peat decomposition due to drainage, and the loss of biomass depending on the land use trajectories. Emission reduction can be achieved through various scenarios. Scenario I, confining future agricultural land development to peatland with peat of &lt;3 m thick, is expected to reduce by 6.8±2.9% the 2010 to 2035 cumulative CO2 emissions from the 127 million tonnes 'business as usual' (BAU) level. Scenario II, providing fertiliser subsidy to replace the traditional burning technique in addition to Scenario I, is expected to reduce emissions by as much as 11.5±4.9%. Scenario III, switching future agricultural expansion to mineral soils, is expected to lower the cumulative emissions by as much as 20.5±8.8%. These scenarios form the basis for sustainable peatland management and for a state of preparedness to reduce emissions from peatland.","Burning; CO2 emission; Emission reduction; Land use change; Peatland","Ananas comosus; Elaeis; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84866657148

The goal was to determine the carbon footprint (grams CO2 equivalents (gCO2e)/kg of dry feed) in the USA on a regional basis, identify key inputs, and make recommendations for emissions reduction. Methods Commonly used dairy feeds in the USA, such as soybeans, alfalfa, corn, and others, were identified based on a recent literature review and information from dairy farm surveys. The following input data for the cultivation and harvesting of dairy feeds were collected for five US regions: crop production data, energy input, soil amendments, and crop protection chemicals. Life cycle inventory input data were mainly collected from the US Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistical Service on a state-bystate basis as well as from state extension services forage crop budget estimates. In addition to consulting other life cycle assessment studies and published articles and reports, this cradle-to-farm gate carbon footprint analysis was conducted using the Ecoinvent™ unit processes in SimaPro version 7.1© (PRé Consultants 2009). Results The final carbon footprint results (gCO2e/kg of dry dairy feed) varied regionally depending on a number of factors such as lime and fertilizer application rates. The average national US carbon footprint results of the main feeds were: corn grain (390), corn silage (200), dried distillers grains with solubles (910 dry mill, 670 wet mill), oats (850), soybeans (390), soybean meal (410), winter wheat (430), alfalfa hay (170), and forage mix (160). Conclusions and recommendations The southeast dairy region generally showed a relatively high level of carbon footprint for most feeds, and this is attributable to the higher application rates of both synthetic fertilizers and lime. The highest contributor to carbon footprint for most regions (apart from soybeans and soybean meal) was due to the application of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer. Efficient transfer of knowledge to farmers with regards to fertilizer best management practices such as precision application of farm nutrients may contribute significantly to reducing regional crop carbon footprints. © Springer-Verlag 2012.","Carbon footprint; Dairy; Feeds; Milk production","calcium oxide; carbon dioxide; fertilizer; alfalfa; animal food; article; carbon footprint; crop production; energy yield; forage; harvesting; life cycle assessment; maize; milk production; priority journal; soil amendment; soybean; United States; Avena; Glycine max; Medicago sativa; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865108564

Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable software has been employed to carry out the present study. It was found that Wind-PV-Generator-Battery hybrid system is most suitable option as stand-alone electricity generating system in Ibadan. The optimal simulation results indicate that the levelised cost of energy for this hybrid energy system varies between $0.437/kWh and $0.606/kWh depending on the diesel price. These costs are significantly lower than the cost of using diesel generator only (without battery) which varies between $0.607 and $0.940 per kWh. It was further observed that there is a significant reduction in emission produced if hybrid energy system is used instead of only generator based energy system. The most suitable hybrid systems in other locations in southwest Nigeria can be identified from the optimal energy system plots provided.","Diesel Generator; Electricity; Hybrid System; Levelised Cost of Electricity; PV; South-West Nigeria; Wind Turbine","Cost of electricity; Diesel generators; Diesel prices; Economic assessments; Electricity generation; Energy systems; Generating system; Hybrid energy system; Hybrid optimization; Nigeria; Optimal energy; PV; Renewable resource; Rural community; Solar data; Costs; Electricity; Hybrid systems; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Wind turbines; Electric generators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864070993

The relationship between warming and heterotrophic microbial respiration remains poorly understood, not least in terms of the differential sensitivity of microbial groups to temperature and the complexity of interactions with other biota. Cord-forming basidiomycete fungi are dominant primary decomposers in temperate woodland. Decomposition rates are determined by the composition of the decomposer community, ecophysiological relationships between these fungi and abiotic variables and interactions with other organisms. Amongst the latter, a major determinant is the balance between mycelial growth and removal by soil invertebrate grazers, which can themselves be affected by elevated temperature. We investigated the impact of elevated temperature on fungal foraging and decomposition of beech (Fagus sylvatica) wood in soil microcosms to which the invertebrate grazers, Folsomia candida and Protophorura armata (Collembola), were added in factorial combinations with five basidiomycete fungi. Species-specific impacts on mycelial development and function resulted from differential sensitivity of fungi to warming and grazing. Temperature impacts on collembola abundance were resource-specific, causing increased grazing pressure by both species, but on different fungi. Grazing often counteracted warming-induced stimulation of mycelial growth, but occasionally amplified the temperature effect, with implications for colonization rates of new resources. High grazing pressure did not prevent increased fungal-mediated decomposition of colonized wood, as fungi utilized more resource-derived energy to maintain explorative growth. Impacts of elevated temperature on decomposition are likely to depend on local composition of the fungal and invertebrate decomposer community. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; CO 2 feedback; Decomposition; Ecosystem processes; Interactions; Saprotrophic fungi; Soil biota; Soil respiration","arthropod; carbon dioxide; climate change; community composition; decomposition; ecophysiology; ecosystem; fungus; grazing; growth response; soil biota; soil respiration; temperature effect; Basidiomycota; Candida; Collembola; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica; Folsomia candida; Fungi; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860660591

In vitro gas production technique was used for evaluating the effect of tannin-rich plants, essential oils, and biodiesel co-products on CH 4 formation in three individual studies and a small chamber system to measure CH 4 released by sheep for in vivo studies was developed. Microbial rumen population diversity from in vitro assays was studied using qPCR. In vitro studies with tanniniferous plants, herbal plant essential oils derived from thyme, fennel, ginger, black seed, and Eucalyptus oil (EuO) added to the basal diet and cakes of oleaginous plants (cotton, palm, castor plant, turnip, and lupine), which were included in the basal diet to replace soybean meal, presented significant differences regarding fermentation gas production and CH 4 formation. In vivo assays were performed according to the results of the in vitro assays. Mimosa caesalpineaefolia, when supplemented to a basal diet (Tifton-85 hay Cynodon sp, corn grain, soybean meal, cotton seed meal, and mineral mixture) fed to adult Santa Ines sheep reduced enteric CH 4 emission but the supplementation of the basal diet with EuO did not affect (P &gt; 0.05) methane released. Regarding the microbial studies of rumen population diversity using qPCR with DNA samples collected from the in vitro trials, the results showed shifts in microbial communities of the tannin-rich plants in relation to control plant. This research demonstrated that tannin-rich M. caesepineapholia, essential oil from eucalyptus, and biodiesel co-products either in vitro or in vivo assays showed potential to mitigate CH 4 emission in ruminants. The microbial community study suggested that the reduction in CH 4 production may be attributed to a decrease in fermentable substrate rather than to a direct effect on methanogenesis. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Biodiesel co-products; GHG mitigation; Sheep; Tanniniferous plants","bacterial DNA; biofuel; essential oil; methane; RNA 16S; tannin derivative; angiosperm; animal; animal disease; animal food; animal husbandry; article; bacterium; chemistry; classification; diet; drug effect; fermentation; male; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; polymerase chain reaction; randomization; ruminant stomach; sheep; Angiosperms; Animal Feed; Animal Husbandry; Animal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Animals; Bacteria; Biofuels; Diet; DNA, Bacterial; Fermentation; Male; Methane; Oils, Volatile; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Random Allocation; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Rumen; Sheep, Domestic; Tannins; Bovidae; Brassica rapa subsp. rapa; Eucalyptus; Foeniculum vulgare; Glycine max; Gossypium hirsutum; Mimosa; Nigella sativa; Ovis aries; Thymus vulgaris; Zea mays; Zingiber officinale",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860628027

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, changes in carbon source lead to gene induction by Adr1 and Cat8 that are known to require the upstream function of the Snf1 protein kinase, the central regulator of carbon metabolism, to exert their activating effect. How Snf1 facilitates transcription activation by Adr1 and Cat8 is not known. Here we show that under derepressing conditions, deletion of SNF1 abolishes the increase of histone H3 acetylation at the promoter of the glucose-repressed ADY2 gene, and as a consequence profoundly affects the chromatin structural alterations accompanying transcriptional activation. Adr1 and Cat8 are not required to regulate the acetylation switch and show only a partial influence on chromatin remodelling at this promoter, though their double deletion completely abolishes mRNA accumulation. Finally, we show that under derepressing conditions the recruitment of the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 is abolished by SNF1 deletion, possibly explaining the lack of increased histone H3 acetylation and nucleosome remodelling.The results highlight a mechanism by which signalling to chromatin provides an essential permissive signal that is required for activation by glucose-responsive transcription factors. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..","Adr1; ADY2; Cat8; Histone acetylation; Nucleosome remodeling; Snf1","histone acetyltransferase GCN5; histone H3; messenger RNA; protein kinase; Snf1 protein kinase; unclassified drug; article; chromatin assembly and disassembly; controlled study; enzyme localization; gene deletion; histone acetylation; nonhuman; priority journal; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; transcription initiation; Acetylation; Carbon; Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly; DNA-Binding Proteins; Glucose; Histone Acetyltransferases; Histones; Membrane Transport Proteins; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Signal Transduction; Trans-Activators; Transcription Factors; Transcriptional Activation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84857660885

At the same time, RE technologies can generate clean energy and potentially boost the economy of the African continent. It is thus not surprising that recent studies have investigated the relationship between RE and economic growth in some African countries. However, the limitation of these reductionist analytical frameworks is that they can conceal the true regional picture in terms of the link between investments in RE technologies and gross domestic product (GDP). This holistic analysis is important in order to inform regional policies on climate change. The article uses statistical analytic techniques to examine the correlation between RE production and economic growth across different blocks of the African continent between 1980 and 2008. The analysis is between geographical blocks (e.g. Southern Africa, Western Africa, etc.) and between oil and non-oil producing blocks. Generally speaking, while there exists a similar pattern in all the studied blocks in terms of mean, standard deviation and correlation between RE and GDP, a few exceptions can be found. For instance, the rise in RE-GDP correlation from 1992/1993 onwards was conspicuously higher in North Africa and oil-producing countries compared to all the other blocks. Similarly, Southern Africa was the only block where the correlation between RE and GDP was negative throughout the period under review, except 1988, 1989 and 1997 when it was positive. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Africa; Climate change; GDP; Renewable energy","Africa; Analytic technique; Clean energy; Climate change impact; Comparative studies; Economic growths; GDP; Gross domestic products; Holistic analysis; North Africa; Regional policies; Renewable energies; Similar pattern; Standard deviation; Climate change; Investments; Economics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858164320

A probit model is used for a clearer understanding of EE investment determinants in SMEs. The second consists of the US State and Regional Climate Policy actions of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Panel data is used to analyse the impact of both policies, combining information on emissions and energy consumption per unit of real GDP for 51 US states over 19 years with data on EE investments as a consequence of the first policy, and, finally, 30 climate policies implemented at state and regional levels.
