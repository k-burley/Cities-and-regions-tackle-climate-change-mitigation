In this respect, both the composition and spatial patterns of anthropogenic land use play an important role in local thermal pattern. The urban environments’ climate change adaptation strategy needs adequate knowledge systems urban planners can use to organise and design more resistant and resilient urban spaces. This study examined the relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) variations and increasing urbanised areas during the period 2001–2011 in the Po Valley, utilising different urban growth spatial patterns (UGSP). Remotely sensed LST data was obtained from MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) at a resolution of 1 km/pixel for an 11 year-period, from 2001 to 2011, with urbanisation data from the ISTAT map (nominal scale 1:10,000) respectively for the 2001 and 2011 time sections. The relationship between dependent (mean annual daytime, nighttime and daily values) and independent (urbanised areas) variables were investigated through ANOVA test and post-hoc analysis (p < 0.01) for all defined UGSP. Results showed that there is a decreasing LST range (in all conditions) associated with progressive increase of urbanised areas. Furthermore, clustered patterns urban growth have a statistically significant relationship with daytime, nighttime and daily conditions while dispersed pattern urban growth have the same with nighttime only. The outcomes are helpful for understanding the effects of different UGSP, which have significant implications for urban planning, and identifying the critical territorial sectors in need of sustainable mitigation actions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","GIS analysis; Lowland urbanisation; LST; Urban climate change; Urban growth spatial pattern","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Land use; Radiometers; Satellite imagery; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Climate change adaptation; GIS analysis; Land surface temperature; Lowland urbanisation; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; Spatial patterns; Urban environments; Urban heat island; Urban growth; climate change; GIS; heat island; land surface; lowland environment; spatial variation; surface temperature; urban growth; urban planning; urbanization; analysis of variance; article; city planning; climate change; post hoc analysis; urbanization; Italy; Po Valley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054048944

Because of the achievement of climate protection targets, photovoltaic (PV) energy has an increasing role in the global energy mix. This paper presents the technical and economic aspects of different photovoltaic system configurations designed to suit the Hungarian renewable energy regulations. In this study, five alternative PV configurations were examined for systems with a capacity from 50 kW to 500 kW, related to low- and medium-voltage installations. This article also introduces and explains the Hungarian economic PV and Feed-in-Tariff (FiT) regulations, where three different investment alternatives are analyzed with the help of economic indicators. This study could help stakeholders in the market (e.g., the Hungarian industry sector and local governments) understand the possible directions of technical and economic PV development. According to the results, the payback periods in all the studied economic-technical cases were below 10 years.

Urban planning needs to address this problem focusing on areas where people are exposed to heat such as in public squares. Typical square designs include green infrastructure which can positively affect outdoor thermal comfort by providing regulating ecosystem services, but knowledge on the effectiveness of different design approaches is still limited. The present study assessed typical greening designs of rectangular public squares and their microclimatic influences during a hot summer day both during day and night-time conditions. By using a validated ENVI-met V4 model, thermal comfort values expressed by the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET) index were compared. Moreover, a novel greening design was developed and tested with the model. The results showed that at 3pm the greening design with most trees and trees placed in the sunlit areas of the square provided 5.2% higher cooling effect compared to the current greening, whereas for 4am the design without trees, but with meadow areas performed best (4.2% heat reduction). This led to the conclusion that for a comfortable thermal situation a climate adapted design has to include trees to maximize the shaded surface areas, while the main wind channel is kept free from trees, but planted with grass to minimize the heat storage. The number of trees and their placement together with the extent and placement of grass areas can thus serve as indicators for designing climate adapted public squares. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate adaptation; Green design; Microclimate modelling; Outdoor thermal comfort; Urban planning; Urban trees","Climate change; Ecodesign; Ecosystems; Heat storage; Physiological models; Thermal comfort; Urban planning; Climate adaptation; Climate-adapted designs; Ecosystem services; Green infrastructure; Human thermal comfort; Outdoor thermal comfort; Physiologically equivalent temperatures; Urban trees; Forestry; greenspace; infrastructural development; microclimate; optimization; temperature effect; urban design; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059584294

One of the most populous and developed provinces in China, Jiangsu, is facing tremendous pressure to reduce CO 2 emissions. This study assessed CO 2 emissions from large, stationary CO 2 sources and the CO 2 geological storage capacity for the Jiangsu province, and studied their optimal geographical matching relationships. The results of the study show that major, large, stationary sources have a total of 730.75 Mt/year CO 2 emissions, and the majority of them are located in southern Jiangsu. The Subei-Southern South Yellow Sea basin, with a total storage capacity of 5.21 × 10 4 Mt, can be subdivided into 28 storage blocks based on the faults. Source-sink geographical matching shows that the locations of the sources and the matched sinks are approximately translational. When the entire Subei-Southern South Yellow basin was chosen as an option for CO 2 sinks, the sinks that matched to the northern Jiangsu CO 2 sources were mainly located in the onshore northern Subei basin. The northern sources tended to match the north sinks of the northern Subei basin. The CO 2 from the southern Jiangsu should be stored in the southern Subei basin and the offshore Southern South Yellow basin. When only the offshore storage blocks are optional CO 2 sinks, the CO 2 sources in the northern and central Jiangsu mainly match the sinks in the northwestern Southern South Yellow basin. The CO 2 sources from southern Jiangsu mainly match the sinks in the southern and eastern Southern South Yellow basin. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","geological storage; linear programming model; source-sink matching; storage potential; Subei-Southern South Yellow Sea basin","Chemical industry; Geology; Linear programming; Offshore oil well production; Geological storage; Linear programming models; Source-sink; South Yellow Sea Basin; Storage potential; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057960223

However, the high potential needed for driving OER usually leads to electrochemical oxidation of carbon-based materials, reducing their catalysis durability. Meanwhile, the weak interaction between carbon-based conductive additive and transition metal oxides, nitrides, sulfides and other compounds that possess electrocatalyst activity affects the performance of the electrocatalysts. Herein, a novel three-dimensional (3D) bifunctional electrocatalyst was prepared by embedding CoO nanoparticles into nitrogen and sulfur co-doped carbon framework (denoted as Co/N/S-CF) through morphology-controlled solid-state pyrolysis. The carbon framework was derived from a morphology-retaining pyrolysis of poly(aniline-co-2-aminothiophenol) precursor, retaining the 3D porous structure of the latter. The embedded CoO nanoparticles improve electrocatalysis durability of the 3D carbon-based framework as CoO has lower OER potential than the electrooxidation decomposition potential of doped carbon materials. Only 1.61 V can attain a current density of 10 mA cm−2. Meanwhile, the catalyst retains the highly efficient activity of N and S co-doped carbon framework towards ORR with an onset potential of about 0.92 V, suggesting that it is a qualified electrocatalyst for ORR. Long-term stability of the catalyst for ORR and OER is superior to the commercially available Pt/C and IrO2. Furthermore, the overpotential between ORR and OER (oxygen electrode activity parameter) of the catalyst is calculated to be 0.796 V, indicating that the catalyst could be a promising bifunctional electrocatalyst for both ORR and OER. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","3D N/S-doped carbon frameworks; CoO nanoparticles; Morphology-retaining pyrolysis; Oxygen evolution reaction; Oxygen reduction reaction","Aniline; Catalysis; Cobalt compounds; Conductive materials; Durability; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrochemical oxidation; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Electrooxidation; Morphology; Nanoparticles; Oxygen; Pyrolysis; Sulfur compounds; Transition metal oxides; Transition metals; Bifunctional electrocatalysts; Carbon based materials; Carbon framework; Morphology-controlled; Oxygen evolution reaction; Oxygen reduction and evolution; Oxygen reduction reaction; Threedimensional (3-d); Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057198579

In order to investigate the effects of natural ventilation in both single- and gable-slope city tunnels, a set of simplified analytical models was proposed in this work based on the equations of continuity, energy, and pressure, and the theoretical values of airflow temperature and velocity were obtained by iterative calculations. The influences of thermal pressure, tunnel slope, tunnel geometry, and shaft on tunnel ventilation performance were discussed. In the single-slope-shaftless, single-slope-single-shaft, and gable-slope-single-shaft tunnels, the calculated ranges of average temperature and velocity of airflow were obtained and analyzed, respectively. Moreover, the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) method employing the software FLUENT was selected to simulate the temperature and airflow velocity distributions in different types of tilted city tunnels. The variation tendencies of both analytical and CFD results were consistent. The iterated values of airflow temperature and velocity fitted the simulation results well.

In order to elucidate regulation of the starch biosynthesis pathway, we screened a series of rice (Oryza sativa L.) endosperm mutants. In this study, we identified a floury white-core endosperm mutant named floury endosperm12 (flo12). The flo12 mutant exhibited loosely packed starch granules and a lower thousand kernel weight compared to wild type. Semithin sections revealed that compound starch grains (SG) in flo12 interior endosperm cells were developed abnormally. Furthermore, amylose content was decreased, while total protein content was significantly increased in flo12 grains. Map-based cloning showed that FLO12 encodes rice alanine aminotransferase 1 (OsAlaAT1). OsAlaAT1 is highly expressed in developing endosperm. Subcellular localization showed that OsAlaAT1 is localized in the cytosol. Moreover, the expression of most starch synthesis-related genes was decreased, while most of the storage protein coding genes had elevated expression levels in the flo12 mutant. In addition, overexpression of the OsAlaAT1 gene increased grain weight. In brief, we demonstrated that OsAlaAT1 regulates carbon and nitrogen metabolism, which provides a new insight for the improvement of rice quality and yield. © 2019, Korean Society of Plant Biologists and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Alanine aminotransferase 1; Floury endosperm; Rice (Oryza sativa L.); Starch synthesis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061239082

It is considered one of the main environmental triggers for lung and heart diseases. Air pollutants can be adsorbed by forest. In this study we investigated the effect of forest cover on urban PM2.5 concentrations in 12 cities in Heilongjiang Province, China. The forest cover in each city was constant throughout the study period. The average daily concentration of PM2.5 in 12 cities was below 75 μg/m 3 during the non-heating period but exceeded this level during heating period. Furthermore, there were more moderate pollution days in six cities. This indicated that forests had the ability to reduce the concentration of PM2.5 but the main cause of air pollution was excessive human interference and artificial heating in winter. We classified the 12 cities according to the average PM2.5 concentrations. The relationship between PM2.5 concentrations and forest cover was obtained by integrating forest cover, land area, heated areas and number of vehicles in cities. Finally, considering the complexity of PM2.5 formation and based on the theory of random forestry, we selected six cities and analyzed their meteorological and air pollutant data. The main factors affecting PM2.5 concentrations were PM10, NO 2 , CO and SO 2 in air pollutants while meteorological factors were secondary. © 2018, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Forest cover; Heilongjiang Province; Influencing factor; PM2.5 concentrations; Random forest","air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; complexity; concentration (composition); forest cover; heating; particle size; particulate matter; traffic emission; urban area; urban atmosphere; China; Heilongjiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045238439

In this study, we constructed a grid-based NUFER (NUtrient Flow in food chains, Environment and Resources use) model in order to quantify a high-resolution agricultural N and P emissions to water bodies in Haihe Basin in 2012, based on data collected from county-level statistics, farm interview, and spatial data of topography, climate, soil texture, and land use. We also explored the mitigation strategies in 2030 via scenario analysis. The results showed that total agricultural N emission to water bodies in Haihe Basin was 1079 Gg N in 2012, of which cropland contributed 54%; total agricultural P emission to water bodies was 208 Gg P, livestock contributed 78%. There were large spatial variations in agricultural N and P emissions. Overall, the plain areas accounted for around 80% of the total agricultural N and P emissions to water in 2012. The highest N and P emission intensities were 10 t N km−2 and 2 t P km−2, respectively. N and P emissions were significantly related to anthropogenic factors (such as the livestock density and cropland) in the plain areas; whereas in mountainous areas, both anthropogenic and natural factors (e.g., slope deviation and soil texture) significantly affected N and P emissions. Our scenario analysis suggests that agricultural N and P emissions can be reduced by up to 45% and 77%, respectively for N and P in 2030, via improved agricultural and environmental policies, technologies and managements. The prohibition of direct animal manure discharge to the water system seems to be the most effective measure to mitigate the emissions. Our study provided a high-resolution agricultural N and P emissions to the water bodies of Haihe Basin and identified the most effective options to reduce these emissions in highly intensified agricultural areas. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Crop-livestock system; Haihe Basin; Nitrogen; NUFER; Phosphorus; Water pollution","Climate models; Environmental protection; Environmental technology; Fertilizers; Land use; Landforms; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Water pollution; Agricultural areas; Anthropogenic factors; Environmental policy; Haihe Basin; Livestock systems; Mitigation strategy; Nitrogen and phosphorus; NUFER; Agriculture; agricultural emission; agricultural land; anthropogenic source; discharge; land use; manure; mitigation; mixed farming; nitrogen; phosphorus; questionnaire survey; scenario analysis; soil texture; spatial data; topography; water pollution; China; Hai Basin; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053192327

The discrepancies at the two sites implied the uncertainty of the bottom-up inventory of BC emissions. Assuming a near-linear response of BC concentrations to emission changes, we applied a multiple regression model to fit the hourly surface concentrations of BC at the two sites, based on the detailed source contributions to ambient BC levels from brute-force simulation. Constrained with this top-down method, BC emissions were estimated at 13.4&thinsp;Gg&thinsp;yr<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">ĝ'1</span> (JS-posterior), 50&thinsp;% smaller than the bottom-up estimate, and stronger seasonal variations were found.

However, application of JS-posterior slightly enhanced NMEs in July and October at NJU where simulated concentrations with JS-prior were lower than observations, implying that reduction in total emissions could not correct modeling underestimation. The effects of the observation site, including numbers and spatial representativeness on the top-down estimate, were further quantified. The best modeling performance was obtained when observations of both sites were used with their difference in spatial functions considered in emission constraining. Given the limited BC observation data in the area, therefore, more measurements with better spatiotemporal coverage were recommended for constraining BC emissions effectively. Top-down estimates derived from JS-prior and the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC) were compared to test the sensitivity of the method to the a priori emission input. The differences in emission levels, spatial distributions, and modeling performances were largely reduced after constraining, implying that the impact of the a priori inventory was limited on the top-down estimate. Sensitivity analysis proved the rationality of the near-linearity assumption between emissions and concentrations, and the impact of wet deposition on the multiple regression model was demonstrated to be moderate through data screening based on simulated wet deposition and satellite-derived precipitation. © Author(s) 2019.",,"annual variation; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric transport; black carbon; carbon emission; cluster analysis; concentration (composition); estimation method; top-down control; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061910900

Approximately 2.53 million households have completed the switch from coal-burning stoves to natural gas or electricity stoves in rural areas surrounding Beijing and Tianjin since 2017. However, the contribution of this clean heating replacement on provincial emission reduction remains unclear. This study aimed to determine emission factors, energy efficiency, and economic profits of traditional coal-burning stoves, as well as cleaner natural gas and electricity stoves by laboratory simulation and field tests. The results indicated a significant reduction after clean replacement for PM 2.5 , CO, CO 2 , NO X , SO 2 , CH 4 , and 16 types of U.S. EPA priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The emission of PM 2.5 can be reduced by 99% and 95% for natural gas and electricity switch. Toxic equivalent quantity value of PAHs was also decreased from 4.89 (coal) to 0.03 (natural gas) and 0.07 μg/MJ net (electricity). When comprehensively considering the upstream pollutants emissions from power plant, natural gas switching performed better than coal-fired electricity. Moreover, the government supported the clean heating replacement project with extensive financial subsidy for purchasing clean stoves and using clean energy within 3 years in rural areas. A relatively cheaper price on an energy basic of natural gas and electricity use can be obtained after this subsidy compared to coal. © 2018 The Authors.

This study integrated two nighttime light datasets: the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime light images and the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) composite data to improve on estimates of urban residential CO2 emissions from 2000 to 2015 at 1 km resolution. Then, the driving forces including socio-economic factors and climatic factors were discussed using spatial econometrics models based on panel data covering 288 prefecture-level cities. The results show that models built for the northern and southern regions separately performed better than those for the entire country in estimating urban residential CO2 emissions, which strongly suggests that climatic factors affect the behavior of urban residents and CO2 emissions. The spatio-temporal analysis revealed that rapid growth in emissions occurred in provincial capitals and was mainly concentrated in central China. Gross Domestic Product and energy utilization technology were associated with higher CO2 emission while GDP per capita and the number of employed workers had a negative effect. Measures based on daily mean temperatures had a substantial negative correlation with CO2 emissions. In contrast, the average of daily maximum air temperature in summer correlated with higher CO2 emissions. We conclude that extreme weather events and energy efficiency should be of particular concern for policy makers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Integration of two nighttime light datasets; Residential carbon emissions; Spatial econometrics models; Spatio-temporal dynamics","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Housing; Image enhancement; Orbits; Statistics; Thermography (imaging); Carbon emissions; Defense Meteorological Satellite Programs; Energy utilization technologies; Night-time lights; Residential energy consumption; Spatial econometrics; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Visible infrared imaging radiometer suites; Energy utilization; air temperature; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; data set; econometrics; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; pollution policy; residential energy; socioeconomic status; spatiotemporal analysis; urban atmosphere; urban pollution; VIIRS; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056234335

To understand the effect of CO2 on the adsorption of CH4 on shale is significant for comprehending the mechanisms of enhanced shale methane recovery using CO2 method in shale gas reservoirs. In this work, the low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technique is employed to quantitatively investigate the influence of CO2 on the CH4 adsorption on typical shale samples. CH4 is first introduced to “saturate” the shale samples at given pressures; based on the measured T2 spectrum for the “CH4-saturated” shale samples, the states that CH4 exists in shale samples are identified. CO2 is then introduced into the “CH4-saturated” shale samples at higher pressures. By comparing the measured T2 spectrum before and after CO2 introduction, the change of CH4 adsorption of due to the presence of CO2 is comprehensively analyzed. According to the measured T2 spectrum, CH4 exists on shale samples in three different states, i.e., the adsorbed CH4 on pore surface, the free-state CH4 in pore center, and the free-state CH4 among shale particles. Compared to the free-state CH4, the “CH4-saturated” shale samples are dominated by the adsorbed CH4. As pressure increases, the adsorbed amount of CH4 first increases and then tends to level off. After introducing CO2 into the “CH4-saturated” shale samples, the adsorbed CH4 is firstly reduced, suggesting the more affinity of CO2 to the organic shale surface, and then tends to level off, achieving the adsorption/desorption equilibrium. CO2 can replace the adsorbed CH4 from pore surface, decreasing the adsorbed molar amount of CH4. However, the replaced CH4 seems to only become free-state CH4 in pore center and hardly escape from the organic pores. Thereby, other stimulating methods, such as secondary hydraulic fracturing, should be supplemented with the CO2 injection for further development of the shale gas reservoirs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Absolute adsorption; Adsorbed CH4; Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR); Organic shale; “CH4-saturated” shale","Adsorption; Carbon dioxide; Magnetism; Oil shale; Petroleum reservoirs; Shale gas; Adsorbed CH4; Adsorption capacities; Adsorption/desorption; Low field nuclear magnetic resonance; Methane recovery; Nuclear magnetic resonance(NMR); Pressure increase; Shale gas reservoirs; Nuclear magnetic resonance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055179211

To evaluate MILD combustion performance, the dependences of the Damköhler number Da on different injection parameters (i.e., the jet velocity, CO2 dilution concentration, and preheating temperature) for MILD combustion in a pilot-scale furnace are investigated in this study. Subsequently, several microscopic-scale parameters of the combustion state are analyzed. Results indicate that the peak value of Da generally exceeds unity under non-premixed MILD combustion. However, the Da value remarkably decrease with an increase in jet velocity, which can be approximate to unity when its value is sufficiently high (up to 190 m/s). An increase in CO2 dilution concentration also tends to reduce the magnitude of Da, because the chemical and physical properties of CO2 and N2 differ. When the CO2 dilution concentration is up to 60 vol%, the peak value of Da is below 10 but hardly approaches unity. Furthermore, low preheating temperatures reduce the effect on the turbulent magnitude and slows down the reaction rate, thereby leading to a slight reduction on the Da value. Compared with the reduced effects of CO2 dilution and preheating temperature on the value of Da, the dependence of jet velocity is more remarkable. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 dilution; Damköhler number; Jet velocity; MILD combustion; Preheating temperature","Carbon dioxide; Dilution; Preheating; Thermal pollution; Velocity; Chemical and physical properties; CO2 dilution; Injection parameters; Jet velocities; MILD combustion; Numerical investigations; Pilot scale furnaces; Preheating temperature; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054162600

The semi-arid Khorchin area in Northeast China is an important production area for rain-fed maize. Drought stress occurs frequently, even if plastic film mulch is applied at sowing. We hypothesized that the yield and water capture of maize could be increased by reducing evaporative loss of water by use of plastic film cover during the autumn and winter preceding sowing. In this study, we compared maize growth, water uptake and yield in three film cover treatments: (1) film cover from the autumn before maize sowing until maize harvest (autumn mulching: AM), (2) film cover from maize sowing till harvest (conventional practice) (spring mulching: SM), (3) no film cover (no mulch: NM). Field experiments were conducted in Fuxin city, Khorchin region, Liaoning province, China in 2013/2014 and 2014/2015. Autumn mulching increased grain yield on average by 18% when compared to spring mulching and by 36% when compared to no mulching. The 1000-kernel weight in AM was 7% higher than in SM, and 12% higher than in NM. Soil water content in the root zone before sowing was 35 mm greater in AM than in SM and NM. Water uptake during the growing season was 34 mm greater in AM than in SM and NM. Water use efficiency for grain yield (yield per unit water uptake) in AM was on average 2.5% higher than in conventional mulching (SM) and 27% higher than in NM. Autumn mulching advanced development, with an advance of 5 days in tasseling time as compared to SM and 10 days when compared to NM. These results show that film cover during the fallow period before maize sowing can increase crop yield and water use efficiency, and reduce climate risks in rain-fed agriculture under semi-arid conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Film cover; Soil temperature; Water availability; Yield components","Crops; Cultivation; Efficiency; Grain (agricultural product); Plastic films; Soil moisture; Film cover; Rain fed agriculture; Semi-arid conditions; Soil temperature; Soil water content; Water availability; Water use efficiency; Yield components; Rain; crop yield; fallow; film; growing season; maize; mulching; plastic; rainfed agriculture; rhizosphere; semiarid region; soil temperature; sowing; spring (season); water availability; water use efficiency; China; Fuxin; Liaoning; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053069260

An accurate quantification of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission of coal chemical industry in China is therefore necessary. However, due to the variety of coal chemical products and limitations of CO2 emission factors, the total CO2 emission of coal chemical industry has yet to be determined. In this study, local CO2 emission factors of coal chemical products in China are published based on first hand data from twenty-three coal chemical enterprises and the total CO2 emission of China's coal chemical industry is extrapolated. The provincial-level spatial distribution of the CO2 emission of coal chemical industry is presented to assist the government in identifying key emission reduction areas. Additionally, scenario analysis of CO2 emission for China's modern coal chemical industry in 2020 is conducted to determine whether the development of the modern coal chemical industry will have a significant impact on future CO2 emission, as well as the effect of carbon capture, utilization and storage technologies on the reduction in carbon emission. The estimate shows that the total CO2 emission of the coal chemical industry in 2015 was 607 million tonnes (Mt), accounting for approximately 5.71% of China's total CO2 emission. The figure is higher than the total annual CO2 emission of a country such as Canada (555 Mt) or Brazil (486 Mt). Quantifying the emission of the coal chemical industry is therefore critical to understand the global carbon budget. The spatial distribution shows that Shandong, Inner Mongolia and Shanxi release one-third of the coal chemical industry's total CO2 emission. Considering the development of the modern coal chemical industry, its CO2 emission is predicted to be as high as 416.52 million tonnes in 2020. However, the CO2 emission could be reduced by 317.98 million tonnes when carbon capture, utilization and storage are applied to process and energy systems simultaneously. This paper quantifies the CO2 emission of the coal chemical industry in China for the first time, identifies key chemical products and the provinces in which they are produced, explores the carbon reduction potential by scenario analysis, and provides specific data to support the assessment of effective CO2 reduction policy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China; CO2 emission; Coal chemical; Coal gasification; Coal liquefaction; Energy conversion","Budget control; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Chemical analysis; Chemical industry; Coal; Coal gasification; Coal liquefaction; Coal storage; Digital storage; Emission control; Energy conversion; Global warming; Spatial distribution; Accurate quantifications; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon reduction potentials; China; CO2 emissions; Coal chemicals; Emission reduction; Storage technology; Coal industry; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; chemical industry; coal; emission control; industrial emission; liquefaction; pollution policy; spatial distribution; Brazil; Canada; China; China; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058051437

Its patterns along climates have been investigated to some extents. However, large uncertainty still exists, especially regarding its relationships with soil nutrients. The objective of this study was to evaluate the CUE variations along soil nutrient gradients by utilizing multi-sources of data for the global terrestrial ecosystem. The global terrestrial ecosystem CUE was calculated based on remote sensing modeled ecosystem productivity data, as well as in-situ observation data. The pattern analysis showed that global croplands and grasslands are distributed in nutrient-richer regions than forests. Along waning nutrients, GPP and net primary productivity (NPP) exhibit an overall increasing trend, while CUE declines. Within each biome, GPP and NPP decrease along enhanced nutrients for forests and grasslands, while CUE exhibits an opposite pattern.

Previous studies mainly focused on the developed countries or cities. There have been very limited studies in less-developed region to quantify the effects of air pollutants on asthma admissions in children. This study aims to assess the short-term impact of air pollutants on asthma hospital admissions for children in Hefei, China. Methods: Poisson generalized linear regression combined with distributed lag non-linear model (DLNM) were applied to investigate the effects of air pollutants on daily childhood hospital admissions of asthma from 2015 to 2016, controlling for meteorological factors. Subgroup analyses by sex and age were performed. Results: There were a total of 17,227 asthma admissions during 2015–2016. We found positive correlations between childhood asthma hospital visits and concentrations of NO2, O3, PM10 and PM2.5. Significantly, NO2 exhibited robust positive correlations with cumulative effects 1.551 (95% CI: 1.306–1.841, lag0–3 days) in single-pollutant model and 1.580 (95% CI: 1.315–1.899, lag0–3 days) in multiple-pollutant model. Conclusions: Air pollutants had adverse effects on childhood asthma. NO2 presented the greatest effect, followed by PM2.5. Results will be important for health authority and guardians to realize the severity of air pollution on the increased risk of asthma, so as to develop relevant strategies and health interventions to meet the challenges of childhood asthma and reduce air pollution. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollutants; Asthma attacks; Child","nitrogen dioxide; ozone; asthma; atmospheric pollution; child health; health impact; hospital sector; pollution effect; time series analysis; urban area; adolescent; adult; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; asthma; child; China; concentration (parameters); disease association; female; hospital admission; human; infant; major clinical study; male; newborn; particulate matter; priority journal; time series analysis; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; asthma; city; environmental exposure; hospital; time; Anhui; China; Hefei; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asthma; Child; China; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Hospitals; Humans; Particulate Matter; Time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057966755

The cyano groups and nitrogen vacancies, as evidenced by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) and Solid-state 13C MAS NMR spectra, are controllable via adjusting chemical reduction temperature. Comparing to the pristine g-C3N4, the as-prepared g-C3N4-x shows much enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution activity under visible-light irradiation. The maximum H2 evolution rate of 3068 μmol·g−1·h−1 is achieved with g-C3N4-x after chemical reduction treatment at 400 °C for 1 h, which is 4.85 times that of the pristine g-C3N4. Moreover, excellent reusability and storage stability have been shown by this photocatalyst as well. It is discovered that nitrogen defects can result in both the up-shift of the valance band and the down-shift of the conduction band, which benefit the absorption of longer wavelength photons and trapping of the photoinduced electrons, therefore reducing the recombination losses of the generated carriers. It is because of this improved visible-light absorption and charge carrier separation, g-C3N4-x displays better visible-light photocatalytic activity compared to the pristine g-C3N4. It is then concluded that the synthetic strategy presented here represents a straightforward and efficient way to synergistically optimize the chemical composition, optical response, and photocatalytic characteristics of g-C3N4-based photocatalysts. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","g-C3N4; Nitrogen defects; Photocatalytic hydrogen production; Solid-state chemical reduction","Carbon nitride; Catalyst activity; Defects; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Hydrogen production; Light absorption; Nitrides; Nitrogen; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Paramagnetic resonance; Photocatalysts; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Photons; Reusability; Spectrometers; Chemical reduction; Electron paramagnetic resonances (EPR); Fourier transform infrared spectra; g-C3N4; Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution; Photocatalytic hydrogen production; Visible light photocatalytic activity; X ray photoelectron spectrometers; Light; carbon; hydrogen; nitrogen; Article; chemical composition; crystal structure; electron spin resonance; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; hydrogen evolution; impedance spectroscopy; light absorption; light scattering; molecular evolution; photocatalysis; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); solid state; synthesis; thermodynamics; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; Defects; Light Absorption; Nitrides; Nitrogen; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Paramagnetic Resonance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054437670

Results reveal that average concentrations of black carbon (BC) and organic carbon in atmospheric aerosols at Lanzhou are 6.7 and 25.4 μg m −3 , respectively, showing obvious seasonality (higher in winter and lower in summer). This is consistent with findings in cities of northern China. Primary organic aerosols and secondary organic aerosols respectively account for approximately 60% and 17% of carbonaceous aerosols. No significant seasonality is found for secondary organic carbon, indicating that its potential sources do not vary significantly throughout the study period. The mass absorption cross-section (MAC 632 nm ) of BC is 7.1 m 2 g −1 , slightly higher than that of immediately emitted BC. MAC values of BC at different wavelengths vary drastically; they are higher for ultraviolet and visible light (8.5–10.2 m 2 g –1 ) than for near-infrared light (4.9–5.7 m 2 g –1 ). The aerosol absorption optical depth generally declines from the near-infrared to the near-ultraviolet region. The values are higher in winter than in summer, thus showing there are different contributions of BC deposition in different seasons. Brown carbon (BrC) has an Ångström absorption exponent (AAE) value of approximately 2.75, which is similar to the AAE value of BrC generated by diesel combustion (2.3). The contribution of BrC to light absorption is as much as 34% at a wavelength of 635 nm. This study demonstrates that the multiwavelength thermal/optical carbon analyzer can quantify absorption properties of BrC in atmospheric aerosols. This can enhance understanding of carbonaceous aerosols and provide key parameters for simulations of climate models. © 2018, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Black carbon; Brown carbon; Carbonaceous aerosol; Multiwavelength thermal/optical carbon analyzer; Organic carbon","Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Bromine compounds; Climate models; Infrared devices; Light; Light absorption; Average concentration; Black carbon; Brown carbons; Carbonaceous aerosol; Multiwavelength; Near-ultraviolet regions; Secondary organic aerosols; Secondary organic carbon; Organic carbon; absorption; aerosol; black carbon; brown carbon; climate modeling; concentration (composition); seasonality; simulation; ultraviolet radiation; China; Gansu; Lanzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053563382

In this study, we evaluated the temperate grassland phenology simulated by the Community Land Model 4.5 for the Northeast China Transect with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer leaf area index (LAI) data set. Results show that although the CLM could partly capture the seasonal patterns of LAI for temperate grasslands, shortcomings lie in a delayed end date of growing season and a problematic senescence existed in early summer. The reason is attributed to the low temperature threshold set for leaf offset and an inaccurate carbon allocation strategy for its display and storage. With the adjusted key phenology parameters, the modeled temperate grassland phenology has been substantially improved for this system: An overestimation of the growing-season LAI as well as the annual gross primary productivity can be constrained.

It significantly impacts energy savings, emission reductions and energy structure upgrades. In recent years, all levels of the Chinese government have strived to introduce policies favorable to the implementation of DE. These policies have been affected by the timing of the introduction, regional economic differences, the degree of government attention, and many other complex factors. To clarify the development and links between these policies, this study summarizes and compares China's DE policies at national, provincial, and municipal levels, from 1989 to 2016. We analyze the scope and content of subsidies in detail, and then provide policy recommendations for DE development in China. The main results are as follows: (1) DE policies emerge from legal provisions in the areas of energy, electricity, and environmental protection. The policies have gradually evolved from macro-plans to specific guidance. (2) The demand for DE subsidies is increasing, making the back slope of subsidies significant under an insufficient government budget. Diverse subsidies are needed to address this contradiction. (3) Future policies should focus on comprehensive DE utilization, smart grids, research and development (R&D), and developing policy synergies at different levels. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Distributed energy; Energy policy; Policy evolution; Policy instruments; Policy recommendations","Budget control; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Environmental regulations; Regional planning; Chinese Government; Distributed energies; Emission reduction; Energy structures; Policy evolution; Policy instruments; Policy recommendations; Research and development; Public policy; energy policy; governance approach; policy analysis; policy development; power generation; research and development; subsidy system; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055731186

The flux chamber technique, typically used to measure emissions from tailings ponds, samples a small area for a short duration, which may not account for the spatial and temporal variability of emissions from oil sands tailings ponds. The eddy covariance (EC) technique, with large spatial coverage and better temporal resolution, is a promising method to improve the accuracy of emission flux quantification. A field campaign was conducted to measure emissions from an oil sands tailings pond in Alberta using an EC system. Average CH4 and CO2 emission fluxes were 4.56 × 10−2 g/(m2-d) and 3.59 g/(m2-d), respectively. Diurnal and daily variations of CH4 and CO2 emission fluxes were strong with relative standard deviations of 97–158%. Nighttime (18:30 to 8:00, inclusive) CH4 average emission flux (6.55 × 10−2 g/(m2-d)) was 2.8 times daytime (8:30 to 18:00, inclusive) CH4 flux (2.32 × 10−2 g/(m2-d)) while nighttime CO2 average emission flux (2.97 g/(m2-d)) was 0.7 times daytime CO2 emission flux (4.29 g/(m2-d)). Pearson correlation test results suggest that short-term (i.e., days to weeks) variations of CH4 and CO2 emission fluxes measured in this study were not strongly (but can be weakly) correlated with meteorological variables or the 90% cumulative flux contour distance. The CH4 and CO2 emission fluxes determined in this study were of the same order of magnitude as those from a previous study that used the EC technique at the same tailings pond. CO2 fluxes in this study were similar while CH4 fluxes in this study were more than an order of magnitude lower than fluxes based on flux chamber measurements conducted by a 3rd party at the same location and in the same month and year as part of routine regulatory monitoring requirements. Continuous, real-time, and long-term monitoring of tailings ponds emissions is necessary to reduce uncertainty and improve representativeness and accuracy of emission flux quantification. © 2018","Alberta oil sands region; Eddy covariance; Emission flux; Fugitive emissions; Greenhouse gases","Carbon dioxide; Correlation methods; Lakes; Oil sands; Ore tailings; Ponds; Sand; Alberta oil sands; Eddy covariance; Emission fluxes; Fugitive emissions; Long term monitoring; Meteorological variables; Relative standard deviations; Spatial and temporal variability; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054431225

Extra nitrogen increased the ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus (N:P ratio) in leaves and aboveground parts of plants by 43.4% and 32.7%, respectively. In contrast, extra nitrogen reduced the ratio of carbon to nitrogen (C:N ratio) in leaves by 30.6%. Extra nitrogen decreased soil C:N ratio by 9.1% in alpine meadows, but increased soil C:N ratio by 3.4% in alpine steppes. Extra urea had a stronger positive impact on aboveground vegetation N:P ratio than did extra ammonium nitrate. Extra urea rather than ammonium nitrate decreased aboveground vegetation C:N ratio and soil C:N ratio. The impact of extra nitrogen on aboveground vegetation N:P ratio was positively correlated with latitude, mean annual temperature and precipitation, nitrogen application rate and accumulated amount, but negatively correlated with elevation, duration and aboveground vegetation N:P ratio of the control plots. The impact of extra nitrogen on leaves N:P ratio was positively correlated with nitrogen application rate and accumulated amount. The impact of extra nitrogen on leaves C:N ratio was positively correlated with latitude, but negatively correlated with mean annual temperature and precipitation, nitrogen application rate, accumulated amount, duration and leaves C:N ratio of the control plots. Therefore, nitrogen enrichment caused by human activities will most likely alter element balance and alpine plants from nitrogen limitation to phosphorus limitation. This effect may weaken with time, and increase with climatic warming, increased precipitation and nitrogen input rate. © 2019 Polish Academy of Sciences.All Rights Reserved.","alpine region; C:N ratio; C:P ratio; eutrophication; N:P ratio; nitrogen deposition","aboveground biomass; alpine environment; ammonium nitrate; atmospheric deposition; eutrophication; grassland; meta-analysis; nitrogen; nutrient enrichment; phosphorus; stoichiometry; temperature profile; urea; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062233970

However, the geographical characteristics of denitrifying bacterial communities associated with activated sludge from diverse wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are still unclear. Here, quantitative PCR and next-generation sequencing of the nirS gene were applied to characterize the abundance and denitrifying bacterial communities from 18 geographically distributed WWTPs. The results showed that the nirS abundance ranged from 4.6 × 10 2 to 2.4 × 10 3 copies per ng DNA, while nirS-type denitrifying bacterial populations were diverse and distinct from activated sludge communities. Among WWTPs, total nitrogen removal efficiencies varied from 25.8 to 84%, which was positively correlated with diversity indices, whereas abundance-based coverage estimator index decreased with an increase in latitude. The dominant phyla across all samples were proteobacteria, accounting for 46.23% (ranging from 17.98 to 87.07%) of the sequences. Eight of the 22 genera detected were dominant: Thauera sp., Alicycliphilus sp., and Pseudomonas sp., etc. Based on network analysis, the coexistence and interaction between dominant genera may be vital for regulating the nitrogen and carbon removal behaviors. Multivariate statistical analysis revealed that both geographic location and wastewater factors concurrently govern the distribution patterns of nirS-type denitrifying bacterial community harbored in WWTPs. Taking together, these results from the present study provide novel insights into the nirS gene abundance and nirS-type denitrifying bacterial community composition in geographically distributed WWTPs. Moreover, the knowledge gained will improve the operation and management of WWTPs for nitrogen removal. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Activated sludge; Coexistence and interaction; Denitrifying bacterial community; nirS gene; Wastewater treatment plant","bacterial protein; nitrite reductase; bacterium; classification; denitrification; devices; ecosystem; gene dosage; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; phylogeny; sewage; waste water; water management; Bacteria; Bacterial Proteins; Denitrification; Ecosystem; Gene Dosage; Nitrite Reductases; Phylogeny; Sewage; Waste Water; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050667656

The present review examines thermal environmental effects on cognitive performance research conducted across multiple disciplines. After differentiating performance from productivity, we compare the two dominant conceptual models linking thermal stress to performance; (1) the inverted-U concept and (2) the extended-U relationship. The inverted-U specifies a single optimum temperature (or its corresponding subjective thermal sensation) at which performance is maximised. In contrast, the extended-U model posits a broad central plateau across which there is no discernible thermal effect on cognitive performance. This performance plateau is bounded by regions of progressive performance decrements in more extreme thermal conditions. The contradictions between these opposing conceptual models might derive from various confounding factors at play in their underlying research bases. These include, inter alia, environment-related, task-related, and performer-related factors, as well as their associated two-way and three-way interaction effects. Methodological discrepancies that might also contribute to the divergence of these conceptual models are evaluated, along with the proposed causal mechanisms underlying the two models. The weight of research evidence reviewed in this paper suggests that the extended-U hypothesis fits the relationship between moderate thermal environments and cognitive performance. In contrast to the inverted-U relationship, implemention of the extended-U in indoor climate control implies substantial reductions in building energy demand, since it permits the heating and cooling setpoint deadband to expand across the full width of the thermal comfort zone, or even slightly further during emergencies such as peak demand events on the electricity grid. Use of personal comfort systems can further extend the thermostat setpoint range beyond the comfort zone. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cognitive performance; The extended-U model; The inverted-U model; Thermal environment; Thermal stress","Productivity; Thermal comfort; Cognitive performance; Indoor climate control; Multiple disciplines; Substantial reduction; Thermal comfort zone; Thermal environment; Three-way interactions; U-model; Thermal stress; cooling; electricity; environmental effect; indoor air; literature review; methodology; numerical model; performance assessment; temperature effect",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058237297

Remote sensing data enable researchers to map concentrations of various air pollutants over vast areas. By combining ground-level concentrations with population data, the spatial distribution of health impacts attributed to air pollutants can be acquired. This study took five highly populated and severely polluted provinces along the Huaihe River, China, as the research area. The ground-level concentrations of four major air pollutants including nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), sulfate dioxide (SO 2 ), particulate matters with diameter equal or less than 10 (PM 10 ) or 2.5 micron (PM 2.5 ) were estimated based on relevant remote sensing data using the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model. The health impacts of these pollutants were then assessed with the aid of co-located gridded population data. The results show that the annual average concentrations of ground-level NO 2 , SO 2 , PM 10 , and PM 2.5 in 2016 were 31 µg/m 3 , 26 µg/m 3 , 100 µg/m 3 , and 59 µg/m 3 , respectively. In terms of the health impacts attributable to NO 2 , SO 2 , PM 10 , and PM 2.5 , there were 546, 1788, 10,595, and 8364 respiratory deaths, and 1221, 9666, 46,954, and 39,524 cardiovascular deaths, respectively. Northern Henan, west-central Shandong, southern Jiangsu, and Wuhan City in Hubei are prone to large health risks. Meanwhile, air pollutants have an overall greater impact on cardiovascular disease than respiratory disease, which is primarily attributable to the inhalable particle matters. Our findings provide a good reference to local decision makers for the implementation of further emission control strategies and possible health impacts assessment. © 2019 by the authors.

To investigate seasonal dry deposition of PM in an urban forest, the concentration and ionic composition of PM 2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic equivalent diameters less than 2.5 μm) and the deposition of PM and ions in PM at different layer were measured at three canopy heights in the Beijing Olympic Forest Park. Results showed that diurnal trends in PM concentration varied with height and that concentrations tended to be highest in the understory. During winter, when the absorption ability of plants, which withered, was reduced, and anthropogenic emissions, primarily from coal combustion, ion concentrations tended to be highest in the forest canopy. The anions SO 4 2− , NO 3 − , and Cl − were the dominant ionic species, accounting for 82% of the total mass of water-soluble ions in PM 2.5 . Results showed a lower mass ratio of NO 3 − /SO 4 2− (mean = 0.29, SD = 0.24), relative to previous studies, implying that vehicle emissions may have reduced in Beijing. The chemical forms of sulfate and nitrate were likely NH 4 NO 3 and (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 ; however, Ca(NO 3 ) 2 was the only chemical form detected based on the correlation coefficient between Ca 2+ and NO 3 − . Concentrations of PM were negatively related to temperature and wind speed, and positively related to relative humidity. Within the forest canopy, the deposition velocity was low (high) during summer (winter). Furthermore, ion deposition fluxes were higher in the forest understory (1.5–6 m) during summer and in the canopy (6–10 m) during winter. This was attributed to seasonal trends in PM concentration. © 2018, University of Tehran.","Canopy height; Dry deposition; Particulate matter; Urban forest; Water-soluble ion","concentration (composition); forest canopy; height; ion; ionic composition; nitrate; particulate matter; sulfate; urban forestry; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060210329

This research proposes a novel two-stage data envelopment analysis (DEA) model that employs frontier-shift methodology to measure ESC ecological efficiency when carbon permits are tradable. The proposed frontier-shift DEA (FSDEA) approach uses the carbon trading quantitative information to determine to whom the trade should be made and how much to trade. In addition to estimating ESC efficiency performance, this research also stipulates the efforts required for a particular decision-making units (DMU) to become efficient and discuss the benefits that derived from the proposed exchange. It also reveals why certain DMUs are more likely involved in trading than others. Under the two-stage ESC, this research shows that either stage can improve the overall efficiency, which can be optimally derived if and only if both stages obtain the optimal solutions. In an application study of cities in one of the Chinese provinces, the proposed FSDEA model compares each city's potential percentage efficiency improvement with minimal possible efforts (carbon reduction), which differs from existing DEA models that rank solely by efficiency scores. Results show that on average the amount of carbon credits a city should trade to its competitors is 392.21 tons, resulting in a 6.61% improvement in efficiency. Among cities, Xuancheng and Fuyang is ranked in the first and the last place, respectively, according to their effectiveness in potential efficiency improvement with possible reduction efforts.

In this study, a sustainable water-food-energy plan has been developed to conduct an optimal framework into a multiple water-reservoir system for confronting regional natural and artificial damages such as water deficit, food crisis and electric insufficient contemporarily. A simulation-optimization approach has been proposed to handle multiple uncertainties due to climatic and socioeconomic changes. The proposed approach has advantages of reflecting the climatic change in a lumped and conceptual way; meanwhile, it is effective to deal with socioeconomic uncertainties regarded as probability and possibility distributions, reducing the risk of decision-making with Green criterions. The developed water-food-energy plan with simulation-optimization approach can be applied to a real case study of Jing River, China. The obtained results of water-food-energy shortage, optimal water allocation-food production-energy generation, flood control, and system benefit under various policy-scenarios can be identify comprehensive water-food-energy alternatives in a multi-reservoir optimization system. Meanwhile, the results associated with credibility confidence, risk-averse attitude parameter and robustness coefficient can support the generation of a water-food-energy plan with a robust manner.

Given that climate change is largely caused by humans, and in part by the built environments they create, a logical response may be to consider how buildings can address the drivers of climate change while simultaneously adapting to it. The built environment must move towards being able to sequester carbon and transform greenhouse gases in order to mitigate the causes of climate change where possible. This is alongside more traditional responses to climate change such as improving energy efficiency, reducing the use of fossil fuels to build and maintain urban environments, and designing cities to become more adaptable to future change. This chapter explores how the rapidly expanding field of biomimicry, where living organisms and traits of ecosystems are emulated in design, could make contributions to the evolution of built environments that are able to both sequester and transform carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases by careful selection and use of specific materials. A number of examples of different biomimetic materials that are able to improve energy efficiencies, generate renewable energy, or sequester carbon are discussed, along with an ecosystem biomimetic method for materials selection based on understanding and mimicking ecosystem services (i.e., what ecosystems actually do). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

The Combined Regenerative Organic food Production ® project of the German Aerospace Center aims for recycling human metabolic waste products to produce useful resources. A biofiltration process based on natural communities of microorganisms has been developed and tested. The processed aqueous solution is, among others, rich in nitrogen present as nitrate. Nitrate is one of the main nutrients required for plant cultivation, resulting in strong synergies between the developed recycling process and plant cultivation. The latter is envisaged as the basis of future bio-regenerative life support systems, because plants do consume carbon dioxide, water and nutrients in order to produce oxygen, water, food and inedible biomass. This paper describes a series of plant cultivation experiments performed with synthetic urine processed in a bioreactor. The aim of the experiments was to investigate the feasibility of growing tomato plants with this solution. The results of the experiments show that such cultivation of tomato plants is generally feasible, but that the plants are less productive. The fruit fresh weight per plant is less compared to plants grown with the half-strength Hoagland reference solution. This lack in production is caused by imbalances of sodium, chloride, potassium, magnesium and ammonium in the solution gained from recycling the synthetic urine. An attempt on adjusting the produced bioreactor solution with additional mineral fertilizers did not show a significant improvement in crop yield. © 2019 The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR)","Bio-regenerative life support; Controlled environment agriculture; Nutrient solution; Space greenhouse; Urine","ammonia; carbon dioxide; magnesium; mineral; oxygen; potassium; sodium chloride; water; biomimetic material; aqueous solution; Article; biofiltration; biomass; feasibility study; fresh weight; harvest; microbial community; microclimate; nonhuman; nutrient solution; plant growth; priority journal; recycling; tomato; urine; chemistry; drug effect; growth, development and aging; human; microclimate; pharmacology; plant development; procedures; space flight; tomato; urine; waste management; Biomimetic Materials; Ecological Systems, Closed; Humans; Lycopersicon esculentum; Nutrients; Plant Development; Space Flight; Urine; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059941553

Here, we focused on a dominant species in Inner-Mongolia typical temperate steppe, Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvei, to examine the responses of plant functional traits to experimentally imposed extreme drought at three sites along an aridity gradient. When comparing the driest (high aridity) to the wettest sites (low aridity), plant height, leaf dry matter content and δ 13 C (water use efficiency) were increased at the intermediate and low aridity sites, whereas specific leaf area and leaf nitrogen content were reduced at the high-aridity site. When extreme drought (~ 66% reduction in the growing season precipitation) was experimentally imposed at all sites, plant height decreased and δ 13 C of L. chinensis increased at the intermediate and low aridity sites. The extreme drought of 66% precipitation reduction also increased leaf dry matter content in high- and low-aridity sites. Compared to the control (ambient precipitation), extreme drought increased the strength of the positive association between plant height and δ 13 C, as well as the negative associations of specific leaf area with plant height and leaf dry matter content. Thus, extreme drought altered key functional traits of the dominant grass of Inner Mongolia steppe, particularly at the low-aridity site where the drought decreased plant size and increased water use efficiency and affected relationships between these traits. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate extremes; Leaf nitrogen content; Precipitation gradient; Specific leaf area; Typical steppe","aridity; drought; dry matter; grass; growing season; leaf area; precipitation (climatology); steppe; water use efficiency; China; Nei Monggol; Leymus chinensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055317082

The government is committed internationally to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions as part of its Nationally Determined Contributions. However, unearthing the dynamics of renewable and sustainable energy in Indonesia requires a detailed stakeholder analysis of all relevant and major actors. This paper aims to provide a stakeholder analysis of actors in the renewable and sustainable energy sector in Indonesia as a whole, using a Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal and Environmental (PESTLE) analysis methodology. The results have indicated that existing policies are not yet perfect, given that the renewable energy industry is still quite minimal, especially in the current conditions of falling oil prices.

Promoting energy conservation and carbon abatement in a multiproduct pipeline is imperative to the entire petroleum industry in China to move toward sustainable and cleaner production. This paper studies the promotion of technical progress on the operation of a multiproduct pipeline under policy control in terms of economic, energy-saving and carbon abatement potential (EECP) from a long-term perspective, which fills a gap in the reference literature. A complete bottom-up framework for detailed calculations of energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions for four categories of energy-saving technical measures is proposed, including pipeline scheduling, transmix treatment, pressure loss control and a leak detection system. Three scenarios are applied to forecast the regional demand of the pipeline in response to different low-carbon policy contexts, and a stepwise multiple linear regression is used to realize the forecast of prices of oil products under the regulation of government. To demonstrate the proposed method, a real multiproduct pipeline in the Zhejiang Province, China is used as an example. The results show that two-thirds of selected technical measures are economically feasible. The forecasted EECP of the studied multiproduct pipeline is rather significant, with the NPV, energy-saving potential and carbon-abatement potential being 198.32 million CNY, 60.25% and 49.57% from 2016 to 2050, respectively. The proposed method is not case-specific and can be used for any multiproduct pipeline in China. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon abatement; CO2 emission; Energy saving; Multiproduct pipeline; Potential forecast","Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Gasoline; Global warming; Leak detection; Linear regression; Petroleum industry; Pipelines; Pollution control; Risk management; Carbon abatement; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 emissions; Energy saving potential; Leak detection systems; Long-term perspective; Multiproduct pipeline; Stepwise multiple linear regression; Energy conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059306837

Prior to this update, PRELIM provided results for energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from petroleum refineries with a level of detail suitable for most LCA studies in support of policy decisions. We updated the model to add criteria air pollutants, hazardous air pollutants, releases to water, releases to land, and managed wastes reflecting 2014 reported releases and waste management practices using data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, National Emissions Inventory, Discharge Monitoring Reports, and Toxic Release Inventory together with process unit capacities and fuel consumption data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (U.S. EIA). The variability of refinery subprocess release factors is characterized using log-normal distributions with parameters set based on the distribution of release factors across facilities. The U.S. EPA Tool for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and Environmental Impacts life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method is used together with the updated inventory data to provide impact potentials in the PRELIM dashboard interface. Release inventories at the subprocess level enable greater responsiveness to variable selection within PRELIM, such as refinery configuration, and allocation to specific refinery products. The updated version also provides a template to allow users to import PRELIM inventory results into the openLCA software tool as unit process data sets. Here we document and validate the model updates. Impact potentials from the national crude mix in 2014 are compared to impacts from the 2005 mix to demonstrate the impact of assay and configuration on the refining sector over time. The expanded version of PRELIM offers users a reliable, transparent, and streamlined tool for estimating the effect of changes in petroleum refineries on LCIA results in the context of policy analysis.

Changes of soil respiration with the climate warming are essential for the carbon cycling between the terrestrial ecosystem and the atmosphere. The aim of this study was to investigate the temperature adaptability of soil respiration and the possible mechanisms. Materials and methods: Experiments with a meadow soil were conducted through pre-incubation for 3 days at 22 °C, then incubation under temperatures of 22 ± 1, 30 ± 1, and 38 ± 1 °C, respectively, for 35 days. For the different incubation temperatures, gas samples were collected on days 3, 9, 13, 16, 20, 23, 30, and 35, respectively. The gas samples were used for measurements of CO 2 concentrations and calculation of soil respiration rates. The temperature sensibility of soil respiration was characterized with the index Q 10 (i.e., the increasing multiple of respiration rate with temperature increase of 10 °C). Soil properties related to respiration rates were measured, including total carbon (TC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), soil organic matter (SOM), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), enzyme activities, and microbial community structure. Results and discussion: After 35 days of incubation, the temperature sensibility of soil respiration decreased with the incubation temperatures, i.e., Q 10 (22 °C) &gt; Q 10 (30 °C) &gt; Q 10 (38 °C). The result showed that soil respiration exhibited temperature adaptability. The TC and SOM contents were not significantly different among the different temperatures, indicating sufficient substrate availability during the short incubation period. The warming scenarios led to lower activities of enzymes relative to C and N cycles and MBC and significantly changed the microbial community, especially decreased abundance of gram-negative bacteria. The elevated temperatures also reduced the comparability of bacteria and fungi and increased the diversity of microbial community structure. Conclusions: Mechanisms of the temperature adaptability of soil respiration included reduction of the carbon-use efficiency and temperature adaptation of microorganisms. Among them, the microbial adaptation was the dominant mechanism for the temperature adaptability of soil respiration during the short-term incubation experiments. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Microbial community; Soil respiration; Temperature adaptability; Temperature sensitivity","abundance; biomass; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; community structure; concentration (composition); dissolved organic carbon; enzyme activity; experiment; meadow; microbial community; soil organic matter; soil respiration; temperature; terrestrial ecosystem; total organic carbon; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Negibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049203300

Earlier studies tended to demonstrate a single variable, such as the role of R & D of low-carbon technologies in improving the output of regional low-carbon innovation systems, ignoring the impacts that interactions among variables may have on systems. Different from the existing literature, we rigorously identify multiple state variables that make up a regional low-carbon innovation system and establish a Logistics equation that describes the relationships among variables. Large quantities of data and simulations are used to make the order parameters, the nonlinear forms and evolution principles of different variables explicit. Our research confirms the impact of changes in government support on regional low-carbon innovation systems, clarifies the evolutionary trends of different state variables and their correlation with each other, and identifies the shortcomings in the evolution of regional low-carbon innovation systems. The results of this study provide the basis for managers to make more targeted policies to promote the evolution of regional low-carbon innovation systems. And the proposed interdisciplinary research framework is also applicable to other fields such as strategic alliances and complex networks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Evolution; Government support; Low-carbon technology application; Low-carbon technology R&D; Low-carbon waste disposal; Regional low-carbon innovation system","Big data; Complex networks; Planning; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Waste disposal; Evolution; Government supports; Innovation system; Low carbon; Low-carbon technologies; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056805730

An apparent improvement in air quality was observed in Beijing and its adjacent region during the winter of 2017/2018. However, caution should be taken in directly attributing this improvement to air control actions without taking the effects of climate variability into account. Here, we develop a statistical prediction model that can successfully predict the variability of wintertime PM2.5 concentrations observed over these regions. Our analysis indicates that the remarkable decrease in PM2.5 concentrations over the North China Plain (NCP) observed during the winter of 2017/2018 can be largely explained by changes in meteorological conditions. To clarify which climate factors control the inter-annual variability of wintertime PM2.5 pollution over the NCP, we further reconstructed a 30-year time series of wintertime PM2.5 levels over the NCP over the period of 1988–2017 using our statistical model. Through our analysis, we found that the combined Arctic-tropical climate effects related to the ENSO and Arctic warming controlled the inter-annual variability of wintertime PM2.5 over the NCP. Specifically, the rapid warming of the Barents-Kara Sea region enhances the Siberian High and thus plays an important role in improving the air quality over the NCP during the 2017/2018 wintertime. These results help us understand the role of climate variability in modulating air quality, especially its contributions to the winter of 2017/2018. These results may assist in the evaluation of current air control actions and the revision of relevant policy for the future, which are urgently needed for China. © 2018 Elsevier LtdArctic and tropical climate factors exert joint effects on the inter-annual variability of wintertime PM2.5 over the North China Plain. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Arctic warming; Inter-annual variability; North China Plain; PM2.5","Air quality; Climatology; Pollution control; Predictive analytics; Tropics; Arctic warming; Atmospheric pollutants; Interannual variability; Meteorological condition; North China Plain; PM2.5; Statistical modeling; Statistical prediction model; Climate models; annual variation; arctic environment; atmospheric modeling; climate change; climate effect; concentration (composition); particulate matter; tropical environment; winter; air quality; Arctic; article; China; climate change; meteorology; prediction; time series analysis; tropic climate; warming; winter; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; China; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; procedures; season; tropic climate; China; North China Plain; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Meteorology; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059323229

A regional chemical transport model, CMAQ-newHg-Br (Ye et al., 2018), was employed driven by four sets of meteorological fields (2004, 2005, 2007, and 2010) and two anthropogenic emission inventories (NEI, 2005 and 2011). Four major findings emerged from this study. First, simulated Hg wet deposition flux in NYS was greatly affected by variation in meteorological conditions, ranging from a 91% decrease to a factor of 5 increase in monthly Hg wet deposition, whereas it hardly responded (2%) to a near doubling of emissions in the northeastern U.S. Second, the precipitation amount dominated interannual and seasonal variations of Hg wet deposition over all other meteorological variables, with total (= convective + non-convective) precipitation explained 60% of Hg wet deposition variance in an urban environment compared to convective precipitation alone explaining 65% in a rural area. Third, large-scale atmospheric circulation influenced regional transport greatly leading to out-of-state anthropogenic emissions explaining at least 80% of Hg wet deposition changes in a NYS urban environment. Fourth, higher Hg concentrations in precipitation and higher atmospheric reactive mercury concentrations in urban areas were related to calm conditions due likely to regional build-up of emissions, whereas in rural areas photochemical oxidation of gaseous elemental mercury was a more important source of reactive mercury. Solar radiation variance was found to explain 41–55% of the variance in simulated reactive mercury concentrations. Given that more than 95% of the US is rural lands and the majority of water bodies occur in rural areas, a realistic chemical mechanism for photochemical gaseous elemental mercury oxidation is paramount to accurate simulation of reactive mercury formation and Hg wet deposition in the US. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric circulation; CMAQ; Convective precipitation; GEM oxidation; Hg wet deposition; Meteorology; Precipitation; Solar radiation","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Climatology; Emission control; Meteorology; Oxidation; Precipitation (chemical); Precipitation (meteorology); Rural areas; Solar radiation; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric circulation; CMAQ; Convective precipitation; Wet deposition; Deposition; mercury; annual variation; anthropogenic source; atmospheric circulation; emission inventory; mercury (element); meteorology; modeling; precipitation (climatology); rural area; seasonal variation; solar radiation; urban area; wet deposition; aerosol; air pollution; anthropogenic emission; Article; atmosphere; atmospheric transport; comparative study; concentration (parameters); controlled study; meteorology; photooxidation; precipitation; priority journal; rural area; seasonal variation; solar radiation; urban area; wet deposition; wind speed; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056208587

Precipitation regime, including the variation of precipitation intensity and frequency, also drives community structure and functions in such areas. However, few studies have focused on the combined effect of sand burial and changed precipitation regime on community function, specifically its role in carbon storage. A 2-yr field experiment with factorial treatments of precipitation (control, slight enhancement and strong enhancement) and sand addition (control and 5 cm sand addition) was conducted to test the responses of plant and soil carbon content in a semi-arid typical steppe in N China. Results showed that sand burial had no significant effect on plant carbon density, but significantly changed the allocation of plant carbon from aboveground to belowground; these responses differed among species and life forms in the community. Precipitation enhancement had no significant effects on plant carbon and its allocation, perhaps because effects of precipitation on plants are due more to precipitation frequency than to precipitation intensity per event. Sand burial and precipitation enhancement decreased soil carbon, especially soil organic carbon, and promoted soil carbon to be distributed deeper down the soil profile. These findings will help to understand how sand deposition affects plant and soil carbon storage and their allocation in plant communities under a changing precipitation regime, and more generally, to understand carbon storage dynamics in early-successional sandy ecosystems in the context of global change. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon allocation; Community function; Life-form; Precipitation; Sand burial; Steppe","Precipitation (chemical); Sand; Soils; Carbon allocation; Community function; Life form; Sand burials; Steppe; Organic carbon; carbon; organic carbon; carbon; rain; biomass allocation; experimental study; plant community; precipitation (climatology); sand; semiarid region; soil carbon; steppe; Article; carbon allocation; carbon storage; China; community structure; controlled study; ecosystem; enzyme activity; germination; global change; nutrient availability; plant community; plant growth; plant root; precipitation; priority journal; sand; semiarid climate; steppe; carbon sequestration; chemistry; microbiology; plant development; soil; China; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; China; Ecosystem; Plant Development; Rain; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055114448

The Continental US is divided into eight different climate divisions to investigate different mechanisms associated with heat waves. At the large scale, heat waves are associated with terrestrial warm air advection to the Northeast, Midwest and Northern Great Plains, and with oceanic warm air advection for the Southeast and Southern Great Plains. Over the western US, reduced maritime cool air advection results in local warming. At the local scale, antecedent precipitation deficits lead to the continuous drying of soil, more net radiative energy is partitioned into sensible heat flux and acts to warm surface air temperature, especially over the Great Plains. NARCCAP-simulated large-scale meteorological patterns and temporal evolution of antecedent local scale terrestrial conditions are shown to be very similar to those of the reanalysis products. Even though extreme temperature is overestimated by the NARCCAP ensemble over the US, different heat wave metrics are realistically represented both in terms of the inter-annual variability and spatial representation. However, NARCCAP overestimates the magnitude of heatwaves over the Northeast, Midwest and Northern Great Plains, partially due to anomalous heat advection through large-scale forcing. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,"advection; air temperature; climate modeling; ensemble forecasting; heat wave; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; sensible heat flux; Great Plains; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053262788

Reductions in BC emissions have attracted attention as a possible means to moderate near-term temperature changes. For the first time, we evaluate regional climate responses, nonlinearity, and short-term transient responses to BC emission perturbations in the Arctic, midlatitudes, and globally based on a comprehensive set of emission-driven experiments using the Community Earth System Model (CESM). Surface temperature responses to BC emissions are complex, with surface warming over land from midlatitude BC perturbations partially offset by ocean cooling. Climate responses do not scale linearly with emissions. While stronger BC emission perturbations have a higher burden efficiency, their temperature sensitivity is lower. BC impacts temperature much faster than greenhouse gas forcing, with transient temperature responses in the Arctic and midlatitudes approaching a quasi-equilibrium state with a timescale of 2-3 years. We find large variability in BC-induced climate changes due to background model noise. As a result, removing present-day BC emissions results in discernible surface temperature changes for only limited regions of the globe. In order to better understand the climatic impacts of BC emissions, both the drivers of nonlinear responses and response variability need to be assessed across climate models. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

Yet policies remain elusive in part because of conflictual empirical findings and insufficient attention to China's complex spatial terrain. This paper conducts a spatial analysis of China's CO2 intensity (CEI) based on six major drivers, and shows that region-targetted strategies may be more effective in tackling CEI. Specifically, results from spatial autoregressive models indicate that drivers vary significantly across regions: changing the energy production mix through alternative sources of energy is likely to have a stronger effect on the Northwest and Middle Yangtze River but it is less effective for the South and East Coasts. Changes in population, urbanization, industrial structure and technology are more likely to lead to CEI reduction for South and East Coasts. Moreover at the regional level, spatial effects are more indirect and widespread spilling over to neighboring regions for the Middle Yellow River and Northeast. But they are more direct and contained affecting residents within the region for the Middle Yangtze River, South, North and East Coasts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide intensity; Direct effect; Indirect effect; Spatial autoregressive models; Spatial dependence","Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Rivers; Alternative sources of energy; Auto regressive models; Carbon dioxide emissions; Direct effect; Empirical findings; Indirect effects; Industrial structures; Spatial dependence; Spatial variables measurement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059315300

The resulting hybrid LCA is not necessarily but probably a closer approximation to an ideally complete process model with a global all-inclusive system boundary. Here, we discuss whether such a complete process model is a goal worth pursuing and whether system boundary is the main limitation of process-based LCA. Methods: We argue that the results of the ideally complete process model, with every single economic activity on earth embodied within, have little to limited implications and relevance for the decisions which LCA seeks to support and which involve changes aimed at reducing environmental impacts through altering product systems or promoting alternatives. The main limitations of process-based LCA, as a supply chain based linear model, lie not in the “incomplete” system boundary but in the narrow focus on supply chain and the unrealistic assumptions, such as omission of price effects and constraints. These assumptions reflect poorly how the economy works. Hybrid LCA, through adding IO models, which are also supply chain and linearity based, doubles down on both the narrow focus on supply chain and the unrealistic assumptions, and thus is a step forward but in the wrong direction. Results and discussion: Reflecting on advances in corn ethanol research, we show that pursuing a more complete system boundary by, for instance, covering Chinese stuffed animal production does not make the LCA results more accurate or relevant for determining if corn ethanol in the US should be promoted. Not only is the theoretical argument for including Chinese stuffed animal industry tenuous, but there is no evidence it has been affected by US corn ethanol expansion. And by worrying about processes far away up the supply chain could distract us from focusing on the actual market mechanisms, such as indirect land use change, that are more likely to occur and are essential to predicting whether promoting corn ethanol would reduce total carbon emissions. Conclusions: We suggest future studies shifting focus from “completing” system boundary within the conventional supply chain and linear framework towards more realistic modeling of our complicated human-environment system. Instead of trying to always include everything, we argue for a flexible and market-based system boundary tailored to the decision in question, particularly considering the scale of potential changes it may cause and how it may affect the economy. A change at larger scales is likely to have a broader impact, thus justifying the definition of a broader system boundary.

The novel process is integrated with coke oven gas and dry/steam-mixed methane reforming technologies to enhance resource and energy efficiencies as well as reduce CO 2 emission. On the basis of the rigorous steady-state simulation of the process, the key operational parameters of the proposed process are investigated and optimized. A detailed technoeconomic analysis is conducted to manifest the advantages of the proposed process by comparison with a conventional process. The results show that the optimal feed ratio of coke oven gas to coal is 0.68, and the split ratio of CH 4 for steam methane reforming reaction is suggested to be 0.74. Compared with the conventional coal to ethylene glycol process, the direct CO 2 emission of the proposed process is significantly reduced by 94.05%, and the carbon utilization efficiency and exergy efficiency are greatly increased by 36.4% and 15.17%. Moreover, the proposed process has a better economic performance and stronger competitiveness since it can save the production cost by 9.72% and improve the internal rate of return by 6.92%. Thus, the proposed process provides a promising way to efficient utilization of CO 2 and improve the technoeconomic performance of coal to ethylene glycol industry. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","Cleaner production; CO 2 utilization; Coal to ethylene glycol; Coke oven gas; Technoeconomic analysis","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal industry; Coke; Coke ovens; Conceptual design; Costs; Earnings; Energy efficiency; Ethylene; Industrial ovens; Methane; Pollution control; Polyols; Steam reforming; Cleaner production; Coke oven gas; Internal rate of return; Operational parameters; Simultaneous reduction; Steady-state simulations; Techno-Economic analysis; Technoeconomic performance; Ethylene glycol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061087184

In this study, air samples were collected from various treatment facilities of a typical WWTP. Community compositions of airborne bacteria were identified by high-throughput sequencing technique. SourceTracker was used to determine the percentages of airborne bacteria from wastewater, sludge, ambient air, and other environment. Health risks associated with airborne bacteria were estimated based on the average daily dose rates (ADD) of exposure by inhalation and skin contact. Concentrations of airborne bacteria varied in a wide range of 23–4878 CFU/m3. The main emission sources of airborne bacteria were treatment facilities with aeration, mechanical agitation, and located indoors. For treatment facilities located indoors, higher percentages of airborne bacteria were associated with wastewater and sludge, while more airborne bacteria were originated from the ambient air for outdoor installations. Opportunistic pathogens such as Micrococcus, Bacteroides, Chryseobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter, were detected in airborne bacteria. Inhalation was the main pathway for on-site workers exposure to airborne bacteria. Due to the presence of opportunistic pathogens, strict control measures should be employed in WWTPs to reduce the infection risks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Airborne bacteria; Health risk assessment; Microbial population; Opportunistic pathogens; Wastewater treatment plant","Bacteria; Health; Health risks; Reclamation; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sewage pumping plants; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Airborne bacteria; Chryseobacterium; Community composition; Emission characterization; High-throughput sequencing; Mechanical agitation; Microbial populations; Wastewater treatment plants; Sewage treatment plants; bacterium; community composition; concentration (composition); emission; health risk; microbial community; occupational exposure; pathogen; pollution exposure; risk assessment; wastewater treatment plant; Acinetobacter; aeration; agitation; air sampling; airborne bacterium; ambient air; article; Bacteroides; Chryseobacterium; controlled study; health hazard; high throughput sequencing; human; infection risk; infectious agent; Micrococcus; nonhuman; Pseudomonas; risk assessment; skin; sludge; worker; bacterium; microbiology; risk assessment; sewage; waste water; Acinetobacter; Bacteroides; Chryseobacterium; Micrococcus; Pseudomonas; Air Microbiology; Bacteria; Humans; Risk Assessment; Sewage; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057560895

Our results showed that particle mass and number emissions increased markedly during accelerations. For three of the four vehicles tested, particulate matter (PM) mass and particle number emissions were markedly higher during cold-start and the first few accelerations following the cold-start period than during the hot running and hot-start segments of the LA92 cycle. For one vehicle (which had the highest emissions overall) the hot-start and cold-start PM emissions were similar. Black carbon emissions were also much higher during the cold-start conditions, indicating severe fuel wetting leading to slow evaporation and pool burning, and subsequent soot formation. Particle number concentrations and black carbon emissions showed large reductions during the urban and hot-start phases of the test cycle. The oxidative potential of PM was quantified with both a chemical and a biological assay, and the gene expression impacts of the PM in a macrophage model with PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) analyses. Inter- and intra-vehicle variability in oxidative potential per milligram of PM emitted was relatively low for both oxidative assays, suggesting that real-world emissions and exposure can be estimated with distance-normalized emission factors. The PCR response from signaling markers for oxidative stress (e.g., NOX1) was greater than from inflammatory, AhR (aryl hydrocarbon receptor), or MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling. Protein production associated with inflammation (tumor necrosis factor alpha-TNFα) and oxidative stress (HMOX-1) were quantified and displayed relatively high inter-vehicle variability, suggesting that these pathways may be activated by different PM components. Correlation of trace metal concentrations and oxidative potential suggests a role for small, insoluble particles in inducing oxidative stress. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Gasoline direct injection; Oxidative stress; Particle number; PM emissions; Toxicity","Bioassay; Carbon; Direct injection; Enzymes; Gasoline; Gene expression; Macrophages; Oxidative stress; Particles (particulate matter); Polymerase chain reaction; Toxicity; Trace analysis; Trace elements; Vehicles; Wetting; Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; Gasoline direct injection; Mitogen activated protein kinase; Particle number concentration; Particle numbers; PM emissions; Trace metal concentration; Tumor necrosis factor alpha; Particulate emissions; aluminum; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; black carbon; calcium; cerium; chromium; cobalt; copper; heme oxygenase 1; iron; lanthanum; manganese; mitogen activated protein kinase; molybdenum; neodymium; nickel; palladium; phosphorus; platinum; potassium; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 1; rhodium; sodium; sulfur; tin; titanium; tumor necrosis factor; unindexed drug; vanadium; zinc; gasoline; acceleration; black carbon; fuel consumption; oxidative stress; particulate matter; physicochemical property; polymerase chain reaction; toxicology; traffic emission; Article; controlled study; cytotoxicity; ecotoxicity; evaporation; exhaust gas; gene expression; macrophage; motor vehicle; oxidative stress; particle size; particulate matter; physical chemistry; priority journal; protein synthesis; signal transduction; soot; air pollutant; analysis; chemistry; exhaust gas; particulate matter; statistics and numerical data; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Gasoline; Motor Vehicles; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053217320

In this study, we first analyzed the meteorological and emission factors that caused a considerable increase in the PM2.5 concentration in December 2016. This severe pollution episode was found to be related with unfavorable meteorological conditions and increased residential emissions. The WRF-Chem simulations were used to calculate the residential contribution to PM2.5 through a hybrid source apportionment method. From the validation that used grid data and in situ observations in terms of meteorological elements, PM2.5 and its compounds, the simulated results indicated that the residential sector was the largest single contributor to the PM2.5 concentration (60.2%), because of its predominant contributions to black carbon (BC, 62.1%) and primary organic aerosol (POA, 86.5%), with these two primary components accounting for 70.7% of the PM2.5 mass. Compared with the remote background (RB) region covering the central part of the Tibetan Plateau, the residential sector contributed 11.3% more to PM2.5 in the highly populated mega-city (HM) region, including the Sichuan and Guanzhong Basins, due to greater contribution to the concentrations of primary PM2.5 components. As the main emission source of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and secondary organic aerosol (SOA), the industrial sector was the second largest contributor to the PM2.5 concentration in the HM region. However, in the RB region, the dominating emissions of NOx, SOA, and BC were from the transport sector; thus, it was the next largest contributor to total PM2.5. An evaluation of the emission control experiment suggested that mitigation strategies that reduce emissions from residential sources can effectively reduce the PM2.5 concentration during heavy pollution periods. The residential sector contributed the most to PM2.5 during a severe pollution episode in western China, because of their predominant contribution to primary PM2.5 components. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Control strategies; PM2.5; Residential emissions; Severe pollution; Unfavorable weather","Aerosols; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Aerodynamic diameters; Atmospheric fine particles; Control strategies; Meteorological condition; Meteorological elements; PM2.5; Residential emissions; Secondary organic aerosols; Housing; black carbon; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; aerosol; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission; nanoparticle; particulate matter; pollutant source; winter; aerosol; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; atmospheric deposition; China; concentration (parameters); controlled study; human; meteorological phenomena; particle size; residential area; simulation; urban area; winter; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; environmental monitoring; housing; particulate matter; procedures; season; weather; China; Guanzhong Plain; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Shaanxi; Sichuan Basin; Poa; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Housing; Nitrogen Oxides; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Sulfur Dioxide; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057196849

With high production capacities, the iron and steel industry (ISI) has long been a key source of air pollutants in BTH and is thus considered responsible for the degradation of local air quality. Here, we conducted a cross-disciplinary research combining the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF/Chem) model, the multiregional input-output model (MRIO) and the health assessment model to explore the impacts of the ISI on air pollution in the BTH region in January 2012. Our results show large increases in air pollution due to direct ISI emissions, with up to a 90 μg/m3 monthly average of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in eastern Tangshan and western Handan. In addition to direct emissions, the ISI has induced large quantities of indirect emissions from upstream sectors (e.g., the electricity and transportation sectors), leading to PM2.5, SO2 and NOx increases of 2–10 μg/m3 in BTH. Considering the direct and indirect emissions, we estimated that 275 (233–313) PM2.5-related mortalities occurred in January, and approximately 42% of these premature deaths occurred in Tangshan. A high rate of premature deaths also occurred in urban Beijing due to its high population density. Revealing the great health burden caused by the ISI, our results underscore the necessity for the Chinese government to reduce air pollutant emissions from the ISI and its upstream industries in BTH. © 2018 Elsevier LtdOur study estimated the air pollutant increases and premature deaths caused by the iron and steel industry and their upstream industries during the winter in BTH region. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; BTH; Health burden; Iron and steel industry; Upstream industries","Air pollution; Air quality; Health; Population statistics; Steelmaking; Sulfur dioxide; Weather forecasting; Air pollutant emission; Cross-disciplinary research; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); High population density; Local air pollutions; Transportation sector; Upstream industry; Weather research and forecasting; Iron and steel industry; iron; steel; sulfur dioxide; iron; steel; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; haze; input-output analysis; interdisciplinary approach; iron and steel industry; pollutant source; winter; air pollution; Article; China; controlled study; electricity; health hazard; human; iron and steel industry; mortality; particulate matter; population density; traffic and transport; urban area; winter; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; city; metallurgy; season; weather; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Cities; Humans; Iron; Metallurgy; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Steel; Sulfur Dioxide; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059305168

Compared to developing next-generation high-capacity non-carbonaceous anode materials, improvement on current carbonaceous materials could lead to instant commercial values due to less process modifications to the battery manufacturing. Here, we report a facile approach to synthesize carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with controlled assemblies: well-dispersed CNTs vs. bundled CNTs. Furthermore, we incorporated these CNTs onto three-dimensional (3D) graphite foams as free-standing anodes for LIBs. This hierarchical 3D network provided high surface area and ultra-high conductivity with enhanced battery capacity. With controlled growth conditions, the assembly of CNTs can be changed from bundled state to dispersed state, resulting in a significant improvement in electrochemical performance. The dispersed CNTs showed a higher specific capacity of above 800 mAhg−1 over 120 cycles, while CNT bundles exhibited a specific capacity of 500 mAhg−1.

In order to estimate contributions of biogenic and biomass burning organic aerosols to atmospheric particles, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) samples were collected simultaneously at an urban and a rural site in the North China Plain (NCP), a region with extensive anthropogenic emissions, during summer 2014. Saccharides, including anhydrosugars, monosaccharides, and sugar alcohols, were quantified. Profiles of saccharides in PM2.5 collected at urban and rural sites during the daytime and nighttime, nearby biomass burning, and without significant influence of biomass burning were investigated and compared. Contributions of biomass burning, biogenic aerosol associated with primary biological aerosol particles, and isoprene-derived secondary organic carbon (SOC) to total organic carbon were then estimated based on source-specific saccharide tracers. The results showed that concentrations of nearly all saccharides were higher at the rural site than at the urban site. Levoglucosan was the most abundant saccharide, followed by glycerol and glucose. Mass concentrations of source specific tracers and associated source contribution estimates indicated that the absolute and relative contributions of biomass burning were both much higher compared to fungal spore derived OC and isoprene SOC, with greater contributions observed at the rural site especially during nighttime. Our findings reveal that biogenic and biomass burning sources are non-negligible summertime contributors to atmospheric PM2.5 OC mass both at the rural site (up to 50%) and at the urban site (~20%) in the NCP. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biogenic; Biomass burning; North China plain; Rural/urban; Saccharide; Secondary organic aerosol","Atmospheric aerosols; Biocatalysts; Biomass; Climate change; Glucose; Isoprene; Organic carbon; Particulate emissions; Urban growth; Biogenic; Biomass-burning; North China Plain; Saccharide; Secondary organic aerosols; Particles (particulate matter); anhydrosugar; carbohydrate; carbohydrate derivative; glucose; glycerol; isoprene; levoglucosan; monosaccharide; organic carbon; secondary organic carbon; sugar alcohol; unclassified drug; aerosol; biogenic emission; biomass burning; concentration (composition); particulate matter; rural area; seasonal variation; urban area; aerosol; Article; atmospheric fine particulate matter; biogenic aerosol; biomass burning aerosol; concentration (parameters); priority journal; quantitative analysis; rural area; suspended particulate matter; urban area; China; North China Plain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054430215

Emission regulations for diesel exhaust intended to reduce EC concentrations have been strengthened in recent years. To investigate regulation effects in Japan, daily EC concentrations in the megacity of Nagoya, central Japan, were measured during April 2003–March 2016. The EC concentrations showed a decreasing trend with changing seasonal variation: high concentrations were found in autumn and winter before 2011, but no seasonal variation was discernible after 2012. Strong correlation was found for annual vehicular EC emissions and annual mean EC concentrations during 2003–2009. However, the relation after 2010 was weaker in spring and summer. Based on the relation of EC with trace element (Pb, V, Sb, etc.) concentrations and the backward air trajectories on high concentration days, EC sources other than vehicles were found to be related to long-range transport of air pollution from China in spring and combustion of heavy oil, including ship engine exhaust, in summer. © 2018 The Authors","Elemental carbon; PM2.5; Source apportionment; Urban air pollution","Air pollution; Crude oil; Global warming; Heavy oil production; Petroleum transportation; Trace elements; Atmospheric concentration; Elemental carbon; Elemental carbon concentration; Emission regulation; Long range transport; PM2.5; Source apportionment; Urban air pollution; Carbon; antimony; arsenic; carbon; copper; lead; manganese; selenium; trace element; vanadium; zinc; atmospheric pollution; carbon; chemical element; concentration (composition); exhaust emission; global warming; health impact; long range transport; megacity; particulate matter; pollutant source; regulatory approach; seasonal variation; source apportionment; trend analysis; urban pollution; aerosol; Article; atmospheric deposition; autumn; car; carbon footprint; combustion; concentration (parameters); exhaust gas; Japan; particulate matter; priority journal; seasonal variation; spring; summer; urban area; wind speed; winter; Aichi; Chubu; Honshu; Japan; Nagoya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056788821

However, it is difficult to provide certain conditions for structure formation. For this purpose, it is possible to create space-limited environment for coagulation of submicroscopic crystals. Generally, this effect is caused by addition of high-dispersed components, usually carbon nanotubes, graphens and etc. are used. The results show that the more effective way is to use the combination of ultra- and nanofine additives and in this case nanofine additives should have specific chemical relation to the binder. Fume silica, surfactants (""Ethacryl HF"", ""DC-5"" including multiwall carbon nanotubes) were used for modification of building materials. In order to replace multiwall carbon nanotubes water suspension of furnace black (trade mark Palizh, Izhevsk) was added into cement matrix. When the ultrafine additive (silica fume) combines to nanofine components there is great increase of material performances. 0.5% ""Ethacryl HF"" and ""DC-5"" with 3% silica fume allow achieving compressive strength to 79.2 % and flexural strength to 94,6% accordingly (compare to test sample). To establish effect from additives and its generality gypsum binder was used. Additionally, the dispersion degrees, mineral chemistry, nature of microfine components are found to be important for modification of building materials. Nanofine additives which have chemical relation to the binder in mineral matrix also have active surfaces and on these surfaces are formed layers of new crystals. The high surface energy of nanofines reduces re-crystallization and allows creating high density and freeing from defects matrixes. Generality of this effect which include all mineral binders is proved. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The microfiber battery showed a stable potential window of 2.5 V with an areal discharge capacity of â4.2 μA h cm -2 at 13 μA cm -2 of the current density. The as-assembled battery fiber delivered a comparable energy density (â0.006 W h cm -3 ) with solid-state lithium thin-film batteries at higher power densities (â0.0312 W cm -3 ). The fibrous batteries were also connected in parallel and in series to deliver large current and high voltage, respectively. The fibrous battery also retains up to 85% discharge capacity even after 100 charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, these battery fibers performed well under both static and bending conditions, which shows the robustness of the battery fiber.

An optimization model is used to locate electric bus chargers and to estimate the associated carbon emissions, using a life cycle perspective and various implementation scenarios. Emissions associated with fuels and batteries of electric powertrains are considered to be the two main factors affecting carbon emissions. The results show that, although higher battery capacities could help electrify more routes of the city's bus network, this does not necessarily lead to a reduction of the total emissions. The results show the lowest life cycle emissions occurring when electric buses use batteries with a capacity of 120 kWh. The fuel choices significantly influence the environmental impact of a bus network. For example, the use of electricity is a better choice than first generation biofuels from a carbon emission perspective. However, the use of second-generation biofuels, such as Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO), can directly compete with the Nordic electricity mix. Among all fuel options, certified renewable electricity has the lowest impact. The analysis also shows that electrification could be beneficial for reduction of local pollutants in the Stockholm inner city; however, the local emissions of public transport are much lower than emissions from private transport. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"Biofuels; Buses; Carbon; Electric automobiles; Electric utilities; Life cycle; Secondary batteries; Electric power trains; Life cycle emissions; Life cycle perspectives; Optimization modeling; Potential impacts; Private transport; Renewable electricity; Second generation; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056180054

It is essential to explore carbon mitigation efforts at the city level, particularly in developing countries with large quantities of energy consumption and carbon emission. This study has focused on the impacts of carbon pricing on sectoral prices and the carbon price transmission mechanism across sectors and along price-transmitted paths, taking the city of Beijing, China, as a case. A two-region social accounting matrix for China in 2012 was built, with one region being Beijing, and the other region representing the rest of China (ROC). The SAM price model and structural path analysis were employed to calculate both the extent of and the detailed price transmission of each sector in Beijing when carbon pricing was implemented just in Beijing or in the whole of China. The results show that the growth of prices is not serious and that the Electricity & Heating Production and Supply Sector in both Beijing and the ROC contributes most to the price growth in almost all sectors in Beijing. The price-transmitted paths starting from Non-metallic Mineral Products and Smelting and Pressing of Metals in ROC transmit the carbon price quickly and directly by the shortest paths. While the price-transmitted paths routed by Electricity & Heating Production and Supply Sector, Transport Service, and Other Services will show far-reaching effect. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; Carbon pricing; Price model; Price transmission; Social accounting matrix; Structural path analysis","Carbon; Costs; Developing countries; Economics; Energy utilization; Forestry; Regression analysis; Beijing; Carbon pricing; Path analysis; Price models; Price transmission; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059315037

However, urban ecosystems remain poorly understood due to their functional complexity. Further, few studies have documented the microbial processes governing the N2O emissions from urban soils. Here, a field study was performed to assess in situ N2O emissions in an urban and agricultural soil located in Xiamen, China. The mechanisms underlying the difference in N2O emission patterns in both soils were further explored in an incubation experiment. Field investigations showed that N2O emission (3.5–19.0 μg N2O-N m−2 h−1) from the urban soil was significantly lower than that from the agricultural soil (25.4–18,502.3 μg N2O-N m−2 h−1). Incubation experiments showed that the urban soil initially emitted lower denitrification-derived N2O because of the lower nirS (encoding nitrite reductases) abundances, whereas overall N2O accumulation during the incubation was mainly controlled by the initial nitrate content in soil. Nitrate addition in a short period (5 days) did not change the total bacterial and denitrifier abundances or the soil bacterial community composition, but significantly altered the relative distribution of some key genera capable of denitrification. Although the urban soil exhibited lower N2O emission than its agricultural counterpart in this study, the expanding urban green areas should be taken into account when building N2O emission reduction targets. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Denitrification; Denitrifier; Illumina sequencing; Nitrous oxide; Urbanization","Agriculture; Atmospheric chemistry; Denitrification; Emission control; Global warming; Nitrates; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Atmospheric nitrous oxide; Denitrifiers; Emission reduction targets; Functional complexity; Illumina; Nitrous oxide; Soil bacterial community; Urbanization; Soil pollution; nitrate; nitrite reductase; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; agricultural soil; bacterium; denitrification; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; relative abundance; soil emission; urbanization; agricultural land; Article; China; controlled study; denitrification; denitrifyer; denitrifying bacterium; greenhouse effect; microbial community; nitrous oxide emission; population abundance; priority journal; soil; soil analysis; soil microflora; species composition; urban area; China; Fujian; Xiamen; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054297648

The results validate the EKC assumption and show that per capita GDP is positively related to CO2 emissions; per capita natural gas consumption has a negative impact on CO2 emissions; however, per capita liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) consumption has a positive effect on CO2 emissions. Therefore, increasing natural gas consumption can effectively slow down the environmental degradation of China.

The electric power industry as the major source of carbon emissions needs to be a focus. However, the uncertainty of power systems, the risk of reducing emissions and the fuzziness of carbon capture technology popularization rate and carbon reduction targets makes previous planning methods unsatisfactory for current planning. This paper establishes an interval fuzzy programming with a risk measure model which takes carbon capture technology and carbon reduction targets into account, to ensure that the complex electric management system achieves the best developmental state. It was concluded that in order to reduce carbon emissions, wind power and hydropower would be the best choices, and coal-fired power would be the suboptimal choice, and solar power would play a complementary role. Besides, decision makers should put much more effort into promoting and improving carbon capture technology instead of simply setting emission reduction targets. The non-synchronism of the downward trend in carbon emissions per unit of electricity generation and electric power industry total carbon emissions need to be taken seriously. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon capture technology; Carbon emission reduction; Interval fuzzy programming; Renewable energy; Risk measure","Carbon capture; Climate change; Decision making; Electric industry; Electric power systems; Emission control; Fuzzy systems; Power generation; Risk assessment; Solar energy; Wind power; Carbon emission reductions; Electric power industries; Emission reduction targets; Fuzzy programming; Renewable energies; Risk measures; Technology popularizations; Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region; Electric power system planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061979829

In order to reduce CO2 emission in power industry and develop economy simultaneously, it is necessary to study how to achieve the strong decoupling relationship between CO2 emission in power industry and GDP in China. However, such studies are relatively limited so far. Thus, this paper mainly inquiries the major driving factors on the decoupling during the period of 1985–2016. First, the decoupling state in China is quantified by using the Tapio decoupling indicator. Then, this paper carries out the decomposition of the decoupling index to explore the driving factors affecting the decoupling by the logarithmic mean divisia index (LMDI) method and Kaya identity equation. Finally, energy consumption in power generation, thermal power structure, power generation structure, transmission and distribution loss, electrification, energy intensity and economic scale are explored to discuss the decoupling relationship with respect to the CO2 emission reduction. The results show that the decoupling relationship is in an alternating state between weak decoupling and expansive negative decoupling in 1985–2016. And the influences of seven factors on the decoupling relationship are of difference. Wherein, energy intensity as well as energy consumption in power generation, promotes the decoupling while both the economic scale and electrification are the two main factors that inhibit the decoupling. The other three factors have relatively weak effects. Therefore, based on the empirical results, this paper puts forward some policy suggestions to effectively promote the decoupling between China's electric CO2 emission and economic growth. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission; LMDI; Power industry; Tapio decoupling","Carbon dioxide; Electric utilities; Emission control; Energy utilization; CO2 emission reduction; CO2 emissions; LMDI; Policy suggestions; Power industry; Tapio decoupling; Thermal power generation; Transmission and distribution; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059296916

Based on a review of recent literature, this work provides a summary of the key environmental benefits of PCPs, in terms of stormwater runoff reduction, underground water quality improvement, heat-island effect mitigation, traffic noise reduction, and skid resistance improvement. The hydraulic performance of PCPs is determined by its mix design, pavement design, construction practice, and service environment. In general, it is difficult to simultaneously optimize the mechanical and durability properties and infiltration performance of PCPs. New technologies need to be developed to help improve the durability of PCPs without significantly increasing its maintenance requirements or sacrificing its infiltration properties. Freeze/thaw damage, deicer impacts, and clogging phenomenon still create bottleneck problems for the implementation of PCPs. The durability of PCPs in cold climates is governed by many factors, and advances could be made at many stages of its life cycle. Challenges remain in quantitative characterization of permeable concrete materials and in establishing quantitative relationships between physicochemical characteristics and performance of permeable concrete. Modeling and advanced characterization are expected to greatly advance the PCP technology. This review also provides a look to the future, for instance, there are some emerging areas of research (e.g., nano-science and nano-engineering) that may help address the durability challenges or further enhance the environmental benefits of PCPs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Concrete pavement; Freeze thaw; Green infrastructure; Hydraulic performance; Infiltration; Permeable concrete","Concrete pavements; Durability; Groundwater; Heat resistance; Infiltration; Noise abatement; Noise pollution; Skid resistance; Water quality; Freeze-thaw; Green infrastructure; Hydraulic performance; Maintenance requirement; Mechanical and durability properties; Permeable concretes; Physicochemical characteristics; Quantitative characterization; Concretes",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057119403

New cropping systems need to be created that use integrated management practices to improve the utilization of nitrogen and water and to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. We conducted a 4-year (2011–2015) field experiment in Huantai county using three cropping treatments: local farmers’ conventional practices (FP), recommended farming management (REC), and no N fertilization (CK). The study revealed that, the mean annual grain yield of FP and REC was both 16.5 Mg ha−1 which was higher than CK (7.9 Mg ha−1). In comparison with FP, the REC treatment showed N fertilizer and groundwater input reduced by 43% and 28% with increasing of 79.3% and 61.7% of N use efficiency (NUE) and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE), respectively. The REC treatment demonstrated consistently lower N2O emissions (36% on average) compared with the FP treatment. The annual net global warming potentials of the REC and CK treatments were 37% and 73% lower, respectively, than that of the FP treatment.

Nowadays, some research studies have been completed to conduct the specifications and guidance for the effective implementation of the hot mix asphalt material. However, after the RAP is utilized in the pavement, the actual performance characteristics to resist the rutting distress at a high temperature and avoid the low temperature crack are not investigated in great detail. In addition, the environmental and economic evaluations of these asphalt materials are not explored very well. This study explored the high and low temperature performance grades as well as energy saving, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction, and cost saving of reclaimed asphalt binders incorporated into the commonly used base binders. Moreover, the results of this study would provide advice and guidance on both economic development policies and environmental protection policies. The experimental designs in this research included three base binders and six RAP sources with respect to the dynamic shear rheometer tests, bending beam rheometer tests and local survey. The results indicated that, at the high temperature, when incorporated 15% and 30% extracted aged binders, one grade (6 °C) and two grades (12 °C) of base binders were generally improved respectively. In addition, the increase of 2–3 °C and 4–5 °C were found at the low temperature when used 15% and 30% aged binders, respectively, regardless of RAP source. Moreover, the reduced energy consumptions, GHG emissions, and costs of the RAP mixtures containing 30% aged binder are generally greater than those with a lower percentage aged binder. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Energy saving; Greenhouse gas emission; Low temperature; m-value; Performance grade; Reclaimed asphalt pavement; Stiffness","Asphalt; Bending tests; Binders; Cost reduction; Economic analysis; Emission control; Energy conservation; Greenhouse gases; Reclamation; Rheometers; Stiffness; Temperature; Economic development policy; Low temperature performance; Low temperatures; m-value; Performance characteristics; Performance grade; Reclaimed asphalt pavements; Reduced energy consumption; Asphalt pavements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059304947

The estimation of abatement costs savings from carbon emission permit trading can provide valuable guidelines and support to environmental regulatory policies on controlling CO2 emissions. By applying a parametric and nonparametric integrating approach and conducting an ex post analysis in two scenarios (i.e., with and without carbon emission permit trading simulation), this study provides a simulative calculation of the opportunity abatement cost savings and the marginal abatement cost savings from carbon emission permit trading in China's power industry of 30 provinces. The simulation results show that: (i) A 13% annually average potential on the opportunity abatement cost savings (i.e., 1024 billion yuan) would be realized if introducing a nationwide emission permit trading system in China's power industry during 2011–2015. (ii) Meanwhile, the marginal abatement cost savings that range from 39 to 47 yuan/ton would be realized through emission permit trading. (iii) Provinces of Xinjiang and Henan show the largest absolute opportunity abatement cost savings from trading, while Qinghai province shows the highest percentage increase in opportunity abatement cost savings.

We demonstrate a simultaneous improvement of light yield and decay time of LSO:Ce single crystal scintillators with lithium codoping. Li codoping significantly enhances the light yield of LSO:Ce from 32 500 to 39 000 photons/MeV, shortens the scintillation decay time from 45.4 to 42.1 ns, and reduces the room temperature afterglow by around one order of magnitude. The physical insights on the role of Li codopants in scintillation mechanism are provided by studying cerium oxidation state, luminescence properties of cerium activator centers, defect structure, and preferential occupation of lithium ions. The improved light yield and afterglow are explained in terms of the dissociation of spatially correlated oxygen vacancies (VO) and Ce centers or the suppression of VO formation, allowing a more efficient electron migration to Ce centers. We attribute the decay time shortening upon Li+ codoping to the reduction of slow Ce2 emissions via a non-radiative energy transfer from six-coordinated Ce2 to seven-coordinated Ce1 centers. © 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It is important for the country to understand the impact factors on emission so that proper mitigation measures can be taken. Previous studies have analyzed emission factors through classifying regions mainly by a single economic index or carbon index, whereas this study introduces a two-dimensional panel framework to classify regions. These two dimensions are per capita GDP and carbon intensity. Based on this panel framework, the 30 provinces in China are classified into four regions, namely, high economy and high carbon intensity (Region I), high economy and low carbon intensity (Region II), low economy and low carbon intensity (Region III), and low economy and high carbon intensity (Region IV). The STIRPAT (stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology) model and the panel cointegration approach are employed to analyze the impacts of various carbon emission factors in the four classified regions. The results show that the most significant factor for Region I is industrial structure, and that for Regions II, III and IV is energy intensity, population size and per capita GDP respectively. The research results can help decision makers adopt effective emission control measures. The two-dimensional panel framework introduced can be extended for application to examine the emission impact factors at regional or national levels in other countries. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Impact factors; Low carbon economy; Panel analysis; STIRPAT model; Two-dimensional panel framework","Classification (of information); Decision making; Emission control; Energy policy; Population statistics; Renewable energy resources; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Carbon emissions; Impact factor; Low carbon economy; Panel analysis; Stirpat models; Two dimensional panels; Carbon; carbon emission; decision making; emission control; energy intensity; Gross Domestic Product; index method; model; panel data; regional pattern; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055020300

Meanwhile, China's economy is more reliant on domestic consumption (particularly household consumption) than on exports. So, to achieve large-scale CEs' reduction for China, there is urgent need to study the CO2 emissions from household consumption (CEs–HC). Based on the environmentally extended Multiregional Input-Output model, this paper not only calculates both the direct CO2 emissions from household consumption (DCEs-CH) and the indirect CO2 emissions from household consumption （ICEs–CH）at the provincial level in China, but also splits ICEs–CH into domestic and foreign CEs. The findings of this paper are as follows: (1) between 2002 and 2012, CEs–HC in China increased significantly, by 2.27 times, from 1306.17 Mt in 2002 to 2971.01 Mt in 2012. The CO2 emissions from urban household consumption (CEs–UHC) in China accounted for 75% of the total CEs–HC in 2012. (2) The per capita CEs–HC in China increased from 1.02 t/person in 2002 to 2.19 t/person in 2012. There was a prominent disparity in the total CEs and per capital CEs–HC among the provinces in China. The per capita CEs–HC were larger in provinces with a higher level of urbanization and higher per capita income. (3) The large-scale interprovincial transfer of ICEs caused by household consumption mainly occurred either within the Yangtze River Delta, the Pearl River Delta, and the Jing-Jin-Ji region or among these three regions. In addition, to service the household consumption, the energy-abundant provinces transferred a considerable amount of CEs to eastern coastal provinces. To achieve CEs' reduction, consumption-based strategies, such as lifestyle changes, should be required in parallel with strategies to reduce emission intensities on the producer side in China. Urban households should take more responsibility for the reduction of CEs in China. The interprovincial “Carbon leakage” should be taken into account when making policies for CEs' reduction in China. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Household consumption; Interprovincial transfer; Multiregional input-output","Industrial engineering; Production engineering; CO2 emissions; Domestic consumption; Emission intensity; Household Consumption; Input output model; Input-output; Interprovincial transfer; Yangtze river delta; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057189671

The fluorescence intensity ratio of I490 and I400 in the phosphors exhibits remarkable temperature dependence, owing to the diverse thermal quenching behaviors of Eu2+ emission centers.

However, the comparison of industrial sector efficiencies is complicated by the fact that the natural resources consumed and/or the pollutants discharged by each sector may differ.

This is different from the previous researches which generally focus on regional data to avoid non-homogeneity. Today environmental reform and energy conservation in various industrial sectors are both parts of the basic state policy of China. The empirical results show that: (1) Sectors’ efficiencies are still low and unbalanced.

Generalized additive models (GAMs) showed that aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) linearly increased with growing season precipitation (GSP) while belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) decreased with growing season temperature (GST). Compared to grazed sites, short-term fencing did not alter the patterns of ANPP along climatic gradients but tended to decrease BNPP at moderate precipitation levels of 200 mm < GSP <450 mm. We also found that ANPP and BNPP linearly increased with species richness, ANPP decreased with Shannon diversity index, and BNPP did not correlate with the Shannon diversity index. Fencing did not alter the relationships between productivity components and plant diversity indices. Generalized additive mixed models furtherly confirmed that the interaction of localized plant diversity and climatic condition nonlinearly regulated productivity partitioning of alpine grasslands in this area. Finally, structural equation models (SEMs) revealed the direction and strength of causal links between biotic and abiotic variables within alpine grassland ecosystems. ANPP was controlled directly by GSP (0.53) and indirectly via species richness (0.41) and Shannon index (−0.12). In contrast, BNPP was influenced directly by GST (−0.43) and indirectly by GSP via species richness (0.05) and Shannon index (−0.02). Therefore, we recommend using a joint approach of GAMs and SEMs for better understanding mechanisms behind the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function under climate change and human disturbance. © 2018","Biodiversity-productivity relationship; Biomass allocation; Ecological network; Generalized additive model; Structural equation model","biodiversity; biomass allocation; climate change; ecosystem function; environmental gradient; grassland; grazing; growing season; land use change; net primary production; species richness; article; biodiversity; biomass allocation; climate change; desert; field study; grazing; growing season; human; joint; precipitation; productivity; species richness; steppe; structural equation modeling; biomass; ecosystem; grassland; Tibet; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; rain; Biomass; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Grassland; Humans; Rain; Tibet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057190752

In an optical spectrum, various metallic and dielectric structures have been proposed to enhance the magnetic dipole emission. However, the enhancement of magnetic dipole emission by a well-designed structure has not been extensively investigated in the terahertz spectrum. Here, we propose a spoof plasmonic structure to enhance strongly the magnetic dipole emission by controlling the electromagnetic environment in the terahertz spectrum. The spoof plasmonic structure with deep-subwavelength scale is designed by periodically inserting metallic strips into a hollow silicon cylinder to obtain the ""hot spot"" of the localized magnetic field in the structural hollow. The resonant frequency and intensity of the magnetic dipole mode supported in this structure can be tuned freely by tailoring the structural parameters. In this context, we investigate the enhancement of a magnetic dipole emission by putting a magnetic dipole at the hollow of the spoof plasmonic structure. The results indicate that the Purcell factor can be more than 103 for a magnetic dipole emission, which is 1 order of magnitude larger than the hollow bare silicon cylinder case. We furthermore investigate the dependence of the Purcell factor on the structural parameters. The spoof plasmonic structure provides the unique ability to enhance the emission from terahertz magnetic dipoles, opening new avenues for novel magnetic light-matter interactions in the terahertz region. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","emission enhancement; magnetic resonances; metamaterials; Purcell effect; spoof plasmonic structure","Cylinders (shapes); Dielectric materials; Magnetic resonance; Metamaterials; Natural frequencies; Plasmonics; Dielectric structure; Electromagnetic environments; Emission enhancement; Light-matter interactions; Purcell effect; Structural parameter; Subwavelength scale; Terahertz spectra; Magnetism",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071566303

Human exposure to fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) is associated with increased incidence of premature mortality and morbidity outcomes. This study builds upon recent, detailed source-apportionment air quality modeling to project the health-related benefits of reducing PM2.5 from mobile sources across the contiguous U.S. in 2025. Updating a previously published benefits analysis approach, we develop national-level benefit per ton estimates for directly emitted PM2.5, SO2/pSO4, and NOX for 16 mobile source sectors spanning onroad vehicles, nonroad engines and equipment, trains, marine vessels, and aircraft. These benefit per ton estimates provide a reduced-form tool for estimating and comparing benefits across multiple mobile source emission scenarios and can be applied to assess the benefits of mobile source policies designed to improve air quality. We found the benefit per ton of directly emitted PM2.5 in 2025 ranges from $110,000 for nonroad agriculture sources to $700,000 for onroad light duty gas cars and motorcycles (in 2015 dollars and based on an estimate of PM-related mortality derived from the American Cancer Society cohort study). Benefit per ton values for SO2/pSO4 range from $52,000 for aircraft sources (including emissions from ground support vehicles) to $300,000 for onroad light duty diesel emissions. Benefit per ton values for NOX range from $2100 for C1 and C2 marine vessels to $7500 for “nonroad all other” mobile sources, including industrial, logging, and oil field sources. Benefit per ton estimates increase approximately 2.26-fold when using an alternative concentration response function to derive PM2.5-related mortality. We also report benefit per ton values for the eastern and western U.S. to account for broad spatial heterogeneity patterns in emissions reductions, population exposure and air quality benefits. © 2018","Air pollution; Benefits per ton; Health benefits; Mobile source; Particulate matter","Air pollution; Air quality; Aircraft; Diesel engines; Diseases; Emission control; Marine engines; Oil fields; Particles (particulate matter); American Cancer Society; Benefits per ton; Fine particulate matter; Health benefits; Mobile source emissions; Mobile sources; Particulate Matter; Spatial heterogeneity; Mobile power plants; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission control; health care; particulate matter; source apportionment; agriculture; air pollution; air quality; aircraft; article; cohort analysis; concentration response; human; logging; mortality; motorcycle; non profit organization; oil field; particulate matter; population exposure; United States; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054308029

My key findings are that coal interests are well integrated into the policy-planning network with major coal producers and reserve holders most connected to ultra-conservative business policy groups and industry associations committed to climate denial while a “coal coalition” of coal-related interests provide linkages to influential moderate conservative groups and industry associations taking a conciliatory stance on climate action.

This study investigated the motivations for urban gardening in Germany, based on an extensive review of 657 urban gardening project websites. The subsequent online survey of 380 project participants provides a characterization of the gardeners, giving insight into both cultivation methods and technologies used and the participants' consumer behavior. It was shown that urban gardening has an influence on consumer behavior and can induce a change towards a more sustainable lifestyle. The gardens provide a space for the exchange of social values, knowledge and ideas on different ways of life among the diverse participants. Hence, urban gardening creates far more than just food; it influences society on multiple levels. Urban gardening can support the bottom-up societal transition towards a bioeconomy as both have common attributes. Finally, the paper proposes an innovative, resource-efficient cultivation system that may attract further societal groups to the urban gardening lifestyle, with the aim of fostering the development of the bioeconomy. © 2019 by the authors.","Bioeconomy; Characterization; Cultivation methods; Motivations; Societal transition; Survey; Terrabioponics; Transformative group; Urban gardening","climate change; conservation status; cultivation; garden; lifestyle; natural resource; resource use; survey method; urban area; urbanization; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061101791

First, we show that global integrated assessment models which characterise transformation pathways consistent with 1.5 °C mitigation are limited in their ability to analyse the emergence of novelty in energy end-use. Second, we introduce concepts of disruptive innovation which can be usefully applied to the challenge of 1.5 °C mitigation. Disruptive low-carbon innovations offer novel value propositions to consumers and can transform markets for energy-related goods and services while reducing emissions. Third, we identify 99 potentially disruptive low-carbon innovations relating to mobility, food, buildings and cities, and energy supply and distribution. Examples at the fringes of current markets include car clubs, mobility-as-a-service, prefabricated high-efficiency retrofits, internet of things, and urban farming. Each of these offers an alternative to mainstream consumer practices. Fourth, we assess the potential emission reductions from subsets of these disruptive low-carbon innovations using two methods: a survey eliciting experts’ perceptions and a quantitative scaling-up of evidence from early-adopting niches to matched segments of the UK population.

This study resamples a water sample archive to explore the spatial pattern of streamwater total concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, and zinc and their associations with biogeochemical controls in northern New England. Road deicing appears to result in elevated trace metal concentrations, as trace metal concentrations are strongly related to sodium concentrations and are most elevated when the sodium: chloride ratio is near 1.0 (~halite). Our results are consistent with previous laboratory and field studies that indicate cation exchange as a metal mobilization mechanism when road salt is applied to soils containing metals. This study also documents associations among sodium, chloride, dissolved organic carbon, iron, and metal concentrations, suggesting cation exchange mechanisms related to road deicing are not the only mechanisms that increase trace metal concentrations in surface waters. In addition to cation exchange, this study considers dissolved organic carbon complexation and oxidation-reduction conditions affecting metal mobility from soils in a salt-rich environment. These observations demonstrate that road deicing has the potential to increase streamwater trace metal concentrations across broad spatial scales and increase risks to human and ecosystem health. © 2019 Wilhelm et al.

As power plants fueled by coal and petroleum are phased out, other generation technologies must fill the gap. While technically feasible, many low-carbon technologies are currently expensive – though costs may fall with experience. As an alternative, natural gas-fired power plants provide lower-carbon electricity – and cheaply if gas is abundant. The least-cost portfolio of generation technologies depends on several uncertain parameters. This paper presents a stylized model of the global electricity sector and evaluates several decarbonization strategies focused on three bridge technologies – natural gas, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and nuclear – over the period 2015–2050. With constraints on total demand for electricity and penetration of renewables, I find that the results are sensitive to the learning curve for CCS, the cost of natural gas, and the social cost of carbon. Depending on the true state of the world, decision-makers may find either natural gas power plants or CCS to be least-cost options for decarbonization portfolios.

China is the largest developing country in the world. With the fast urbanization rate, economic growth and rapid development of industry, China's cement production is soaring year by year. Also, cement CO 2 emissions increased year by year and aroused the rising attention. However, the historical province- and nation-level cement production situations, driving forces of cement output and/or demand based on rapid economic growth and urbanization rate, the peak of cement consumption and China's cement demand projection and CO 2 emissions through 2030 when China should fulfill the international commitments were not clear. The present study summarized the characteristics of China's cement production and CO 2 emissions during 2001–2015, projected cement CO 2 emission scenarios based on diffusion of alternative materials and technical innovation toward 2030. The following results were summarized, clinker- and cement- CO 2 emission factors (EFs) were declining year by year with the technical innovation. CO 2 emissions increased with the increase of cement output year by year. The discrepancies of CO 2 emissions from different researches were becoming large year by year, and the biggest difference of CO 2 emissions reached 49% in 2015. Accordingly, we recommended active EFs for the calculation of cement CO 2 emissions. Cement production situation varies greatly with province, as manifested in unbalanced NSP technology and clinker-to-cement ratio, and energy consumption, which was primarily attributed to the unbalanced resource reserves and economic development. There is still sufficient room for CO 2 reduction in China's cement industry, and the use of alternative material was better than technical innovation in such reduction. The optimal emissions in 2030 will be 1490 Mt CO 2 . And China's cement consumption will be stable in 2030, cumulative cement consumption per capita will be peaked at 23394 kg, and UR will reach 70.1%. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Cement; CO 2 emission factor; Cumulative cement consumption per capita; Urbanization rate","Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Cements; Developing countries; Energy utilization; Industrial economics; Reserves to production ratio; Alternative materials; Cement consumption; CO2 emissions; Demand projection; Economic and social development; Economic development; Per capita; Technical innovation; Economic and social effects; cement; clinker; fossil fuel; unclassified drug; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cement (construction material); consumption behavior; economic growth; social development; urbanization; Article; carbon footprint; cement industry; China; combustion; controlled study; economic development; electricity; gas diffusion; priority journal; process design; social evolution; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056004104

A novel fractionation scheme was developed to segregate three different fractions of Fe and Cu present in ambient PM 2.5 : (i) complexed with hydrophobic organic compounds, (ii) complexed with hydrophilic organic compounds, and (iii) free or inorganic metal fraction. A solid phase extraction (C-18) column was used to separate these fractions. The fractionation scheme applied to the ambient PM 2.5 samples collected from an urban site showed that up to 70-90% of water-soluble Fe and Cu were complexed with the organic compounds. The capability of the complexes of Fe(II) and Cu(II) with Suwanee river fulvic acid (SRFA), a proxy for the atmospheric organic compounds, to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) (·OH and H 2 O 2 ) in a surrogate lung fluid (SLF) was measured. The complex of Fe-SRFA showed a strong synergistic effect in the generation of ·OH in SLF, while that of Cu-SRFA showed an additive effect. Overall, our results indicate that organic complexation of the metals in ambient PM could significantly alter their OP and needs to be considered while assessing their health impacts.

Still, sprawling urbanization, vehicular traffic and coal-fired power plants may maintain regional heat islands and NOx and SO2 pollution. Lichens are one of the first, and longest used, bioindicators of urban heat island effects and atmospheric pollution, but there are few long-term studies of lichen bioindications. We examined herbaria records for lichens collected between 1869 and 2016 in the Western New York (WNY) region (USA). We hypothesized a long-term trend of increasing pollution-sensitive lichens in the region as well as increased desiccation-tolerant species from urban heat island effects. We also evaluated local (urban and tree land use cover) and regional (ecological zones) influences on pollution-sensitive and desiccation-tolerant lichens. We found that the WNY lichen communities appear to be shaped by urbanization with desiccation- and pollution-tolerant species dominating areas adjacent to the urbanized/industrialized core, and direct local effects of the urban heat island and vehicle traffic within the urban core. These results suggest that despite deindustrialization and tighter air quality standards, an industrial imprint remains on the lichen communities of WNY. However, despite urban filtering toward desiccation- and pollution-tolerant lichen species, the urban landscape contributed unique lichen species to the region, increasing WNY's overall lichen biodiversity as much as the relatively pristine Allegheny Plateau. Hence, the urbanized areas of WNY contribute unique species to the regional lichen flora. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

However, these effects may not be homogenous across ecosystem functions, wetland types, ecoregions, or meso-scale watersheds, making broad application of the same management techniques inappropriate. Here, we present a relative wetland vulnerabilities framework, applicable across a range of spatial and temporal scales, to assist in identifying effective and robust management strategies in light of climate change. We deconstruct vulnerability into dimensions of exposure and sensitivity/adaptive capacity, and identify relevant measures of these as they pertain to the attributes of wetland extent and plant community composition. As a test of the framework, we populate it with data for three primary hydrogeomorphic wetland types (riverine, slope, and depression) in seven small watersheds across four ecoregions (Ridge and Valley, Piedmont, Unglaciated Plateau, and Glaciated Plateau) in the Susquehanna River watershed in Pennsylvania. We use data generated from the SRES A2 emissions experiment and MRI-CGCM2.3.2 climate model as input to the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model to simulate future exposure to altered hydrologic conditions in our seven watersheds, as expressed in two hydrologic metrics: % time groundwater levels occur in the upper 30 cm (rooting zone) during the growing season, and median difference between spring and summer mean water levels. We then examine the spatial and temporal scales at which each of the components of vulnerability (exposure and sensitivity/adaptive capacity) shows significant relative differences. Overall, we find that relative differences in exposure persist at a very fine spatial grain, exhibiting high variability even among individual watersheds in a given ecoregion. For temporal scale, we find strong seasonal but weak annual relative differences in exposure resulting from a magnification of summer dry-down combined with winter and spring wet periods becoming wetter. Sensitivities/adaptive capacities show significant differences among wetland types. A comparison between our anticipated hydrologic alterations under climate change and historical changes in hydrology due to anthropogenic disturbance indicates potential shifts in hydrologic patterns that are far beyond anything that wetland managers have experienced in the past. © 2019 The Authors.","climate change; Mid-Atlantic; vulnerability assessment; wetlands",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062732966

Results indicate that the TP heating significantly enhances the southwesterly monsoon circulation over the northern Indian Ocean and the South Asia subcontinent. The intensified southwesterly wind cools the sea surface mainly through the wind-evaporation-SST (sea surface temperature) feedback. Cold SST anomaly then weakens monsoon convective activity, especially that over the Bay of Bengal, and less water vapor is thus transported into the TP along its southern slope from the tropical oceans. As a result, summer precipitation decreases over the TP, which further weakens the TP local heat source. Finally, the changed TP heating continues to influence the summer monsoon precipitation and atmospheric circulation. To a certain extent, the air–sea coupling over the adjacent oceans may weaken the effect of TP heating on the mean climate in summer. It is also implied that considerations of air–sea interaction are necessary in future simulation studies of the TP heating effect. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air–sea coupling; Regional model; Thermal forcing; Tibetan Plateau","air-sea interaction; atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate effect; heating; monsoon; sea surface temperature; summer; weather forecasting; China; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (Tropical); Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (West); Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051455154

The optimized 0.5Pt–CN displayed ~ 2-times higher photocatalytic activities for both CO2 reduction and H2 production than those of bare CN nanosheets. Importantly, the photocatalytic activities for solar fuel production of Pt–g-C3N4 nanosheets can be further enhanced by pretreating a suitable amount of boric acid modification on g-C3N4 nanosheets. Compared to 0.5Pt–CN and bare CN, the optimized 0.5Pt–5B–CN (5% boric acid in molar ratios) displayed ~ 2- and 9-times enhancement for reducing CO2 to CO, as well as CH4 while ~ 2- and 10-times enhancement for H2 production, respectively. By means of the steady-state surface photovoltage spectra, fluorescence spectra and fluorescence spectra related to the produced ·OH amount, the exceptional photoactivities were comprehensively attributed to the boric acid-assisted high dispersion of Pt on g-C3N4 nanosheet which enhances the charge separation and improves the co-catalytic activity. This pretreated boric acid modification strategy is also applicable for other noble metals like Ag and Au.

The index system for TN emission reduction included indices for two groups: a fixed index of marine emission reduction (rate) for jurisdictions, which is 0.5% on average; and threshold indices of pollution prevention at sources, the increment of pollution removal by municipal sewage treatment systems (MSTS) and the increment of watershed retention of source sectors and their rates, which are 0.31%, 6.0% and 2.6% on average, respectively. Based on the land-based TN load and the total maximum allocated load (TMAL), almost half of the jurisdictions are overloaded in Qingdao. The Qingdao coastal sea will meet the “Marine Ecological Red Line” requirement of coastal water quality by the year 2020 by implementing the “precise emission reduction” (PER) method, and 96% of the water quality will be rated as “good” in Jiaozhou Bay by using the best management practices (BMP) for 11 years, or 92% of the water quality in this specific area will be rated as “good” by using the lower-threshold management practice (LTMP) for 8 years.

However, continual water injection changed the situation by introduction of new electron acceptors, donors and exogenous microbes. In this study, 16S-rRNA gene sequencing, comparative metagenomics and genomic bins reconstruction were employed to investigate the microbial community and metabolic potential in three typical water-flooded blocks of the Shen84 oil reservoir in Liaohe oil field, China. The results showed significant difference of microbial community compositions and metabolic characteristics existed between the injected water and the produced water/oil mixtures; however, there was considerable uniformity between the produced samples in different blocks. Microbial communities in the produced fluids were dominated by exogenous facultative microbes such as Pseudomonas and Thauera members from Proteobacteria phylum. Metabolic potentials for O 2 -dependent hydrocarbon degradation, dissimilarly nitrate reduction, and thiosulfate‑sulfur oxidation were much more abundant, whereas genes involved in dissimilatory sulfate reduction, anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation and methanogenesis were less abundant in the oil reservoir. Statistical analysis indicated the water composition had an obvious influence on microbial community composition and metabolic potential. The water-flooding process accompanied with introduction of nitrate or nitrite, and dissolved oxygen promoted the alteration of microbiome in oil reservoir from slow-growing anaerobic indigenous microbes (such as Thermotoga, Clostridia, and Syntrophobacter) to fast-growing opportunists as Beta- and Gama- Proteobacteria. The findings of this study shed light on the microbial ecology change in water flooded petroleum reservoir. © 2018","Metabolic potential; Metagenome; Microbial community; Microbiome; Water-flooded petroleum reservoir","Bacteria; Biochemical oxygen demand; Dissolved oxygen; Ecology; Floods; Gasoline; Genes; Hydrocarbons; Metabolism; Nitrates; Oil well flooding; Petroleum reservoirs; Reservoirs (water); RNA; Sulfur compounds; Water injection; 16S rRNA gene sequencing; Hydrocarbon degradation; Metabolic characteristics; Metabolic potential; Metagenomes; Microbial communities; Microbial community composition; Microbiome; Petroleum reservoir engineering; dissolved oxygen; hydrocarbon; nitrate; nitrite; sulfate; petroleum; RNA 16S; community composition; genome; hydrocarbon reservoir; metabolism; microbial community; petroleum; Article; Betaproteobacteria; biodegradation; carbon dioxide fixation; chemical composition; China; Clostridia; flooding; Gammaproteobacteria; gene sequence; metagenomics; methanogenesis; microbial community; nonhuman; oil field; oxidation; priority journal; Pseudomonas; Thauera; Thermotoga; environmental monitoring; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; oil and gas field; phylogeny; supply and distribution; water supply; China; Liaohe Oilfield; Liaoning; Clostridia; Proteobacteria; Pseudomonas; Syntrophobacter; Thauera; Thermotoga; Betaproteobacteria; China; Environmental Monitoring; Gammaproteobacteria; Metagenomics; Microbiota; Oil and Gas Fields; Petroleum; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Water Microbiology; Water Resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056192447

The individual cylinder air–fuel ratio control is one of the important techniques used to improve fuel economy and reduce exhaust emission. For the large-bore gas fuel engine with gas fuel injection devices, their mass flow rates would be affected more seriously by the valve lifts than the injector of gasoline engine. In this study, we propose an individual cylinder air–fuel ratio estimation algorithm, based on Kalman filtering, for a gas fuel engine with asymmetrical exhaust runners. The coefficient matrix update step is added to the iterative process of common Kalman observer. The individual cylinder air–fuel ratios are estimated with one single universal exhaust gas oxygen sensor located on each side exhaust manifold. Furthermore, the estimation and feedback control performances with the proposed estimation algorithm are validated with a one-dimensional engine simulation tool. The results indicate that the modified Kalman observer can estimate the individual cylinder air–fuel ratio of gas fuel engine with asymmetrical exhaust runner precisely, with the maximum error smaller than 1% under steady-state conditions, and compensate the gas fuel injection devices for their mass flow rate differences. © The Author(s) 2019.","asymmetrical exhaust runner; cylinder-to-cylinder imbalance; gas fuel engine; gas fuel injection device; Individual air–fuel ratio estimation","Air engines; Diesel engines; Exhaust gas recirculation; Exhaust manifolds; Fuel economy; Fuel injection; Gas fuels; Gas lifts; Gases; Iterative methods; Mass transfer; asymmetrical exhaust runner; Coefficient matrix; Control performance; Engine performance; Estimation algorithm; Fuel ratio; Steady-state condition; Universal exhaust gas oxygen sensor; Engine cylinders",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062287600

The following results were obtained. (1) Nuclear density estimation shows that the overall average carbon intensity of cities in China has decreased, with differences gradually narrowing. (2) The spatial autocorrelation Moran’s I index indicates significant spatial agglomeration of carbon emission intensity is gradually increasing; however, differences between regions have remained stable. (3) Spatial Markov chain analysis shows a Matthew effect in China’s urban carbon emission intensity. In addition, low-intensity and high-intensity cities characteristically maintain their initial state during the transition period. Furthermore, there is a clear “Spatial Spillover” effect in urban carbon emission intensity and there is heterogeneity in the spillover effect in different regional contexts; that is, if a city is near a city with low carbon emission intensity, the carbon emission intensity of the first city has a higher probability of upward transfer, and vice versa. (4) Panel quantile results indicate that in cities with low carbon emission intensity, economic growth, technological progress, and appropriate population density play an important role in reducing emissions. In addition, foreign investment intensity and traffic emissions are the main factors that increase carbon emission intensity. In cities with high carbon intensity, population density is an important emission reduction factor, and technological progress has no significant effect. In contrast, industrial emissions, extensive capital investment, and urban land expansion are the main factors driving the increase in carbon intensity. © 2019, Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Chinese cities; kernel density estimation; quantile regression panel model; spatial autocorrelation; spatial Markov chain; spatial spillover effect",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059740287

Strategies to harness excess renewable generation for useful purposes exist, but it is unclear which of these end uses provides the most effective use of available excess generation to maximize greenhouse gas emissions reductions in a cost-effective manner. This study investigates and compares three end-use strategies for utilizing excess renewable generation – storage in electrical energy storage systems, production of transportation fuel or vehicle charging, or production of renewable gas – and their diverse technology pathways on the bases of their greenhouse gas emissions reduction potential and the impacts of their implementation on the cost of energy services. This is accomplished by modeling the integration of 46 different technology pathways for using excess renewable generation in a 70% renewable and an 80% renewable electric grid configuration during the year 2050 in California using the Holistic Grid Resource Integration and Deployment (HiGRID) platform, which is a temporally-resolved resource dispatch model of the electricity system. Technology and cost characteristics for batteries, hydrogen energy storage systems, vehicle fueling or charging, and renewable gas production technologies are collected from multiple sources and their effect on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and affecting the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) services in the HiGRID platform are examined. It was discovered that using excess renewable generation to produce transportation fuel for hydrogen vehicles or to charge electric vehicles provided the largest total greenhouse gas emissions reductions and lowest per-ton cost of greenhouse gas reduction. Use in grid energy storage and production of renewable gas provided similar but relatively lower total greenhouse gas reductions than transportation, with the latter imposing lower per-ton costs of greenhouse gas reduction. More generally, greenhouse gas reduction potential of these end uses depended on the intensity of the fuel being displaced by renewables, while LCOE effects depended on the temporal flexibility of the technologies associated with this end use. Overall, this study provides insight into a priority order for directing the use of excess renewable generation towards end uses to achieve greenhouse gas reduction goals such as those in California in a cost-minimal manner, and investigates the sensitivities that influence the effectiveness of these end uses. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Excess renewable energy; Greenhouse gas reduction; Hydrogen technologies; Levelized cost of energy; Zero emission vehicles","Charging (batteries); Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen storage; Storage as a service (STaaS); Vehicles; Greenhouse gas reductions; Hydrogen technologies; Levelized costs; Renewable energies; Zero emission vehicles; Gas emissions; alternative energy; electric vehicle; electricity generation; emission control; energy storage; gas production; greenhouse gas; hydrogen; power generation; prioritization; smart grid; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056190344

While the factors influencing CO2 emissions have been subject to extensive study, via research that has explored the path of developing a low-carbon economy, little work has been undertaken at the city level as a result of a deficiency in data availability. Addressing this gap, this study firstly estimated CO2 emissions of cities in China using Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) nighttime light imagery. We then analyzed spatial variations in the estimated CO2 emissions at the city level, using a spatial analytical model, finding significant spatial autocorrelation in CO2 emissions. Subsequently, we compared the effects of different socioeconomic factors on CO2 emissions, using both global and local regression models. The results from the global regression model revealed that private car ownership, economic growth, and energy consumption were the major factors promoting CO2 emissions in China's cities, while population density had an effect in reducing CO2 emissions. The use of a Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model provided more detailed results, revealing significant spatial heterogeneity in the impacts of different factors. Economic growth, private car ownership, and energy consumption all posed positive effects on CO2 emissions while the remainder of the factors studied were found to pose a bidirectional impact on CO2 emissions in different areas of China. Economic growth and private car ownership were to found to exert the strongest positive effects in the cities of western and central China, and energy consumption was shown to significantly and positively influence CO2 emissions in the southernmost part of China. Urban expansion and road density were identified as key promoting factors in CO2 emissions in the northeast of China; and the industrial structure demonstrated significantly positive effects in relation to CO2 levels in cities located in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. The role of foreign direct investment (FDI) was not found to be significant in most cities expect Guangdong, where a significant positive relationship appeared. © 2018","China; City-level; CO2 emissions; DMSP/OLS; Geographically Weighted Regression Model","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Energy utilization; Industrial emissions; Investments; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Satellite imagery; China; City-level; CO2 emissions; DMSP/OLS; Geographically weighted regression models; Economic and social effects; adaptive management; car ownership; carbon emission; economic growth; environmental economics; foreign direct investment; industrial structure; numerical model; spatial variation; urban agriculture; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055917499

While it is increasingly recognized that urban form could significantly influence the CO 2 emissions of urban areas, few studies have been able to quantify the implications of urban form in relation to CO 2 emission efficiency. The purpose of this paper is thus to contribute to existing literature by empirically quantifying how urban form influences CO 2 emission efficiency. CO 2 emission efficiency in this study is presented in terms of CO 2 economic efficiency (CEE) and CO 2 social efficiency (CSE). Firstly, we calculated the CEE and CSE of nine cities in the Pearl River Delta (Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Foshan, Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, Huizhou, Dongguan, and Zhongshan) using locally important socioeconomic variables over the period 1990–2013. Then, seven landscape metrics were selected in order to quantify three dimensions of urban form (extension, irregularity, and compactness) using remote sensing data. Finally, panel data models were utilized to estimate the associations between urban form and CO 2 emission efficiency. We identified a negative correlation between urban sprawl and CEE as well as CSE, a finding that indicates that urban growth decreases CO 2 economic efficiency. Further, increasing irregularity in the form of cities was found to decrease both CEE and CSE—a larger degree of irregularity, in other words, results in lower CO 2 emission efficiency. Conversely, urban compactness was identified as having a significant positive influence on both CEE and CSE, indicating that the compact development of cities can actually help to improve CO 2 emission efficiency.

The CO2 emissions and CO2 intensities of each province are calculated by using the fossil fuel data of 30 provincial administration regions from 2006 to 2016. Then difference in difference (DiD) models and propensity score matching (PSM) with panel data are applied to estimate the causal impact of the pilot ETS project. Results show that the pilot regions reduce their CO2 emissions and intensities more than the non-pilot regions under the pilot ETS project. The pilot ETS project significantly induced 12% decreases in the nominal CO2 intensity and 7.6% decrease in the real CO2 intensity, after controlling for regional heterogeneity, but its reduction effects on CO2 emissions are insignificant. Decreasing the proportion of coal to total energy consumption may be the main channel of the pilot ETS project inducing CO2 abatement. The estimated results for control variables indicate that upgrading industrial structures, attracting FDI, and purifying the export structure have significant effects on CO2 abatement. © 2019 by the authors.","CO2 abatement; Difference-in-difference model; Emissions trading scheme","abatement cost; administration; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emissions trading; environmental modeling; fossil fuel; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061706576

Mass concentrations of PM 2:5 and its major chemical components were 20.6%-43.1% lower during the NCCPC-control period compared with a non-control period, and differences were greater on days with stable meteorological conditions. A receptor model showed that PM 2:5 from traffic-related emissions, biomass burning, industrial processes, and mineral dust was 38.5 %-77.8% lower during the NCCPC-control versus noncontrol period, but differences in PM 2:5 from coal burning were small, and secondary sources were higher during the NCCPC-control period. During one pollution episode in the non-control period, secondary sources dominated, and the WRF-Chem model showed that the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region contributed 73.6% of PM 2:5 mass. A second pollution episode was linked to biomass burning, and BTH contributed 46.9% of PM 2:5 mass. Calculations based on Interagency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE) algorithms showed that organic matter was the largest contributor to light extinction during the non-control period whereas NH 4 NO 3 was the main contributor during the NCCPC. The Tropospheric Ultraviolet and Visible radiation model showed that the average direct radiative forcing (DRF) values at the Earth's surface were-14:0 and-19:3Wm -2 during the NCCPC-control and non-control periods, respectively, and the DRF for the individual PM 2:5 components were 22.7 %-46.7% lower during the NCCPC. The information and dataset from this study will be useful for developing air pollution control strategies in the BTH region and for understanding associated aerosol radiative effects. © Author(s) 2019.",,"atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; concentration (composition); particulate matter; pollution control; radiative forcing; traffic emission; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061450428

The threshold R values to mark the start (R ts ) and end (R te ) of the transition regime are defined at the point where O 3 -NO x sensitivity turns from negative to positive and where O 3 -NO x sensitivity is ten times higher than O 3 -VOC sensitivity, respectively. R ts and R te are determined using NO x and VOC sensitivity simulations in a box model with a modified SAPRC-11 mechanism. For the widely used indicator ration R = (P H2O2 + P ROOH )/P HNO3, which is based on the production rates of H 2 O 2 , HNO 3 and organic hydroperoxides (ROOH), the recommended R ts and R te values are 0.047 and 5.142, respectively. Parameterized attribution functions, depending only on the values of R, are developed to apportion modeled in situ O 3 formation in the transition regime to NO x and VOCs. The new 3R and the traditional two-regime (2R) schemes are incorporated into the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to quantify NO x and VOC contributions to regional O 3 concentrations in China in August 2013. The 3R approach predicts approximately 5-10 ppb and up to 15 ppb higher NO x contributions to 8 h O 3 in in the North China Plain, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta than the 2R approach. The big differences in O 3 attribution between 2R and 3R can have significant policy implications for air pollution emission controls.

The spatial pattern of rice exposure to cold stress (ECS) is critical to develop countrywide adaptation strategies. Under climate change, whether and how ECS spatial pattern has changed? These answers are urgently required for adaptation optimization, but regrettably remain unclear. Here, we examined the changes in rice-planted area exposed to cold stress across mainland China, and historical movements of the geographical centroids of rice ECS over 1980–2015. The results showed that in the single rice cultivation of northeast China and the Yunan-Guizhou plateau, the area exposed to cold stress has shrunk significantly and the centroid moved northward since the 1980s. The southern parts of the mid-lower reaches of Yangtze River witnessed a continuous decrease in the area exposed to cold stress from the 1980s to 2000s, but a large expansion over the 2010s. In south China, the areas exposed to cold stress mainly gathered in the northern parts and showed large variations since the 1980s. These two regions dominant by double rice have witnessed westward movements of ECS centroids over the past decades. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","China; Climate change; Cold stress; Geographical centroid; Rice","climate; climate change; cultivation; environmental stress; extreme event; land use change; pattern recognition; rice; China; Yangtze River; Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057610143

All sectors of society, including the government, have begun to focus on energy issues. How to realize an ideal supply-demand matching of logistics resources is one of the common issues and objectives. To facilitate the development of this platform for both academic researchers and industrial practitioners, a green urban closed-loop logistics distribution network model is proposed in this paper by using the supply and demand data of a logistics service consumer to obtain the optimized solution that minimizes the emissions of greenhouse gases and the overall operational cost. This study aims to assist enterprises to effectively reduce carbon emissions in the current logistics distribution process. This paper uses a case study to validate the feasibility and practicality of the proposed green logistics distribution model to help end-users optimize their daily operations. The results show that there is a negative correlation between the cost and carbon emissions under the shortest distribution routes. However, this negative correlation is not absolute, for instance, certain changes in distribution cost may lead to positive correlation between the cost and carbon emissions. The multi-objective Pareto optimization results also show that the combination of vehicles, including electric vehicles and fuel vehicles, is able to effectively achieve a win-win scenario including carbon emissions and distribution costs, which could be ideal for enterprises. Furthermore, the proposed model could also provide guiding significance for enterprises to achieve low carbon distribution and for governments to promote a low carbon agenda in the urban logistics network distribution system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ant colony algorithm; Closed-loop logistics; Distribution network; Green logistics","Ant colony optimization; Carbon; Economics; Electric power distribution; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Logistics; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Vehicles; Ant colony algorithms; Closed loops; Green logistics; Industrial practitioners; Logistics distribution; Logistics distribution networks; Modern information technologies; Supply-demand matching; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059328318

Although various studies have found a causal relationship between energy intensity and energy-related carbon emissions, the internal mechanisms are still unclear. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the impact of energy intensity on carbon emissions from 2005 to 2015. With an association established between logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) and generalized Fisher index (GFI), two-layer factor decomposition model is proposed to explore the factor analysis in-depth. (1) LMDI method proves that energy intensity is the main contributor that reduces carbon emissions in BTH. (2) GFI model further decomposes energy intensity into five effects, namely energy substitution, technology progress, labor productivity, capital substitution, and labor-capital resources allocation. (3) The results reveal that the effect of capital-energy substitution in declining energy intensity surpasses technology progress. (4) Energy-labor substitution has increased energy intensity, while energy-energy substitution is negligible. For the coordinate development of BTH, the government should aim at energy intensity and attach importance to encouraging entrepreneurship, accelerating the construction of carbon trading market, allocating resources rationally, and guiding the capital flow into energy-efficient direction. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei; Carbon emissions; Energy intensity; Influence mechanism; Policy implications; Two-layer decomposition","carbon emission; decomposition analysis; emissions trading; energy intensity; environmental economics; policy strategy; pollution tax; resource allocation; sustainable development; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; carbon; analysis; China; city; energy resource; greenhouse gas; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; Beijing; Carbon; China; Cities; Energy-Generating Resources; Greenhouse Gases; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058562112

The α- and β-carboxysomes of cyanobacteria contain ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)—a complex of eight large (RbcL) and eight small (RbcS) subunits—and carbonic anhydrase2–4. As HCO3− can diffuse through the proteinaceous carboxysome shell but CO2 cannot5, carbonic anhydrase generates high concentrations of CO2 for carbon fixation by Rubisco6. The shell also prevents access to reducing agents, generating an oxidizing environment7–9. The formation of β-carboxysomes involves the aggregation of Rubisco by the protein CcmM10, which exists in two forms: full-length CcmM (M58 in Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942), which contains a carbonic anhydrase-like domain8 followed by three Rubisco small subunit-like (SSUL) modules connected by flexible linkers; and M35, which lacks the carbonic anhydrase-like domain11. It has long been speculated that the SSUL modules interact with Rubisco by replacing RbcS2–4. Here we have reconstituted the Rubisco–CcmM complex and solved its structure. Contrary to expectation, the SSUL modules do not replace RbcS, but bind close to the equatorial region of Rubisco between RbcL dimers, linking Rubisco molecules and inducing phase separation into a liquid-like matrix. Disulfide bond formation in SSUL increases the network flexibility and is required for carboxysome function in vivo. Notably, the formation of the liquid-like condensate of Rubisco is mediated by dynamic interactions with the SSUL domains, rather than by low-complexity sequences, which typically mediate liquid–liquid phase separation in eukaryotes12,13.

This study quantified relative contributions of six factors to changes in GHG emissions from interconnected grids in China during 2008-2015. These six factors include three generation-side factors (i.e., fuel mix of thermal power generation, energy efficiency of thermal power generation, and electricity structure), two consumption-side factors (i.e., electricity efficiency of GDP and GDP), and electricity transmission structure. GDP growth and changes in fuel mix of thermal power generation are two major drivers of increased GHG emission during 2008-2015, especially for the North China Grid. In contrast, changes in electricity transmission structure (especially in East China Grid and Southern China Grid), the increase in electricity efficiency of GDP (except for Northwest China Grid), improvements in energy efficiency of thermal power generation (especially in North China Grid and Central China Grid), and changes in electricity structure (especially in Southern Power Grid) are major factors offsetting GHG emission increments. Findings of this study can provide multiple-perspective policy implications for GHG mitigation in China's power sector.

There was consensus regarding the impacts of climate change on forest ecosystems and on economic sectors such as agriculture and forestry. Respondents also indicated a lack of public awareness and policy and legislation as challenges to addressing climate change. However, the results indicate differences in opinion between regions on the negative impacts of climate change and in satisfaction with actions taken to address climate change, highlighting the need for locally specific policies and research. The study presents specific recommendations to address issues of most concern, based on subregion and professional affiliation throughout the Asia–Pacific region. The results can be used to improve policy and forest management throughout the region. This research will also provide valuable suggestions on how to apply research findings and management recommendations outside of the AP region. The conclusions should be communicated relative to the level of the research and the target audience, ensuring that scientific findings and management recommendations are effectively communicated to ensure successful implementation of forest adaptation strategies. © 2018, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Asia–Pacific; Climate change; Expert opinion; Forest management; Questionnaire","action plan; adaptation; climate change; climate effect; economic activity; environmental legislation; environmental policy; expert system; forest ecosystem; forest management; forestry; questionnaire survey; Asia; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055865359

Yet, little is known about the interactive effect of climate change and grazing on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Here, we conducted a vegetation translocation experiment (ten soil-vegetation blocks were translocated from high-altitudinal site 3,245 m to low-altitudinal site 3,045 m) combined with grazing treatment in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that (a) translocation induced effect of climate change from harsh, high-altitudinal site to benign, low-altitudinal site significantly promoted species richness, and density of asexual and sexual seedling, with an increase in the proportion of asexual recruitment to sexual recruitment; (b) grazing decreased the proportion of asexual seedling to sexual recruitment within community, led to a shift in the dominant plant functional groups from graminoids and legumes to forbs; and (c) grazing partly offset the increased species richness of seedling, but not seedling density, induced by climate change. These findings suggest that moderate grazing may buffer the effect of climate change on the plant community composition, and thus, functional role in alpine meadows. Further understanding the influence of climate change on grassland ecosystems needs to consider the non-additive effect of grazing and climate change to sustainability of grassland services. © 2018 The Authors.

Two distinct oxidation states were generated using different pre-treatment protocols that developed in this paper: pre-oxidized surface that was dominated by PdO and pre-reduced surface that was dominated by metallic Pd. The CH4 kinetics was investigated on the catalysts with these two different Pd oxidation states. It was discovered that metallic Pd played a vital role in low temperature CH4 oxidation activity, which was indicated by a higher reaction rate on the pre-reduced catalyst as compared to the pre-oxidized catalyst. The apparent activation energies were estimated to be 94.0 and 82.2 KJ/mole on PdO dominated and metallic Pd dominated surfaces, respectively. At higher temperature, CH4 conversions on pre-reduced catalysts presented a “bend” shape, which could not be merely explained by the CH4 kinetics built upon the pre-reduced catalyst. This “unusual” change in CH4 kinetics was explained by the transition of metallic Pd to PdO with increasing temperature. CH4 oxidation kinetics followed two distinct pathways on metallic Pd and PdO dominated surfaces: the activation of CH4 on PdO dominated surfaces requires a pair of site including a PdO site and a vacant site while activation of CH4 on metallic Pd dominated surfaces involves a pair of site consisting of a metallic Pd and an oxygen lattice from support. Additionally, it was revealed that CH4 activation was much faster on metallic Pd as compared to PdO. A CH4 oxidation kinetic model was developed to simulate the dynamic change of Pd active site pairs so as to accurately predict the CH4 oxidation with different Pd oxidation states under reaction conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","CH4 oxidation; Kinetic model; Pd oxidation states; Reaction kinetics; Three-way catalyst (TWC)","Activation energy; Catalysts; Kinetic parameters; Kinetic theory; Oxidation; Reaction kinetics; Temperature; Apparent activation energy; CH4 oxidation; Increasing temperatures; Kinetic modeling; Oxidation state; Reaction conditions; Reaction pathways; Three way catalysts; Palladium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059179931

Within the city limits of Denver, Colorado, there are now more than 600 registered Cannabis spp. cultivation facilities (CCFs) for recreational and medical uses, each containing thousands of plants. Ambient measurements collected inside growing operations pre-legalization have found concentrations as high as 50–100 ppbv of terpenes; a group of highly reactive biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and known precursors for the formation of ozone and particulate matter (PM). Due to its illicit nature there has been insufficient experimental data produced to determine Cannabis spp. emission rates. This study used, for the first time, an enclosure chamber and live Cannabis spp. plants during a 90-day growing period consisting of four different strains of Cannabis spp.: Critical Mass, Lemon Wheel, Elephant Purple, and Rockstar Kush. These measurements enabled characterization of terpenes and estimates of emission capacity (EC, μgC g−1 hr−1) at standard conditions. During peak growth, the percentages of individual BVOC emissions were dominated by β-myrcene (18–60%), eucalyptol (17–38%), and d-limonene (3–10%) for all strains. Our results showed large variability in the rate and composition of terpene emissions across different strains. For the Critical Mass and Lemon Wheel, the dominant terpenoid was eucalyptol (32% and 38%), and it was β-myrcene (60% and 45%) for the Elephant Purple and Rockstar Kush. Critical Mass produced the highest terpene emission capacity (8.7 μgC g−1 hr−1) and Rockstar Kush the lowest (4.9 μgC g−1 hr−1). With 600 CCFs in Denver, and assuming 10,000 plants per CCF, an emission capacity of 8.7 μgC g−1 hr−1 would more than double the existing rate of BVOC emissions to 520 metric ton year−1. Using Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) values the total ozone formation potential from all these emitted species could produce 2100 metric tons year−1 of ozone, and based on published secondary organic aerosols yields 131 metric tons year−1 of PM. It is likely that the ECs calculated here are lower than those achieved in CCFs where growing conditions are optimized for rapid growth and higher biomass yields. Further studies including a greater number of the 620 available Cannabis spp. strains and a wider range of treatments are needed to generate a representative dataset. Such a dataset could then better enable assessments of the potential impacts of this new industry on indoor and regional air quality. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biogenic volatile organic compound; Cannabis spp.; Emission capacity; Leaf enclosure; Ozone; Particulate matter","Air quality; Citrus fruits; Enclosures; Gas chromatography; Monoterpenes; Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); Volatile organic compounds; Wheels; Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Cannabis spp; Emission capacity; Maximum incremental reactivities; Particulate Matter; Regional air quality; Secondary organic aerosols; Volatile organic compound emission; Cultivation; cannabis; cineole; limonene; myrcene; ozone; terpene; terpenoid; volatile organic compound; aerosol; air quality; commercialization; concentration (composition); emission; enclosure experiment; herb; measurement method; operations technology; optimization; particulate matter; volatile organic compound; air pollution; air quality; air sampling; ambient air; Article; Cannabis sativa; concentration (parameters); controlled study; leaf area; lemon; nonhuman; particulate matter; photosynthetically active radiation; plant growth; plant leaf; priority journal; secondary organic aerosol; Colorado; Denver; United States; Cannabis; Citrus limon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056755751

A newly extended LMDI method based on the Kaya identity was adopted to examine the main drivers for the carbon emissions increments both at the industrial sector and the residential sector. Research results are listed as follow: (1) Carbon emissions embodied in the imported electricity played a significant important role in emissions mitigation in Guangzhou. (2) The influences and impacts of various driving factors on industrial and residential carbon emissions are different in the three different development periods, namely, the 10 th five-year plan period (2003-2005), the 11 th five-year plan period (2005-2010), and the 12 th five-year plan period (2010-2013). The main reasons underlying these influencing mechanisms were different policy measures announced by the central and local government during the different five-year plan periods. (3) The affluence effect (g-effect) was the dominant positive effect in driving emissions increase, while the energy intensity effect of production (e-effect-Production), the economic structure effect (s-effect) and the carbon intensity effect of production (f-effect-Production) were the main contributing factors suppressing emissions growth at the industrial sector. (4) The affluence effect of urban (g-effect-AUI) was the most dominant positive driving factor on emissions increment, while the energy intensity effect of urban (e-effect-Urban) played the most important role in curbing emissions growth at the residential sector. © 2019 Wang et al.

These factors are likely to have biodiversity implications. However, climate-driven forest ecosystem models used to predict changes to forest structure and composition are not coupled to models used to predict changes to biodiversity. We proposed integrating woodpecker response (biodiversity indicator) with forest ecosystem models. Woodpeckers are a good indicator species of forest ecosystem dynamics, because they are ecologically constrained by landscape-scale forest components, such as composition, structure, disturbance regimes, and management activities. In addition, they are correlated with forest avifauna community diversity. In this study, we explore integrating woodpecker and forest ecosystem climate models. We review climate–woodpecker models and compare the predicted responses to observed climate-induced changes. We identify inconsistencies between observed and predicted responses, explore the modeling causes, and identify the models pertinent to integration that address the inconsistencies. We found that predictions in the short term are not in agreement with observed trends for 7 of 15 evaluated species. Because niche constraints associated with woodpeckers are a result of complex interactions between climate, vegetation, and disturbance, we hypothesize that the lack of adequate representation of these processes in the current broad-scale climate–woodpecker models results in model–data mismatch. As a first step toward improvement, we suggest a conceptual model of climate–woodpecker–forest modeling for integration. The integration model provides climate-driven forest ecosystem modeling with a measure of biodiversity while retaining the feedback between climate and vegetation in woodpecker climate change modeling. © 2019 The Authors.

Weekly averaged climatic and socio-economic variables are screened through correlation analysis and the significant variables are then used to develop yard waste models. These models then utilize artificial neural networks (ANN) where the variables are time lagged for a different number of weeks. This helps to realize a reduction in the error of the predicted weekly yard waste generation. Optimal lag times for each model varied from 1 to 11 weeks. The best model used both the ambient air temperature and population variables, in an ANN model with 3 layers, 11 neurons in the hidden layer, and an optimal lag time of 1 week. A mean absolute percentage error of 18.72% was obtained during the testing stage. One model saw a 55.4% decrease in the mean squared error at training, showing the value of lag time on the accuracy of weekly yard waste prediction models. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural networks; Climatic and socio-economic variables; Effects of lag; Municipal yard waste prediction model; Optimization of model structure","Errors; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mean square error; Neural networks; Structural optimization; Ambient air temperature; Effects of lag; Machine learning approaches; Mean absolute percentage error; Prediction model; Significant variables; Socio-economic factor; Socio-economics; Waste management; artificial neural network; efficiency measurement; error analysis; machine learning; municipal solid waste; optimization; planning method; prediction; socioeconomic conditions; waste management; ambient air; article; artificial neural network; correlation analysis; human; nerve cell; prediction; socioeconomics; artificial neural network; socioeconomics; solid waste; theoretical model; waste management; Models, Theoretical; Neural Networks (Computer); Socioeconomic Factors; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057796110

The study was carried out in the abandoned Roman Valley quarry (Majella Mountain, central Italy), well-known for its historical bitumen extraction. The studied rocks consist of ramp carbonates of the lower member of the Bolognano Formation (Oligocene-Miocene in age) mainly composed of grainstones, and secondary packstones and wackestones. In the quarry, the exposed rocks are crosscut by two high-angle oblique-slip faults striking WNW-ESE with up to 40 m of throw. With the aim of deciphering the contribution of both matrix and fracture pore space on the fluid storage and migration, both laboratory measurements and field-based Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) models (cubes with 4-m per side) have been carried out. The obtained dual-porosity/permeability model, which includes the lithological and the structural heterogeneities observed at the location, was used to run flow simulations under different scenarios of well locations. The fluid distribution in the matrix, resulting from these flow simulations, is consistent with field observations where bitumen localizes within the most permeable lithofacies (grainstones). In the fault zones, the fracture network causes an important fluid flow anisotropy, enhancing the flow in a direction subparallel to the faults. The flow orthogonal to the fault zones is controlled by type and lateral continuity of fault rocks, where fault breccias represent conduits and cataclasites localized barriers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Deformed carbonates; Dual-porosity/permeability; Fault sealing; Geological model","Bituminous materials; Carbonates; Flow simulation; Landforms; Lithology; Porosity; Quarries; Stratigraphy; Discrete fracture network models; Dual porosity; Fault sealing; Fluid flow anisotropy; Fractured carbonates; Geological modeling; Laboratory measurements; Structural heterogeneity; Fracture; carbonate rock; flow modeling; fracture network; fractured medium; hydrocarbon reservoir; permeability; porosity; quarry; reservoir rock; Abruzzi; Apennines; Italy; Majella Mountains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056485512

Its pH has been established at around 7.6 at least after thyrotropin (TSH) stimulation. This alkaline intrafollicular pH is thought to be critical for iodide coupling to thyroglobulin and internalization of iodinated thyroglobulin. At least in mice, this alkalinization requires the expression of pendrin (Slc26a4) within the apical membrane, and a lack of pendrin results in acidic follicular lumen pH. Yet, the mechanism importing HCO 3 - into the cytoplasm is unknown. This study investigated whether the rather ubiquitous sodium bicarbonate cotransporter NBCe1 (SLC4A4) might play this role. It also examined which variant was expressed and where it was localized in both rat and human thyroid tissue. Lastly, the dependence of its expression on TSH was studied. Methods: Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunofluorescence, and Western blotting were used to test whether TSH stimulated NBCe1 protein expression in vivo. Subcellular localization of NBCe1 was performed using immunofluorescence in both rat and human thyroid. Cultured thyroid cells were also used to attempt to define how TSH affects NBCe1 expression. Results: Only transcripts of the NBCe1-B variant were detected in both rat and human thyroid. Of interest, NBCe1-C was not detected in human tissues, not even in the brain. On immunofluorescence microscopy, the immunostaining of NBCe1 mainly appeared in the basolateral membrane upon stimulation with TSH. This TSH induction of basolateral membrane expression of NBCe1 protein was confirmed in vivo in rat thyroid and in vitro on human thyroid slices. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the expression of the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter NBCe1-B in rat and human thyroid. Additionally, the data suggest that TSH blocks the degradation of NBCe1 protein by trafficking it to the basolateral membrane. Hence, TSH increases NBCe1 half-life without increasing its synthesis. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.","NBC1; NBCe1 variants; SLC4A4; thyroid; TSH","bicarbonate sodium cotransporter; sodium bicarbonate cotransporter NBCe1; thyrotropin; unclassified drug; bicarbonate sodium cotransporter; SLC4A4 protein, human; Slc4a4 protein, rat; thyroid hormone; thyrotropin; animal cell; animal cell culture; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; basolateral membrane; cellular distribution; female; hormone determination; human; human cell; human tissue; immunofluorescence microscopy; immunohistochemistry; in vivo study; nonhuman; PCCL3 cell line; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; protein localization; rat; regulatory mechanism; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; thyroid cell; thyroid follicle; thyroid gland; thyroid gland tissue; Western blotting; animal; cell membrane; cytoplasm; gene expression regulation; metabolism; mouse; physiology; thyroid gland; Wistar rat; Animals; Cell Membrane; Cytoplasm; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Mice; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Sodium-Bicarbonate Symporters; Thyroid Gland; Thyroid Hormones; Thyrotropin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061481798

In Vietnam, more than 80% of the mangroves develop either in the Mekong Delta or in the Can Gio Estuary, which are characterized by tropical monsoon climates. Most of these mangroves were planted and are dominated by Rhizophora apiculata Blume. The main objectives of this study were to determine forest structure, above-ground biomass and carbon conversion factors for each tree component in order to obtain allometric equations and to derive carbon stocks for managed Rhizophora stands of different ages developing within this context. Thirty-six trees, having a diameter at breast height (DBH) ranging from 7.0 to 36.2 cm, from a planted mangrove forest were harvested in Ca Mau (Mekong Delta) to determine allometric equations. In addition, thirteen plots were established in both Ca Mau and Can Gio mangrove forests, to determine above-ground carbon densities. We proposed the following specific allometric equation to estimate total above-ground biomass (kg) for managed R. apiculata mangrove stands in Southern Vietnam: WTotal = 0.38363 * DBH2.2348 (R2 = 0.976, SE = 1.17, F = 1401, P &lt; 0.001). The total above-ground biomass ranged from 135.4 to 523.6 Mg ha−1 depending on forest age and tree density. Consequently, and taking into account a carbon conversion factor of 44.09%, carbon stocks in the above-ground biomass of R. apiculata mangrove forests in Southern Vietnam ranged from 59.7 to 230.9 Mg C ha−1. The mean carbon partitioning in the tree biomass was: 77.11% for trunks, 11.87% for branches, 8.66% for prop roots, and 2.36% for leaves. However, this distribution, as well as annual height increments and biomass increase rates, also varied with forest age and tree densities. We suggested that tree density reduction through thinning activities allowed easier tree development, resulting in an increased biomass with enhanced allocation to branches and above-ground prop roots for the stability of the trees. Using the specific allometric equation and specific carbon conversion factor reduced the uncertainty in the estimation of above-ground biomass and carbon stocks. © 2018",,"Biomass; Carbon; Tropics; Above ground biomass; Above-ground carbons; Allometric equations; Allometric models; Carbon conversions; Carbon partitioning; Diameter-at-breast heights; Equatorial regions; Forestry; aboveground biomass; age structure; allometry; carbon sequestration; forest management; height; mangrove; thinning; tree; Biomass; Carbon; Forestry; Forests; Mangrove; Trees; Tropics; Vietnam; Ca Mau; Mekong Delta; Viet Nam; Rhizophora; Rhizophora apiculata; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058481446

The quality of biogas generated by this landfill was monitored in 2013 under passive and forced extraction conditions across 112 extraction wells forming an integrated biogas extraction network. Based on the preliminary results, we can conclude the following: (1) the methane content of biogas produced at the PM landfill was around 45–69%. (2) Forced extraction favored air intrusion through superficial cracks and reduced the methane content of the biogas mixture. (3) Assuming a recovery efficiency of 75%, the biogas flux was estimated at 1081 m3 h−1 (at least 1.8 MW) according to the Mexican model of biogas v. 2.0 for the year 2013. This flux value was less than the value obtained from direct measurement (1505 m3 h−1). A biogas recovery of 908 m3 h−1 is currently estimated, equivalent to 1.5 MW. In conclusion, a good quality and high quantity of biogas is produced at the PM landfill.

How the different modes of WRM will contribute to future overall emissions from infrastructure is therefore of great interest to road owners with a view to a more sustainable, low-carbon future. In the quest for near-zero-emissions transport, all aspects of the transport sector need to be accounted for in the search for possible mitigation of emissions. This study used 35 peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2018 to map available information on the environmental impacts and effect of WRM and reveal any research gaps. The articles were categorized according to their research theme and focus. They were found to focus mainly on the local effects of WRM with emphasis on effects on water. Of the reviewed works, 27 contain information related to the environmental effects of deicers on a local level while five focused on global impact, which was mainly caused by fuel consumption. Only two articles took a holistic look at the system to identify emission sources and the effectiveness of possible changes in operations methods or material selection. In conclusion, WRM would benefit from further research to understand how it affects the natural environment in regions with a cold climate. Furthermore, a life-cycle approach could reveal ways to mitigate emissions through effectively comparing possible changes in the system without shifting the problem to other aspects of road transport. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","De-icer; Emissions; Environmental impact; Life cycle assessment; road salt; Winter road maintenance","Climate change; Life cycle; Maintenance; Particulate emissions; Roads and streets; De-icer; Life cycle approach; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Low-carbon futures; Natural environments; Near-zero emissions; Road salts; Winter road maintenance; Environmental impact; cold region; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; road; road transport; winter",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057524292

In this work, high-throughput sequencing and reverse transcriptase-qPCR (RT-qPCR) was applied to activated sludge samples from three WWTPs for two seasonal periods (winter and summer) and linked with the N2O emissions and wastewater characteristics. The total N2O emissions ranged from 7.2 to 937.0 g N-N2O/day, which corresponds to an emission factor of 0.001 to 0.280% of the influent NH4-N being emitted as N2O. Those emissions were related to the abundance of Nitrotoga, Candidatus Microthrix and Rhodobacter genera, which were favored by higher dissolved oxygen (DO) and nitrate (NO3 −) concentrations in the activated sludge tanks. Furthermore, a relationship between the nirK gene expression and N2O emissions was verified. Detected N2O emission peaks were associated with different process events, related to aeration transition periods, that occurred during the regular operation of the plants, which could be potentially associated to increased emissions of the WWTP. The design of mitigation strategies, such as optimizing the aeration regime, is therefore important to avoid process events that lead to those N2O emissions peaks. Furthermore, this study also demonstrates the importance of assessing the gene expression of nosZ clade II, since its high abundance in WWTPs could be an important key to reduce the N2O emissions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Denitrification; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Nitrification; Nitrous oxide (N2O); Nitrous oxide reductase (NosZ); Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs)","Denitrification; Dissolved oxygen; Gas plants; Gene expression; Microorganisms; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Polymerase chain reaction; Sewage pumping plants; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Greenhouse gas (GHG); High-throughput sequencing; Microbial community structures; Nitrous oxide; Nitrous oxide emissions; Reverse transcriptases; Wastewater characteristics; Wastewater treatment plants; Greenhouse gases; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide; activated sludge; community structure; concentration (composition); denitrification; dissolved oxygen; emission inventory; gene expression; greenhouse gas; microbial community; nitrous oxide; reduction; wastewater treatment plant; activated sludge; Article; bacterium; cladistics; community structure; controlled study; gene; gene expression; high throughput sequencing; microbial community; Microthrix; narG gene; nirK gene; nirS gene; Nitrotoga; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; nosZ gene; nosZ I gene; nosZ II gene; population abundance; priority journal; process optimization; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Rhodobacter; summer; waste water treatment plant; winter; air pollutant; analysis; bioreactor; devices; microbiology; microflora; Portugal; season; sewage; waste water; water pollutant; Candidatus Microthrix; Rhodobacter; Air Pollutants; Bioreactors; Microbiota; Nitrous Oxide; Portugal; Seasons; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054875180

(2017) presented greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the production of major food commodities in India. Emissions of GHGs were calculated using the Cool Farm Tool and were based on farm management data for major crops (including cereals like wheat and rice, pulses, potatoes, fruits and vegetables) and livestock-based products (milk, eggs, chicken and mutton meat). Methods correction We corrected the calculated emissions by fixing errors in the model script and refined the methodological approach to accommodate the fixes. The correction included (i) fixing an error in application of the Stehfest and Bouwman (2006) model for calculating the N2O emissions, (ii) fixing a double counting of methane emissions for rice per kg production, (iii) excluding data points for plots with zero recorded yield (to avoid division by zero in carbon footprints), (iv) choosing appropriate crop classes for cotton and sugarcane, and (v) fix the percentage of rice under flooding conditions as previously it was not representative of the area under this management. Livestock emissions were revised after additional discussion with livestock experts. The new feed emissions were based on the amended GHG emissions of the crops, and the GHG emissions from enteric fermentation and manure were adjusted to match the Indian dataset in Herrero et al. 2013. For each crop and livestock species, weighted average emissions were calculated considering state-level total area under crop obtained from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics of the Government of India (http://eands.dacnet.nic.in) and total number of animals obtained from the 19th livestock census of the Government of India (GOI, 2012). Results update GHG emissions of food items up to farm-gate The updated results are given in Table 1 and Fig. 2. For paddy rice, &gt;10,000 plots were available for analysis with a wide range of management practices, which is reflected in the GHG emission results (Fig. 2B). The main reason for the wide range in GHG emissions seen in rice was water management, the main determinant of CH4 emissions. In particular, continuous flooding generated the highest CH4 emissions, while longer and more frequent periods of drying reduced emissions. For example, changing the water regime from continuously flooded to multiple drying of the field, reduced CH4 emissions 9-fold (data not shown). The GHG emissions weighted by state level area gave a value of 2408 kg ha-1. Emissions of GHGs per kg product i.e. GHG emission intensity (Fig. 2C) varied markedly between livestock types. Emissions were highest for mutton meat (as the example for ruminant meat), followed by other livestock products such as dairy (milk) and poultry products (eggs, poultry meat). Emissions intensities were greater for livestock products than for crops. Mean GHG emissions were &lt;0.8 kg CO2eq kg-1 product for all crops. The intensity of GHG emissions among crops was greatest in rice (0.73 kg CO2eq kg-1), followed by the group of other pulses. Greater GHG emissions intensity in pulses was mainly because of lower yield compared to other crop items. Intensities of GHG emissions from other crop groups were lower in the order of pulses, nuts and oils, cereals, fruits, roots and vegetables. GHG emissions from food consumption in India Fig. 3 A shows relative reported consumption by weight of commodities in the Indian Migration Study (IMS), while 3B shows their relative contribution to emissions. Livestock products other than ruminant meat (principally milk, poultry and eggs) contributed the most to total dietary GHG emissions. Although ruminant meat had the greatest GHG emissions per unit product, it contributed less to overall GHG emissions (21.7%) as consumption was low, accounting for only 0.4% of the mass of total food intake. Rice was the third largest contributor to total emissions (9.4%). Cereals other than rice and fruit products accounted for 12.9% and 22.5% of reported consumption by weight, respectively, yet as their emissions per unit of product were low, they made a relatively small contribution to total dietary GHG emissions, representing only 5.3% and 2% of total emissions, respectively. The groups “other” (including various crops from the subgroups nuts and oils, spices, and vegetables), potato and pulses also contributed little to total dietary GHG emissions compared to livestock. Amended discussion GHG emissions from livestock products Emissions of GHGs associated with livestock products depended largely on feed inputs, and in other studies had been shown to range between 0.8–2.4 kg CO2eq kg-1 milk, 1.7–6.6 kg CO2eq kg-1 eggs, 2.5–6.9 kg CO2eq kg-1 poultry meat and 10–20 kg CO2eq kg-1 mutton and lamb (Bellarby et al., 2013). Most of these values came from model-based studies which focused on Europe. Our results for milk in India were within the range of these studies. The calculated emissions of poultry products were lower than in the above studies, but gave similar results to those reported by Pathak et al. (2010). The GHG emissions for mutton were greater, resulting from embedded emissions in feed, which were 50–75% of the total GHG emissions per-animal-per-year. GHG emissions associated with Indian diets Overall, national GHG emissions associated with diets were greatest for livestock products such as milk and eggs (Fig. 3), because these were widely consumed products with high GHG emissions per unit of product. Although there was limited consumption of ruminant meat in India, its high GHG intensity means that it was the second greatest contributor to GHG emissions. © 2018 The Author(s)",,"Animalia; Gossypium hirsutum; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum",Erratum,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057014866

We study the main time characteristics (ignition delay and combustion duration) of fuel combustion, heat release, anthropogenic emissions. The values of relative efficiency (taking into account energy, environmental and economic indicators) of waste-derived composite fuels are defined in comparison with fuel oil and coal. The optimal concentration of components – 50% of sawdust, 25% of oil component, and 25% of water – allows the maximum efficiency of fuel combustion. In terms of minimizing the cost of ignition, the best is the mixture of 30% of sawdust and 70% of heavy oil.

We found that the method can be successfully applied to a broad range of radiation fields (clinical proton, helium and carbon ion beams) and that the inclusion criterion for fluorescence intensity is key in matching the detection rate of lower-LET particles. In case of carbon beams, the detection of secondary protons with their distribution in polar angle is, however, critically undermined by their apparent similarity to secondary electron tracks and spurious tracks from detector and readout noise.

In Latin America, the urbanization process has involved a loss of these green spaces of high environmental value. These changes have had a series of consequences on the climate of Latin American cities that have been intensified by climate change. Although the contribution of GI to urban climate regulation and to climate change mitigation and adaptation is growing in recognition, the debate has still had little influence on urban planning initiatives, with exceptions in North America and Europe. In Latin America and Africa little is known about how climate change adaptation plans incorporate the development of urban GI. This chapter explores institutional actions to develop GI as an alternative to tackle climate change in Latin American cities. A bibliographic review was conducted using the terms ""green infrastructure"" or ""climate change."" The analysis focused on identifying: responsible institutions, objectives, and the understanding and use of the GI concept. Results indicate that GI has been recently and slowly incorporated into urban planning. This scenario suggests a growing awareness of the need to plan sustainable, green, and more prepared cities to face climate change. However, planners have not considered enough the potential contribution of GI; thus, the role of GI has not been properly identified and valued in urban planning, and planning and design efforts do not maximize the benefits of GI. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

After 2 pretreatment weeks without 3-NOP supplementation, 30 Holstein Friesian cows were divided into 3 homogeneous treatment groups: no additive, 3-NOP mixed in with the basal diet (roughage; NOPbas), and 3-NOP incorporated into a concentrate pellet (NOPconc). The pretreatment period was followed by a 10-wk treatment period in which the NOPbas and NOPconc cows were fed 1.6 g of 3-NOP/cow per day. After the treatment period, a 2-wk washout period followed without 3-NOP supplementation. The CH4 emissions were measured using a GreenFeed unit (C-Lock Inc., Rapid City, SD) installed in a freestall with cubicles during the entire experimental period. On average for the total treatment period and compared with the no-additive group, CH4 production (g/d) was 28 and 23% lower for NOPbas and NOPconc, respectively. Methane yield (g/kg of dry matter intake) and methane intensity (g/kg of milk) were 23 and 24% lower for NOPbas, respectively, and 21 and 22% lower for NOPconc, respectively. No differences were found between NOPbas and NOPconc. Moreover, supplying 3-NOP did not affect total dry matter intake, milk production, or milk composition. The results of this experiment show that 3-NOP can reduce enteric CH4 emissions of dairy cattle when incorporated into a concentrate pellet and that this reduction is not different from the effect of mixing in 3-NOP with the basal diet (roughage). This broadens the possibilities for using 3-NOP in the dairy sector worldwide, as it is not always feasible to provide an additive mixed in with the basal diet. © 2019 American Dairy Science Association","3-nitrooxypropanol; dairy cow; greenhouse gas emission reduction; methane","3-nitrooxypropanol; methane; propanol; analysis; animal; animal food; bovine; diet; dietary fiber; dietary supplement; female; lactation; metabolism; milk; rumen; veterinary medicine; Animal Feed; Animals; Cattle; Diet; Dietary Fiber; Dietary Supplements; Female; Lactation; Methane; Milk; Propanols; Rumen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059011131

Climate sensitive regions result from strong spatial variation of the global climate impact of local non-CO2 emissions, which are expressed by so-called climate change functions. Previous research established high-fidelity climate change functions (CCFs) for aviation water vapour and NOx emissions, and contrail formation with a climate model as inputs for air traffic optimisation. The mitigation potential in this case study is promising but the climate change function simulations are too computationally intensive for real-time calculation and thus cannot be applied operationally. In this study we show for the first time that this problem can be overcome by formulating algorithmic approximations of the global climate impact. Here we approximate water vapour concentration changes from local aviation water vapour emissions, ozone changes from local NOx emissions and methane changes from local NOx emissions (i.e. algorithmic climate change functions; aCCFs) from instantaneous model weather data using regression analysis. Four candidate algorithms are formulated per chemical species and traded off. The final adjusted regression coefficients, indicating how well the aCCFs represent the CCFs, are 0.59, 0.42, and 0.17 for water vapour, ozone and methane. The results show that the meteorology at the time of emission largely controls the fate of the emitted species, where the quality of the aCCF degrades with increasing lifetime of the respective species. © 2018 The Authors","Algorithm; Aviation; Climate impact; Meteorology; Regression analysis","Algorithms; Aviation; Climate models; Meteorology; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Planning; Quality control; Regression analysis; Water vapor; Aircraft trajectory; Anthropogenic climate changes; Climate impacts; Function simulation; Global climate impact; Real-time calculations; Regression coefficient; Spatial variations; Climate change; algorithm; climate change; climate effect; meteorology; methane; nitrogen oxides; ozone; regression analysis; transportation planning; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058996530

In this work, the occurrence of AOM driven by humus-catalyzed dissimilatory iron reduction was investigated in sediments from a coastal mangrove swamp. Anoxic sediment incubations supplied with both goethite (α-FeOOH) and leonardite (humic substances (HS)) displayed an average AOM rate of 10.7 ± 0.8 μmol CH4 cm−3 day−1, which was 7 and 3 times faster than that measured in incubations containing only goethite or HS, respectively. Additional incubations performed with 13C-methane displayed Pahokee Peat HS-mediated carbonate precipitation linked to 13CH4 oxidation and ferrihydrite reduction (~1.3 μmol carbonate cm−3 day−1). These results highlight the role of HS on mitigating greenhouse gases released from wetlands, not only by mediating the AOM process, but also by enhancing carbon sequestration as inert minerals (calcite, aragonite and siderite). © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM); Electron shuttling; Humus; Iron reduction; Natural organic matter","Biological materials; Calcite; Carbon; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Oxidation; Soils; Wetlands; Anaerobic methane oxidations; Electron shuttling; Humus; Iron reduction; Natural organic matters; Anoxic sediments; calcium carbonate; carbon 13; carbonic acid; chemical compound; ferric hydroxide; ferric oxide; leonardite; methane; mineral; siderite; unclassified drug; anoxic sediment; carbon cycle; humic substance; humus; iron oxide; mangrove; marine sediment; methane; microbial activity; oxidation; wetland; anaerobic metabolism; Article; carbon sequestration; chemical phenomena; controlled study; electron shuttling; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; humus; incubation time; mangrove; precipitation; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; sediment; swamp; X ray diffraction; Florida [United States]; Pahokee; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054309431

The wireless charging infrastructure for CAEVs has appeared to be a promising, however, it is yet to be matured. In this paper, we have designed and implemented wireless CAEV charging management system that provides effective communication between the vehicle and wireless charger based on (International Organization for Standardization) ISO 11518-8 standard as well as furnishes automated reservation with the help of the back-end system.

Adapting to increasingly strict environmental norms by the government committed to reducing the national greenhouse gas emissions, growing concerns amongst the citizens over the deteriorating air quality in the cities are the major environmental sustainability challenges for the auto industry in next decade. In this study, we analyze the potential benefits of vehicle lightweighting and introduction of electric vehicles through a cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) of a standard sedan passenger vehicle. Based on the LCA results, five different scenarios are envisioned with different composition of the passenger vehicle fleet in 2030. These scenarios are used to analyze three key enviro-economical goals for India; (1) dependency on crude oil imports, (2) GHG emission reduction targets and (3) improvement in urban air quality. The results indicate that global warming potential (GWP) and fossil depletion impacts of ICEs can be reduced by 17%, while metal depletion reduces by 34% per vehicle with lightweighting. However, increase in freshwater ecotoxicity impact by 57% is one of the trade-offs. The GWP of a compact BEV powered with current (2014) and 2030 electricity grid mixes is 36% and 16% higher than petrol car. The GWP of a sub-compact BEV powered with current grid mix is 9% higher with current grid mix but 14% lower than petrol cars when powered with 2030 electricity grid mix. Crude oil consumption and GHG emissions are reduced by 20% with lightweight ICE fleet. Whereas, up to 45% reduction in crude oil consumption and 65% improvement in urban air quality can be achieved with BEV penetration scenarios. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","2030 passenger vehicle fleet; Compact and sub compact BEV; LCA and environmental performance; Lightweighted ICEs; Reduction of crude oil imports; Urban air quality improvement","Air quality; Automotive industry; Commerce; Crude oil; Economic and social effects; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Environmental management; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Petroleum analysis; Sustainable development; Vehicle performance; Crude oil import; Environmental performance; Environmental sustainability; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Passenger vehicles; Urban air quality; Vehicle lightweighting; Vehicle-to-grid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056868529

This study examined the premise under which VPLUPs implementation can enhance the management and conservation of Village Land Forest Reserves (VLFRs) in the context of Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation plus (REDD+) initiative in the Kilosa district of Tanzania. A mixed method research design, which integrates participatory community mapping (PCM), focus group discussions (FGDs), key informants interviews (KIIs), direct observations, and household interviews were used in data collection. The results showed that there were significant (p < 0.05) improvements in forest management and conservation indicators after VPLUPs implementation, and increase in the management and conservation activities carried out by the community after the implementation of VPLUPs. There was also a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in almost all uses of the forest after the implementation of VPLUPs. The findings provide evidence that the VPLUP model has potential for enhancing the management and conservation of forests in the context of REDD+ strategy. Thus, it is argued that VPLUP can be used as a forest management and conservation tool to facilitate the implementation of the REDD+ initiatives. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.","Community perceptions; conservation; forest management; Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation; Village Land Forest Reserves; Village Participatory Land Use Plans","Conservation; Deforestation; Forestry; Land use; Rural areas; Community perceptions; Direct observations; Forest degradation; Forest reserves; Land-use plan; Management and conservations; Natural resource management; Research designs; Natural resources management; conservation management; deforestation; environmental policy; forest management; land use change; local participation; perception; Conservation; Deforestation; Forest Management; Forestry; Interviews; Land Use; Reserves; Tanzania; Kilosa; Morogoro [Tanzania]; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054711991

However, the technical performance variation combined with inadequate financial assessment and insufficient environmental impact data associated with the deployment of those innovative district heating systems represents a big challenge for the broad implementation of CSHPSS in Europe. In this context, our paper presents a comprehensive evaluation for the possibility of integrating CSHPSS in the residential sector in various EU member states through the formulation of a multi-objective optimization framework. This framework comprises the life cycle cost analysis for the economic evaluation and the life cycle assessment for the environmental impact estimation simultaneously. The technical performance is also considered by satisfying both the space heating demand and the domestic hot water services. The methodological framework is applied to a residential neighborhood community of 1120 apartments in various EU climate zones with Madrid, Athens, Berlin, and Helsinki acting as a proxy for the Mediterranean continental, Mediterranean, central European, and Nordic climates, respectively. The optimization results regarding the energy performance show that the CSHPSS can achieve a renewable energy fraction above 90% for the investigated climate zones. At the same time, the environmental assessment shows significant improvement when using the CSHPSS in comparison to a natural gas heating system, in those cases the environmental impact is reduced up to 82.1–86.5%. On the other hand, substantial economic improvement is limited, especially in the Mediterranean climate zone (Athens) due to low heating demands and the prices of the non-renewable resources. There the total economic cost of the CSHPSS plants can increase up to 50.8% compared to a natural gas heating system. However, considering the incremental tendency in natural gas prices all over EU nowadays, the study of future plant costs confirms its favorable long-term economic feasibility. © 2018 The Authors","2030 climate and energy EU targets; Central solar heating plant with seasonal storage; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Life cycle cost (LCC); Multi-objective optimization; Solar community","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Digital storage; District heating; Economic analysis; Gas heating; Heating equipment; Housing; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Solar heating; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle cost analysis; Life cycle costs (LCC); Methodological frameworks; Renewable energy fractions; Residential neighborhoods; Seasonal storage; Solar community; Environmental impact; cost; environmental assessment; environmental impact; European Union; greenhouse gas; heating; innovation; life cycle analysis; Mediterranean environment; optimization; residential location; solar power; standard (regulation); Athens [Attica]; Attica; Berlin; Europe; Finland; Germany; Greece; Helsinki; Madrid [Spain]; Scandinavia; Spain; Varsinais-Suomi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057550745

However, there is little understanding of the impacts on CO 2 fluxes, especially across the growing season. Furthermore, while widespread shoot mortality is commonly observed with browning events, recent observations show that shoot stress responses are also common, and manifest as high levels of persistent anthocyanin pigmentation. Whether or how this response impacts ecosystem CO 2 fluxes is not known. To address these research needs, a growing season assessment of browning impacts following frost drought and extreme winter warming (both extreme climatic events) on the key ecosystem CO 2 fluxes Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (R eco ) and soil respiration (R soil ) was carried out in widespread sub-Arctic dwarf shrub heathland, incorporating both mortality and stress responses. Browning (mortality and stress responses combined) caused considerable site-level reductions in GPP and NEE (of up to 44%), with greatest impacts occurring at early and late season. Furthermore, impacts on CO 2 fluxes associated with stress often equalled or exceeded those resulting from vegetation mortality. This demonstrates that extreme events can have major impacts on ecosystem CO 2 balance, considerably reducing the carbon sink capacity of the ecosystem, even where vegetation is not killed. Structural Equation Modelling and additional measurements, including decomposition rates and leaf respiration, provided further insight into mechanisms underlying impacts of mortality and stress on CO 2 fluxes. The scale of reductions in ecosystem CO 2 uptake highlights the need for a process-based understanding of Arctic browning in order to predict how vegetation and CO 2 balance will respond to continuing climate change. © 2018 The Authors.

Across North America, green roofs often make use of the same limited set of plant species, but the effects of regional climates on the survival and growth of a core set of plant species has seldom been investigated. To identify the impact of climate on green roof plant performance, we installed an identical green roof system in three Canadian cities that experience different climate conditions: Calgary, Alberta; London, Ontario; and Halifax, Nova Scotia. The green roofs were monitored across three growing seasons for plant survival, plant height, and canopy density of three species grown in monoculture: Aquilegia canadensis, Sporobolus heterolepis, and Sedum spurium, and a mixture planting with all three species. Green roof vegetation canopy density, plant height and growth rates differed by city, plant species, substrate depth and planting type (monoculture or mixture treatment). Between sites, plant species exhibited different growth phenologies. Mixture treatments performed slightly better than monoculture plantings at each site in canopy density measures but were not significantly greater in plant height measures. The growth rate between years two and three was greatest for the mixture treatment, indicating greater potential for long term survival and performance of mixture plantings. The London, Ontario site, with a relatively moderate climate, supported the best green roof growth and performance compared to the cooler and drier Calgary and the rainier Halifax. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Canopy density; Climate; Extensive green roof; Monoculture; Native plants; Polyculture; Species mixture","Ecosystems; Mixtures; Canopy density; Climate; Extensive green roofs; Monoculture; Native plants; Poly cultures; Species mixtures; Roofs; canopy; climatic region; density; experiment; greenspace; growing season; growth; growth rate; monoculture; native species; polyculture; roof; survival; Alberta; Calgary; Canada; England; Halifax; London [England]; North America; Nova Scotia; Ontario [Canada]; United Kingdom; Aquilegia canadensis; Phedimus spurius; Sporobolus heterolepis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054431554

Online-electrochemical mass spectrometry (OLEMS) results revealed that the onset potential of the quadrupole mass spectrometer (Q-mass) ion signal for the reduction product carbon monoxide (CO; m/z = 28) is ca. 0.3 V lower on the Au(110) surface than on the Au(111) and (100) surfaces. Furthermore, the Au(110) surface showed the highest selectivity for CO generation in the potential region of 0.4 V to 1.4 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE); the relative, OLEMS-corrected ECR partial current density for generated CO at 0.76 V was ca. 20-fold higher compared with the Au(100) and (111) surfaces. The Tafel slope of Au(110) at the onset potential region (around 0.4 V) was much smaller than that of the Au(111) and (100) surfaces, suggesting that Au(110) shows the fastest ECR kinetics among the low-index Au surfaces. The results obtained in this study reveal that the ECR efficiency as well as the selectivity for CO generation on Au electrode surfaces can be dominated by the surface atomic arrangements and that relative Faradaic selectivity evaluation by OLEMS is helpful for discussion of the ECR process. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; electrochemical CO 2 reduction; gold electrode; online electrochemical mass spectrometry; single crystal surfaces","Atoms; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Electrochemical electrodes; Mass spectrometers; Mass spectrometry; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Reduction; Single crystal surfaces; CO2 reduction; Gold electrodes; Online electrochemical mass spectrometries; Potential region; Quadrupole mass spectrometer; Reduction products; Reversible hydrogen electrodes; Surface atomic arrangements; Gold",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060309580

They also provide ecosystem services that play important roles in relation to nutrient cycling, climate mitigation and adaptation, as well as food security. In this research, we examined and projected the spatiotemporal trends of change in open wetlands by coupling logistic regression, Markov chain methods and a multi-objective land allocation model into a hybrid geosimulation model. To study the changes in open wetlands we used multi-temporal land cover information interpreted from LANDSAT images (1985, 1995, and 2005). We predicted future spatial distributions of open wetlands in the administrative region of Abitibi-Témiscamingue, Quebec, Canada for 2015, 2025, 2035, 2045 and 2055. A comparison and assessment of the model's outcomes were performed using map-comparison techniques as well as landscape metrics. Change analysis between 1985 and 2005 showed an increase of about 63% in open wetlands, while simulation results indicated that this tendency would persist into 2055 with a continuous augmentation of open wetlands in the region. The spatial distribution of predicted trends in open wetlands could provide support to local biodiversity assessments, management and conservation planning of the open wetlands in Quebec, Canada. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Logistic regression; Markov-chain; Multi-objective optimization; Open wetlands; Spatiotemporal modelling","biodiversity; conservation planning; environmental management; Markov chain; modeling; optimization; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; wetland; Abitibi; Canada; Quebec [Canada]; Temiscamingue; Amphibia; Anatidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062895320

Very few studies have compared the carbon emissions of YREB with that of non-YREB and furthermore, have not considered regional differences and radial or non-radial characteristics in their analysis. This paper thus selects the energy consumption data of 19 provinces and cities in YREB and 19 provinces and cities in non-YREB from 2013 to 2016, constructs the modified meta-frontier Epsilou-based measure (EBM) data envelopment analysis (DEA) model and adds an undesirable factor, energy consumption, and CO2 emission efficiency of each province and city of the two regions. The results are as follows. (1) China’s provinces and cities have different energy efficiency scores in energy consumption, economic growth, and CO2 emissions. The regional ranks and technology gaps of five provinces and cities in non-YREB and of four provinces and cities in YREB exhibit a decline. Overall, the ranks and technology gaps of the provinces and cities in YREB are significantly lower than those in non-YREB, meaning that there is greater room for efficiency improvement in the latter region. (2) The gross domestic product (GDP) and CO2 efficiency values of non-YREB provinces present great differences, especially the CO2 efficiency value that ranges from 0.2 to 1, while their values in YREB are more balanced with little difference between provinces and cities. Thus, YREB is more coordinated in terms of energy savings and air pollutant reduction. (3) Some cities with good economic development such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin have regional and technology gap values of one, indicating that they not only target economic growth but also address energy savings and air pollutant reduction. The regional rank and technology gap values of some underdeveloped provinces such as Neimenggu, Ningxia, and Qinghai are also one. Finally, this research proposes countermeasures and recommendations to both areas. © 2019 by the authors.

Although there are numerous strategies for reducing NH3 emission from agricultural systems, the effectiveness of these measures is highly variable. Furthermore, the integrated assessment of measures to reduce NH3 emission both from livestock production and cropping systems based on animal and crop type is lacking. Therefore, we conducted a global meta-analysis and integrated assessment of measures to reduce NH3 emission from agricultural systems. Most of the studied mitigation strategies were effective in reducing NH3 emission. In the livestock production system, dietary additive, urease inhibitor (UI), manure acidification and deep manure placement have the highest mitigation potential relative to other mitigation strategies, with reduction ranges of 35.1–54.2%, 24.3–68.7%, 88.8–95.0%, and 93.8–99.7%, respectively, relative to the control, while manure storage management could significantly reduce NH3 emission by 70.0–82.1%. In the cropping system, fertilizer source, use of enhanced efficiency fertilizers, and method of field application are most effective for reducingNH3 emission. The use of ammonium nitrate, controlled release fertilizer (CRF), and deep placement of fertilizers could reduce NH3 emission by 88.3, 56.8, and 48.0%, respectively. Choosing a proper fertilizer is critical for decreasing NH3 emission from cropping systems. We conclude that carefully planned and adopted strategies suited for local conditions are promising for minimizing NH3 emission from agricultural systems on a global scale, while possible effects of those mitigation measures on the emission of greenhouse gases should be studied in the future. Ammonia emission from agricultural sources could be markedly reduced by mitigation measures based on this meta-analysis. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural system; Ammonia emission; Fertilizer source; Manure management; Meta-analysis; Reduction strategy","Acidification; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Ammonia; Biodiversity; Eutrophication; Greenhouse gases; Manures; Soil pollution; Storage management; Water pollution; Agricultural system; Ammonia emissions; Fertilizer sources; Manure management; Meta analysis; Reduction strategy; Fertilizers; agricultural chemical; ammonia; ammonium nitrate; fertilizer; food additive; urease inhibitor; ammonia; nitric acid derivative; ammonia; emission; emission control; farming system; fertilizer; integrated approach; manure; meta-analysis; acidification; agricultural waste; air pollution; Article; cropping system; environmental management; farming system; greenhouse gas; livestock; manure; meta analysis (topic); waste management; agriculture; air pollution; analysis; animal; chemistry; meta analysis; prevention and control; procedures; soil; Animalia; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Ammonia; Animals; Fertilizers; Livestock; Manure; Nitrates; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057183597

Biofunctool® uses a set of twelve indicators to monitor changes in three key soil functions: carbon transformation, nutrient cycling and structure maintenance (part A). Information from all the indicators is integrated in a Soil Quality Index using multivariate analysis (PCA) weighting. We used Biofunctool® to assess the impact of land use, land use change and agricultural practices on soil quality. The Biofunctool® index was measured for soils in Thailand within rubber plantations, forests and intensive cash crops (cassava and sugar cane). The results demonstrate that the Biofunctool® index provides an aggregated synthetic soil functioning score that is sensitive to land management and is robust in various pedo-climatic contexts. Firstly, the index revealed the impact on soil of land conversion from annual cropping to rubber plantations and ranked the effect on soil with respect to a natural forest reference. Secondly, it showed the positive effect of legume cover-crops on soil functioning. Thirdly, it highlighted a trend of improving soil quality with increasing age of rubber plantations, in contrasted pedo-climatic contexts. It is concluded that the Biofunctool® index is a reliable and relevant descriptor of integrated soil functioning (i.e. soil quality) that could be useful for environmental impact assessment at regional to global scales. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biofunctool® index; Indicators; Land management; Rubber plantation; Soil Quality Index","Crops; Environmental impact; Environmental impact assessments; Forestry; Indicators (instruments); Land use; Multivariant analysis; Rubber; Rubber plantations; Sugar cane; Agricultural practices; Land conversion; Land managements; Legume cover crops; Multi variate analysis; Natural forests; Nutrient cycling; Soil quality index; Soils; agricultural practice; cash cropping; cover crop; deciduous tree; environmental impact assessment; environmental indicator; environmental monitoring; index method; land management; legume; nutrient cycling; soil quality; transformation; Thailand; Manihot esculenta; Saccharum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055262208

In Southeast-Asia, the shift from swidden farming to permanent cash crop systems has led to a wide range of impacts on ESS. Our study area, the Nabanhe Reserve in Yunnan province (PR China), saw the loss of extensive forest areas and the expansion of rubber (Hevea brasiliensis Müll. Arg.) plantations. In this study, we model water yield and sediment export for a rubber-dominated watershed under multiple scenarios of land use and climate change in order to assess how both drivers influence the supply of these ESS. For this we use three stakeholder-validated land use scenarios, varying in their degree of rubber expansion and land management rules. As projected climate change varies remarkably between different climate models, we combined the land use scenarios with datasets of temperature and precipitation changes, derived from nine General Circulation Models (GCMs) of the Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) in order to model water yield and sediment export with InVEST (Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs). Simulation results show that the effect of land use and land management decisions on water yield in Nabanhe Reserve are relatively minor (4% difference in water yield between land use scenarios), when compared to the effects that future climate change will exert on water yield (up to 15% increase or 13% decrease in water yield compared to the baseline climate). Changes in sediment export were more sensitive to land use change (15% increase or 64% decrease) in comparison to the effects of climate change (up to 10% increase). We conclude that in the future, particularly dry years may have a more pronounced effect on the water balance as the higher potential evapotranspiration increases the probability for periods of water scarcity, especially in the dry season. The method we applied can easily be transferred to regions facing comparable land use situations, as InVEST and the IPCC data are freely available. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Ecosystem services; InVEST; Land use change; Rubber plantation","Climate models; Crops; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Indium compounds; Land use; Rubber; Rubber plantations; Sediments; Ecosystem services; General circulation model; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; InVEST; Land-use change; Potential evapotranspiration; Precipitation change; Valuation of ecosystem services; Climate change; climate change; climate conditions; ecosystem service; land management; land use change; plantation; rubber; sediment transport; water budget; water yield; watershed; Ecosystems; Farm Crops; Indium Compounds; Land Use; Rubber; Sediments; China; Nabanhe National Nature Reserve; Yunnan; Hevea brasiliensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061840989

The chemical formula for the materials disposed of in volume base waste fee (VBWF) bags that are processed in WTE plants was calculated as: C 6 H 9.9 O 2.3 , with a heat of formation of 27.6 MJ/kg. The average heating value for the 35 WTE plants was 9.7 MJ/kg, and the average amount of energy recovered was calculated at 1.5 MWh/ton waste processed. 22 of the 35 WTE plants comply with the limits of the R1 formula for energy recovery plants (R1 &gt; 0.61), as introduced by the EU. It was estimated that 8% of the district heating demand is provided by WTE in S. Korea. WTE plants can contribute to about 0.6% to the total electricity demand of S. Korea and aid the efforts of the nation to phase out the dependence on fossil fuels. The average dioxin emissions of all WTE plants were 0.005 ng TEQ/Nm 3 (limit:0.1 ng TEQ/Nm 3 ), and most of the other pollutants examined indicated a ten-fold to hundred-fold lower emissions than the national and the EU standards. S.

This paper examines what has happened to these two major sources of mercury emissions since 1989. A comparison within the waste management industry is, also, provided. The 2014 total anthropogenic emissions of mercury in the U.S. were 51.4 t. The results of the analysis of emissions by industrial sector showed that the largest source of anthropogenic mercury were coal-fired power plants. Among industrial processes, the ferrous metals recycling and the cement industries were the largest emitters of mercury. With regard to waste-to-energy power plants, all of which, since the nineties, have installed advanced emission control systems, the results have been very satisfactory: The authors obtained mercury emission data from operators of most of the waste-to-energy (WTE) power plants in the US. The results showed that in 2014 the 77 U.S. WTE plants in total emitted 0.35 tons of mercury, corresponding to 0.73% of the U.S. total. This number was one half of that reported by the National Emissions Inventory (NEI) for “municipal waste combustion’’ (0.64 t) due to the fact that the NEI survey included incinerators without energy recovery. A 2002 Earth Engineering Center study had shown that the mercury emissions of the U.S. WTE industry decreased from 81.8 t in 1989 to 2.2 t in 2001. The present study showed that between 2001 and 2014 the U.S. WTE industry mercury emissions were reduced further, by a factor of seven. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Coal-fired power plants; Emissions; Mercury sources; U.S. inventory; Waste to energy","Air pollution; Cement industry; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal fueled furnaces; Emission control; Industrial plants; Mining; Particulate emissions; Waste incineration; Waste management; Anthropogenic emissions; Anthropogenic mercury; Coal-fired power plant; Municipal waste combustions; National emissions inventories; U.S. inventory; Waste to energy; Waste-to-energy power plants; Fossil fuel power plants; mercury; coal; atmospheric pollution; coal-fired power plant; emission control; mercury (element); source apportionment; waste technology; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; cement industry; combustion; electric power plant; fire; incineration; iron and steel industry; landfill; municipal solid waste; priority journal; recycling; United States; waste disposal; waste management; waste-to-energy plant; air pollutant; atmosphere; United States; Air Pollutants; Atmosphere; Coal; Incineration; Mercury; Power Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058552208

Societal transformation in the context of multi-functional protection schemes offers potential in this regard. However, the drivers and barriers of societal transformation in hazard management are poorly understood. Here we interrogate drivers and barriers of societal transformation in natural hazard management through case studies in Austria, France and Ireland focusing on attempts to integrate multi-functional protection schemes in the context of flood and avalanche hazards. We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders connected to proposed transformative strategies in the selected case studies. We find that transformative approaches have been mainly supported by local initiatives instigated by local governments, residents, or NGOs with the aim of complementing conventional hazard management policies. Our analysis shows that local actors and stakeholders often pursue initiatives to address local problems or to seize local opportunities rather than to contribute to a broader societal transformation. According to our findings, key drivers of community-based initiatives with multiple functionality and use include: (i) lack of funding, (ii) lack of legal protection or (iii) lack of space, where classical risk management measures can no longer respond to new circumstances. In contrast, key barriers relate to: (i) lack of local capacities, (ii) lack of local political support and (iii) technological challenges in the implementation phase. These insights support European regions currently working on the implementation of climate change adaptation strategies arising from natural hazards. © 2018 The Authors","Adaptation; Barriers; Bottom-up approach; Drivers; Multi-functional; Societal transformation","Climate change; Risk assessment; Risk management; Truck drivers; Adaptation; Barriers; Bottom up approach; Multi-functional; Societal transformation; Hazards; adaptation; bottom-up approach; climate change; hazard assessment; hazard management; natural hazard; risk assessment; vulnerability; adult; article; Austria; climate change; driver; France; funding; government; human; Ireland; resident; risk management; semi structured interview; adaptation; cultural anthropology; Europe; procedures; safety; Austria; France; Ireland; Adaptation, Physiological; Climate Change; Culture; Europe; Humans; Risk Management; Safety Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053129746

Drawing on these data we evaluate their relation to cultural/economic changes during the early to late Harappan phases in the peripheral zone of southwest monsoon. Between ca. 5400-5100 yr BP, palynofacies and sediment particle size indicated a high terrestrial influx, interpreted as a period of higher monsoon precipitation. These proxies then indicated a protracted period of diminished freshwater inundation between ca. 5100-1400 yr BP. At the start of this period, archaeobotanical evidence from studied sites in the region also shows the shift in cropping pattern from large grain winter cereals during the Urban Harappan phases to millet based agriculture during the Post-Urban phase, indicating human adaptation in response to climate change. These strategies also appeared contingent on the geographic niche and site type, size and density. The Harshad core from 1400 yr BP to recent times also demonstrates fluctuating precipitation proxies between lower and higher values which may broadly correspond to climate events such as the Medieval Climate Optimum (MCO) and Little Ice Age (LIA), as well reflecting increasing anthropogenic pressures impacting the depositional environment of the estuary. © 2019","Harshad estuary; Little ice age; Medieval climate optimum; Palynofacies; Urban Harappan","climate change; cultural change; Little Ice Age; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; palynology; reconstruction; Gujarat; India; Saurashtra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062806192

Of concern is the potential for a projected warmer future climate to further compound heat waves in urban environments. The present study investigates the interaction of a 2006 heat wave in North America with two urban environments (Phoenix and New York City (NYC)) in current climate and future climate simulations. The future climate conditions were generated using the pseudo-global warming methodology. Multiple high-resolution (3 km) simulations were performed using the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the single-layer urban canopy model to improve representation of urban processes and we explore how irrigated green roofs and cool roofs can mitigate heat wave amplification by UHIs. To quantify heat wave intensity, an analytical model is applied to the WRF model output that considers the urban surface heat and water vapor exchanges with the atmosphere. A future, warmer climate is found to amplify the UHI intensity during heat waves in both Phoenix (21%) and NYC (48%), but the amplification is of great uncertainty as its magnitude is comparable to the temporal variability of temperatures. The increase in urban heat index can be almost completely offset by adopting irrigated green roofs in urban areas, and partially offset by adopting cool roofs. © 2019 The Author(s).

Nonetheless, the energy production from renewable sources is intermittent and stochastic, and cogeneration units are characterized by fixed power-to-heat ratios, which are incompatible with fluctuating thermal and electric demands. These drawbacks can be partially overcome by smart operational controls that are capable of maximizing the energy system performance. Moreover, electrically driven heat pumps may add flexibility to the system, by shifting thermal loads into electric loads. In this paper, a novel configuration for smart multi-energy microgrids, which combines centralized and distributed energy units is proposed. A centralized cogeneration system, consisting of an internal combustion engine is connected to a micro-district heating network. Distributed electric heat pumps assist the thermal production at the building level, giving operational flexibility to the system and supporting the integration of renewable energy technologies, i.e., wind turbines, photovoltaic panels, and solar thermal collectors. The proposed configuration was tested in a hypothetical case study, namely, a University Campus located in Trieste, Italy. The system operation is based on a cost-optimal control strategy and the effect of the size of the cogeneration unit and heat pumps was investigated. A comparison with a conventional configuration, without distributed heat pumps, was also performed. The results show that the proposed configuration outperformed the conventional one, leading to a total-cost saving of around 8%, a carbon emission reduction of 11%, and a primary energy saving of 8%. © 2019 by the authors.","Cogeneration; District heating; Energy microgrids; Energy system integration; Energy system optimization; Heat pumps; Hybrid renewable systems; Smart building clusters","District heating; Emission control; Energy conservation; Heat pump systems; Heating equipment; Internal combustion engines; Optimal control systems; Photovoltaic cells; Pumps; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Stochastic systems; Wind turbines; Cogeneration; Energy system optimizations; Energy systems; Heat pumps; Micro grid; Cogeneration plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067236783

According to future scenarios, mountain regions are highly vulnerable to climate impacts, including changes in the water cycle (e.g. rainfall extremes, melting of glaciers, river runoff), loss of biodiversity and ecosystems services, damages to local economy (drinking water supply, hydropower generation, agricultural suitability) and human safety (risks of natural hazards). This is due to their exposure to recent climate warming (e.g. temperature regime changes, thawing of permafrost) and the high degree of specialization of both natural and human systems (e.g. mountain species, valley population density, tourism-based economy). These characteristics call for the application of risk assessment methodologies able to describe the complex interactions among multiple hazards, biophysical and socio-economic systems, towards climate change adaptation. Current approaches used to assess climate change risks often address individual risks separately and do not fulfil a comprehensive representation of cumulative effects associated to different hazards (i.e. compound events). Moreover, pioneering multi-layer single risk assessment (i.e. overlapping of single-risk assessments addressing different hazards) is still widely used, causing misleading evaluations of multi-risk processes. This raises key questions about the distinctive features of multi-risk assessments and the available tools and methods to address them. Here we present a review of five cutting-edge modelling approaches (Bayesian networks, agent-based models, system dynamic models, event and fault trees, and hybrid models), exploring their potential applications for multi-risk assessment and climate change adaptation in mountain regions. The comparative analysis sheds light on advantages and limitations of each approach, providing a roadmap for methodological and technical implementation of multi-risk assessment according to distinguished criteria (e.g. spatial and temporal dynamics, uncertainty management, cross-sectoral assessment, adaptation measures integration, data required and level of complexity). The results show limited applications of the selected methodologies in addressing the climate and risks challenge in mountain environments. In particular, system dynamic and hybrid models demonstrate higher potential for further applications to represent climate change effects on multi-risk processes for an effective implementation of climate adaptation strategies. © 2018","Agent-based model; Bayesian network; Climate change adaptation; Event trees; Multi-risk assessment; System dynamic modelling","adaptive management; Bayesian analysis; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; complexity; ecosystem service; future prospect; hydrological cycle; local economy; modeling; mountain region; nature-society relations; risk assessment; socioeconomic conditions; warming; climate change; human; review; risk assessment; uncertainty; acclimatization; Bayes theorem; ecosystem; risk assessment; Acclimatization; Bayes Theorem; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Humans; Risk Assessment",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059297279

Microalgae can be used as an alternative treatment to reach the required effluent quality. However, only robust and fast growing microalgae species are required in order to ensure stable and efficient nutrient removal under the conditions existing in wastewater treatment plants. Consequently, maintaining a stable microalgae community adapted to this environment becomes a key issue. In this work, a local microalgal strain was isolated from an anaerobic digester effluent (ADE). Microalgal growth was defined as the isolation criteria. The isolated microalgae were identified by molecular techniques as Chlorella sorokiniana (strain S12/S13/S16). Nutrient removal capacity from the ADE was assessed for the isolated strain by cultivation on ADE in repeated batch mode. Growth was limited by phosphorus, which reached removal efficiencies close to 100%. Under such conditions, biomass productivity and growth rate were barely enhanced with CO 2 -enriched air not compensating the extra cost of CO 2 addition. Finally, in order to close the process scheme, the methane potential of the isolated C. sorokiniana was assessed. The methane production capacity was 376 mL CH 4  g −1 volatile solids, similar to values reported for other microalgae species.

The largest ecological restoration program ever implemented in China, the first round of the countrywide Grain for Green Program (GGP), finished in 2010. However, it is not known whether the ecological changes that resulted from the GGP met the restoration goal across the whole implementation region. In this study, we monitored and assessed the ecological changes in the whole GGP region in China over the lifetime of the first round of implementation (2000-2010), by establishing a comprehensive assessment indicator system composed of ecosystem pattern, ecosystem quality (EQ), and key ecosystem services (ESs). Remote sensing interpretation, ecological model simulations based on multi-source images, and trend analysis were used to generate land use and land cover (LULC) datasets and estimate ES and ESs indicators. Results showed that while forest increased by 0.77%, artificial land increased more intensely by 22.38%, and cropland and grassland decreased by 1.81% and 0.68%, respectively. The interconversion of cropland and forest played a primary role in ecosystem pattern change. The increase in ecosystem quality measures, including fractional vegetation cover (0.1459% yr -1 ), leaf area index (0.0121 yr -1 ), and net primary productivity (2.6958 gC m -2 yr -1 ), and the mitigation of ecosystem services deterioration in soil water loss (-0.0841 t ha yr -1 ) and soil wind loss (-1.0071 t ha yr -1 ) in the GGP region, indicated the positive ecological change in the GGP region to some extent, while southern GGP subregions improved more than the those in the north on the whole. The GGP implementation other than climate change impacted ecological change, with contributions of 14.23%, 9.94%, 8.23%, 30.45%, and 18.05% in the ecological outputs mentioned above, respectively. However, the water regulation did not improve (-2283 t km -2 yr -1 ), revealing trade-offs between ecosystem services and inappropriate afforestation in ecological restoration programs. Future GGP implementation should change the practice of large-scale afforestation, and focus more on the restoration of existing forest and cultivation of young plantings, formulating rational and specific plans and designs for afforestation areas through the establishment of near-natural vegetation communities, instead of single-species plantations, guided by regional climate and geographical characteristics. © 2019 by the authors.","Ecological monitoring and assessment; Ecosystem services; Grain for Green Program; Land use and land cover; Remote sensing; Trade-offs","Climate change; Conservation; Deterioration; Economic and social effects; Image reconstruction; Land use; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Restoration; Soil moisture; Vegetation; Ecological monitoring; Ecosystem services; Grain for greens; Land use and land cover; Trade off; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061373370

Using first-principles calculations, we have found that Cu2Si nanoribbons with an armchair edge (labeled as A &gt; CuSi) and a zigzag edge ending with Cu or Si (labeled as Z &gt; Cu and Z &gt; Si) have a strong reduction ability to activate CO2 to COOH with low barriers. Especially, Z &gt; Si is most effective for further hydrogenation, displaying a capability of transferring eight electrons to produce CH4 with a low free energy change of 0.24 eV. Furthermore, the undesired hydrogen evolution reaction can also be suppressed on Z &gt; Si, exhibiting excellent performance and good selectivity for CO2 reduction.

It also reviews the mitigation and adaptations undertaken, and future strategies to manage the impacts of regional climate change. Methodology: The review encompasses historical climate data comprising mean daily temperature, precipitation, mean sea level and occurrences of extreme weather events. Future climate projections have also been reviewed in addition to scholarly papers and news articles related to impacts, contributors, mitigation and adaptations in relation to climate change. Findings: The review shows that annual mean temperature, occurrences of extreme weather events and mean sea level are rising while rainfall shows variability. Future projections point to continuous rise of temperature and mean sea level till the end of the 21st century, highly variable rainfall and increased frequency of extreme weather events. Climate change impacts particularly on agriculture, forestry, biodiversity, water resources, coastal and marine resources, public health and energy. The energy and waste management sectors are the major contributors to climate change. Mitigation of and adaptations to climate change in Malaysia revolve around policy setting, enactment of laws, formulation and implementation of plans and programmes, as well as global and regional collaborations, particularly for energy, water resources, agriculture and biodiversity. There are apparent shortcomings in continuous improvement and monitoring of the programmes as well as enforcement of the relevant laws.

One of the consequences of the warming is encroachment by herbaceous plants from forests at low elevations into alpine ecosystems. In the Changbai Mountains, narrowleaf small reed (Deyeuxia angustifolia (Kom.) Y. L. Chang) from mountain birch forests encroached upward into alpine tundra, gradually replacing native tundra shrubs such as Rhododendron (Rhododendron aureum Georgi). How encroaching plants affect native plant communities is not fully understood. In this study, we analyzed above- and belowground biomass of alpine plant communities at five encroachment levels to investigate how biomass allocation changed at species and community scales. Our research showed that native plants are forced to change their morphology to cope with competition, at both above- and belowground levels, from encroaching plants. We found that (1) R. aureum increased the shoot height and leaf area in order to compete with D. angustifolia; (2) above- and belowground biomass of D. angustifolia increased while above- and belowground biomass of R. aureum decreased with increasing levels of encroachment; and (3) D. angustifolia encroachment reduced the total biomass of alpine tundra. Encroachment by herbaceous plants has a long-term negative impact on the ability of tundra plants to sequester carbon in the alpine tundra of the Changbai Mountains. © 2019 by the authors.","Alpine tundra; Biomass allocation; Competition; Herbaceous encroachment","Biomass; Competition; Forestry; Global warming; Landforms; Alpine tundra; Belowground biomass; Belowground competition; Biomass allocation; Changbai Mountains; Herbaceous encroachment; Herbaceous plants; Plant communities; Plants (botany); aboveground biomass; belowground biomass; biomass; competition (ecology); herb; montane forest; morphology; plant community; tundra; Betula Odorata; Biomass; Competition; Forestry; Forests; Mountains; Plants; Baekdu Mountain; Changbai Mountains; Betula pubescens subsp. tortuosa; Rhododendron; Rhododendron aureum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061818209

A three-dimensional urban model was designed and applied to capture the circulation flow and channeling flow in street canyons. The effects of building height, aspect ratio and roof shape on CO2 cloud dispersion were studied by wind tunnel experiment and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) method. Building Reynolds number was calculated to ensure Reynolds number independence and turbulent flow. The results of model evaluation indicate that 100% of the predictions were within a factor of two of the experimental measurements (FAC2), and the relative mean bias (MG) was about 7%. CO2 behaved as a dense gas, whose volume fraction was more than 30% near the ground and about 5% in the upper region, respectively. Only 0.5% of CO2 removed from the canyon was through the top opening. Increasing windward-side building height enhanced vertical recirculation, thus reduced CO2 volume fraction from 22.9% (equal to 422 g/m3) to 14.5% (267 g/m3). Increasing aspect ratio to 3/2 could take greater amount of air into the canyon through the larger area of the openings, and then reduced CO2 volume fraction to 15.9% (293 g/m3). © 2018","CO2 dispersion; Flows in street canyons; Geometric effect; Urban micrometeorology","Accidents; Aspect ratio; Computational fluid dynamics; Dispersions; Reynolds number; Volume fraction; Wind tunnels; Accidental release; Computational fluid dynamics methods; Geometric effects; Model evaluation; Street canyon; Urban micrometeorology; Urban street canyon; Wind tunnel experiment; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059202204

Using the new generation of cigarette filters may be a solution to reduce pollutants emitted from consumption of cigarettes. In this study, cigarette filters were enhanced by different amounts of MgO nanoparticles to find the extent to which they are effective in removing carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, total hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide from cigarette smoke. The MgO nanoparticles were produced by the sol-gel method. The characteristics of produced MgO nanoparticles were investigated by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) theory. It was revealed that concentration of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, total hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide gradually increased during cigarette consumption for both conventional and enhanced filters due to saturation of the cigarette filter. The results demonstrated that the enhanced filters could remove nearly 56%, 30%, 44% and 43% of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, total hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, respectively, compared with conventional filters.

Cyclists, in particular, face great health risks, as they typically are most exposed to tail-pipe emissions. Four avenues are being explored to combat urban air pollution: 1) policy interventions such as outright bans on polluting vehicles, 2) embracing zero tailpipe emission vehicles, 3) measuring air-quality as a means to better informing citizens of zones of higher pollution, and 4) developing smart mobility devices that seek to minimize the effect of polluting devices on citizens as they transport goods and individuals in our cities. Following this latter direction, in this paper, we present a new way to protect cyclists from the effect of urban pollution. Namely, by exploiting the actuation possibilities afforded by pedelecs or e-bikes (electric bikes), we design a cyber-physical system that mitigates the effect of urban pollution by indirectly controlling the ventilation rates (volume of air inhaled per minute) of cyclists in polluted areas. Results from a real device are presented to illustrate the efficacy of our system. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Cyber-physics; man-machine interaction; non-linear control; pedelecs; pollution mitigation","Air pollution; Air quality; Automobiles; Bicycles; Electric machine control; Electric motors; Embedded systems; Health risks; Human computer interaction; Linear control systems; Military vehicles; Sensors; Solar cells; Urban transportation; Non linear control; pedelecs; Policy intervention; Pollution mitigation; Tailpipe emission; Urban air pollution; Urban areas; Urban pollutions; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046832041

However, solar PV often appears within distribution systems where existing infrastructure was designed under a central-station paradigm. Fortunately, smart grid technologies can aid integration of distributed energy resources through better characterization of how these resources affect the grid. Using a New York utility service territory as a test bed, we present a data-driven Monte Carlo framework that estimates the maximum installed solar PV capacity at the distribution feeder level subject to existing network constraints. Working with representative days that closely match a feeder's load profile, we probabilistically select PV systems according to current New York trends and stochastically model hourly electricity generation.

Climate matching techniques have been used to overcome this limitation by prioritising regions in the target weed's native range to survey for climatically-matched control agents. However, climate matching has been criticised for not considering that climatically compatible regions may not contain host-plant populations, which is especially important for weeds with an unknown or uncertain native distribution. To overcome this limitation, an ecological niche modelling approach (MaxEnt) was used to identify “sweet-spots” to search for candidate biological control agents for two African grasses that are invasive in Australia, namely: Sporobolus pyramidalis P. Beauv. and S. natalensis (Steud.) Dur. &amp; Schinz (Poaceae) (giant rat's tail grasses). “Sweet-spots” were identified by overlaying rasters indicative of climatic suitability for plant growth, reproduction and survival (i.e. models calibrated using native range occurrences) and climatic compatibility with intended biological control agent release sites in Australia (i.e. models calibrated using invaded range occurrences). This approach reduced the total geographic search area by 3.8–7.5 million km2 (57–88% of the total search area), with respect to traditional climatic matching techniques. The models identified: eastern South Africa, eastern Madagascar, Ethiopia, Kenya and coastal West Africa (S. pyramidalis only) as high-priority regions to search for potentially climatically-matched biological control agents. These findings are discussed in the context of guiding and optimising the native range component of this biological control programme, and how this increases the likelihood of successfully managing weed infestations in Australia. © 2018","Agent prioritisation; Climate matching; Establishment; Sporobolus natalensis; Sporobolus pyramidalis; Thermal physiology",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057845135

However, knowledge on the soil fungal assemblages in revegetated shrubs still remains veiled. This study aimed to evaluate how soil fungal diversity and composition respond to shrub species. Methods: We characterized soil fungal communities in three different shrublands (Artemisia ordosica, Salix psammophila, and Caragana microphylla), which had been planted on bare sandland for about 20 years, in the Mu Us Desert in northern China, using high-throughput 18S rRNA gene sequencing. The relationships of fungal community diversity and composition with environmental variables were explored by regression analysis and Mantel test, respectively. Results: The dominant phyla across the studied samples were Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. Compared to bare sandland, fungal diversity was significantly greater in A. ordosica and C. microphylla but not in S. psammophila. There was a positive linear relationship between soil fungal and understory plant diversity. A. ordosica and C. microphylla shrublands showed the greatest relative abundance of Ascomycota; S. psammophila shrubland showed the greatest relative abundance of Basidiomycota. In terms of functional groups, the highest relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi and the lowest relative abundance of pathogenic fungi were found in S. psammophila shrubland. Soil collected from A. ordosica shrubland showed the highest relative abundance of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Conclusions: Variations in fungal diversity and assemblages were directly affected by the revegetated shrub species. The strong correlation of the fungal community and shrubs provides a better understanding of soil organic carbon sequestration and plant–soil interaction in different revegetated shrublands. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Revegetation; Semi-arid ecosystem; Shrub species; Soil fungal community composition; Soil fungal diversity","carbon sequestration; desert; ectomycorrhiza; fungus; organic carbon; relative abundance; revegetation; semiarid region; shrub; shrubland; soil microorganism; soil-vegetation interaction; species diversity; understory; China; Ordos; Artemisia ordosica; Ascomycota; Basidiomycota; Caragana microphylla; Fungi; Salix psammophila",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056471569

The bicycle as a more environmentally friendly means of transportation which is an alternative mode of transportation that can replace motor vehicles to reduce the impact of global warming. Facilities for bicycle users provide a sense of security and comfort to the various users and is considered an important part of the complete street where a community of 100,000 people replacing their cars by bicycle a month will reduce 3.764 tons of carbon dioxide gas (C02) per year. Yos Sudarso Road in Mamuju City is a road segment with activities in various zones, the intensity of activities that occur on the road is very high at certain hours, due to the different activities of the diversity of building functions. Road conditions that do not provide facilities for bicycle users require assessment of the needs of bicycle lane and analyze how the design of the concept of bike lane on the road segment is based on the complete street concept. The type of research used is non-experimental descriptive with the qualitative and quantitative approach, using a survey method in the form of direct observation at research sites, interviews and questionnaires. The condition of the road lane is not yet based on the complete street concept because there is no bicycle lane available as one of the complete street elements so it does not provide a sense of security and comfort for bicycle users. The need for bicycle lanes based on the responses of respondents is the need to provide bike lanes, on segment 1 with bike lane type, on segment 2 and segment 3 with bike lane type, for provision of bicycle lane based on bicycle volume and volume the traffic needs of the bike lane on Yos Sudarso road segment is not yet necessary to be provided. The recommended implementation of bicycle lane based on the concept of Complete Street is a bike lane (width of 1.5 meters for a one-way lane with elevated surfaces that can still be passed by motor vehicles in an emergency condition.

Herein this research is aimed at developing a new generation of catalysts that can potentially decrease the reaction temperature of Claus catalytic converters (used to convert sulfur compounds to elemental sulfur), and also reduce the amount of catalyst. There are two factors that affect the performance of the conventional Claus catalysts. First, the conventional metal oxide catalysts suffer from ageing, trapped liquid sulfur fouling in the mesopores and high steady-state concentration of surface sulfate, which reduce the number of active sites for CS2 conversion. Therefore, the industry has to pay the price for a high reaction temperature to maintain a satisfactory CS2 conversion, while sacrificing Claus conversion (2H2S + SO2). Second, Al2O3 and TiO2 are widely used for Claus reactions; nevertheless, they are not active for conversion of CS2 at lower temperatures. In this context, our approach in this research is using nanofibrous La(III)-doped TiO2 as a new Claus catalyst. La(III) is incorporated into titanium-oxo-acetate complexes via a one-pot sol-gel process, followed by calcination to form a nanofibrous xerogel. Because the nanofibers join together to form a connected network, the xerogel monolith has large macroporosity and exhibits a low density. The exterior surface of the nanofibers, which makes a large contribution to the surface area, remains intact under harsh conditions and thereby is accessible by the reactants. In addition, the La(III) doped TiO2 exhibits more Lewis-base activity that is effective for CS2 conversion. For comparison, TiO2 xerogels were deposited with La(III) by means of an impregnation method and also tested for Claus reaction activity; however, the catalytic performance of this material was reduced compared to the pure TiO2 counterpart. On the basis of characterization studies on these catalysts, it is concluded that (i) a good distribution of La(III) in TiO2 matrix and (ii) the method of La(III) incorporation are important for CS2 conversion. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Claus process; La-doped titania; Lewis-base; Macropores; Nanofibrous xerogel; Self-assembly; Sol-gel; sulfur fouling","Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Carbon footprint; Catalyst activity; Catalytic converters; Complexation; Desulfurization; Energy efficiency; Metals; Nanofibers; Natural gasoline plants; Self assembly; Sol-gel process; Sulfur compounds; Sulfur determination; Temperature; Titanium dioxide; Xerogels; Claus process; Doped titania; Lewis base; Macropores; Nano-fibrous; Lanthanum compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053452301

Here, our study evaluates whether carbon mitigation strategies would decrease or increase local industrial water use and water-related pollutants discharge by using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model coupled with a water withdrawals and pollutants discharge module in Shenzhen, the fourth largest city in China. To fulfill China's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) targets, Shenzhen's GDP and welfare losses are projected to be 1.6% and 5.6% in 2030, respectively. The carbon abatement cost will increase from 56 USD/t CO 2 in 2020 to 274 USD/t CO 2 in 2030. The results reveal that carbon mitigation accelerates local industrial structure upgrading by restricting carbon-, energy-, and water-intensive industries, e.g., natural gas mining, nonmetal, agriculture, food production, and textile sectors. Accordingly, carbon mitigation improves energy use efficiency and decreases 55% of primary energy use in 2030. Meanwhile, it reduces 4% of total industrial water use and 2.2-2.4% of two major pollutants discharge, i.e., COD Cr and NH 3 -N. Carbon mitigation can also decrease petroleum (2.2%) and V-ArOH (0.8%) discharge but has negative impacts on most heavy metal(loid)s pollutants discharge (increased by -0.01% to 4.6%). These negative impacts are evaluated to be negligible on the environment. This study highlights the importance of considering the energy-water nexus for better-coordinated energy and water resources management at local and national levels.

Reducing air emissions is an expensive element of air quality management which can be reached by set of different independent means. One of the areas where solutions for improving air quality in cities can be found is the largest energy-consuming building sector, and related heating needs. The aim of the paper is to estimate the unit Total Suspended Particulates (TSP) abatement costs of building envelope modernization and replacement of heating systems with cleaner ones for buildings in the city of Krakow (Poland). Three, typical for Krakow, types of buildings are analyzed: A single-family house, a pre-war tenement house, and a block of flats. In all the options the base scenario is a coal heated building. The analyzed building's upgrade includes different combinations of changes of heat source and insulation improvements. For each of the scenarios, the costs as well as the expected effects of unit TSP emission reduction were estimated for the whole city. This approach can support the decision making, planning and financial balancing of the most beneficial activities or estimation of the expected environmental effects. © 2019 The Authors. published by EDP Sciences.",,"Air quality; Balancing; Buildings; Cost estimating; Decision making; Emission control; Heating; Modernization; Quality management; Building envelopes; Building sectors; Emission reduction; Expected effects; Heated buildings; Political issues; Single-family house; Total suspended particulates; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062450082

Consequently, the magnitude of the diurnal cycle in surface ozone is changing in several regions of the world. Changes in the diurnal cycle of ozone have implications for the metrics used to assess the impact of ozone on human health and vegetation, since different metrics are sensitive to different portions of the diurnal cycle. We use a high resolution model simulation to examine global changes in the magnitude of the diurnal cycle of O3 between 1980 and 2015. The simulation reproduces the negative trends in the tropospheric NO2 column over the eastern United States and Europe, and the positive trends over East Asia, seen by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). It also gives a reasonable reproduction of the change in the diurnal cycle of surface ozone seen at rural sites in the eastern United States between the 1990s and 2000s. The simulation shows that the magnitude of the surface O3 diurnal cycle is increasing in regions with positive changes in NOx emissions, such as South and East Asia, and decreasing in regions with reductions in NOx emissions. It also shows changes in the diurnal cycle of the tropospheric ozone column, although these have fewer regions with statistically significant trends. These changes suggest that daily mean ozone is responding less than the mid-day ozone measured by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and OMI. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Diurnal cycle; Global modeling; OMI; Ozone; Trends","Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Troposphere; Diurnal cycle; Global modeling; High-resolution models; Ozone monitoring instruments; Surface ozone trends; Total ozone mapping spectrometer; Trends; Tropospheric ozone; Ultraviolet spectrometers; ozone; diurnal activity; emission; global change; growth modeling; health impact; instrumentation; modeling; nitric oxide; ozone; public health; rural area; simulation; TOMS; trend analysis; Article; China; circadian rhythm; Europe; global change; priority journal; South Korea; surface property; United States; Europe; Far East; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057084056

Rapidly changing climatic conditions are a major concern for the future economic development of these regions. This study examines the extent to which infrastructure and housing are affected by permafrost in Russia and estimates the associated value of these assets. An ensemble of climate projections is used as a forcing to a permafrost-geotechnical model, in order to estimate the cost of buildings and infrastructure affected by permafrost degradation by mid-21st century under RCP 8.5 scenario. The total value of fixed assets on permafrost was estimated at 248.6 bln USD. Projected climatic changes will affect 20% of structures and 19% of infrastructure assets, costing 16.7 bln USD and 67.7 bln USD respectively to mitigate. The total cost of residential real estate on permafrost was estimated at 52.6 bln USD, with 54% buildings affected by significant permafrost degradation by the mid-21st century. The paper discusses the variability in climate-change projections and the ability of Russia's administrative regions containing permafrost to cope with projected climate-change impacts. The study can be used in land use planning and to promote the development of adaptation and mitigation strategies for addressing the climate-change impacts of permafrost degradation on infrastructure and housing. © 2019 The Author(s).

This is particularly the case in Gujarat, India, which is experiencing fluctuating monsoon rains and seasons. Local institutions there are ill-equipped to assist farmers in adapting to these changes. However, farmers are adapting to climate change, largely through livelihood diversification, in the absence of formal state intervention. Using qualitative methods, we conducted adaptive capacity assessments and assessed vulnerability perceptions in 3 villages, involving 120 farmers from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Combining vulnerability perceptions with adaptive capacity assessments, we better observed the mismatch between rural development policy with the potential to aid in adaptation processes that address local needs, identifying why policy fails to increase the adaptive capacity of the agriculturalists most vulnerable to climate impacts. Decentralizing adaptation programmes to community-level institutions can increase the efficacy of climate interventions by emboldening latent institutions, while not widening the socioeconomic gap of a rapidly modernizing India. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; adaptive capacity; India; livelihood diversification; vulnerability perceptions","acid precipitation; adaptive management; climate change; perception; policy development; rural development; socioeconomic conditions; vulnerability; Gujarat; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037973052

The proposed emissions reduction strategy is focused on the reduction of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions by the year 2030. Two high PM2.5 concentration episodes with high ammonium nitrate compositions occurring during September and November 2008 were simulated with the Community Multi-scale Air Quality model (CMAQ). All simulations were made with same meteorological files provided by the SCAQMD to allow them to be more directly compared with their previous modeling studies. Although there was an overall under-prediction bias, the CMAQ simulations were within an overall normalized mean error of 50%; a range that is considered acceptable performance for PM modeling. A range of simulations of these episodes were made to evaluate sensitivity to NOx and ammonia emissions inputs for the future year 2030. It was found that the current ozone control strategy will reduce daily average PM2.5 concentrations. However, the targeted NOx reductions for ozone were not found to be optimal for reducing PM2.5 concentrations. Ammonia emission reductions reduced PM2.5 and this might be considered as part of a PM2.5 control strategy. Implications: The SCAQMD and the ARB have proposed an ozone abatement strategy for the SoCAB that focuses on NOx emission reductions. Their strategy will affect both ozone and PM2.5. Two episodes that occurred during September and November 2008 with high PM2.5 concentrations and high ammonium nitrate composition were selected for simulation with different levels of nitrogen oxide and ammonia emissions for the future year 2030. It was found that the ozone control strategy will reduce maximum daily average PM2.5 concentrations but its effect on PM2.5 concentrations is not optimal. © 2019, © 2019 A&WMA.",,"Air quality; Ammonia; Emission control; Nitrates; Ozone; Particulate emissions; Quality management; Volatile organic compounds; Acceptable performance; California Air Resources Board; Community multi-scale air quality models; Emissions reduction; Particulate Matter; PM2.5 concentration; South Coast Air basins; South Coast Air Quality Management District; Nitrogen oxides; ammonia; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; California; ecosystem restoration; environmental monitoring; epidemiology; forecasting; human; particulate matter; prevention and control; procedures; theoretical model; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Ammonia; California; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Forecasting; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Nitrogen Oxides; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058145639

The ETS pilot achieved full compliance, whereas 15–17% of the 10,000 Programme's target entities fell short each year. This article compares how the government implemented the policies, seeking factors that can explain the outputs. The structured and focused comparison employs a policy-implementation process model, using data from written sources and semi-structured interviews in Shanghai and Beijing, 2015–2017. The government's normative power emerged as a major factor: the local ownership of the ETS pilot sent strong normative signals to target entities that it was important to complete the tasks required of them. Further, policy requirements for determining output were more detailed and less flexible in the 10,000 Programme than the ETS pilot, making full compliance difficult. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","10,000 Programme; China; ETS; Local governance; Mitigation policies; Policy process","Article; comparative study; compliance (physical); economic development; energy conservation; environmental policy; government; health care planning; health care policy; human; industrialization; priority journal; semi structured interview; social norm; social status",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058209259

CO2 reduction via the Sabatier reaction presents a thermodynamically favourable pathway to reduce CO2; however, to date, there has been a lack of understanding of how plasmonic enhancement may be utilised for this reaction particularly with respect to the role of bimetallic catalysts. In this study, the effect of laser light illumination on Ni-Au/SiO2, at 520 nm and 660 nm, was studied for CO2 reduction over a temperature range of 150 °C to 450 °C, with the catalytic performance being assessed by CO2 conversion along with CH4 and CO selectivity. Under laser light illumination, at 520 nm and 450 °C, CO2 conversion for Ni–Au/SiO2 increased by 79% whilst simultaneously lowering CH4 selectivity, which was attributed to localised surface plasmon resonance effects and promotion of the reverse water-gas shift reaction by the Au. Laser light illumination at 660 nm also introduced a mild conversion increase, however not to the same extent as for 520 nm. XPS analysis of Ni-Au/SiO2 implied that the observed photo-enhancement could be due to plasmonic mediated electron charge transfer from the Au deposits to the Ni deposits. Monometallic Ni and Au samples were examined and compared with the bimetallic system to elucidate the origin of the photo enhancement and to understand the plasmonic and catalytic interactions. The Au/SiO2 and Ni/SiO2 samples demonstrated that the photo-enhancement arose from the presence of the Au, with the increase in CO2 conversion at 520 nm increasing with increasing Au content; Au (∼110%) &gt; Ni-Au (∼80%) &gt; Ni (∼21%). However, the overall better performance of the Ni/SiO2 sample, facilitating high CO2 conversion and CH4 selectivity emphasises that, while plasmonic metal inclusion can induce synergistic effects, the benefits can be muted if it is unable to promote the target reaction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bimetallic interactions; CO2 reduction; Localised surface plasmonic resonance; Nickel-gold","Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Charge transfer; Chemical shift; Deposits; Gold deposits; Image enhancement; Nickel; Nickel deposits; Plasmonics; Plasmons; Silicon compounds; Surface plasmon resonance; Water gas shift; Catalytic performance; CO2 reduction; Electron charge transfer; Laser light illumination; Localised surface plasmon resonance; Plasmonic enhancements; Reverse water-gas shift reaction; Surface plasmonic resonances; Gold",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045324759

Using concentrations from samples collected over 4 years and calibrated modeled hydrology, we calculated methylmercury (MeHg) and total mercury (THg) mass balances for Lake Hazen, the world's largest High Arctic lake by volume, for 2015 and 2016. Glacial rivers were the most important source of MeHg and THg to Lake Hazen, accounting for up to 53% and 94% of the inputs, respectively. However, due to the MeHg and THg being primarily particle-bound, Lake Hazen was an annual MeHg and THg sink. Exports of MeHg and THg out the Ruggles River outflow were consequently very low, but erosion and permafrost slumping downstream of the lake increased river MeHg and THg concentrations significantly before entering coastal waters in Chandler Fjord. Since 2001, glacial MeHg and THg inputs to Lake Hazen have increased by 0.01 and 0.400 kg yr -1 , respectively, in step with dramatic increases in glacial melt. This study highlights the potential for increases in mercury inputs to arctic ecosystems downstream of glaciers despite recent reductions in global mercury emissions.

A 30-year hindcast was performed and evaluated against observational records consisting of long-term ground-based meteorological observations, automatic weather stations, radiosoundings, satellite records, stake measurements and ice cores. Reasonable agreement regarding the surface and upper-air climate is achieved by the COSMO-CLM 2 model, comparable to the performance of other state-of-the-art climate models over the AIS.

The project was targeted on the development of autonomous Wind-Hydrogen Powered Plant with the Wind Turbine for initial power generation and Hydrogen Module serving as Uninterruptible Power Supply, for universal usage in any point of the World including the cold zones of Arctic and Antarctic, deserts of Africa and isolated islands characterized by destructive sea salt fogs. At the same time, the equipment is clean, continuous operating, long-lasting and maximally reliable, with no polluting or greenhouse emissions. The components of the Power Plant are developed for the unified DC voltage with an option of adding more on the DC bus bar, scaling the power of the Plant up. It presents a flexibility and modularity in combination with the scalable Hydrogen Storage capacity suitable for different demands of distributed energy consumers including both residential and small business. The comprehensive analysis of the renewable energy sources and in particular wind turbines included the study of the main known types and classes. As a result, the choice was made in favor of proprietary design of innovative multi-tier scalable Vertical Axis Wind Turbine as a main power source, the uninterrupted supply part of which is based on the looped cycle Hydrogen Module containing Electrolyser Module, Fuel Cells Assembly System and Hydrogen Storage with communication and control equipment. The intelligent control algorithms optimize the operation of the Plant minimizing the start-stop cycling phases, stretching the servicing periods and extending the lifetime of the equipment. Remote control provides monitoring and managing all processes of power generation and hydrogen storage via Internet anytime, almost anywhere. The project has proved the presented equipment as long-live, reliable and environmentally friendly, as well as modular and flexible, easily scaled under consumer's control, covering the big power consumption range from personal to small business scale. The developed Power Plant is affordable for the remote energy consumers as the estimated equipment value is correlating with the cost of power line installation using no deep engineering or technological skills. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Hydrogen based uninterruptible power supply; Optimal multi-tier development; Power generation; Renewable energy; Vertical axis wind turbine; Wind energy","Arid regions; Control equipment; Cost engineering; Electric power utilization; Fuel cells; Hydrogen production; Power generation; Remote control; Uninterruptible power systems; Wind power; Wind turbines; Communication and control; Hydrogen storage capacities; Multi-tier; Power line installation; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Uninterrupted power supply; Vertical axis wind turbines; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059430362

These issues arise from the combustion of fossil fuels. One of the major contributors to global CO2 emission is the transport sector. Therefore, in order to identify the trends and characteristics of transport carbon emissions this study reviews the relevant literature significantly; and decomposes carbon emission in this sector in 7 top transport CO2 emitter countries by applying the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI). The results indicated that, during 2000–15, transport carbon emissions increased in the United States, China, India, Canada, Russia, and Brazil whereas decreased in Japan. Hence, in the majority of these countries, energy conservation strategies were not successfully implemented during the study period. In the majority of countries, the main contributor to CO2 emission reductions was carbon intensity, whereas the main drivers of CO2 emission increases were electricity structure and economic output effects. Reductions in carbon emissions could be achieved by further optimizing energy structures, limiting the private vehicle population. A set of policies and regulations, from demand-side and supply-side, must be implemented to be effective in reducing GHGs emissions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission; Decomposition analysis; Demand-side policy; Supply-side policy; Transport carbon emission","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Carbon emissions; CO2 emissions; Decomposition analysis; Demand-side; Supply sides; Greenhouse gases; carbon emission; climate change; decomposition analysis; demand analysis; emission control; energy conservation; environmental policy; fossil fuel; optimization; strategic approach; traffic emission; Brazil; Canada; China; India; Japan; Russian Federation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059330435

Here, we report that metformin provides protection in this murine model. Treatment of mice with metformin or exposure of murine or human alveolar macrophages to metformin prevented the particulate matter-induced generation of complex III mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which were necessary for the opening of calcium release-activated channels (CRAC) and release of IL-6. Targeted genetic deletion of electron transport or CRAC channels in alveolar macrophages in mice prevented particulate matter-induced acceleration of arterial thrombosis.

However, maple syrup producers are facing a diversity of challenges, including: potential range shifts in the maple resource; increasing variability in the timing, duration and yield of sap flow and syrup operations; invasive species, pests and diseases; and intergenerational land and business transfer challenges. Members of Maple Syrup Producer Associations in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan were surveyed to learn about their operations, adaptation strategies, concerns, and information needs. While many respondents indicated they have undertaken or plan to undertake adaptation activities, only 11% had done so out of specific concern over changing climate conditions. Climate-motivated activities included: being prepared to tap earlier and utilizing newer technology such as vacuum tubing or reverse osmosis to enhance sap collection and processing efficiency. Respondents were generally unlikely to consider planting climate-resilient maple cultivars or tapping trees other than sugar maple. They expressed the greatest concerns over tree health and forest pests, as well as their physical ability and family member interest to continue their operations. Boil season variability and weather issues were viewed with less concern. Respondents were generally optimistic that they can adapt to future conditions, likely in large measure through the adoption of new technologies, and they expect their syrup production levels to slightly increase in the future. If future climate scenarios play out, however, additional planning and adaptation strategies may be called for, particularly as they relate to forest health and productivity issues. © 2019, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Climate adaptation; Family forest landowner; Non-industrial private forest landowner (NIPF); Non-timber forest product (NTFP); Sugar maple; Sugaring","Timber; Climate adaptation; Family forests; Non-industrial private forest landowners; Non-timber forest products; Sugar maple; Sugaring; Forestry; adaptive management; climate conditions; deciduous tree; landowner; methodology; nontimber forest product; private land; public attitude; technology; Acer saccharum; agricultural parameters; Article; climate change; forest pest; health; lake; nonhuman; physical capacity; reverse osmosis; social adaptation; United States; weather; Acer; attitude; Michigan; Minnesota; Wisconsin; Minnesota; United States; Acer; Acer saccharum; Acer; Attitude; Lakes; Michigan; Minnesota; Wisconsin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060783758

The trend was pushed by the state administrations of mainly EU countries and international organizations seeing LNG as a cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to diesel. Different infrastructural projects for the widespread use of LNG in transport have been launched around the world. The main goal of this paper was to analyze use of LNG as a fuel for heavy trucks. Different aspects of LNG chain were analyzed along with economical and ecological benefits of LNG application. Filling stations network for LNG were described for the purpose of comparative analysis of diesel and LNG heavy trucks. Conclusion has shown that using LNG as propellant fuel has numerous advantages over the use of conventional fuels. The higher initial investment of the LNG road vehicles could be amortized in their lifetime use, and in the long-term they are more affordable than the classic diesel vehicles. In addition to cost-effectiveness, LNG road vehicles reduce CO 2 emissions. Therefore, the environmental goals in transport, not only of the member states but worldwide, could not be met without LNG in heavy truck traffic. © 2019 by the authors.","Alternative fuels; Heavy truck traffic; Liquefied natural gas (LNG); Road transport","Alternative fuels; Automobiles; Cost effectiveness; Gas fuel purification; Natural gas transportation; Natural gas wells; Roads and streets; Truck transportation; Trucks; Comparative analysis; Ecological benefits; Environmentally friendly alternatives; Heavy-truck traffic; International organizations; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Road transports; State administration; Liquefied natural gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061851491

Reducing uncertainty by expanding our understanding of the processes that drive cumulus convection is vital to the accurate identification of future global and regional climate impacts. Here we adopt an interdisciplinary approach that integrates interrelated scales from plant physiology to atmospheric turbulence. Our explicit simulations mimic the land-atmosphere approach implemented in current numerical weather prediction, and global climate models enable us to conclude that neglecting local plant dynamic responses leads to misrepresentations in the cloud cover and midtropospheric moisture convection of up to 21% and 56%, respectively. Our approach offers insights into the key role played by the active vegetation on atmospheric convective mixing that has recently been identified as the source of half of the variance in global warming projections (i.e., equilibrium climate sensitivity). ©2019.

We assess variation in social-ecological vulnerability to climate change-induced coral bleaching, specifically for reef-based fisheries and tourism, of islands throughout the insular Caribbean, thus providing the first region-wide quantitative analysis of island-scale social-ecological vulnerability to coral bleaching. We show that different components of vulnerability have distinct spatial patterns and that variability in overall vulnerability is driven more by socio-economic than ecological components. Importantly, we find that sovereign islands are less vulnerable on average than overseas territories and that the presence of fisheries management regulations is a significant predictor of adaptive capacity and socio-economic sensitivity, with important implications for island-level governance and policies to reduce climate vulnerability. © 2019 The Authors.

To save energy and ensure the economic benefits of industrial production, we designed a reallocation planning model for urban industrial land. The planning model takes the cost of industrial land development, the investment intensity of unit land fixed assets and planning density as the main planning indices and combines the tax differences for different energy consumption intensity industries and the heterogeneity of the enterprise's decision of spatial location. The reallocation strategy of the model is simulated according to the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomerations of China. The characteristics of industrial land reallocation planning and its impact on industrial structure optimization and emission reduction are analyzed. The results show that the position adjustment of industrial parks during planning will lead to ladder-type spatial characteristics of planning indices through enterprises’ decision heterogeneity. The differences in tax intensity for industries with different energy consumption intensities have little influence on indices’ spatial characteristics and have no significant impact on the structural characteristics of the industrial land development cost except for large size enterprises. The role of urban industrial land reallocation planning in the process of urban industrial structure optimization has been better reflected under indifferent tax policies, which will also have a significant effect on reducing regional industrial carbon emissions and optimizing the spatial pattern of regional industrial carbon emissions. In China's Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomerations, cities with large areas of industrial land should make full use of the role of the industrial park's position adjustment in urban industrial land reallocation planning to optimize the urban industrial structure. Cities with small scale industrial land should pay attention to the decision heterogeneity of enterprises in the planning process. Industrial tax policy and land use planning should be combined to make full use of the contribution of industrial land reallocation to regional carbon emission reduction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Industrial land development cost; Industrial land reallocation; Industrial layout adjustment; Structure optimization","agglomeration; carbon emission; emission control; industrial development; land use planning; manufacturing; optimization; sustainable development; urban planning; China; Yangtze Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057129571

To stop climate change, we must transition from burning fossil fuels to using clean energy resources that do not involve the emission of CO 2 . We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of renewable energy sources, such as wind, water, and solar, relative to nuclear fission and the continued burning of fossil fuels, coupled to CO 2 capture and sequestration of the flue gas. A plot of the energy per unit mass, ε, against the energy per unit volume, e, shows many orders of magnitude difference between changes in the mechanical state of ordinary matter versus chemical reactions versus nuclear transformations. These differences raise an apparent paradox concerning how the price of electricity can be roughly competitive for the commercial technologies based on the very different fuel types. Explicit and implicit subsidies for politically favored fuels give a partial explanation, but the turbines that turn flowing fluids into flowing electricity account for most of the result. Reversing climate change requires the world to extract CO 2 from the atmosphere. Through the processes of growth and reproduction, evolution has endowed vegetation with the ability to convert carbon dioxide pulled from the atmosphere with water drawn from the soil into liquid and solid organic compounds. In the first part of the article, we recommended the carbonisation of the global annual waste from farms and ranches into an inert soil enhancer called biochar. We showed that burying biochar back into the soil of farms and ranches of the world suffices to lower the CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere to a safe level by 2100 if some combination of renewables, nuclear power, and fossil fuel usage with carbon capture and sequestration can reduce to zero the emission of CO 2 from total global energy consumption in 2050. In the second part of this article, we begin by describing how using hot molten salt to speed up traditional methods of carbonizing biomass can reduce the time scale for manufacturing biochar from days to minutes. The equipment needed to produce a tonne or more of biochar per day is compact enough to transport by truck to harvest sites. Because the biochar is not burned, but used to improve crop productivity and save water, this technology can meet the goals set in the first part of this article concerning the reversal of climate change if other technologies can transform the energy sector into a carbon-neutral activity. We then discuss how molten-salt breeder reactors can overcome the four usual objections raised by anti-nuclear groups to oppose nuclear fission: (1) sustainability of the fuel cycle, (2) superiority of the economics, (3) security against weapons proliferation, and (4) safety against accidental release of massive amounts of radioactivity into the environment. © 2019, Indian Academy of Sciences.","alternative energy; biochar; Carbonisation; dump tanks; molten salt breeder reactor; nuclear energy; sustainability; thorium fuel cycle; torrefaction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063024436

However, consumers have shown concern with the dependability of electric vehicles due to their limited charging infrastructure and long charging times. Furthermore, the electrification of transportation allows for the ability to be powered by renewable energy. Renewable energy would reduce gas emissions even further, but the sources of energy are known to be intermittent. This paper proposes a distributed battery storage system to close the gap between renewable energy production and consumers' demand. In this system, electric vehicle charging stations, instead of charging vehicles directly from the grid and energy sources, would store energy in batteries. The proposed system seamlessly integrates renewable energy as it compensates for its intermittent nature by allowing energy to be charged in proportion to the rate electricity is produced. The objective of the proposed system is to integrate renewable energy without compromising energy reliability at electric vehicle charging stations. © 2018 IEEE.","Charging infrastructure; distributed battery storage system; electric vehicle; lithium-ion battery; range anxiety; renewable energy","Charging time; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Lithium-ion batteries; Smart city; Vehicle-to-grid; Battery storage system; Charging infrastructures; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicle charging infrastructures; Integrate renewable energies; Integration of renewable energies; Range anxieties; Renewable energies; Battery storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063429327

Here, we collected GHG flux, plant biomass, and litter decomposition data from three distinct vegetation zones (Spartina alterniflora, Juncus roemerianus and Spartina patens) on a 7-year-old created brackish marsh in North Carolina, USA, and integrate these data into an overall C mass balance budget. The marsh fixed an average of 1.85 g C m−2 day−1 through plant photosynthesis. About 41–46% of the fixed C remained in plants, while 18.4% of the C was decomposed and released back to the atmosphere as CO2 and CH4, and 8.6–13.2% of the decomposed C was stored as soil C. In all, this created marsh sequestered 28.7–44.7 Mg CO2 year−1 across the 14 ha marsh. Because the brackish marsh emitted only small amounts of CH4 and N2O, the CO2 equivalent emission of the marsh was −0.87 to −0.56 g CO2-eq m−2 day−1, indicating the marsh has a net effect in reducing GHGs to the atmosphere and contributes to cooling. However, resultant CO2 credit (through the increment of soil C) would be worth only $30.76–$47.90 USD per hectare annually, or $431–$671 per year for the project, which, coupled with other enhanced ecosystem services, could provide landowners with some additional economic incentive for future creation projects. Nevertheless, C mass balance determinations and radiative cooling metrics showed promise in demonstrating the potential of a young created brackish marsh to act as a net carbon sink. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Brackish marsh creation; Carbon sequestration; Ecosystem services; Greenhouse gas emissions","Biomass; Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Radiative Cooling; Soils; Brackish marsh creation; Carbon sequestration; Economic incentive; Ecosystem services; Litter decomposition; North Carolina , USA; Spartina alterniflora; Wetland ecosystem; Wetlands; air-soil interaction; biomass; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; cooling; dicotyledon; ecosystem service; estuarine environment; greenhouse gas; soil carbon; North Carolina; United States; Juncus roemerianus; Spartina alterniflora; Spartina patens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053889871

Faced with barriers to adaptation planning and implementation at the local level, growing numbers of practitioners have turned to the metropolitan region as a new scalar platform for climate adaptation planning. This study examines regional adaptation planning in Los Angeles, Miami, and Boston, three metropolitan areas that have significant exposure to the impacts of climate change and typify the high levels of administrative fragmentation found in the United States. I ask, what regional adaptation strategies have they deployed? What local adaptation challenges do they try to overcome? Given their progress, what are the implications for this scale of adaptation planning? Drawing on case studies of these efforts, I find that regional collaborations promisingly get more cities to start planning for the impacts of climate change, even in states where governments oppose climate action, by increasing access to information, providing opportunities for networking and technical assistance, helping secure additional funding, and strengthening coordination among vertical levels of government. However, local-centric regional adaptation efforts have had less success in addressing horizontal coordination challenges across municipalities, particularly as they relate to land use planning, fiscal constraints, spillovers effects, and social equity. These findings suggest that scaling up adaptation to the metropolitan region is no panacea for overcoming structural limits to local adaptation in places with weak regional governance institutions. More critical and reflexive regional adaptation planning can help pave the way to difficult conversations around regional institution building so that governance at this scale can achieve its promise of producing more effective and equitable adaptation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Governance; Metropolitan; Planning; Regional","access to information; article; California; city; climate change; conversation; coordination; drawing; funding; government; human; human experiment; land use; local adaptation; Massachusetts; scale up",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058163956

The present study aimed to explore the physiological responses of plants exposed to NO 2 . A total of 41 plants were classified into 13 functional groups according to the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group classification system. The plants were exposed to 6 µL/L NO 2 in an open-top glass chamber. The physiological parameters (chlorophyll (Chl) content, peroxidase (POD) activity, and soluble protein and malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations) and leaf mineral ion contents (nitrogen (N + ), phosphorus (P + ), potassium (K + ), calcium (Ca 2+ ), magnesium (Mg 2+ ), manganese (Mn 2+ ), and zinc (Zn 2+ )) of 41 garden plants were measured. After NO 2 exposure, the plants were subsequently transferred to a natural environment for a 30-d recovery to determine whether they could recover naturally and resume normal growth. The results showed that NO 2 polluted the plants and that NO 2 exposure affected leaf Chl contents in most functional groups. Increases in both POD activity and soluble protein and MDA concentrations as well as changes in mineral ion concentrations could act as signals for inducing defense responses. Furthermore, antioxidant status played an important role in plant protection against NO 2 -induced oxidative damage. NO 2 poses a pollution risk to plant systems, and antioxidant status plays an important role in plant protection against NO 2 -induced oxidative damage. In conditions of strong air pollution, more evergreen plants may be considered in landscape design, particularly in seasonal regions.

The tempo-spatial variations were analyzed and discussed for the implications for regional air pollution control. Severe air pollution, with PM10 and benzo[a]pyrene (one representative PAH) exceeding national air quality standards, was in both urban and rural sites. Seasonal variation was significant with much higher levels during the heating period. Air pollution in the studied rural site was even much worse than those in the cities studied, and the PAHs contamination was nearly an order of magnitude higher. Ambient air pollution expectably declined as a result of effective clean air actions during the last several years; however, is still serious particularly in rural area and in cold seasons. Concerns on wintertime air pollution in urban areas and severe rural air pollution call for urgent actions on residential combustion emissions. Effective controls on this specific source would benefit not only indoor air quality but significantly reduce regional outdoor air pollution. In 2017, eleven Chinese ministries co-issued a plan to promote multiple clean heating ways in north China. The action, if implemented effectively, would alleviate wintertime air pollution not only in urban but rural areas. Mitigation of rural air pollutant emissions from the residential sector calls for effective deployment and sustainable use of advanced high-efficiency cooking/heating stoves and clean fuels. © 2018","North China Plain; PAHs; Rural air pollution; Seasonal distribution; Solid fuel combustion","benzo[a]pyrene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; air; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality standard; ambient air; Article; China; combustion; cooking; government regulation; heating; indoor air pollution; particle size; priority journal; residential area; rural area; seasonal variation; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057770283

Nonetheless, both energy conversion and water purification result in substantial amounts of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These negative interactions with potential “snowball” effect, can be decoupled via the deployment of renewable power generation, and carbon capture from fossil-fuelled technologies. However, such retrofits pose new challenges as wind and solar energy exhibit intermittent generation patterns. In addition, integrating thermal power plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS) imposes energy penalties and increases water requirements. In the present research, an optimization framework is developed which enables systematic decision-making for the retrofit of existing power and water infrastructure as well as investment in renewable and green technologies. A key aspect of the applied framework is the simultaneous optimization of design and operational decisions in the presence of uncertainties in the water demand, electricity demand, as well as wind and solar power availability.

The current study is focused on developing a five-year mathematical model for finding the optimal sizing of renewable energy technologies for achieving certain CO2 emission reduction targets. A manufacturing industrial facility which uses CHP for electricity generation and natural gas for heating is considered as the base case in this work. Different renewable energy technologies are developed each year to achieve a 4.53% annual CO2 emission reduction target. The results of this study show that wind power is the most cost-effective technology for reducing emissions in the first and second year with a cost of 44 and 69 CAD per tonne of CO2, respectively. Hydrogen, on the other hand, is more cost-effective than wind power in reducing CO2 emissions from the third year on. The cost of CO2 emission reduction with hydrogen doesn't change drastically from the first year to the fifth year (107 and 130 CAD per tonne of CO2). Solar power is a more expensive technology than wind power for reducing CO2 emissions in all years due to lower capacity factor (in Ontario), more intermittency (requiring mores storage capacity), and higher investment cost. A hybrid wind/battery/hydrogen energy system has the lowest emission reduction cost over five years. The emission reduction cost of such hybrid system increases from 44 CAD per tonne of CO2 in the first year to 156 CAD per tonne of CO2 in the fifth year. The developed model can be used for long-term planning of energy systems for achieving GHG emission targets in a regions/country which has fossil fuel-based electricity and heat generation infrastructure. © 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Battery; CO2 emission; Hydrogen; Optimization; Solar; Wind","Carbon dioxide; Cogeneration plants; Computer aided design; Cost effectiveness; Electric power generation; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen; Investments; Optimization; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Wind; Wind power; Battery; CO2 emission reduction; CO2 emissions; Cost-effective technology; Electricity generation; Industrial facilities; Renewable energy technologies; Solar; Cost reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059647565

The use of alkali and alkaline earth sorbents to address the emissions or their introduction during cocombustion of biomass can cause defluidization of fluidized bed combustors. This article presents the results obtained from an extensive experimental campaign aimed at exploring the performance of different defluidization inhibition measures and defluidization outcomes of a pilot-scale atmospheric bubbling fluidized bed combustor cofired with ReEngineered Feedstock (ReEF) and coal. ReEF is a solid fuel made from the nonrecyclable fraction of municipal solid waste to which alkaline air emission control reagents are physically bound. The cocombustion of coal and ReEF combines fuel- A nd sorbent-blending techniques for improved combustion and higher efficiency emission reduction. An earlier study of the group proved these favorable aspects during the cocombustion of a granular bituminous coal and ReEF in a pilot-scale bubbling fluidized bed combustor of coarse silica sand particles. However, some formulations of ReEF led to the bed defluidization during the 800-1000 °C operation. In the first phase of the current study, the performance of different counteractive/pre-emptive measures to delay/prevent the defluidization incidents during the coal-ReEF cocombustion trials in the same combustor unit was examined. Although the application of counteractive measures, e.g., a decrease in the operating temperature and an increase in the superficial gas velocity, could delay the defluidization incident, replacing coarse silica with olivine sand significantly extended the temperature range of operation without defluidization. In the second phase of the current study, employing the more commonly used coarse silica sand, the cocombustion of bituminous coal with over 50 ReEF formulations was performed to explore defluidization outcomes in the 800-1000 °C range. The data collected from these trials illustrated trends that could be presented as a defluidization map. The map relates the sodium and calcium composition limits for the ReEF that would defluidize a bed of coarse silica at different temperature levels. The defluidization boundaries obtained at 900 and 1000 °C were described by adopting an empirical formulation. Extrapolation, following an Arrhenius type temperature dependency, over the 800-1100 °C range in 50 °C increments showed acceptable predictability of the approach, satisfying the industrial requirements. The applicability of the predictive tool, developed on the basis of 1 h of operation at each operating temperature, was subsequently tested over extended periods (>8 h) at 850 °C. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Bituminous coal; Blending; Bubble formation; Coal combustion; Emission control; Feedstocks; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized beds; Fuels; Municipal solid waste; Particles (particulate matter); Reefs; Renewable energy resources; Silica; Silica sand; Silicate minerals; Temperature; Waste incineration; Bubbling fluidized bed combustors; Electricity production; Experimental campaign; Industrial requirements; Operating temperature; Renewable energy source; Superficial gas velocities; Temperature dependencies; Fluidized bed combustors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061297235

Different predefined procedures are available to calculate some of the main operational characteristics, such as capacity, delay, and level of service, in order to select the best type of control. However, there are other important factors that affect major arterials operational characteristics, factors that are not fully addressed, such as the impact of emissions. In this study, a microscopic simulation approach using VISSIM and MOVES was developed to assess the environmental effect of converting four three-lane roundabouts to signalized intersections along a heavily congested urban corridor in Qatar. A decision was made to switch all roundabouts to traffic signals for better operations. Preliminary results indicated that the signal control outperformed the roundabout in the range of 37% to 43% reduction in emissions. A more detailed analysis revealed that roundabout corridor operations’ effects on emission rates are divergent from those of signalized corridors, particularly upstream and downstream of the intersections. Immediate roundabout upstream approaches are driver behavior dependent, characterized by substantial coasting at lower speeds and subsequent re-accelerating with less idling, described as acceleration events, which resulted in high emission rates, while signalized corridors are signal timing dependent, characterized by ample idling with less coasting and re-acceleration, resulting in reduced emission rates. The results also revealed that there was no significant difference between emission rates in the vicinity of the two types of control. Both recorded nearly the same emission rate. Implications: A microscopic simulation approach using VISSIM and MOVES was developed to assess the environmental effect of converting four three-lane roundabouts to signalized intersections along a heavily congested urban corridor in Doha, Qatar. Intersection geometries along with the control type have significant impact on emission rates and play a major role in assessing environmental impacts. US EPA MOVES was calibrated to Qatar conditions which can be used to estimate emission factors and quantify vehicular emissions along other corridors in the country. The results can also be beneficial for other countries within the region. © 2019, © 2019 A&WMA.",,"Environmental Protection Agency; Particulate emissions; Traffic signals; Emission factors; Level of Service; Microscopic simulation; Operational characteristics; Re-acceleration; Signalized intersection; Vehicle emission; Vehicular emission; Street traffic control; adverse event; air pollution; environmental monitoring; epidemiology; exhaust gas; human; prevention and control; procedures; Qatar; traffic and transport; urban health; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Qatar; Traffic-Related Pollution; Transportation; Urban Health; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058675229

The case study in this paper is the transportation system in the Yogyakarta Province of Indonesia. The transportation sector has the highest energy demand of all the other sectors in this province. Therefore, this sector is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Four scenarios were developed, business as usual, mode change, fuel switch and efficient vehicle. The business as usual scenario is the reference scenario. Also, a scenario, called the mitigation scenario, which combines the mode change, fuel switch and efficient vehicle scenarios was also developed. An analysis of the energy demand projections and greenhouse gas emissions, in the form of CO2, NOx, and CH4, was conducted and the contribution of the aforementioned scenarios to low-carbon energy planning for the transportation sector was analyzed. Long-range energy alternative planning software was utilized to simulate the scenarios. The efficient vehicle scenario resulted in the highest reduction in energy demand. At the end of the projection period, this scenario reduced energy demand for the transportation sector by 15.82% compared to the reference scenario. The mitigation scenario reduced energy demand by 20.45% compared to the reference scenario in 2050. By implementing an efficient vehicle scenario, global warming potential can be reduced by 15.80%. The implementation of the mitigation scenario reduced global warming potential by 24.76% compared to the reference scenario. © 2019, Aalborg University press.

In this study, we aimed to examine fishers' decisions to adapt to climate change and their expectations for their children to pursue the same profession. Data were obtained from fisher households covering 8 districts and 22 sub-districts in the coastal area of Chumphon Province, Thailand, using participatory observation, focus group discussion, and in-person field surveys. A binary logistic regression model was used to determine factors influencing the fishers' decisions and their expectations for their children to inherit their occupation. Results showed that the fishers are aware of the increasing trends in air temperature, sea water temperature, inland precipitation, offshore precipitation, and storms. Increased fishing experience and fishing income increased the likelihood of the fishers applying adaptations to climate change. Looking to the future, fishers with high fishing incomes expect their children to pursue the occupation, whereas increased fishing experience, non-fishing incomes, and perceptions of storms likely discourage them from expecting their children to be fishers. Of the fishers interviewed, 58.06% decided to apply adaptations in response to climate change by incorporating climate-smart agriculture, particularly by cultivating rubber, oil palm, and orchards as a second income source. The adoption of climate-smart fisheries should be considered in relation to the body of local knowledge, as well as the needs and priorities of the fisher community. To cope with the impacts of current and future climate change on coastal communities, the national focal point of adaptation should be climate change, and related governmental agencies should pay more attention to these key factors for adaptation. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptation; Climate change; Expectation; Fisher; Thailand",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062173224

Results suggest that environmental benefits in terms of NOx emissions and PM emissions are significant as concentrations of both species are reduced. Based on the analysis presented in the study, altered local air-fuel ratio suppresses NOx formation and PM formation resulting in 10-fold lower PM emission than same experimental apparatus with diesel fuel. The study further analyses and identifies three key mechanisms that are responsible for this reduction: altered oxygen profile during mixture preparation, prevention of soot precursors formation and promotion of soot oxidation reactions. The influence of tested fuel is also perceivable through higher CO and THC emissions. Parametric analysis within the selected experimental space suggests that operational parameters of the micro gas turbine can be adjusted to reduce concentrations of these two species without negatively affecting other pollutants. Significant benefits of the fuel in terms of environmental impact indicate that further investigation and development of this approach might provide a new alternative energy source for stationary use as well as for mobility in sectors where heavy duty gas turbines are used as prime movers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Emissions; Glycerol; Oxygenated fuels; Particulates; Soot; Viscous biofuel","Biofuels; Combustion; Emission control; Gas turbines; Glycerol; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Soot; Alternative energy source; Environmental benefits; Experimental apparatus; Heavy-duty gas turbines; Operational parameters; Oxygenated fuel; Parametric -analysis; Particulates; Gas fuel analysis; alternative energy; biofuel; chemical compound; chemical reaction; concentration (composition); emission control; environmental impact; experimental apparatus; nitric oxide; parameter estimation; soot; turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058708342

The distribution and morphotypes of these landforms, SHAllow RADar detections, and crater size-frequency distribution measurements (>50 m in diameter) were used to understand the permafrost cryolithology and its past evolution in relation to climate in Utopia Planitia. Three assemblages of landforms were identified based on their spatial correlation and correlation with Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter surface roughness along a strip from 30°N to 80°N. At 30°–38°N, the assemblage is formed by kilometer-scale polygons, high-albedo mounds, and thumbprint terrains. This assemblage is associated with a lobate deposit of 30 m in thickness with a crater retention age of 1 Ga. At 38°–47°N, the assemblage is comprised of large scallops, 100-m-diameter polygons, pits, and mantled deposits. This assemblage is correlated with a deposit of 80 m in thickness containing excess ice (~50–85% by volume) with a crater retention age of about 10 Ma. At 47°–78°N, the assemblage is composed of mantled deposits, textured terrains, and 30-m-diameter polygons. This assemblage is related to the ice-rich, debris-covered, latitude-dependent mantle that has a crater retention age of about 1.5 Ma. Utopia Planitia appears to be a region of combined depositions of sediment and continuous cold climatic conditions that leaded to a complex distribution of ground ice. ©2018.

Near-road monitoring sites were set up from 2014 through 2016, with 68 NO2 monitors in 2016, 31 of which also monitored PM2.5. Annual and multi-year statistics of NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations were compared with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. A PM2.5“increment”—the difference between concentrations measured in the near-road environment and those concentrations measured at nearby sites—was estimated. Several methods were used to select nearby sites from which to calculate “background” concentrations: (1) sites within 25 km, 50 km, and 100 km of the near-road site, and sites whose 24 h PM2.5 concentrations were well correlated with those at the near-road site; (2) sites within 40 km of the near-road site, where PM2.5 concentrations were interpolated using an inverse distance weighting; and (3) a site in the “upwind” direction from the near-road site. The mean PM2.5 increment across all near-road sites ranged from +0.6 to +1.1 μg/m3 (or 6–10% of the average PM2.5), depending on the method. Understanding the variation in the PM2.5 increment can be useful to assess calculations of PM2.5 background, which is required by EPA under various regulatory frameworks. The PM2.5 increment generally decreased with increasing distance from monitoring site to roadway, and increased with increasing traffic volume. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2019.",,"Air quality; Air quality standards; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental regulations; Inverse problems; Nitrogen oxides; Air quality monitoring; Continuous monitoring; Inverse distance weighting; Monitoring sites; National ambient air quality standards; National assessment; PM2.5 concentration; Regulatory frameworks; Roads and streets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061202221

Their restoration in mountain regions often presents specific problems of raw soil stabilisation and difficult climatic conditions. Methods used to tackle these problems include increasing sowing density and fertilisation. However, past studies were performed at only one site or for a short time and do not clearly show how site traits and time affect restoration results. In six field experiments undertaken on raw soils in the Italian Alps, the effects of sowing density, fertilisation, soil, and climate on the development over time of plant density and cover were analysed over three to six years. The seed was collected from nearby grasslands and sown at rates of 335–21,410 seeds m−2. During the first one-two years, the percentage of seeds producing established plants at low seed rates was higher in stonier surfaces; however, at high rates a larger absolute plant number was recorded in finer soils. Two to five years after sowing, climatic conditions became more important. Full vegetation cover was achieved in all experiments. However, at high altitudes, individual plant cover became greater (and plant density decreased), probably because the grasses needed to accumulate more non-structural carbohydrates necessary to survive during the longer winter. Fertilisation accelerated the establishment of full vegetation cover by 1 to 3 years as it increased the mean cover per plant without affecting plant density. Grassland restoration is possible in mountain raw soils by using the seeds collected from nearby donor sites. High sowing densities are not required even in coarse or higher altitude soils because, in the short term, stones on the ground surface increase the percentage of seed producing established plants and, over the long term, plant density is not dependent on the sowing density. In low-fertile soils, fertilisation accelerates the establishment of full vegetation cover. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Fertilisation; Ground stoniness; Safe-site; Sowing density; Vegetative rest length","Biodiversity; Landforms; Restoration; Soil mechanics; Soils; Stability; Vegetation; Climatic conditions; Fertilisation; Grassland restorations; Ground stoniness; Non-structural carbohydrates; Safe-site; Semi-natural grasslands; Vegetative rest length; Seed; carbohydrate; rain; biodiversity; climate effect; fertilizer application; grassland; mountain region; plant; restoration ecology; soil cover; sowing; vegetation cover; altitude; Article; climate; controlled study; density; ecosystem restoration; fertilization; germination; grassland; Italy; nonhuman; plant cover; plant density; plant growth; plant parameters; plant seed; priority journal; seedling establishment; soil; soil fertility; sowing; sowing density; survival; vegetation; winter; biodiversity; chemistry; plant; soil; Poaceae; Biodiversity; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Grassland; Plants; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055109744

The World Health Organization attributes 3.8 million additional deaths to indoor air pollution. Air pollution can harm acutely, usually manifested by respiratory or cardiac symptoms, as well as chronically, potentially affecting every organ in the body. It can cause, complicate, or exacerbate many adverse health conditions. Tissue damage may result directly from pollutant toxicity because fine and ultrafine particles can gain access to organs, or indirectly through systemic inflammatory processes. Susceptibility is partly under genetic and epigenetic regulation. Although air pollution affects people of all regions, ages, and social groups, it is likely to cause greater illness in those with heavy exposure and greater susceptibility. Persons are more vulnerable to air pollution if they have other illnesses or less social support.

Urban energy models (UEM) can be useful to analyze the impact of different energy efficiency actions on city districts. While simulation of demand data with high spatial and temporal resolution is often necessary to evaluate retrofit measures, the city's complex structure and lack of data often prevents a reliable application of such methods. This paper presents an urban energy modeling approach based on open-source geographical information system (GIS) datasets to reduce input data uncertainty and simplify city district modeling. We present a method to automatically extract basic city district data from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and enrich these datasets based on national building stock statistics. Building models with representative geometries and physical properties are automatically generated based on building archetype information. These models enable thermal simulation on urban scale. The approach is demonstrated for a use case in Germany, where a reference city district model has been generated with OSM data extraction and enrichment. The reference city district model has been used to perform a space heating net energy demand uncertainty analysis. The demand values simulated with the reference model show a sufficient fit with measured consumption values. The approach provides a fast and structured methodology to model city districts and simulate space heating energy demand on urban scale. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Archetypes; City district; Data enrichment; Geographic information systems; Urban energy models; Workflow automation","Computer software maintenance; Data mining; Energy management; Gas emissions; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Information systems; Information use; Open systems; Space heating; Uncertainty analysis; Archetypes; Automatically generated; City district; Data enrichments; Spatial and temporal resolutions; Thermal building simulation; Urban energy; Urban energy systems; Energy efficiency; automation; building; data set; emission control; energy efficiency; energy use; GIS; greenhouse gas; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059567997

Methane emission monitoring procedures are suggested, based on a robust method for measuring total leakage from the site; additionally, quantitative measures, to determine the efficiency of the performed emission mitigation, are defined. The tracer gas dispersion measuring technique is suggested as the core emission measurement methodology in monitoring plans for methane emissions from landfills and a guideline for best practice measurement performance is presented. A minimum methane mitigation efficiency of 80% is suggested. Finally, several principles are presented on how criteria can be developed for when a monitoring program can be terminated.

However, these inexpensive sensors have limitations and need to be characterized under realistic conditions. This study evaluated two Plantower PMS (particulate matter sensor) 1003s and two PMS 5003s outdoors in Salt Lake City, Utah over 320 days (1/2016–2/2016 and 12/2016–10/2017) through multiple seasons and a variety of elevated PM2.5 events including wintertime cold-air pools (CAPs), fireworks, and wildfires. The PMS 1003/5003 sensors generally tracked PM2.5 concentrations compared to co-located reference air monitors (one tapered element oscillating microbalance, TEOM, and one gravimetric federal reference method, FRM). The different PMS sensor models and sets of the same sensor model exhibited some intra-sensor variability. During winter 2017, the two PMS 1003s consistently overestimated PM2.5 by a factor of 1.89 (TEOM PM2.5&lt;40 μg/m3). However, compared to the TEOM, one PMS 5003 overestimated PM2.5 concentrations by a factor of 1.47 while the other roughly agreed with the TEOM. The PMS sensor response also differed by season. In two consecutive winters, the PMS PM2.5 measurements correlated with the hourly TEOM measurements (R2 &gt; 0.87) and 24-h FRM measurements (R2 &gt; 0.88) while in spring (March–June) and wildfire season (June–October) 2017, the correlations were poorer (R2 of 0.18–0.32 and 0.48–0.72, respectively). The PMS 1003s maintained high intra-sensor agreement after one year of deployment during the winter seasons, however, one PMS 1003 sensor exhibited a significant drift beginning in March 2017 and continued to deteriorate through the end of the study. Overall, this study demonstrated good correlations between the PMS sensors and reference monitors in the winter season, seasonal differences in sensor performance, some intra-sensor variability, and drift in one sensor.

Germination strategy determines the plant’s ability to synchronise germination timing and seedling emergence to a favourable growing season and thus variation in germination strategy within species may be key to persistence under more extreme and variable future climates. However, the determinants of variation in germination strategy are not well resolved. To understand the variation of germination strategy and the climate drivers, we assessed seed traits, germination patterns, and seedling establishment traits of Oreomyrrhis eriopoda from 29 populations across its range. Germination patterns were then analysed against climate data to determine the strongest climate correlates influencing the germination strategy. Oreomyrrhis eriopoda exhibits a striking range of germination strategies among populations: varying from immediate to staggered, postponed, and postponed-deep. Seeds from regions with lower temperature variability were more likely to exhibit an immediate germination strategy; however, those patterns depended on the timescale of climatic assessment. In addition, we show that these strategy differences extend to seedling establishment traits: autumn seedlings (from populations with an immediate or staggered germination strategy) exhibited a higher leaf production rate than spring seedlings (of staggered or postponed strategy). Our results demonstrate not only substantial within-species variation in germination strategy across the species distribution range, but also that this variation correlates with environmental drivers. Given that these differences also extend to establishment traits, they may reflect a critical mechanism for persistence in changing climate. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Local adaptation; Maternal environment; Plastic variation; Reproductive ecology; Seedling growth","alpine environment; climate change; germination; growing season; herb; local adaptation; phenotypic plasticity; reproductive biology; seedling emergence; seedling establishment; temperature effect; temperature gradient; Oreomyrrhis eriopoda; germination; plant seed; season; seedling; temperature; Germination; Seasons; Seedlings; Seeds; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059503837

In the present study, heat and chilling accumulation conditions of a collection of 44 grapevine cultivars currently grown in Portugal are assessed at very high spatial resolution (~ 1 km) and for 1981–2015. Two bioclimatic indices that incorporate non-linear plant-temperature relationships are selected for this purpose: growing degree hours—GDH (February–October) and chilling portions—CP (October–February). The current thermal growing conditions of each variety are examined and three clusters of grapevine cultivars are identified based on their GDH medians, thus assembling varieties with close heat accumulation requirements and providing more physiologically consistent information when compared to previous studies, as non-linear plant-temperature relationships are herein taken into account. These new clusters are also a complement to previous bioclimatic zoning. Ensemble mean projections under two anthropogenic-driven scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, 2041–2070), from four EURO-CORDEX simulations, reveal a widespread increase of GDH and decrease of CP, but with spatial heterogeneities. The spatial variability of these indices throughout Portugal is projected to decrease (strongest increases of GDH in the coolest regions of the northeast) and to increase (strongest decreases of CP in the warmest regions of the south and west), respectively. The typical heat accumulation conditions of each cluster are projected to gradually shift north-eastwards and to higher-elevation areas, whereas insufficient chilling may represent a new challenge in warmer future climates. An unprecedented level of detail for a large collection of grapevine varieties in Portugal is provided, thus promoting a better planning of climate change adaptation measures. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Chilling portions; Climate change; Euro-CORDEX; Grapevine; Growing degree hours; Portugal","climate change; climate conditions; computer simulation; numerical model; temperature anomaly; viticulture; Portugal; Vitis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045030848

The structure of electricity grid tariffs may, however, be a barrier to large-scale implementation. This study analyses how different electricity grid tariff structures affect flexible use of electricity in future Nordic district heating. The energy market model Balmorel is applied for the analysis. The results show that the structure of grid tariffs significantly influence the use of electricity in district heating. Load demand tariffs based on maximum monthly load demand hamper flexible use of electricity in district heating. Going from a high energy charge with no load demand tariff structure to a low energy charge with time-of-use load demand tariff structure increases the power-to-heat share by 60%, increases the wind power generation by 4%, and reduces the CO2 emissions by 7%. A favourable tariff structure can thus encourage more investment in renewable power. This is, however, at the expense of investment in and use of combined heat and power. High electricity prices hamper extensive deployment of flexible electric boilers. With increasing electricity prices, the power-to-heat share will increasingly consist of less flexible heat pumps. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","District heating; Electricity grid tariffs; Flexibility; Nordic; Power-to-heat","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; District heating; Electric power generation; Investments; Wind power; Benefit to cost ratios; Combined heat and power; Electricity grids; Electricity prices; Energy market modeling; Flexibility; Nordic; Renewable energies; Electric power transmission networks; alternative energy; cost-benefit analysis; electricity; energy market; energy use; heating; power generation; price determination; tariff structure; wind power; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059320354

In a context of increasing pressure on water resources as a result of the reduction in water availability, it is essential and urgent to structure water management in a way that allows for adaptation to the challenges that the changing climate will bring to an already water scarce region. It is necessary to generate experiences and methodologies that are based on real case studies that will lay the foundations for the generalisation of practices of climate change adaptation in water management. In this study, we have developed a ready to use analytical framework to evaluate the coherence of water management plans and programs with climate change adaptation principles. We have tested the applicability of the framework that was developed on the Tordera River Basin Adaptation Plan (TRBAP).

To protect the environment and secure water supplies, water abstractions for irrigation can be mandatorily reduced by environmental regulators. Such abstraction restrictions can result in economic impacts on irrigated agriculture. This study provides a novel approach for the probabilistic risk assessment of potential future economic losses in irrigated agriculture arising from the interaction of climate change and regulatory drought management, with an application to England and Wales. Hydrometeorological variability is considered within a synthetic data set of daily rainfall and river flows for a baseline period (1977–2004) and for projections for near future (2022–2049) and far future (2072–2099). The probability, magnitude, and timing of abstraction restrictions are derived by applying rainfall and river flow triggers in 129 catchments. The risk of economic losses at the catchment level is then obtained from the occurrences of abstraction restrictions combined with spatially distributed crop-specific economic losses. Results show that restrictions will become more severe, more frequent, and longer in the future. The highest economic risks are projected where drought-sensitive crops with a high financial value are concentrated in catchments with increasingly uncertain water supply. This research highlights the significant economic losses associated with mandatory drought restrictions experienced by the agricultural sector and supports the need for environmental regulators and irrigators to collaboratively manage scarce water resources to balance environmental and economic considerations. ©2019.

Emissions of conventional thermal power plants affect adversely air quality and intensify the greenhouse effect. Renewable energy technologies for electricity generation present perhaps a possible alternative. The purpose of this research is to investigate the viability of electricity generation using agricultural biomass residues from both a techno-economic and an environmental perspective. The biomass residues considered in this work concern tree pruning in nine different geographically dispersed prefectures of the Greek territory. An integrated methodology is proposed for assessing the potential of tree pruning biomass fired power plants. A systematic sensitivity analysis is also carried out in order to examine the effect of various economic parameter values on investment recovery time.

However, it remains unclear whether this holds at the scales relevant for management, and particularly large knowledge gaps exist for temperate forests and for taxa other than trees. We built a comprehensive dataset of Central European temperate forest structure and multi-taxonomic diversity (beetles, birds, bryophytes, fungi, lichens, and plants) across 352 plots. We used Boosted Regression Trees (BRTs) to assess the relationship between above-ground live carbon stocks and (a) taxon-specific richness, (b) a unified multidiversity index. We used Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis to explore individual species’ responses to changing above-ground carbon stocks and to detect change-points in species composition along the carbon-stock gradient. Our results reveal an overall weak and highly variable relationship between richness and carbon stock at the stand scale, both for individual taxonomic groups and for multidiversity. Similarly, the proportion of win-win and trade-off species (i.e., species favored or disadvantaged by increasing carbon stock, respectively) varied substantially across taxa. Win-win species gradually replaced trade-off species with increasing carbon, without clear thresholds along the above-ground carbon gradient, suggesting that community-level surrogates (e.g., richness) might fail to detect critical changes in biodiversity. Collectively, our analyses highlight that leveraging co-benefits between carbon and biodiversity in temperate forest may require stand-scale management that prioritizes either biodiversity or carbon in order to maximize co-benefits at broader scales. Importantly, this contrasts with tropical forests, where climate and biodiversity objectives can be integrated at the stand scale, thus highlighting the need for context-specificity when managing for multiple objectives. Accounting for critical change-points of target taxa can help to deal with this specificity, by defining a safe operating space to manipulate carbon while avoiding biodiversity losses. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","biodiversity conservation; carbon storage; climate change mitigation; community thresholds; multi-objective forest planning; multi-taxonomic diversity; trade-off species; win-win species","biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; forest management; nature conservation; regression analysis; taxonomy; temperate forest; Central Europe; Aves; bryophytes; Coleoptera; Fungi; carbon; biodiversity; climate change; forest; France; Hungary; Italy; Biodiversity; Carbon; Climate Change; Forests; France; Hungary; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058861871

However, few studies quantify risks of illness and death, examine their contribution to climate policy benefits, or assess their robustness in light of natural climate variability. We employ an integrated modeling framework of the economy, climate, air quality, and human health to quantify the effect of natural variability on U.S. Air pollution impacts under future climate and two global policies (2 and 2.5 °C stabilization scenarios) using 150 year ensemble simulations for each scenario in 2050 and 2100. Climate change yields annual premature deaths related to fine particulate matter and ozone (95CI: 25000-120000), heart attacks (900-9400), and lost work days (3.6M-4.9M) in 2100. It raises air pollution health risks by 20%, while policies avert these outcomes by 40-50% in 2050 and 70-88% in 2100. Natural variability introduces ""climate noise"", yielding some annual estimates with negative cobenefits, and others that reach 100% of annual policy costs. This ""noise"" is three times the magnitude of uncertainty (95CI) in health and economic responses in 2050. Averaging five annual simulations reduces this factor to two, which is still substantially larger than health-related uncertainty. This study quantifies the potential for inaccuracy in climate impacts projected using too few annual simulations.

Currently, chemical sources cannot fully satisfy these applications, especially in solid state form. Betavoltaic (βV) nuclear batteries using β--emitting radioisotopes possess energy densities 1000 times greater than conventional chemical sources. Their power density is a function of β- flux saturation point relative to the planar (2D) configuration, β- emission range, and the semiconductor converter, the betavoltaic (βV) cell, properties. The figure of merit is the beta (β-)-flux surface power density (Pβ− in μWn per cm2 footprint), where an optimal portion of incident beta particles penetrates the surrounding semiconductor depletion region. Tritiated nitroxides are favorable radioisotope sources with the potential to have the highest specific activity (Am in Ci/g) and Pβ− for an organic compound in solid form. The goal of this research is to demonstrate a tritiated nitroxide nuclear battery using the planar (2D) coupling configuration. The reproducible tritiation procedure produced stable product with a Am of approximately 635 Ci/g, which was 70% of the theoretical Am. For the nuclear battery demonstration, the tritiated nitroxide, dissolved in methanol, was deposited on a 4H-SiC βV and InGaP photovoltaic (PV) cell using a dispensing apparatus and micropipette. Both devices’ characteristics were measured beforehand using a controlled electron beam source to approximate the surface radioactivity from the deposited radioisotope. The maximum power point (MPP) of the 4H-SiC and InGaP were 7.77 nW/cm2 and 1.63 nW/cm2 with 100 mCi and 67 mCi, respectively. The power and total efficiency were lower than expected due to partial solvent evaporation and droplet thickness. Numerical models using MCNP6 Monte Carlo code were used to simulate an optimal nuclear battery prototype. The models’ accuracy was confirmed with the device calibration curves and a previous metal tritide model based on empirical results. Based on optimal model results, the tritiated nitroxide saturation layer thickness (D0.99) and Pβ−(D0.99) were 10 µm and 558 nW/cm2, respectively, using a 4H-SiC. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"Gallium compounds; Optimal systems; Radioisotopes; Semiconductor alloys; Silicon carbide; Tritium; Wide band gap semiconductors; Device calibration; Electron beam source; InGaP photovoltaic; Maximum power point; Monte Carlo codes; Radioisotope sources; Solvent evaporation; Specific activity; Nuclear batteries; methanol; nitroxide; radioisotope; Article; betavoltaic cell; calibration; concentration (parameters); dispensing apparatus; electron beam; mathematical model; maximum power point; nuclear battery; photovoltaic cell; priority journal; radioactivity; radiological parameters",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058483227

Echocardiographic studies conducted in ambulatory patients, 18 yr of age or older, between January 2012 and July 2016, at our medical center, for whom climate data on the day of the echocardiogram study were available, were retrospectively included in case climate data. Discomfort index, apparent temperature, temperature-humidity index, and thermal index were computed. Echocardiograms conducted in hotter months (June–November) were compared with those done in colder months (December–May). The cohort consisted of 11,348 individuals, 46.2% women, and mean age of 57.9 18.1 yr. Climate indexes correlated directly with stroke volume (r 0.039) and e= (lateral r 0.047; septal r 0.038), and inversely with systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP; r 0.038) (all P values 0.05). After adjustment for age and sex, echocardiograms conducted during June–November had a lower chance to show e= septal 7 cm/s (odds ratio 0.88, 95% confidence interval 0.78 – 0.98, P 0.017) and SPAP 40 mmHg (odds ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.67– 0.99, P 0.04) compared with those conducted in other months.

Crop protection against common voles is a complex task that requires the consideration of a set of preventive and control measures within an integrated pest management strategy. A possible option could be to modify farming practices to reduce the availability of refuges for rodents and the damage to crops that they subsequently cause. Farming, however, must simultaneously meet multiple goals including the reduction of the carbon (C) emissions, soil erosion and water use, and the improvement of soil quality. Crop establishment through conservation agriculture strategies, like zero-tillage, would reduce crop management investment, but is also promoted in many regions to reduce C emissions and increase soil organic matter. It could, however, create favourable refuge habitats for fossorial rodent crop pests, like common voles, benefitting from reduced soil disturbance between crop rotations and thus increasing burrow persistence. Assessing the impact that tillage practices, their interaction with different crops and the influence of proximity to potential common vole sources, have on common vole occupancy could provide a valuable tool within an integrated management strategy. Using a 2-ha experimental field with 62 plots 180 m2 (each roughly matching common vole home range size) located experimental plots in north-western Spain, we tested how tillage practices, crop type (wheat, barley, vetch, Narbonne vetch, pea and fallow) and distances from possible colonization sources affect field use by common vole during low population density conditions. Our results show that tillage practices have more influence on common vole occurrence (zero tillage &gt; reduced and conventional tillage) than other aspects such as crop type thus supporting the hypothesis that tillage practices play a key role in common vole habitat use. © 2018","Land-use; Outbreak management; Pest; Tillage","agricultural practice; carbon emission; integrated approach; integrated pest management; land use; pest species; population outbreak; refuge; rodent; soil erosion; soil organic matter; soil quality; water use; zero tillage; Spain; Hordeum; Microtus arvalis; Pisum sativum; Rodentia; Triticum aestivum; Vicia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057213302

The greenhouse gas (GHG) impact of three forest-based bioenergy systems from the USA, Canada and Spain supplying wood pellets for electricity in the UK were evaluated by conducting lifecycle assessments and forest carbon modelling of the three forest systems. Cumulative emissions were analysed by calculating the forest carbon stock change and net GHG emissions balance of the forest-based bioenergy electricity. The analysis considered both the replacement of the existing electricity mix with bioenergy electricity and forest management with and without bioenergy use. The supply chain emissions and forest carbon balances indicated that GHG emission reductions are possible. However, the cumulative net GHG balance at forest landscape scale revealed that the reduction potential is limited, potentially with no GHG reductions in fast growing forests with shorter rotations, while slow growing forest systems with longer rotations result in greater GHG reductions. This means that the maximum climate benefit is delivered at a different point in time for different forest systems.

Missing from such assessments is consideration of higher flow periods, when flow paths and chemical concentrations change and episodic acidification may occur. Stream samples collected weekly and bi-hourly during high-flow storm events from 1992 to 2015 at three watersheds representing a gradient in response to acid deposition in the south-eastern United States were used to evaluate temporal trends in acid anions, base cations, acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), and pH for each of five distinct flow exceedance regimes, as well as trends in concentration–discharge (C–Q) relationships. For the most well-buffered watershed (mean ANC = 220 μeq L −1 ), ANC and pH increased at a similar rate for baseflow and storm flow conditions. Decreases in sulfate controlled ANC trends at higher flows, whereas smaller sulfate decreases in combination with base cation increases resulted in similar ANC improvements for low-flow periods. For the most acid sensitive watershed (mean ANC = 10 μeq L −1 ), no trends in ANC or pH were observed for the lowest flows (&gt;90% flow exceedance), whereas reductions in sulfate resulted in significant increases in ANC during higher flow conditions. At all sites, greater rates of sulfate decline during high-flow, as compared with low-flow, conditions are likely a result of a reduced capacity of near surface soils to adsorb and retain sulfur in these non-glaciated watersheds. Overall, consistent increases in pH (~0.01–0.02 pH units year −1 ) during higher flow conditions (&lt;10% flow exceedance) in contrast to the variable trends observed during lower flows (&gt;50% flow exceedance) illustrate that episodic acidification is recovering at an equal or greater rate than chronic acidification in these watersheds. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","chronic acidification; episodic acidification; headwater streams; pH; streamwater; sulfate; surface water recovery; watersheds","Acidification; Air pollution; Deposition; Positive ions; Recovery; Storms; Sulfur compounds; Surface waters; Watersheds; Episodic acidification; Headwater stream; Stream water; sulfate; Water recovery; pH; acid deposition; concentration (composition); headwater; pH; spatiotemporal analysis; streamflow; streamwater; sulfate; surface water; watershed; Europe; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060348967

To investigate similar phenomena in West Virginia, we measure and characterize emissions from abandoned and active conventional oil and gas wells. In addition, we reconcile divergent regional CH4 emissions estimates by comparing our West Virginia emissions estimates with those from other states in the United States. We find the CH4 emission factors from 112 plugged and 147 unplugged wells in West Virginia are 0.1 g CH4 h−1 and 3.2 g CH4 h−1, respectively. The highest emitting unplugged abandoned wells in WV are those most recently abandoned, with the mean emission of wells abandoned between 1993 and 2015 of 16 g CH4 h−1 compared to the mean of those abandoned before 1993 of 3 × 10−3 g CH4 h−1. Using field observations at a historic mining area as a proxy for state-wide drilling activity in the late 19th/early 20th century, we estimate the number of abandoned wells in WV at between 60,000 and 760,000 wells. Methane emission factors from active conventional wells were estimated at 138 g CH4 h−1. We did not find an emission pattern relating to age of wells or operator for active wells, however, the CH4 emission factor for active conventional wells was 7.5 times larger than the emission factor used by the EPA for conventional oil and gas wells. Our results suggest that well emission factors for active and abandoned wells can vary within the same geologic formation and may be affected by differences in state regulations. Therefore, accounting for state-level variations is critical for accuracy in greenhouse gas emissions inventories, which are used to guide emissions reduction strategies. © 2018","Emission factor; Methane; Oil and gas wells; State-level variation","Emission control; Gas emissions; Gas industry; Greenhouse gases; Laws and legislation; Methane; Natural gas wells; Conventional oil and gas; Emission factors; Emissions reduction; Geologic formations; Oil and gas infrastructures; Oil and gas well; Regional variability; State-level variation; Abandoned wells; methane; emission inventory; gas well; greenhouse gas; methane; oil well; air pollution; Article; chemical analysis; concentration (parameters); gas field; mining; offshore oil industry; oil field; priority journal; United States; West Virginia; United States; West Virginia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054962400

To achieve these goals, an intelligent, context-aware, adaptive energy management platform is required. This paper will demonstrate two district energy management optimisation strategies; one that optimises district heat generation from a multi-vector energy centre and a second that directly controls building demand via the heating set point temperature in addition to the heat generation. Several Artificial Neural Networks are used to predict variables such as building demand, solar photovoltaic generation, and indoor temperature. These predictions are utilised within a Genetic Algorithm to determine the optimal operating schedules of the heat generation equipment, thermal storage, and the heating set point temperature. Optimising the generation of heat for the district led to a 44.88% increase in profit compared to a rule-based, priority order baseline strategy. An additional 8.04% increase in profit was achieved when the optimisation could also directly control a proportion of building demand. These results demonstrates the potential gain when energy can be managed in a more holistic manner considering multiple energy vectors as well as both supply and demand. © 2018 The Authors","Artificial neural network; Building energy optimisation; Energy management; Genetic algorithm; Multi-vector energy systems","Energy efficiency; Energy management; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Heat generation; Heat storage; Microgrids; Profitability; Solar power generation; Thermostats; Vectors; Building energy; District energy systems; Energy generations; Energy systems; Generation equipment; Management platforms; Set-point temperatures; Solar photovoltaic generations; Neural networks; artificial neural network; demand analysis; electricity supply; energy efficiency; energy planning; equipment; genetic algorithm; greenhouse gas; heating; optimization; photovoltaic system; power generation; renewable resource; solar power; strategic approach; temperature effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056486297

Climate adaptation plans have prioritized water saving to prevent the devastating consequences of drought. To develop such adaptation plans, it is critical to understand the water-use patterns of cities. The present research determines the water consumption for irrigation of green spaces and residential gardens in metropolitan area of Santiago, Chile (MAS) and compares this consumption with the expected vegetation water requirements estimated using a hydrological model. The monthly water consumption was obtained from a database of drinking water meters provided by the private water utility serving most of the MAS, which includes 110 large parks and 1882 small parks. The MAS shows higher water consumption during the summer dry months (November to April). The water use for irrigation is higher than the modelled demand of vegetation, which entails a significant chance to save water. The irrigation rate of public spaces is lower than private spaces, and closer to the modelled demand. In all cases, the landscaping based on extensive lawn surfaces seems to be the main driver of over-irrigation. Further research is required to study the trade-offs between the urban green benefits and the costs of irrigation in semi-arid and Mediterranean cities. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Green infrastructure; Hydrological model; Santiago de Chile; Urban vegetation; Water-use pattern","Climate models; Economic and social effects; Housing; Hydrology; Irrigation; Potable water; Vegetation; Water conservation; Water supply; Green infrastructure; Hydrological modeling; Santiago de Chile; Urban vegetation; Water use; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; greenspace; home garden; hydrological modeling; infrastructure; irrigation; Mediterranean environment; metropolitan area; plant water relations; public space; vegetation; water use; Chile; Metropolitana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055096781

For operational daily forecasts of pollutant concentrations, usually long-term emission averages are used which may differ significantly from real values for a certain day, especially in big cities with intense and variable human activities. The online coupled atmospheric chemical transport model COSMO-ART was implemented for the Moscow region, Russia. A method for calculation of pollutant emissions for short-term forecasting was suggested. In this method, “actual” emissions for a certain day are obtained from measurements of air pollutant concentrations. It is assumed that the pollutant concentration reflects the spatially averaged intensity of emission sources. We used the observational data of pollutant concentrations from the network of the State Ecological Monitoring System of Moscow City. In order to get a more homogeneous field of data, “virtual” stations (so-called ""bogus data"") were added within the areas not covered with observations. The proposed method allows a transformation of the hourly measurements of air pollutant concentration to emission values just after the measurements are completed. We showed the application of this method for carbon monoxide. Verification of COSMO-ART results demonstrates that the forecasts based on emissions calculated by the new method are better than the ones based on climate mean emissions. The approach suggested in the study provides a possibility to issue more detailed operational short-term forecasts of pollutant concentrations for megacities depending on the real air pollution of the previous day. The main limitation of this methodology is that it can be applied to the chemical species that have longer chemical life-time compared to the frequency of concentration measurements. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","air quality forecast; Atmospheric chemical-transport modelling; carbon monoxide; emission calculation method","Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Carbon monoxide; Air pollutant concentrations; Air quality forecasts; Carbon monoxide concentration; Chemical transport; Chemical transport models; Concentration Measurement; Emission calculation; Pollutant concentration; Weather forecasting; air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; concentration (composition); emission; megacity; Moscow [(CTY) Russian Federation]; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062291093

The combination of district heating systems with solar thermal energy and seasonal thermal energy storage has successfully reduced the carbon intensity of heating in different countries, such as Denmark, Germany and Canada. The potentials of such systems to decarbonise the heat demand in the UK has also been highlighted in different reports. Nevertheless, bottom-up quantitative studies to support or dismissive these potentials are very limited. The quantification can be provided by simulating a solar district heating system using UK-specific inputs, such as heat demand and weather profiles. In this study, a validated simulation model is used to study the performance of solar district heating systems with seasonal thermal storage deployed in the UK. The case study is based on the Drake Landing Solar Community in Okotoks, Canada, which has a relatively high solar fraction. The results show that the system is technically feasible to be implemented in the UK but that it has lower technical performance. A systematic analysis of the influence of the main components on the system performance shows that not only the solar supply and heat demand need to be balanced but also that the long-term storage needs to be appropriately sized. The relatively lower solar fraction could be offset by installing more long-term storage and implementing the system to supply new-built houses with better energy performance rather than the current building stock of older homes. Financially, the system still needs to be supported by encouraging policies to make it competitive with incumbent technologies. The results and the validated model open the possibility to design bespoke solar district heating systems for the UK and other countries in middle to high latitudes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","District heating; Seasonal thermal energy storage; Techno-economic; Thermal energy storage; TRNSYS","Economic analysis; Heat storage; Heating equipment; Solar energy; Thermal energy; District heating system; Incumbent technology; Solar thermal energy; Systematic analysis; Technical performance; Techno-Economic analysis; Techno-economics; TRNSYS; District heating; building; demand analysis; economic analysis; energy storage; energy use; heating; model validation; performance assessment; seasonality; solar power; thermal power; Canada; Denmark; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057752893

Similarly, o-phthalic acid, succinic acid, and 2,3-dihydroxy-4-oxopentanoic acid (DPA) concentrations also significantly decreased during the Parade, with reductions of 63, 50, and 61%, respectively, compared with before the event. Photochemical oxidation played an important role in the formation of o-phthalic acid, while the formation of DPA was influenced by both photochemical oxidation and liquid-phase chemical reactions. The lung cancer risk, caused by inhalation exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, to the exposed populations decreased by 40% during the 2015 China Victory Day Parade, the enhanced control measures implemented during Parade Blue would also have positive influence on the human health. © 2018","Health risk assessment; Organic acids; Parade Blue; Primary organic aerosols; Strengthening control measures","Aerosols; Air quality; Carboxylic acids; Emission control; Health risks; Organic acids; Photochemical reactions; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Reduction; Risk assessment; Average concentration; Control measures; Inhalation exposure; Organic aerosol; Parade Blue; Photochemical oxidation; Regional air pollution; Traffic restrictions; Quality control; alkane; cholesterol; dehydroabietic acid; levoglucosan; palmitic acid; phthalic acid; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; stearic acid; succinic acid; aerosol composition; air quality; cancer; concentration (composition); emission control; health risk; organic acid; oxidation; photochemistry; reduction; traffic emission; aerosol; air pollution control; air quality; Article; biomass; cancer risk; chemical composition; chemical reaction; China; combustion; cooking; environmental exposure; human; lung cancer; meteorology; particulate matter; photooxidation; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); risk assessment; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056187282

Quantification of CH 4 emissions from oil and natural gas (O&amp;NG) operations is important for establishing scientifically sound policies for mitigating greenhouse gases. We use the aircraft mass balance approach for three flight experiments in August and September 2015 to estimate CH 4 emissions from O&amp;NG operations over the southwestern Marcellus Shale. We estimate a mean CH 4 emission rate as 21.2 kg/s with 28% coming from O&amp;NG operations. The mean CH 4 emission rate from O&amp;NG operations was estimated to be 1.1% of total NG production. The individual best-estimate emission rates from the three flight experiments ranged from 0.78 to 1.5%, with overall limits of 0% and 3.5%. These emission rates are at the low end of other top-down studies, but consistent with the few observational studies in the Marcellus Shale region as well as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency CH 4 inventory. A substantial source of CH 4 (~70% of observed CH 4 emissions) was found to contain little ethane, possibly due to coalbed CH 4 emitted either directly from coal mines or from wells drilled through coalbed layers in O&amp;NG operations. Recent regulations requiring capture of gas from the completion-venting step of hydraulic fracturing appear to have reduced the atmospheric release of CH 4 . Our study suggests that for a 20-year time scale, energy derived from the combustion of natural gas extracted from this region likely exerts a net climate benefit compared to coal. ©2019.

All operations aimed to limit emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere are motivated by the growing environmental awareness of developed societies and alarming reports on the global warming and its effects. In Poland, legal regulations are the answer to this problem. According to them, it is necessary to reduce the limit values of the heat transfer coefficient for partitions in rebuilt buildings. These values will be successively tightened until 1 January 2021. The compliance with the limits of the heat transfer coefficient is also required for historic buildings. For obvious reasons, historical buildings do not meet the technical requirements imposed on modern architectural structures. The constructional technique of partitions in historic buildings and building materials used in them require to undertake additional actions to provide thermal extra insulation of such buildings. The provision of extra insulation of historic buildings so that they can meet the assumed technical requirements is a challenge for designers and manufacturers of materials used for extra insulation in buildings. The first part of the paper covers the influence of modern thermal retrofitting methods and techniques applied in historic buildings conducted under the provisions of law onto the preservation of authenticity of the historical tissue of monuments. The paper analyses a variety of traditional and most recent methods and materials used in the provision of thermal insulation of external vertical partitions in historic wooden and brick-based buildings with wooden and masonry structures. Then the second part of the paper based on the conducted analyses determines the effectiveness of the adopted thermal retrofitting techniques, threats resulting from the applied methods towards the authenticity of historic building structures. At the same time, a set of factors which are relevant to the preservation of the authentic character of historic buildings was specified. To sum up, on the grounds of the conducted research studies it was indicated that the thermal retrofitting methods applied currently in historic buildings based on the provision of extra insulation for vertical partitions (applied from the inside of buildings) in reversible techniques do not admittedly devastate the authentic structure of walls but still do not ensure the expected and required technical parameters (and in the case of wooden architecture they lead even to accelerated degradation). The effective thermal retrofitting methods involving external extra insulation of partitions damage the authentic tissue of monuments. As a result of stricter legal regulations and a lack of good thermal retrofitting methods, it may be necessary to decommission historic buildings from their use. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Architecture; Authentication; Fuels; Global warming; Heat transfer coefficients; Laws and legislation; Masonry materials; Retrofitting; Thermal insulation; Tissue; Urban planning; Accelerated degradation; Architectural structure; Environmental awareness; Harmful substances; Historic buildings; Historical buildings; Methods and materials; Technical requirement; Historic preservation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062429065

The land and its agriculture are being affected by climate changes in different ways, e.g., variations in annual rainfall, average temperature, heat waves, modifications in weeds, pests or microbes, global change of atmospheric CO2 or ozone level, and fluctuations in sea level. The threat of varying global climate has greatly driven the attention of scientists, as these variations are imparting negative impact on global crop production and compromising food security worldwide. According to some predicted reports, agriculture is considered the most endangered activity adversely affected by climate changes. To date, food security and ecosystem resilience are the most concerning subjects worldwide. Climate-smart agriculture is the only way to lower the negative impact of climate variations on crop adaptation, before it might affect global crop production drastically. In this review paper, we summarize the causes of climate change, stresses produced due to climate change, impacts on crops, modern breeding technologies, and biotechnological strategies to cope with climate change, in order to develop climate resilient crops. Revolutions in genetic engineering techniques can also aid in overcoming food security issues against extreme environmental conditions, by producing transgenic plants. © 2018 by the author.","Climate change; Crop adaptation; Genetic engineering; Genome wide association studies (GWAS); Hormone responses; Marker-assisted selection (MSA); Molecular breeding; Physiological responses",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063297669

However, most contemporary air quality models lack a mechanistic representation of the biogeochemical processes that form these gases. They typically use heavily parameterized equations to simulate emissions of NO independently from NH 3 and do not quantify emissions of HONO or N 2 O. This study introduces a mechanistic, process-oriented representation of soil emissions of N species (NO, HONO, N 2 O, and NH 3 ) that we have recently implemented in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The mechanistic scheme accounts for biogeochemical processes for soil N transformations such as mineralization, volatilization, nitrification, and denitrification. The rates of these processes are influenced by soil parameters, meteorology, land use, and mineral N availability. We account for spatial heterogeneity in soil conditions and biome types by using a global dataset for soil carbon (C) and N across terrestrial ecosystems to estimate daily mineral N availability in nonagricultural soils, which was not accounted for in earlier parameterizations for soil NO. Our mechanistic scheme also uses daily year-specific fertilizer use estimates from the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC v0509) agricultural model. A soil map with sub-grid biome definitions was used to represent conditions over the continental United States. CMAQ modeling for May and July 2011 shows improvement in model performance in simulated NO 2 columns compared to Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite retrievals for regions where soils are the dominant source of NO emissions. We also assess how the new scheme affects model performance for NO x (NO+NO 2 ), fine nitrate (NO 3 ) particulate matter, and ozone observed by various ground-based monitoring networks. Soil NO emissions in the new mechanistic scheme tend to fall between the magnitudes of the previous parametric schemes and display much more spatial heterogeneity. The new mechanistic scheme also accounts for soil HONO, which had been ignored by parametric schemes. © 2019 Author(s).",,"air quality; ammonia; atmospheric modeling; biogeochemical cycle; biome; biotransformation; fertilizer application; heterogeneity; nitrous acid; nitrous oxide; nutrient availability; ozone; soil emission; soil nitrogen; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062457911

It is often unclear why cities would adopt such policies, however, given that the benefits from climate mitigation will be felt globally, rather than exclusively locally. Studies have identified a rationale for urban mitigation and energy policies rooted in local co-benefits, such as improvements in local environmental quality or job creation. Here we explore the possibility of financial co-benefits: whether municipal climate policies lead to an enhanced creditworthiness. This would translate into reduced borrowing costs for other infrastructure projects. Interviewing key informants from cities, investment firms and rating agencies, we find that rating agencies do consider climate policies in their ratings. This clearly applies to those climate policies that can result in demonstrable net economic gains to the municipality. However even those mitigation and energy policies that come at net costs to cities can have positive impacts on rating assessments, either because the policies are seen as reducing regulatory risks, or because they send positive signals to those investors having global sustainability agendas. Interestingly, those least aware of these factors appear to be city leaders themselves. This suggests a need to make them aware of how rating agencies and investors positively view climate mitigation policies. © 2018 The Authors","Cities; Climate policies; Creditworthiness; Energy policies; Infrastructure; Low carbon investment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054603329

The solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine system design consists of an adequate gas cleaning section for contaminants removal, solid oxide fuel cell as the main power producer and an anode offgas pressure swing adsorption based CO2 capture unit. This system is thermodynamically and techno-economically analyzed and compared with a reheat steam turbine. Furthermore, the reheat steam turbine is retrofitted with a CO2 capture unit. It is then compared to the solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine system to analyse the difference in system efficiencies. The solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine system yields an electrical efficiency of 64%, which is significantly higher than electrical efficiency achieved by both, a conventional reheat steam cycle (34.1%) and the retrofitted system (27.0%). Moreover, it depicts a combined heat and power efficiency of 73%. Results also reveal that the solid oxide fuel cell-gas turbine system can achieve a reduction of 50% in CO2 emissions for equal power production.

However, there exist several challenges to the success of such restoration projects. In this paper, one such key challenge, that of the risk of extreme climatic events, is considered. Optimal rate of mangrove restoration on public coastal lands is derived in the presence of a future risk of extreme cyclones decimating the mangrove forests. Using the context of the Sundarbans region of India, which has the largest mangrove forests on the planet, we develop a model of community led restoration efforts where local inhabitants receive credit for carbon sequestered in the process. Results indicate that when communities do not receive outside support through wages or reimbursement of plantation costs, restoration efforts get spread over a longer time horizon. Presence of a risk of future cyclone events that could destroy the restored forests prompts speedier restoration, which may not be an optimal outcome from the perspective of global carbon mitigation efforts. An optimal plan that is primarily concerned with deriving sequestration benefits from newly restored mangroves leads to lower restoration levels in the presence of higher cyclone risks. However, irrespective of the institutional setting under which restoration is incentivized, given the relatively stable nature of underground carbon stored in mangroves, it is optimal to undertake higher restoration efforts when climatic risks are low. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Blue carbon; Cyclone risks in sundarbans; Land use change; Mangrove restoration; Mangrove restoration failure; Payments for environmental services","climate variation; coastal zone management; ecosystem service; environmental risk; land use change; mangrove; optimization; restoration ecology; Sundarbans; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057303752

While poaching and encroachment challenges in conservation parks are of immediate nature, climate-related risks exist in the long term. The park manager faces a utility function that includes as its arguments local community’s incomes, benefits to the larger society from preserving threatened species and the financial costs of monitoring and land-use change efforts. Using the case of single-horned rhinos in the Kaziranga National Park, India, an optimal mix of monitoring and land-use changes is designed in presence of tradeoffs between short- and long-term management efforts. As monitoring only addresses immediate challenges associated with poaching and encroachment, long-term climatic risks remain ignored. Land-use management offers riskprotection as well as risk-insurance benefits with respect to climate change-induced flooding of the park. Recommendations for Resource Managers • It is important to incorporate both short- and longterm risks posed to endangered wildlife while investing in conservation efforts. There may exist a tradeoff between mitigating short- and long-run risks due to financial and physical resource constraints. However, ignoring long-term risks to wildlife habitats can jeopardize past conservation efforts. • Land-use management, both within and outside of conservation reserves, enhances resilience to climatic shocks through reducing flooding risks and must be an essential part of wildlife conservation efforts. • Conservation efforts ignoring local community welfare considerations can become suboptimal as they lead to reduced cooperation and potential conflicts.

However, realizing this promise requires addressing a number of challenges characteristic of the forest sector. Forests are complex social-ecological systems (SESs) with myriad interactions and feedbacks potentially linked to policy impacts. This complexity makes it hard for machine learning methods to distinguish between significant causal relationships and random fluctuations due to noise. In this context, SES frameworks together with quasi-experimental impact evaluation approaches can facilitate the use of machine learning by providing guidance on the choice of variables while reducing bias in estimated effects. Here we combine an SES framework, optimal matching, and Causal Tree-based algorithms to examine causal impacts of two community forest management policies (forest cooperatives and joint state-community partnerships) on vegetation growth in the Indian Himalaya. We find that neither policy had a major impact on average, but there was important heterogeneity in effects conditional on local contextual conditions. For joint forest management, a set of biophysical and climate factors shaped differential policy impacts across the study region. By contrast, cooperative forest management performed much better in locations where existing grazing-based livelihoods were safeguarded. Stronger local institutions and secure tenure under cooperative management explain the difference in outcomes between the two policies. Despite their potential, machine learning approaches do have limitations, including absence of valid precision estimates for heterogeneity estimates and issues of estimate stability. Therefore, they should be viewed as a complement to impact evaluation approaches that, among other potential uses, can uncover key drivers of heterogeneity and generate new questions and hypotheses to improve knowledge and policy relating to forest and other natural resource governance challenges. © 2019 The Author(s).

Coyoacán, Mexico City, Mexico","N 2 O is a GHG of environmental concern. It is generated from the nitrous material contained in wastewater and is the sixth most important contributor to N 2 O emissions. There is a great variety of methods to quantify the emission of N 2 O in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which present variants among them, such as predetermined values and operational data of the plants. In this paper, we compared three different methods to quantify the N 2 O emission in 2015 from WWTP in two metropolitan areas with high population density: Mexico City and the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (MAB). MAB has advanced treatment plants that remove nutrients from wastewater, and Mexico City has only traditional treatment plants. The N 2 O emission/inhabitant from WWTPs in MAB (3,214,211 inhabitants served) was 40% lower than the plants in Mexico City (1,806,440 inhabitants served). The MAB emission was 0.009 tCO 2 e/inhabitant and 0.013 tCO 2 e/inhabitant in Mexico City; these emission values could be considered statistically different with a risk error of 5%. This difference could be due to the fact that MAB has nutrient removal (42% of inhabitants served), and Mexico City has only traditional treatment plants. The results obtained may be influenced by the default emission factors of each methodology. In addition, per capita protein consumption and water consumption per inhabitant are different parameters that must be considered between these zones to quantify and compare the emission of N 2 O. The integral methods are closer to the reality of the N 2 O emission when the operating parameters of each plant and wastewater are considered. There should be more research on the reduction of this GHG in wastewater treatment for a correct quantification of these emissions, and more especially in the estimation of N 2 O emission factors suitable for each treatment plant and study area. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Global warming; Greenhouse gas; N 2 O emissions; Nitrous oxide; Wastewater treatment","Developing countries; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Nutrients; Population statistics; Reclamation; Comparative analysis; Default emission factors; Environmental concerns; High population density; Nitrous oxide; Operating parameters; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment system; Wastewater treatment; carbon dioxide; nitrous oxide; comparative study; developing world; emission; global warming; greenhouse gas; metropolitan area; nitrous oxide; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; comparative study; developed country; developing country; Doorn and Liles methodology; environmental aspects and related phenomena; fluid intake; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; Lara and Prendez methodology; methodology; Mexico City; nitrous oxide emission; population density; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; Spain; urban area; waste component removal; waste water management; waste water treatment plant; Barcelona [Barcelona (PRV)]; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico City; Mexico [North America]; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060949802

This study investigates the situational factors affecting the consequences on coastal livelihoods, and social activities; it also considers the effectiveness of traditional knowledge in reducing possible risks. Both qualitative and quantitative methods were employed, including questionnaire survey for identifying the local perception of climatic impacts alongside the impacts on daily activities. Interviews, field observations, and multivariate analyses were performed to explain the vulnerability status in coastal communities. Results show that most livelihood sectors were severely affected by the long-term and repeated actions of climatic hazards, such as cyclones, associated with a number of unavoidable risks making people susceptible to damages in social wellbeing. In addition, saltwater intrusion damages drinking water supply and crop farming, which can cause diseases among coastal communities, but very few attempts have been made to provide alternative sources of drinking water at a household level. Moreover, principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) revealed significant interfaces between local perceptions and the socio-and agro-environmental factors changing the overall status of regional hazards. Thus, the situation exhibits coastal hazards, social vulnerability, and social crisis. Local people use their traditional knowledge to cope with various levels of crisis under vulnerable conditions, but sometimes doing so exceeds their capacity owing to the unwanted changes in climatic variables and knowledge gaps or uncertainties. Challenges on the basis of the problematic points should be noted, however, it would be more significant to achieve social sustainability under adverse climatic conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Coastal hazards; Livelihood crisis; Multivariate statistics; Social vulnerability; Traditional knowledge uncertainty","drinking water; rain; climate change; coastal zone; coastal zone management; drinking water; livelihood; local participation; multivariate analysis; perception; questionnaire survey; saline intrusion; traditional knowledge; vulnerability; adult; aged; agricultural worker; aquaculture; Article; Bangladesh; climate change; cluster analysis; coastal waters; crop production; economic aspect; environmental change; environmental exposure; environmental factor; environmental impact; environmental stress; environmental temperature; female; fishing; flooding; health hazard; human; hurricane; internal consistency; male; meteorology; nonhuman; principal component analysis; qualitative research; quantitative study; risk assessment; risk reduction; salinity; seashore; social behavior; social capital; social evolution; soil fertility; water temperature; waterlogging; agriculture; hurricane; water supply; Bangladesh; Agriculture; Bangladesh; Climate Change; Cyclonic Storms; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055994632

The flame structure and the heat transfer characteristics of the impinging methane diffusion flame and partially premixed flame are experimentally investigated. The heat transfer characteristics of the impinging methane flame are determined using the minimization technique wherein the target surface is impinged by a methane flame from the bottom and is simultaneously cooled from the top by air jets of different Reynolds number. At steady state, one-dimensional energy balance across the impingement surface provides an over-determined system of equations which when solved using the minimization technique give the heat transfer coefficient of the flame jet, the reference temperature and the emissivity of the gas/flame beneath the impingement surface. The stagnation point heat transfer coefficient and reference temperature are found to be maximum for the case of flame just touching the impingement surface. The radial variation of the non-dimensional heat transfer coefficient and reference temperature is found to have a Gaussian profile. For low H/d's where the flame is impinging the target surface, the temperature at the stagnation zone is lower than in the radial position as the hot jet turns in the radial direction and impinges at a distance slightly away from the stagnation region. The separation of heat transfer components indicates that the heat transfer is convective dominant with radiation accounting to 10% of the total incident heat flux in the case of methane diffusion flame and 3.5% in the case of partially premixed flame. Re-radiation becomes a significant component of heat transfer, accounting to 25–30% of the incident heat flux, due to higher wall temperatures. The present study also investigates the effect of tube burner to plate spacing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Methane diffusion and partially premixed flame impingement; Separation of heat transfer components; Spatial variation of emissivity and temperature","Diffusion; Electromagnetic wave emission; Heat transfer coefficients; Jets; Methane; Reynolds number; Heat transfer characteristics; High heat transfers; Impingement surfaces; Minimization techniques; Partially premixed flames; Reference temperature; Spatial variations; Well-established techniques; Heat flux",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054768046

Indicators were selected from the list of the World Meteorological Organization–Commission for Climatology (WMO–CCL) and the Research Programme on Climate Variability and Predictability (CLIVAR). The indicators included the number of days with precipitation greater than or equal to 10 mm/day (R10), maximum number of consecutive dry days (CDD; days with precipitation lower that 1 mm), maximum 5-day precipitation total (R5D), and simple daily intensity index (SDII) which is the annual precipitation total divided by number of days with precipitation greater than or equal to 1 mm, and the fraction of annual total precipitation due to events exceeding the 95th percentile (R95T) based on the period 1961–1990. Positive trends in the results were found for a majority of stations for R10, R5D, SDII, and R95T. Consecutive dry days was the only index that had a negative trend at a majority of stations. Spatial pattern analysis indicates greater changes in frequencies and magnitudes for eastern Kansas. Results from this study highlight observed climate shifts in precipitation patterns with a tendency towards greater and more frequent extreme precipitation in eastern Kansas and a tendency towards drier conditions in western Kansas.

Overall at the average 0.22 d SRT condition, both A-stage and CS had similar carbon capture behavior (42–43%) and thus the similar potential for energy recovery. However, the A-stage had better effluent quality (67 mg VSS/L) through the growth of more heterotrophic biomass leading to increased oxidation (22% vs 18%), and increased fraction of nitrogen (26% vs 19%) and phosphorous (36% vs 30%) redirection compared to the CS. At biomass limited conditions and at lower SRT, CS maintained better performance, potentially through a better extracellular polymeric substance management under feast-famine conditions. Full-scale plant energy calculations based on this study results showed that chemically enhanced primary treatment (CEPT), A-stage, CS, primary treatment + CS and CEPT + CS could all lead to energy neutral plants as enough carbon can be redirected to generate the energy needed to support wastewater treatment.

Controlled carbon doping provides a favorable pathway for constructing more oxygen vacancies and active functional groups on the TiO 2 surface. The estimation of work functions based on Kelvin probe force microscopy reveals that there is a significant change in the energy band states during controlled carbon doping on TiO 2 . Both substitutional and interstitial carbon doping in TiO 2 lattice introduce more surface active sites which significantly enhance the ethanol gas sensing performance (34.8%) compared to undoped TiO 2 (8.5%) with rapid response/recovery time (2 and 2.8 s) at reduced operating temperature (150 °C) and possess negligible noise to signal ratio. The interfacial reaction mechanism between the ionosorbed species during ethanol gas sensing demonstrates that presence of ionosorbed oxygen species and oxygen vacancies formed in the anatase TiO 2 lattice during C-doping is found to have profound roles in the redox reactions.

Yet limited information is available on the PAO community and the metabolic capabilities in full-scale EBPR systems operating at high temperature. We studied the composition of the key functional PAO communities in three full-scale wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) with high in-situ EBPR activity in Singapore, their EBPR-associated carbon usage characteristics, and the relationship between carbon usage and community composition. Each plant had a signature community composed of diverse putative PAOs with multiple operational taxonomic units (OTUs) affiliated to Ca. Accumulibacter, Tetrasphaera spp., Dechloromonas and Ca. Obscuribacter. Despite the differences in community composition, ex-situ anaerobic phosphorus (P)-release tests with 24 organic compounds from five categories (including four sugars, three alcohols, three volatile fatty acids (VFAs), eight amino acids and six other carboxylic acids) showed that a wide range of organic compounds could potentially contribute to EBPR. VFAs induced the highest P release (12.0–18.2 mg P/g MLSS for acetate with a P release-to-carbon uptake (P:C) ratio of 0.35–0.66 mol P/mol C, 9.4–18.5 mg P/g MLSS for propionate with a P:C ratio of 0.38–0.60, and 9.5–17.3 mg P/g MLSS for n-butyrate), followed by some carboxylic acids (10.1–18.1 mg P/g MLSS for pyruvate, 4.5–11.7 mg P/g MLSS for lactate and 3.7–12.4 mg P/g MLSS for fumarate) and amino acids (3.66–7.33 mg P/g MLSS for glutamate with a P:C ratio of 0.16–0.43 mol P/mol C, and 4.01–7.37 mg P/g MLSS for aspartate with a P:C ratio of 0.17–0.48 mol P/mol C). P-release profiles (induced by different carbon sources) correlated closely with PAO community composition. High micro-diversity was observed within the Ca. Accumulibacter lineage, which represented the most abundant PAOs. The total population of Ca. Accumulibacter taxa was highly correlated with P-release induced by VFAs, highlighting the latter's importance in tropical EBPR systems. There was a strong link between the relative abundance of individual Ca. Accumulibacter OTUs and the extent of P release induced by distinct carbon sources (e.g., OTU 81 and amino acids, and OTU 246 and ethanol), suggesting niche differentiation among Ca. Accumulibacter taxa. A diverse PAO community and the ability to use numerous organic compounds are considered key factors for stable EBPR in full-scale plants at elevated temperatures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Alcohols; Amino acids; Candidatus Accumulibacter; Carbon source; Enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR); High temperature; Polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAO); Sugars; Tetrasphaera; Volatile fatty acids (VFAs)","Alcohols; Amino acids; Bacteria; Biological water treatment; Carbon; Forestry; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage treatment plants; Sugars; Tropics; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Accumulibacter; Carbon source; Enhanced biological phosphorus removal; High temperature; Polyphosphate-accumulating organisms; Tetrasphaera; Volatile fatty acids (VFAs); Volatile fatty acids; acetic acid; alcohol derivative; amino acid; carbon; glycogen; lactic acid; phosphorus; polyphosphate; pyruvic acid; volatile fatty acid; polyphosphate; activated carbon; alcohol; amino acid; bacterium; bioaccumulation; fatty acid; high temperature; microbial community; operations technology; phosphate; pollutant removal; polymer; relative abundance; tropical environment; wastewater treatment plant; Accumulibacter; Article; carbon source; controlled study; Dechloromonas; nonhuman; Obscuribacter; priority journal; Singapore; Tetrasphaera; waste component removal; waste water treatment plant; bioreactor; waste water; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Dechloromonas; Otus; Tetrasphaera; Bioreactors; Carbon; Phosphorus; Polyphosphates; Singapore; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056827612

An investigation of trends in regional features of pollutant emission and control cost is critical to better decision makings. By integrating GAINS-China model and spatial autocorrelation analysis, this study estimates and analyzes air pollutant (SO2 and NOx) emission, mitigation potential and control cost of thermal power generation in China's 31 regions from 2015 to 2030. The Business-as-Usual Scenario and Policy-Reinforced Scenario are set for comparison to quantify the effects of increasingly reinforced national emission control policies. The results show that up to 2030, with reinforced control policies and implementation of more abatement technologies, obvious mitigation effects of SO2 and NOx emission can be recognized. The regions with huge mitigation potential and higher total control cost are mainly located in the eastern coastal regions with higher gross domestic product and more power generation (such as Zhejiang, Shandong, and Jiangsu), as well as in the regions with abundant energy reserve and tremendous power supplied to other regions (such as Inner Mongolia and Shanxi). The spatial autocorrelation analysis verifies that there is significant regional disparity, as well as agglomeration effects of pollutant emission of thermal power generation. The results presented by this study are expected to provide policy makers with reference when formulating emission control policies and regional goals for thermal power generation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollutants; GAINS-China; Mitigation potential; Spatial analysis; Thermal power generation","Air pollution; Autocorrelation; Cost estimating; Decision making; Electric power system interconnection; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Reinforcement; Spatial variables measurement; Air pollutants; GAINS-China; Mitigation potential; Spatial analysis; Thermal power generation; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059331637

India has made significant progress, far more rapidly in the past 2 years, increasing the installed capacity of sustainable energy, and potentially this upward drift is anticipated to persist. The innovation in new and advanced technologies, aggressive energy policies, action, and planning activities has enabled India to resolve the barriers of commercial production of sustainable energy. The domestic production and use of renewable energy, such as off-grid power sources, i.e., solar power, wind power, small hydropower, biofuels and bioenergy from new biomass will help to reduce the fossil fuel use and its imports from other countries. Sustainable economic and industrial growth also requires safe and sustainable energy resources. The use of sustainable energy will help in strengthening low-carbon energy in India and providing a clean environment through reduction of pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. Prospective attention to financial and development needs by the use of sustainable energy will also improve the living standards of society with equity and economic sustainability. There is a strong need to extensively adopt and use sustainable energy technologies to supply off-grid power, especially in the areas with difficulty in accessing the central grid power, such as un-electrified villages, remote areas, and hilly terrains.

Here we provide an overview of recent advances in uncovering the trophic structure of soil food webs using natural variations in stable isotope ratios. We discuss approaches of application, normalization and interpretation of stable isotope ratios along with methodological pitfalls. Analysis of published data from temperate forest ecosystems is used to outline emerging concepts and perspectives in soil food web research. In contrast to aboveground and aquatic food webs, trophic fractionation at the basal level of detrital food webs is large for carbon and small for nitrogen stable isotopes. Virtually all soil animals are enriched in 13 C as compared to plant litter. This ‘detrital shift’ likely reflects preferential uptake of 13 C-enriched microbial biomass and underlines the importance of microorganisms, in contrast to dead plant material, as a major food resource for the soil animal community. Soil organic matter is enriched in 15 N and 13 C relative to leaf litter. Decomposers inhabiting mineral soil layers therefore might be enriched in 15 N resulting in overlap in isotope ratios between soil-dwelling detritivores and litter-dwelling predators. By contrast, 13 C content varies little between detritivores in upper litter and in mineral soil, suggesting that they rely on similar basal resources, i.e. little decomposed organic matter. Comparing vertical isotope gradients in animals and in basal resources can be a valuable tool to assess trophic interactions and dynamics of organic matter in soil. As indicated by stable isotope composition, direct feeding on living plant material as well as on mycorrhizal fungi is likely rare among soil invertebrates. Plant carbon is taken up predominantly by saprotrophic microorganisms and channelled to higher trophic levels of the soil food web. However, feeding on photoautotrophic microorganisms and non-vascular plants may play an important role in fuelling soil food webs. The trophic niche of most high-rank animal taxa spans at least two trophic levels, implying the use of a wide range of resources. Therefore, to identify trophic species and links in food webs, low-rank taxonomic identification is required. Despite overlap in feeding strategies, stable isotope composition of the high-rank taxonomic groups reflects differences in trophic level and in the use of basal resources. Different taxonomic groups of predators and decomposers are likely linked to different pools of organic matter in soil, suggesting different functional roles and indicating that trophic niches in soil animal communities are phylogenetically structured. During last two decades studies using stable isotope analysis have elucidated the trophic structure of soil communities, clarified basal food resources of the soil food web and revealed links between above- and belowground ecosystem compartments. Extending the use of stable isotope analysis to a wider range of soil-dwelling organisms, including microfauna, and a larger array of ecosystems provides the perspective of a comprehensive understanding of the structure and functioning of soil food webs. © 2018 Cambridge Philosophical Society","belowground communities; decomposer; energy channels; food chain; soil food web; soil invertebrates; trophic enrichment; trophic niche; δ 13 C; δ 15 N",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057482328

We experimentally investigated the effects of increasing N deposition (Nexo) and climate warming on the fate of Nexo in a subalpine meadow and established the involvement of plant species. Using 15N tracer, we tracked Nexo sprayed on the vegetation in belowground and aboveground plant biomasses (AGB) and in bulk soil over three growing seasons. We assessed the Nexo absorption capacity of plant species and the contribution of Nexo to their AGB N pool. The meadow retained a large proportion of Nexo (≈65%, mostly in AGB) for depositions up to four times the background N rate. Nexo present in the meadow compartments in year 2 was still present in year 3, suggesting that the ecosystem was unsaturated after three years of high N input. Nexo retention resulted more from an increase in N concentration in plant tissues than from the increase in AGB. The species-specific Nexo absorption capacity was inversely related to their AGB N concentration. Nexo accounted for up to 40% of total AGB N depending on the species and the N treatments. The contribution of species to ecosystem Nexo retention more contingent on their AGB than on their relative cover in the community, ranked as follows: C. vulgaris (14.0%) &gt; N. stricta (7.0%) &gt; other Poaceae = C. caryophyllea (2.5%) &gt; other Eudicotyledons (1.5%) &gt; non-vascular species = P. erecta &gt; Fabaceae (0.8–0.2%). Climate warming increased AGB and decreased tissue N concentration. No warming-Nexo interaction was observed. Thus, Pyrenean subalpine meadows that have not undergone a decline in plant species richness in recent decades paradoxically display a high potential to sequester atmospheric N deposition. The low tissue N concentration and the elevated absorption-accumulation capacity of some dominant plant species play an essential role in the high N retention of a subalpine ecosystem exposed to annual N inputs up to four times the ambient N rate. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","15N tracer; N deposition; Nitrogen; Subalpine meadow; Warming","Ecosystems; Forestry; Nitrogen; Tissue; Absorption capacity; Dominant plant species; N deposition; Plant species richness; Retention capacity; Subalpine meadow; Warming; ^15N tracer; Deposition; nitrogen; nitrogen 15; nitrogen; aboveground biomass; belowground biomass; experimental study; global warming; meadow; nitrogen; soil pollution; subalpine environment; tracer; vegetation; Article; atmospheric deposition; biomass; Calluna; Calluna vulgaris; Carex (genus); Carex caryophyllea; controlled study; ecosystem; eudicot; geographic and geological phenomena; greenhouse effect; isotope labeling; Nardus stricta; nitrogen cycling; nitrogen deposition; nitrogen metabolism; nitrogen retention capacity; nonhuman; plant biomass; plant metabolism; plant tissue; Poaceae; Potentilla; Potentilla erecta; soil; species richness; subalpine meadow; vegetation; air pollutant; analysis; classification; climate; climate change; grassland; metabolism; plant; season; species difference; eudicotyledons; Fabaceae; Poaceae; Air Pollutants; Biomass; Climate; Climate Change; Grassland; Nitrogen; Plants; Poaceae; Seasons; Soil; Species Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056247191

Here, we aimed to assess the effects of these additives on the rumen microbiota in order to understand underlying microbial mechanisms of methane abatement. Two 2-by-2 factorial design studies were conducted simultaneously, which also allowed us to make a broadbased assessment of microbial responses. Eight nonlactating cows were fed diets supplemented with linseed or saponin in order to decrease hydrogen production and nitrate to affect hydrogen consumption; also, combinations of linseed plus nitrate or saponin plus nitrate were used to explore the interaction between dietary treatments. Previous work assessed effects on methane and fermentation patterns. Rumen microbes were studied by sequencing 18S and 16S rRNA genes and ITS1 amplicons. Methanogen activity was monitored by following changes in mcrA transcript abundance. Nitrate fed alone or in combination in both studies dramatically affected the composition and structure of rumen microbiota, although impacts were more evident in one of the studies. Linseed moderately modified only bacterial community structure. Indicator operational taxonomic unit (OTU) analysis revealed that both linseed and nitrate reduced the relative abundance of hydrogen-producing Ruminococcaceae. Linseed increased the proportion of bacteria known to reduce succinate to propionate, whereas nitrate supplementation increased nitrate-reducing bacteria and decreased the metabolic activity of rumen methanogens. Saponins had no effect on the microbiota. Inconsistency found between the two studies with nitrate supplementation could be explained by changes in microbial ecosystem functioning rather than changes in microbial community structure. © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

This is a problem both in terms of legislation compliance, but also in terms of health of citizens, as it has been recently estimated that 400 to 450 thousand people die prematurely every year due to poor air quality. Air quality in cities can be improved with a number of interventions, at different sectoral (industry, traffic, residential, etc …) and geographical (international, European, national, local, etc.) levels. In this paper we explore the potential of city level plans to improve mobility and air quality (excluding electro-mobility options, not considered in this study). We applied the “Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans” (SUMPs) framework to 642 cities in Europe and modelled how the measures they include may impact at first on mobility and emissions at urban level, and then on urban background concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2. Results show that annual averages moderately improve for both pollutants, with reductions of urban background concentrations up to 2% for PM2.5 and close to 4% for NO2. The impact on NO2 at street level (that will be higher than on urban background) is not evaluated in this work. The air quality improvement of the simulated SUMP would only partially alleviate air quality problems in urban areas, but such a reduction in the emissions of air pollutants should still be considered as a positive result of SUMPs, given that they correspond to a set of low-cost measures that can be implemented at local level. Furthermore, the introduction of electro-mobility options (not considered here) would increase the impact on air quality. Other types of benefits, such as reduced fuel consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, higher impact at street level or accident rates reduction further add to the overall positive impact. © 2018 The Authors","Air quality modelling; Low emission zones; Sustainable urban mobility plans; Transport modelling","nitrogen dioxide; air quality; atmospheric modeling; concentration (composition); emission; European Union; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; urban area; urban pollution; accident; air pollutant; air quality; air quality standard; Article; carbon footprint; environmental impact; Europe; evaluation study; particulate matter; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; Europe; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Greenhouse Gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056202691

On the other hand, some constructive solutions are becoming increasingly important in the current scenario of climate change, taking into account the need to increase the resilience of the urban environment and the mitigation of emissions. This is the case, for example, of green roofs and living faades, which are an alternative to traditional grey infrastructure, offering many benefits to both citizens and cities. Beyond the ability to improve environmental conditions and quality of life, they can augment the energy efficiency of buildings, reduce flood risks in urban areas and be combined with rainwater harvesting systems. So, taking into account these trends for constructive solutions in the future, this paper analyses the possibilities of a circular use of water in buildings, aiming to create in the future ""zero water"" buildings. Particular attention is given to the compatibility between new green roofing solutions and rainwater harvesting systems in buildings, but the reuse of grey water and the possibility of nutrient recovery in buildings, such as urine (phosphorus) - which can be used in the building itself on green roofs - living facades or urban agriculture, are also referred to. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agriculture; Building materials; Buildings; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Floods; Nutrients; Rain; Roofs; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Circular economy; Constructive solutions; Environmental conditions; Nutrient recovery; Rainwater harvesting system; Roofing solutions; Urban agricultures; Urban environments; Construction",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063400944

Since surface evaporation explains most of the lake's water losses, reliable estimates are paramount to the prediction of global warming impacts on Lake Titicaca and to the region's water resource planning and adaptation to climate change. Evaporation estimates were done in the past at monthly time steps and using the four methods as follows: water balance, heat balance, and the mass transfer and Penman's equations. The obtained annual evaporation values showed significant dispersion. This study used new, daily frequency hydro-meteorological measurements. Evaporation losses were calculated following the mentioned methods using both daily records and their monthly averages to assess the impact of higher temporal resolution data in the evaporation estimates. Changes in the lake heat storage needed for the heat balance method were estimated based on the morning water surface temperature, because convection during nights results in a well-mixed top layer every morning over a constant temperature depth. We found that the most reliable method for determining the annual lake evaporation was the heat balance approach, although the Penman equation allows for an easier implementation based on generally available meteorological parameters. The mean annual lake evaporation was found to be 1700&thinsp;mm&thinsp;year<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula'1</span>. This value is considered an upper limit of the annual evaporation, since the main study period was abnormally warm. The obtained upper limit lowers by 200&thinsp;mm&thinsp;year<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">ĝ'1</span>, the highest evaporation estimation obtained previously, thus reducing the uncertainty in the actual value.

Cemeteries constitute a significant part of green areas in the city with a large potential for passive recreation places for residents. The aim of the research was to attempt to characterize the landscape of municipal cemeteries in Szczecin, as well as to formulate proposals for actions that would improve their current condition. On the basis of research and analyzes, the authors pointed out that the factors that influence the shaping of the landscape of Szczecin cemeteries are varied and can be generally divided into legal, spatial, historical, economic and cultural ones. It was found that the Central Cemetery, as a listed historic object, has the greatest landscape values, however, it lost much of the original landscape and cultural values due to post-war neglect and destruction. The remaining cemeteries are of secondary importance as objects of limited importance and functions of district cemeteries. Their condition is worse, and their landscapes are the least diverse. Cemeteries in Szczecin have a fairly high share of high greenery, and the low greenery is limited mainly to lawns. In order to create a climate favouring to walks and resting, the cemetery areas should be enriched with aesthetic and well thought out plant compositions from shrubs and perennials, designed by a landscape architect. It is proposed to create common ""garden units"" where the distance between the graves would be larger and it would be possible to create small plant arrangements. In addition, it is observed that cemeteries lack beautiful and original tombstones, which is why the return to exhibitions of cemetery art forms an important aspect. This would create the possibility of presenting modern and valuable stone art products and inspiring forms of plant arrangements at the graves. This is only part of the authors' proposals, which are quite universal and can therefore also be applied to other municipal cemeteries in Poland and abroad. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Architecture; Exhibitions; Plants (botany); Urban planning; Cultural value; Green areas; Landscape architects; Landscape values; Plant composition; Public works",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062497660

To incorporate urban climate knowledge into urban planning, it is necessary to create instruments that summarize the relationship between meteorological parameters and urban form and function. This chapter shows the urban climate of the city of Tandil, Argentina, and its relations with land cover. The main objective is to present an instrument that proposes improvement in urban planning using this information. The instrument was generated combining two methodologies: local climate zones (LCZs) and climatopes. LCZs are used to characterize the different urban forms and functions. They were created based on construction and population density, the amount of vegetation, location characteristics and temperature, and spatial and temporal distribution. To summarize urban climate information, climatopes were made using seasonal temperature, humidity and precipitation distribution, wind analysis, and comfort. The results are presented in a map and a table. Tandil is a middle-sized city located in the south east of Buenos Aires province, Argentina. It has a transitional temperate climate and is surrounded by the Tandilia Hill System. The city has a population of 116,916 inhabitants and diversified economic activity. As a result, 16 LCZs were determined and climatic characteristics were described for each of them. The analysis of each one put into context the need to improve existing urban planning, which does not take into account climatic parameters. The mitigation strategies consisted in three types of intervention: gas emission control, improving urban vegetation, and construction restrictions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

This is because a key model input–namely the valuation of centennial climate damage–is highly unknowable for fundamental reasons discussed here. Problems with damage valuation are highlighted by the implicit implausibility to climate scientists of a leading model's (centennial) damage function, and by strong criticisms of damage functions by many climate economists. The claim that statistical analyses of past weather impacts on local economies, combined with structural modeling of sectoral impacts, can significantly improve centennial damage valuation rests on untestable, far-out-of-sample extrapolation. Testing centennial climate (natural) science projections is generally harder than testing predictions in astronomy, geology and other earth sciences, because of Earth's uniqueness, and the unprecedented degree of likely climate change; but stable underlying laws make climate modeling based on past observations meaningful. By contrast, the added complexity of human behavior means there are no quantitatively stable laws for modeling the value of centennial climate damage. I suggest that any carbon prices used to inform climate policies, be they carbon prices used as policy instruments, or complementary, non-carbon-price policies, should instead be based on marginal abatement costs, found by modeling low-cost pathways to socially agreed, physical climate targets. A pathway approach to estimating carbon prices poses challenges to many economists, and is no panacea, but it avoids any illusion of optimality, and facilitates detailed analysis of sectoral policies.

A total of 21 source-related biomarker and stable carbon isotope ratios among the samples were assessed to assure that they were unaffected by secondary processes. Chemometric analysis of these data identifies six oil families with map and stratigraphic distributions that reflect organofacies variations within the Miocene Monterey Formation source rock. The data comprise a training set that was used to create a chemometric decision tree to classify newly collected oil samples. Three onshore families originated from two synclines, which may contain one or more pods of thermally mature source rock. Multiple biomarker parameters indicate that the six oil families achieved early oil window maturity in the range of 0.6%-0.7% equivalent vitrinite reflectance. The offshore oil samples consist of one family from Point Pedernales field and two families from the ""B"" prospect. Geochemical characteristics of these families indicate origins under differing water column and sediment oxicity and carbonate versus siliceous and detrital input in 'carbonate,' 'marl,' and 'shale' organofacies like those in the lower calcareous-siliceous, carbonaceous marl, and clayey-siliceous members of the Monterey Formation elsewhere in coastal California. The corresponding lithofacies and organofacies appear to be linked to the early- middle Miocene climate optimum and subsequent paleoclimatic cooling after circa 14Ma, a systematic up-section increase in the stable carbon isotope composition of related oil samples, decreased preservation of calcium carbonate shells from planktic foraminifera and coccoliths, and increased preservation of claysized siliceous shells of diatoms and radiolarians. The results show that organofacies within theMonterey source rock are responsiblefor many of the geochemical differences between the oil families. This paleoclimate-organofacies model for crude oil from the Monterey Formation can be used to enhance future exploration efforts in many areas of coastal California. © 2019.

This has evident implications regarding health effects and justifies the need to design and apply effective measures to reduce emissions from mobile sources in urban areas. The methodologies to estimate emissions from road transport require, among other relevant factors, a detailed characterization of the actual fleet composition within the city that vehicle registration databases cannot provide. This contribution presents an experimental campaign to characterise the fleet of vehicles moving in the city of Madrid (Spain). The field campaign made use of different types of already available traffic cameras in the city to record nearly 5 million license plate readings from 1.3 million different vehicles. This information was used to estimate emissions with the COPERT model in the area of study. According to results obtained, passenger cars are responsible for 80.7% of the total mileage made in the city and are also the main contributors in terms of emissions (65%, 73% and 72% of NOx, CO 2 and PM 2.5 , within mobile sources respectively), mainly due to diesel vehicles that represent 68.2% of total passenger cars mileage. The study also provided relevant information on average age and other policy-relevant details such as average emission factors that should be considered to propose effective emission abatement strategies in Madrid City. A comparison with the information obtained from official registration statistics illustrates the need to perform similar studies to gather accurate information of the actual fleet within a city and thus, design sound measures and policies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","COPERT model: urban traffic; Policy-support tool; Road traffic emissions; Traffic cameras; Vehicle fleet characterization","air quality; car use; diesel engine; policy development; road traffic; transportation policy; urban transport; Madrid [Madrid (ADS/PRV)]; Madrid [Spain]; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059304566

Diverse solutions have been proposed to meet these challenges: more efficient processes that minimize energy consumption, weight reductions, as well as achieving longer maintenance periods and longer replacement times for tooling and components. In order to find a solution for these issues, nanoparticles (NPs) have been used as additives in conventional lubricants decreasing the coefficient of friction (COF) and wear of elements working under relative motion and loading. Due to environmental and health concerns, recent studies have focused on utilizing eco-friendly NPs, minimizing the usage of hazardous materials and additives. These NPs have demonstrated to be highly efficient increasing wear resistance and lowering COF through several tribological mechanisms. Furthermore, ecofriendly NPs may also help reduce energy consumption in manufacturing processes, hence reducing carbon footprint.

Wood combustion produced various minor pollutants, which should be considered in life cycle assessment. For this purpose different wood combustion processes have been modeled under Aspen Plus® software in order to assess pollutant emissions (CO2, aromatic compounds, CO, etc.) based on industrial emission data and therefore to obtain a rigorous life cycle inventory. Different technologies are assessed for a fixed heating demand and hot water production of a typical French house: district heating fueled by wood chips, individual stoves or boilers fueled by wood logs or pellets. Electricity, natural gas, and fuel oil solutions complete the scenario set. The different heating solutions are compared in terms of their greenhouse gas emissions and of the cost of the final energy (including investment and operating costs). The important effect of minor pollutants (such as CO and volatile organic compounds) on the global warming potential of wood-to-heat chains is highlighted. The performance of wood scenarios compared to fossil-based ones is also highly dependent on the impact factor assumed for the biogenic CO2. The wood-based scenarios present a wide range of costs with pellet solutions being more expensive on investment and pellet production. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Biogenic carbon; Cost; Forest; Global warming; Pollutant","Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Computer software; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Industrial emissions; Investments; Life cycle; Operating costs; Pelletizing; Pollution; Volatile organic compounds; Wood products; Bio-energy; Combustion technology; Forest; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life Cycle Inventory; Pollutant; Wood combustion process; Costs; bioenergy; carbon emission; cost analysis; forest ecosystem; global warming; greenhouse gas; industrial emission; life cycle analysis; pollutant; volatile organic compound; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057121368

This paper illustrates that a combination of non-stationary modelling approaches can be adopted to evaluate trends in EPEs under uncertainty. A large database of daily rainfall events from 281 sparsely distributed weather stations in Finland between 1961 and 2016 was analysed. Among the tested methods, Poisson distributions provided a powerful method to evaluate the impacts of multiple physical covariates, including temperature and atmospheric circulation patterns (ACPs), on the resulting trends. The analysis demonstrates that non-stationarity is statistically valid for the majority of observations, independently of their location in the country and the season of the year. However, subsampling can severely hinder the statistical validity of the trends, which can be easily confused with random noise and therefore complicate the decision-making processes regarding long-term planning. Scaling effects have a strong impact on the estimates of non-stationary parameters, as homogenizing the data in space and time reduces the statistical validity of the trends. Trends in EPE statistics (mean, 90 and 99% percentiles) and best-fitted Generalized Pareto parameters in the tails of the distributions appear to be stronger when approaching the Polar region (Lapland) than away from it, consistent with the Arctic amplification of climate change. ACPs are key covariates in physically explaining these trends. In particular, the Arctic Oscillation (AO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) can explain statistically significant increases in extreme precipitation in Lapland, Bothnian and South regions of Finland, particularly during summer and fall seasons. © 2018 Royal Meteorological Society","climate change; extreme precipitation; extreme value analysis; Generalized Pareto; non-stationarity; Poisson distribution","Atmospheric pressure; Decision making; Poisson distribution; Precipitation (meteorology); Uncertainty analysis; Atmospheric circulation patterns; Decision making process; Extreme precipitation; Extreme precipitation events; Extreme value analysis; Generalized Pareto; Non-stationarities; North Atlantic oscillations; Climate change; Arctic Oscillation; autumn; climate change; climate effect; climate variation; estimation method; extreme event; North Atlantic Oscillation; precipitation intensity; summer; threshold; trend analysis; weather forecasting; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Bothnian Sea; Finland; Gulf of Bothnia; Lappi [Finland]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054583920

Heavy-duty diesel trucks were a significant source of NOx and BC at both sites. Characterization of temporal variations in heavy-duty truck activity on diurnal, weekly, and seasonal scales were included in this study; truck traffic and emissions are not well-correlated with passenger vehicle or total traffic volumes. For both pollutants, more than 90% of predicted 24-h average concentrations were within a factor of two of observations at both near-roadway monitoring sites.

Realising adaptive urban governance systems requires attention to institutions, and in particular, processes of institutional innovation. Interestingly, understanding of how institutional innovation and change occurs remains a key conceptual weakness in urban climate change governance. This paper explores how institutional innovation in urban climate change governance can be conceptualised and analysed. We develop a heuristic involving three levels: (1) “visible” changes in institutional arrangements, (2) changes in underlying “rules-in-use”, and (3) the relationship to broader “governance dilemmas”. We then explore the utility of this heuristic through an exploratory case study of urban water governance in Santiago, Chile. The approach presented opens up novel possibilities for studying institutional innovation and evaluating changes in governance systems. The paper contributes to debates on innovation and its effects in urban governance, particularly under climate change. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

In the Andean zone of Colombia, there is a growing need to develop GHG mitigation techniques associated with milk production. The present study focuses on GHG emissions and potential sinks associated with milk production scenarios in the Andean zone of Colombia. The scenarios considered were as follows: conventional agriculture of Pennisetum clandestinum in rotation with potatoes (PRP), improved pastures of Lolium multiflorum (IP) and silvopastoral system of P. clandestinum in association with Acacia decurrens and Trifolium repens (SPS). Based on the IPCC (Guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories. The intergovernmental panel on climate change, Institute for Global Environmental Strategies, Kanagawa, 2006. http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/support/Primer_2006GLs.pdf) methodologies, the annual GHG emissions considering a 6-year production cycle included agricultural sources and gasoline consumption related to the most important agricultural phases in the field, and a potential for soil carbon accumulation and biomass carbon fixation in all the studied scenarios. The lowest GHG emissions were estimated in PRP scenario (3684 kg CO 2 -eq ha −1 year −1 ), which also presented additional emissions because of soil carbon losses beyond the lower milk productivity. Highest GHG emissions were observed in IP scenario (7711 kg CO 2 -eq ha −1 year −1 ), which exhibited the highest milk productivity and a considerable potential for soil carbon accumulation that could help to offset its emissions. Nevertheless, SPS scenario, which had milk productivity close to that of IP, presented the highest potential to offset the total GHG emission (4878 kg CO 2 -eq ha −1 year −1 ) because of soil carbon accumulation and biomass carbon fixation in trees. This study contributed to indicate management strategies that should be prioritized to mitigate the main sources of GHG emission in the extensive and intensive dairy cattle production in the Andean region of Colombia. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Agricultural intensification; Biomass and soil carbon sequestration; Climate change; GHG mitigation; Global warming; Grassland; Milk production; Trees","agricultural intensification; carbon fixation; carbon sequestration; climate change; farming system; global warming; grassland; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; intergovernmental relations; milk production; pasture; soil carbon; strategic approach; Andes; Colombia; Honshu; Honshu; Japan; Kanagawa; Kanto; Acacia decurrens; Bos; Lolium multiflorum; Pennisetum clandestinum; Solanum tuberosum; Trifolium repens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030317016

In relation to sustainability and climate change, such initiatives promise more efficient use of resources through the use of information and communications technology in energy infrastructure. Experiments with smart city technologies such as urban smart grids have shown the potential to restructure relationships between energy utilities, energy users and other actors by reconfiguring the dynamics of energy supply and demand. But do urban experiments lead to institutional change? The aim of the article is to provide a better understanding of how smart city experiments reshape the urban governance of building energy use. Hyllie, a new city district in Malmö, Sweden, was home to two smart city experiments that contributed to the institutionalization of urban smart grid technology.

This paper introduces SAMBA, a state-of-the-art monitoring station for continuous, real-time measurements of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) parameters from occupants’ work desks. It combines a hardware solution that integrates a low-cost suite of sensors with a software platform designed to automatically analyse and visualize data for quick interpretation of IEQ performance by non-scientist. In addition to feeding a massive IEQ database for research, the resulting data may be used to better inform the metrological requirements for popular international IEQ rating schemes. This new era of indoor environmental monitoring based upon systems such as SAMBA affords a fundamentally new approach to built environmental field research that holds significant promise to improve building performance and indoor environmental quality and occupant satisfaction, health, wellbeing and performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Analytics; Building performance; Continuous monitoring; Indoor environmental quality; Measurement; Sensors","Carbon footprint; Hardware; Measurement; Sensors; Analytics; Building performance; Continuous monitoring; Environmental fields; Environmental Monitoring; Indoor environmental quality; Occupant satisfaction; Real time measurements; Monitoring; building; carbon footprint; environmental quality; indoor air; measurement method; monitoring system; performance assessment; real time; sensor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058012570

Light-rail transit (LRT) is a major type of transportation infrastructure, but there has been little research assessing the air quality effects of LRT based on the actual air pollution data. This study aimed to assess the effects of LRT on automobile-related air emissions in Houston. Specifically, we examined the effects of LRT on key tailpipe pollutants-carbon monoxide and acetylene-as well as other traffic pollution surrogates referred to as BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene), measured from ambient air monitoring stations. An interrupted time series design and analysis was used to determine the impact of an intervention, where the intervention was the opening of an LRT on January 1, 2004, with two years (2002−2003) of before and two years (2004–2005) of after period data. We found that, after controlling for weather, the opening of the LRT was associated with statistically significant reductions in traffic-related air emissions. Specifically, at the exposure sites, the daily maximum carbon monoxide level was reduced roughly by 24%, and the daily level of toluene was reduced roughly by 60% (33% after accounting for the reduction at the comparison site). Our findings lend support to the air quality benefits of LRT by providing suggestive evidence of positive effects of LRT based on actual air pollution monitoring data. This study's findings also emphasize the importance of developing effective measures to assess traffic-related pollution and call for advanced data collection strategies of additional data, including traffic volume and speed data. © 2018","Air pollution; Houston; Interrupted time series analysis; Intervention; Light-rail transit; Vehicle exhaust","Air pollution; Air quality; Automobiles; Carbon monoxide; Pollution detection; Time series analysis; Toluene; Urban transportation; Air pollution monitoring; Benzene , toluene , ethylbenzene , and xylenes; Data collection strategies; Houston; Intervention; Light rail transit (LRT); Transportation infrastructures; Vehicle exhausts; Light rail transit; acetylene; benzene; carbon monoxide; ethylbenzene; toluene; xylene; air quality; atmospheric pollution; automobile; BTEX; light rail system; pollution monitoring; time series analysis; traffic emission; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; car; controlled study; environmental exposure; light rail transit; limit of quantitation; measurement precision; priority journal; railway; United States; Houston; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053340640

One of the main drawbacks for such generators, fed by biogenous gas is the impact of trace compounds on the anode compartment. For this reason, a gas clean-up section is mandatory. The effect of temperature and gas moisture was investigated through experiments on the removal performance of the tested sorbents. An increase in the operating temperature caused lower values of the maximum capacity of the adsorbent. The decrease of removal performance considering a humidified gas is connected to the interference of water in the pores of activated carbons. Biochar, compared to the other commercial sorbent materials showed the lowest removal performance, even if with activated biochar the adsorption capacity growth to commercially available materials. The highest adsorption capacity at 1% of the initial concentration was showed by commercial carbons with 1.75 mg/g for H2S and 20.4 mg/g for HCl.

Primary data were collected through face-to-face interviews taken in 141 households. Supplementary data of public domain were collected from 9 Focus Group Discussions, 3 Historical Timeline Calendars, 20 Key Informant Interviews and sketches of 2 Crop Calendars. The findings suggest that traditional agro-livestock-based livelihood of the farming households of Lumle is ruined because of farmland abandonment and shift of agro-livestock activities to others options. A sharp decline in contribution of agro-livestock-based activities in household livelihoods in the last decade justifies this statement. Many factors might have been interplaying in abandoning agro-livestock activities. However, as the impacts of climate change are complex because of their spiral effects in existing poverty and marginality of households, it is contributing to agro-ecology through the effects of changes in weather pattern, increased invasive species and crop–livestock pest, as well as labour migration abroad caused by reduced farm output. The damage in agricultural ecology of mountain area in general and of Lumle in particular, however, has not yet been addressed by contemporary development policies of Nepal. Considering the importance of agricultural ecology for social-ecological sustainability and meeting the Sustainable Development Goal of eliminating hunger by 2030, Nepali agricultural policies should urgently recognise the need of agro-ecological restoration policy. It is expected that the integration of migration and climate change adaptation policies with agriculture and landuse policies to restrict farmland abandonment as well as provision of incentives for agricultural restoration would benefit in this regard. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Agro-ecological restoration; Climate change impacts; Farmland abandonment; Himalaya; Nepal","abandoned land; adaptive management; agricultural land; agricultural policy; agroecology; climate change; climate effect; household survey; invasive species; labor migration; livelihood; mountain region; perception; restoration ecology; sustainable development; Himalayas; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030157449

And the dependence of accuracy of time difference of arrival (TDOA) method on the propagation characteristic is investigated. Based on the analysis result, a higher-order statistics (HOS) algorithm is introduced into acoustic emission (AE) to automatically identify the arrival time of rubbing signals and localize the rubbing source via automatic threshold selection. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed AE method to recognize the rubbing fault, a series of rubbing tests are carried out. It is demonstrated by the experimental results that the accuracy of the proposed method is improved compared with conventional TDOA methods since more than half of the sources localized at the rubbing region can be identified in almost all cases and the identification accuracy is up to 80 % at threshold of 85 % of amplitude. © 2019, KSME & Springer.","Acoustic emission; Higher-order statistics; Localization; Rubbing; Threshold","Acoustic emission testing; Acoustic emissions; Aircraft engines; Stators; Time difference of arrival; Acoustic emission method; Automatic threshold selection; Finite element simulations; Higherorder statistic (HOS); Localization; Propagation characteristics; Rubbing; Threshold; Higher order statistics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062065467

This study shows the impacts (in terms of energy efficiency) of a three-year adaptation process of transportation (2014–2016) towards HCT that took place in a synchronized transportation system (STS). The use of three transportation fleet-management control (TFMC) methods was analyzed in various road infrastructures. Energy-efficiency calculations were undertaken based on the HCT vehicles’ mass limits (64, 68 and 76 t). The use of 76 t vehicles increased energy efficiency by 13.4% and reduced CO 2 emissions by 3.5% (to 49.6 g/tkm). In addition, the results show that the energy efficiency of the STS could be improved by a further 3.1%. In this respect, the proposed TFMC was used to adjust the STS towards vehicle-group transportation while meeting the road-class constraints of local wood supply chains. Forest-industry companies in Finland and abroad can use the tailored TFMC to optimize the STS in the near future and to achieve the energy-efficient STS and the regulations of the European Commission in wood-procurement logistics. © 2019 by the authors.","Energy efficiency; Fleet management; High-capacity transportation; Synchronized transportation system; Wood procurement","Energy management systems; Fleet operations; Forestry; Highway administration; Industrial management; Roads and streets; Supply chains; Synchronization; Vehicles; Efficiency calculations; Fleet management; High capacity; Road infrastructures; Road transportation; Transportation fleet; Transportation system; Wood procurement; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061983892

Biophysical feedbacks on climate are highly dependent on transpiration, which is mediated by vegetation phenology and plant responses to stress conditions. Here, we explore the potential of satellite observations of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF)-normalized by photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR)-to diagnose the ratio of transpiration to potential evaporation ('transpiration efficiency', τ). This potential is validated at 25 eddy-covariance sites from seven biomes worldwide. The skill of the state-of-the-art land surface models (LSMs) from the eartH2Observe project to estimate τ is also contrasted against eddy-covariance data. Despite its relatively coarse (0.5°) resolution, SIF/PAR estimates, based on data from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment 2 (GOME-2) and the Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), correlate to the in situ τ significantly (average inter-site correlation of 0.59), with higher correlations during growing seasons (0.64) compared to decaying periods (0.53). In addition, the skill to diagnose the variability of in situ τ demonstrated by all LSMs is on average lower, indicating the potential of SIF data to constrain the formulations of transpiration in global models via, e.g., data assimilation. Overall, SIF/PAR estimates successfully capture the effect of phenological changes and environmental stress on natural ecosystem transpiration, adequately reflecting the timing of this variability without complex parameterizations. © 2019 by the authors.","Eddy-covariance; GOME-2; Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence; Transpiration; Transpiration efficiency","Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Forestry; Plant shutdowns; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Clouds and earth's radiant energy systems; Eddy covariance; Global ozone monitoring experiments; GOME-2; Photosynthetically active radiation; Solar-induced fluorescences; Transpiration efficiency; Transpiration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062540427

While such drifts may be easily removed from the prediction system when analyzing individual variables, a major problem prevails for multivariate issues and, especially, when the output of the global prediction system shall be used for dynamical downscaling. In this study, we present a statistical approach to remove climate drifts in a multivariate context and demonstrate the effect of this drift correction on regional climate model simulations over the Euro-Atlantic sector. The statistical approach is based on an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis adapted to a very large data matrix. The climate drift emerges as a dramatic cooling trend in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and is captured by the leading EOF of the multivariate output from the global prediction system, accounting for 7.7% of total variability. The SST cooling pattern also imposes drifts in various atmospheric variables and levels. The removal of the first EOF effectuates the drift correction while retaining other components of intra-annual, inter-annual and decadal variability. In the regional climate model, the multivariate drift correction of the input data removes the cooling trends in most western European land regions and systematically reduces the discrepancy between the output of the regional climate model and observational data. In contrast, removing the drift only in the SST field from the global model has hardly any positive effect on the regional climate model. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Decadal prediction; Drift correction; Dynamical downscaling","climate modeling; climate prediction; climatology; cooling; correction; downscaling; global climate; sea surface temperature; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044938418

To date, how they produce anesthesia is unknown. This study proposes that carbonic anhydrase enzymes are likely targets mediating the actions of inhalational anesthetics. Carbonic anhydrase enzymes, commonly expressed in living organisms, utilize carbon dioxide (CO2) as a substrate and can generate H+ and HCO3 − from CO2 with a great efficiency. There are remarkable lines of evidence for their likely roles in mediating anesthetic actions. Firstly, carbonic anhydrase enzymes are extensively expressed in the brain and spinal cord, and their importance in the brain activity, especially for the GABA and NMDA receptor signaling pathways, has been demonstrated in numerous studies. According to these studies, they provide HCO3 − for GABA-A receptor activities and also buffer HCO3 − excess resulting from NMDA receptor activation. Activation of GABA-A and inhibition of NMDA receptors are associated with the induction of anesthesia by the intravenous general anesthetics propofol and ketamine, respectively. Secondly, the carbonic anhydrase inhibitors topiramate and zonisamide are effectively used in the treatment of epilepsy for decades; their chronic use results in the requirement of increased levels of amobarbital in order to produce anesthesia in the epileptic patients during WADA test. In addition, given that CO2 is a substrate for these enzymes, their tertiary structure is likely has a hydrophobic pocket suitable for the anesthetic molecules to bind. Inhalational anesthetic molecules, which are lipophilic and inert in nature, have an ability to cross the membranes and inhibit carbonic anhydrases, which might not be accessible by topiramate and zonisamide. Unlike carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, they could bind to the hydrophobic pocket for CO2 molecules and produce a profound effect called anesthesia. Finally, there is a great deal of similarities between the physiological actions of inhalational anesthetics and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors; moreover well-known side effects of inhalational anesthetics could be associated with the inhibition of carbonic anhydrases. Therefore, this article presents a hypothesis that the anesthetic actions of inhalational anesthetics could be due to their inhibitory effects on the carbonic anhydrases. Investigating this hypothesis might lead to the development of new safer anesthetics, and more importantly it might reveal an endogenous anesthetic pathway, in which the carbonic anhydrase system is a component along with the GABA-A and NMDA receptor systems. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"4 aminobutyric acid A receptor; acetazolamide; amobarbital; bicarbonate; brinzolamide; carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; carbonate dehydratase inhibitor; desflurane; dorzolamide; halothane; hydrogen; inhalation anesthetic agent; isoflurane; ketamine; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; propofol; topiramate; zonisamide; 4 aminobutyric acid A receptor; carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; inhalation anesthetic agent; isoflurane; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; topiramate; zonisamide; altitude disease; amnesia; analgesia; anesthesia induction; Article; brain function; brain region; cognitive defect; drug mechanism; drug targeting; dry eye; enzyme inhibition; enzyme substrate; epilepsy; glaucoma; human; hydrophobicity; immobility; language disability; lipophilicity; malignant hyperthermia; membrane permeability; nonhuman; protein expression; protein tertiary structure; receptor upregulation; respiration depression; signal transduction; sleep; spinal cord; thermoregulation; unconsciousness; vasodilatation; wada test; anesthesia; animal; brain; enzymology; metabolism; Anesthesia; Anesthetics, Inhalation; Animals; Brain; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonic Anhydrases; Humans; Isoflurane; Receptors, GABA-A; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; Topiramate; Zonisamide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060079712

The analysis was based on the noise descriptors LAeq, L10, L90, LD, TNI and NEI. Results from the study reflects that the highest and lowest equivalent noise levels (LAeq) were recorded at commercial areas (96 dB (A)) and residential areas (52 dB (A)), respectively, the background noise level (L90) has the highest and lowest values at commercial areas (77 dB (A)) and residential areas (44 dB (A)), respectively and the peak value (L10) has the highest value and lowest value at the commercial areas (96 dB (A)) and residential areas (56 dB (A)). Based on the WHO recommendations and standards, only 2 out of the 41 locations considered are under normally acceptable situation while the noise levels of other areas are not acceptable. Noise map developed in this study provides enough information for technical controls and interim legislation against environmental noise pollution in the metropolis. Moreover, considering the noise emission standards, planning and promoting the citizens awareness about the high noise risk could help to mitigate the effect of noise in Ota, Metropolis.

Laboratory-scale biotrickling filters (BTFs) were inoculated with microbial consortia derived from sewage sludge, with the goal to study the biotreatment of low-loads of methylamines and ammonia that are main components of odorous exhaust gases produced by fishmeal processing plants. A BTF packed with ceramic rings was subjected to a real fishmeal plant emission containing trimethylamine (TMA), dimethylamine (DMA) and monomethylamine (MMA). The highest elimination capacities (ECs) obtained were 372 mg TMA m −3 h −1 , 5.518 mg DMA m −3 h −1 and 1.038 mg MMA m −3 h −1 , with maximal removal efficiencies of 92% (TMA), 83% (DMA) and 95% (MMA) after 30 days operation. In a different experiment, a polyurethane foam packing was employed to treat ammonia (NH 3 ) at low inlet loads, reaching an EC of 47.19 mg N m −3 h −1 with 99.8% efficiency (inlet load of 47.27 mg N m −3 h −1 ). Likewise, the microbial community of the polyurethane-associated biofilm was diverse and stable during operation. These results suggested that elimination of volatile amino-compounds using BTFs inoculated with a methylotrophic microbial consortium holds potential for odour removal. In addition, sequencing analysis of 16S rDNA gene fragments allowed the identification of heterotrophic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria that are promising candidates to effectively maintain ammonia elimination in a biotreatment operation of nitrogenous compounds present in exhaust gases from fishmeal facilities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biotrickling filter; DMA; Fishmeal plant; MMA; Odour; TMA","ammonia; dimethylamine; DNA 16S; methylamine; nitrogen derivative; polyurethan; polyurethan foam; trimethylamine; ammonia; bacterium; biofilm; biological method; emission; environmental issue; filter; foam; inoculation; microbial community; odor; pollutant removal; sewage; sludge; ammonia oxidizing bacterium; Article; bacterial gene; bioprocess; exhaust gas; fish meal; heterotrophy; laboratory; microbial community; microbial consortium; nonhuman; reactor operation; sludge; technology; waste component removal; bioreactor; bioremediation; filtration; gas; Nitrosomonadales; Biodegradation, Environmental; Bioreactors; Filtration; Gases; Nitrogen Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059305078

Based on the close link between the atmospheric particle matter concentration and the deposited load in rainwater, 336 rainwater samplings with seven parameters (pH, NH4 +-N, NO3 −-N, P, S, Cu and Cd) at five-minute intervals in 2013 and 2014 were compared. The field monitoring and the temporal patterns analysis revealed a positive development of air quality. The lesser composition of coal in the energy consumption and the effective control of traffic emission were found. The average Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) value around the sampling point during the 7 sampling rainfall events in 2014 was 2.855, which was higher than that in 2013 (1.807). It reflected the washing effect of rain on atmospheric particulates and highlighted the urban non-point source pollution effected by atmospheric deposition. AOD was demonstrated to perform well in reflecting regional air quality. A trajectory analysis conducted by HYSPLIT model in conjunction with the spatial distribution of AOD in the Beijing-Tian-Hebei (BTH) region depicted paths of air pollutants from long-range transport. The dominant trace was to the south of region. Cities around BTH were provided with different emission-reducing targets. Both Inner Mongolia and Henan province were suggested to control agricultural emissions. Shanxi, Shandong and cities around Bohai Bay should supervise the energy consuming industries. Furthermore, NO3 −-N was introduced to be an indicator of effect of the regional joint prevention and control in the future. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","AOD; HYSPLIT; Non-point source pollution; Particle matter; Rainwater characteristics","Air quality; Energy utilization; Meteorological problems; Quality control; Rain; Remote sensing; Agricultural emissions; Atmospheric depositions; Atmospheric particulate; HYSPLIT; Non-point source pollution; Particle matter; Prevention and controls; Rainwater characteristics; Atmospheric movements; coal; copper; nitrate; nitrogen; phosphorus; rain; aerosol; aerosol composition; atmospheric pollution; nonpoint source pollution; optical depth; particulate matter; pollutant source; rainwater; remote sensing; source apportionment; agriculture; air pollution; air quality; airborne particle; Article; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric transport; China; exhaust gas; nonpoint source pollution; pollution transport; priority journal; remote sensing; temporal analysis; urban area; water pollution control; water quality; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Henan; Nei Monggol; Shandong; Shanxi; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053796426

Despite its importance, the chemical basis for the formation of oceanic CDOM remains unclear. Currently, CDOM's optical properties are best-described by an electronic interaction (EI) model of charge transfer (CT) complexes which form between electron-rich donors and electron-poor acceptors. While terrigenous compounds such as lignin best fit this model, planktonic sources of CDOM have not yet been tested. Here, we have tested CDOM formed during an incubation experiment using a natural phytoplankton assemblage and throughout active growth, stationary phase and algal biomass decomposition. Absorbance of the derived planktonic CDOM generally decreased with increasing wavelength, similar to the reference Pony Lake (PLFA) and Suwanee River (SRFA) fulvic acid solutions used as models of terrigenous CDOM. Further, after 60 d of microbial degradation in the dark, CDOM exhibited fluorescence emission maxima continuously red-shifted into the visible band, consistent with PLFA and SRFA. Reduction of carbonyl-containing groups, key to CT complex formation, with sodium borohydride (NaBH 4 ) produced coherent results in planktonic CDOM and reference FAs. Absorption at 350 nm decreased by 50% for planktonic CDOM and by 30% for PLFA and SRFA, with corresponding increases in spectral slope (S) values, indicating preferential loss of absorption well into the visible. Fluorescence likewise responded with enhanced emission at shorter wavelengths. Apparent quantum yields (Φ) were similarly affected. Results from our work support prior observations that phytoplankton and bacteria are important sources of CDOM that color the ocean's “twilight zone”. We hypothesize that microbial processing of a variety of source substrates into more complex compounds represented as planktonic CDOM likely represents a semi-refractory pool of DOM in the ocean. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Absorbance; CDOM; Fluorescence; Plankton; Quantum yield","absorbance; biodegradation; dissolved organic matter; experiment; fluorescence; formation mechanism; fulvic acid; phytoplankton; plankton; quantum mechanics; wavelength; Antarctica; East Antarctica; Pony Lake; Ross Island; Suwannee River; United States; algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060450903

Research into powerful practical treatments to decolorize and degrade colored textile wastewater is an important challenge nowadays for the textile industry due to environmental considerations, along with the potential water saving. It has been verified, in previous studies, that electrochemical oxidation-reduction treatment with doped SnO2 anodes was effective. In particular, those belonging to a trychromy (mix of three reactive dyes) achieved a significant reduction in Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Total Organic Carbon (TOC), as well as the decolorization of the treated solutions. Subsequently, the next step is to proceed to study and verify that these treated waters can be reused in subsequent dyes and that acceptable values of color equalization in the dyed fabrics can be achieved. The color differences obtained in the dyed fabrics in the four studied reuses are below the threshold of acceptance of color differences in the textile industry, which is one unit. The only electrolyte used was sodium sulphate. Chloride was not added externally in order to avoid as far as possible indirect oxidation. This allows a true test of the electrooxidantion power of the anodes. In these conditions, the Ti/SnO 2 -Sb-Pt DSA electrode is stable. The degree of mineralization is evaluated by measurements of TOC and COD. These data also allow the Average Oxidation State (AOS) at the end of each electrolysis, as well as information on the efficiency in each case through the Carbon Oxidation State (COS) and Average Current Efficiency (ACE) to be established. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) was used to study the decolorization kinetics and the evolution of the generated intermediates. Comparison of the spectra obtained by UV-Visible Spectroscopy allows the decolorization from the initial state to the end of the electrolysis to be monitored. © 2019 The Authors.","Electrochemical treatment; Reused dyebath wastewater; Tin dioxide anode; Trychromy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061872743

We investigate the role played by a pre-supernova (SN) ambient magnetic field in the dynamics of the expanding remnant of SN 1987A, and the origin and evolution of the radio emission from the remnant, in particular during the interaction of the blast wave with the nebula surrounding the SN. Methods. We modeled the evolution of SN 1987A from the breakout of the shock wave at the stellar surface to the expansion of its remnant through the surrounding nebula using three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations. The model considers the radiative cooling, the deviations from equilibrium of ionization, the deviation from temperature-equilibration between electrons and ions, and a plausible configuration of the pre-SN ambient magnetic field. We explore the strengths of the pre-SN magnetic field ranging between 1 and 100 μG at the inner edge of the nebula and we assume an average field strength at the stellar surface B 0 3 kG. From the simulations, we synthesize the thermal X-ray and the non-thermal radio emission and compare the model results with observations. Results. The presence of an ambient magnetic field with strength in the range considered does not change significantly the overall evolution of the remnant. Nevertheless, the magnetic field reduces the erosion and fragmentation of the dense equatorial ring after the impact of the SN blast wave. As a result, the ring survives the passage of the blast, at least during the time covered by the simulations (40 yr). Our model is able to reproduce the morphology and lightcurves of SN 1987A in both X-ray and radio bands. The model reproduces the observed radio emission if the flux originating from the reverse shock is heavily suppressed. In this case, the radio emission originates mostly from the forward shock traveling through the H II region and this may explain why the radio emission seems to be insensitive to the interaction of the blast with the ring. Possible mechanisms for the suppression of emission from the reverse shock are investigated. We find that synchrotron self-absorption and free-free absorption have negligible effects on the emission during the interaction with the nebula. We suggest that the emission from the reverse shock at radio frequencies might be limited by highly magnetized ejecta. © ESO 2019.","ISM: supernova remnants; Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD); radio continuum: ISM; shock waves; supernovae: individual: SN 1987A; X-rays: ISM","3D modeling; Electric dipole moments; Radiative Cooling; Shock waves; Supernovae; X rays; ISM: supernova remnants; Magnetohydrodynamic simulations; Possible mechanisms; Radio continuum: ISM; Radio frequencies; Supernovae: individual: sn 1987a; Temperature equilibration; X rays: ISM; Magnetohydrodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060977659

The population increase poses a serious challenge of increasing food supply to meet the future demand. This challenge is compounded by climate change impacts on agriculture. In this paper, how poverty contributes to household food insecurity is explored and measures suggested to help address this challenge. To plan adaptation measures, linkages among food insecurity, poverty, and illiteracy should be considered. For the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), adaptation (focused on poverty alleviation) should be prioritized and preferred to mitigation. Enhancement of adaptive capacity should not only be tailored toward empowerment of women but also made highly localized to household levels. Generally, efforts could be geared toward yield gap closure, addressing challenges regarding food distribution, promoting non-farm income-generating activities, and unification of government priorities in agriculture and food security. Government in each country of the SSA should ensure that governance strongly embraces transparency, accountability, and integrity otherwise as it is said a fish rots from the head down. Estimates of uncertainty in predicting future climate and their implications on expenditure related to adaptation should to always be made in an integrated way and reported to support actionable policies. To increase credibility in climate prediction especially at local scales, advances toward improving climate models (for instance by refining spatiotemporal scales, enhancing models’ capacity to reproduce observed natural variability in key climatological variables like rainfall) should be made, and this requires support from the investment in climate science. Science–policy interfacing is required in planning and implementation of measures for adapting to climate change impacts. In summary, food insecurity and persistent poverty especially in the SSA should be of direct relevance and concern at a global scale. Thus, global collaboration in science is key to achieve food security in the SSA. © 2018 The Authors.

While terrestrial plants have a distinct structural and functional separation between the light exposed aerial parts and the non-exposed roots, epiphytic plants, such as orchids, have shoots and roots simultaneously fully exposed to light. The roots of orchids differ mainly from non-orchidaceous plants in their ability to photosynthesize. Since the roots of Catasetum fimbriatum can synthesize auxin which is acropetally transported to the shoot region, we decided to investigate whether: (1) light treatment of C. fimbriatum roots raises the auxin levels in the plant; and (2) distinct auxin concentrations can change the source-sink relationships, altering the amounts of sugars and organic acids in leaves, pseudobulbs and roots. Among the organs studied, the roots accumulated the highest concentrations of indole-3-acetic-acid (IAA); and when roots were exposed to light, IAA accumulated in the leaves. However, when polar auxin transport (PAT) was blocked with N-(1-Naphthyl)phthalamic acid (NPA) treatment, a significant accumulation of sugars and organic acids occurred in the pseudobulbs and leaves, respectively, suggesting that auxin flux from roots to shoots was involved in carbon partitioning of the aerial organs. Considering that C. fimbriatum plants lose all their leaves seasonally, it is possible the roots are a substituting influence on the growth and development of this orchid during its leafless period. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS","Auxin; Carbon partitioning; Carbon sources; Catasetum; Light; Orchid; Roots","carbon; fructose; glucose; indoleacetic acid; indoleacetic acid derivative; sucrase; animal; light; metabolism; Orchidaceae; plant leaf; plant root; radiation response; Animals; Carbon; Fructose; Glucose; Indoleacetic Acids; Light; Orchidaceae; Plant Leaves; Plant Roots; Sucrase",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059230517

Classical hypotheses suggest that communities become more vertically stratified with increasing species richness, owing to reduced competition or finer niche subdivision. However, this assertion remains untested in the context of the broader realm of biogeography. Here, integrating traits and distribution data for amphibians globally, we show how vertical strategies interact with the physical and climatic environments to govern global patterns of species richness and community composition. Our results reveal a marked latitudinal shift in strategies of vertical habitat use, from highly arboreal assemblages in the tropics to highly fossorial assemblages in sub-tropical and temperate regions. Arboreality is strongly associated with precipitation, vegetation structure and climatic stability, whereas fossoriality is more common in dry environments with high diurnal temperature range and low vegetation structure. These analyses shed light on the importance of vertical stratification for species coexistence in species-rich regions. As certain tropical habitats become drier from climate change, the rich biological diversity that is emblematic of the tropics may transition from vertically stratified to ‘flattened’, with future communities living mostly on or beneath the ground. © 2018 The Authors","arboreality; fossoriality; macroecology","biodiversity; biogeography; climate change; coexistence; global perspective; habitat use; landscape; macroecology; precipitation (climatology); species richness; subtropical region; terrestrial ecosystem; tropical environment; vegetation structure; Amphibia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052456070

While numerous articles have addressed how the NUA can be implemented at different levels and in different areas, this article points out the potential limitations in incorporating the NUA into metropolitan transport policies. The relevance of the limitations can be seen in three main fields: incompatibility between legal and financial frameworks and the functional and spatial structures of metropolitan areas, the characteristics of how transport systems are developed as part of metropolitan functional and spatial structures and the inconsistency and inadequacy between political declarations (NUA) which are based on ideas and programmes and the objectives of strategy papers which are based on diagnoses, data analyses and predictive models. The authors put forward the thesis that by concentrating on cities, the NUA leaves out some of the characteristics of metropolitan areas. As a consequence, although the NUA can work successfully for metropolitan cores, outer areas are not covered directly. In order to verify the thesis, a comparison was made between the NUA's transport system approach with experience from running and planning metropolitan transport systems described in the literature. The results of the comparative analysis, confirmed the thesis of the authors and made it possible to formulate general conclusions regarding the specific conditions of metropolitan areas for the running and developing of the transport system. By using explanatory case study of Tri-City Metropolitan Area (TMA) and the Strategy for Transport and Mobility for TMA 2030 general assumptions were confirmed and explain in more details. The NUA and STM were compared for how they address the main areas of intervention related to transport. Differences were identified and recommendations were formulated, should the documents be updated. The STM must be updated in areas such as equity and climate change mitigations while the NUA should be expanded to cover the specific conditions that prevail in functional and metropolitan areas. © 2019 by the authors.","Civil engineering and transport; Metropolitan transport system; New urban agenda","civil engineering; climate change; equity; financial provision; metropolitan area; sustainable development; transportation infrastructure; urban development; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061080935

These changes to the dispatch order affect the total amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that is emitted to the atmosphere and the amount of total water that is required by the electricity generating facilities. In a case study of the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas system, we separately investigated the value that three BES technologies (CO2-Geothermal Bulk Energy Storage, Compressed Air Energy Storage, Pumped Hydro Energy Storage) could have for reducing system-wide CO2 emissions and water requirements. In addition to increasing the utilization of wind power capacity, the dispatch of BES also led to an increase in the utilization of natural gas power capacity and of coal power capacity, and a decrease in the utilization of nuclear power capacity, depending on the character of the net load, the CO2 price, the water price, and the BES technology. These changes to the dispatch order provided positive value (e.g., increase in natural gas generally reduced CO2 emissions; decrease in nuclear utilization always decreased water requirements) or negative value (e.g., increase in coal sometimes increased CO2 emissions; increase in natural gas sometimes increased water requirements) to the regional electricity system. We also found that these values to the system can be greater than the cost of operating the BES facility. At present, there are mechanisms to compensate BES facilities for ancillary grid services, and our results suggest that similar mechanisms could be enacted to compensate BES facilities for their contribution to the environmental sustainability of the system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bulk energy storage; Decarbonization; Dispatch; Electricity system; Integrated assessment modeling; Water-energy nexus","Carbon dioxide; Compressed air; Decarbonization; Electric energy storage; Electric power system interconnection; Gas emissions; Geothermal energy; Natural gas; Nuclear fuels; Sustainable development; Wind power; Dispatch; Electricity system; Environmental sustainability; Integrated assessment models; Pumped-hydro energy storages; Total amount of carbons; Variable renewable energies; Water energy; Electric load dispatching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059572457

Climate change and fertilization are expected to largely shift litter decomposition rates in terrestrial ecosystems, however, studies contextualizing the relative importance of these major global change drivers versus other key decomposition drivers such as substrate quality and ecosystem type are lacking. Herein, we used two independent field experiments in an Eastern Australian grassland (Experiment 1) and a forest (Experiment 2) to evaluate the role of (i) litter quality, (ii) nutrient addition (N, P and K in full factorial combination; Experiment 1), and (iii) a combination of N addition and irrigation (Experiment 2) in litter decomposition, substrate-induced respiration and microbial abundance. Regardless of experimental treatments, forest soils decomposed litter between 2 and 5 times faster than grassland soils. This was principally controlled by the greater ability of forest microbes to respire C-based substrates and, ultimately, by soil N availability. The experimental treatments accounted for only relatively small differences in our measured variables, ranging from 10 to 15% in the case of the irrigation-by-N-addition forest experiment to almost negligible in most of the grassland nutrient addition plots. In the latter experiment, decomposition and soil activity responses were associated with either K addition or interactions between K and other nutrients, suggesting a key role for this often-neglected soil nutrient in controlling litter decomposition. Our study provides evidence that while nutrient enrichment and/or irrigation have the potential to affect litter decomposition rates in grassland and forest ecosystems, land use change that results in loss or gain of forested area is likely to exert a much greater impact than these other two drivers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Decomposition; Eutrophication; Land use change; Litter quality; Soil microbial communities","Decomposition; Earth (planet); Ecosystems; Eutrophication; Forestry; Irrigation; Land use; Microorganisms; Nutrients; Quality control; Soils; Substrates; Land-use change; Litter decomposition; Litter decomposition rates; Litter quality; Microbial abundances; Soil microbial community; Substrate-induced respirations; Terrestrial ecosystems; Climate change; decomposition; ecosystem approach; environmental quality; eutrophication; experiment; forest; forest soil; global change; grassland; land use change; litter; microbial community; natural resource; nutrient; nutrient availability; soil microorganism; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059319884

Life cycle assessments are not typically conducted using more than one software package, but comparisons such as the analysis in this paper provide a critical review of a fuel product system. In particular, differences in the data and assumptions become evident for life cycle stages of the same fuel product when compared between life cycle assessment software packages. Using default settings in the three software packages, life cycle greenhouse gas emissions predictions ranged from 2.75 to 47.8 gCO2 equivalent per MJ of ethanol (gCO2e MJ−1), which presents a difference of as much as 45 gCO2e MJ−1. Assumptions regarding nitrogen fertilizer, land management, on/off-site enzyme production, and material/energy inputs included/excluded had substantial effects on life cycle greenhouse gas emissions. A consistent corn stover ethanol pathway using equivalent model assumptions and material/energy inputs was developed and implemented in each of the software packages, resulting in life cycle greenhouse gas emissions ranging from 40.7 to 42.0 gCO2e MJ−1. The difference in life cycle greenhouse gas emissions was considerably reduced to 1.3 gCO2e MJ−1 at most between software packages; however, individual emissions sources such as nitrogen fertilizer production, fertilizer application, corn steep liquor, glucose, sodium hydroxide, and biomass electricity still exhibit variation between software packages (e.g., up to 7.3 gCO2e MJ−1 E100 for equivalent glucose input), mainly due to different emissions factors data. Life cycle greenhouse gas emissions appeared consistent because emissions sources that vary between software packages offset each other. Differences in greenhouse gas emissions determined for corn stover ethanol point to the need to improve the life cycle modelling and replicability of life cycle studies on this biofuel pathway. Such inconsistencies are relevant in a carbon economy because the same product will have a different value in different jurisdictions as a result of differences in life cycle assessment software packages. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuel; Corn stover; Ethanol; Greenhouse gas emissions; LCA tools; Life cycle assessment","Application programs; Biofuels; Ethanol; Gas emissions; Glucose; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen fertilizers; Sodium hydroxide; Software packages; Biomass electricity; Corn stover; Corn stover ethanol; Fertilizer applications; Fertilizer production; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle modelling; Life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle; biofuel; biomass; comparative study; crop residue; electricity; emission; enzyme; enzyme activity; ethanol; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; pollutant source; software; Midwest; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056236673

Health impacts, as quantified by regionalized life cycle assessment, are highest in India and parts of eastern and southeastern Europe due to lack of modern flue gas treatment, and in China due to widespread coal power generation. Deployment of state-of-the-art flue gas treatment, driven by local emission limits, can mitigate health impacts in India and parts of Europe while it is already largely used in China and the United States. Phase-out of the 10% most polluting coal power plants (by capacity) would reduce coal power GHG emissions by 16% or human health impacts by 64%, respectively. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Coal; Flue gases; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Health; Life cycle; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Sulfur dioxide; Supply chains; Airborne emissions; Flue gas treatment; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Human health impacts; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Particulate Matter; South Eastern Europe; Underground coal mining; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061547827

Both at EU and Member State level, circular economy and resource efficiency policies are promoting production of lower-impact building materials with secondary material input. However, secondary material strategies do not result in carbon saving by default, and depend on businesses developing effective and economic applications that can overcome the many barriers to closing material loops. This paper aims to advance understanding of the relevance of secondary material for decarbonisation of the building sector, as well as the interplay of business model innovation and policy instruments in this transition. We used a comparative case study of three pioneering Scandinavian companies that produce circular building materials to estimate the carbon saving potential of using secondary material. We also examined business model innovations to implement strategies, and companies’ experienced and desired policies to help remove barriers. The results show clearly that all three cases offer potential for carbon savings. As the savings vary significantly, findings suggest that careful consideration of affected processes and markets is a key to attaining carbon savings. Business model innovations to enable secondary material use involve establishing key partnerships to access secondary materials, developing recovery process and technology, targeting customer segments that value lower environmental impacts, and considering life cycle costs. Public policies that can help companies remove barriers include 1) incorporating reuse of higher material value in construction and demolition waste targets, and 2) incentivising waste collection and recovery markets to offer recovered material at higher value. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Circular Business Models; Life Cycle Analysis; Policy for circular economy; Reuse of CDW; Sustainable Buildings","Building materials; Carbon; Commerce; Demolition; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Public policy; Recovery; Secondary recovery; Sustainable development; Business models; Circular economy; Life cycle analysis; Reuse of CDW; Sustainable building; Costs; carbon; building; business; carbon emission; economic policy; greenhouse gas; innovation; life cycle analysis; social policy; sustainability; Article; case study; comparative study; cost benefit analysis; decarboxylation; environmental impact; environmental policy; life cycle assessment; methodology; recycling; Scandinavia; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056210292

The next generation molten salts will be able to achieve 700 °C, which is a suitable temperature for Supercritical CO2 cycles. However, there is a big uncertainty about the efficiencies of the cycle components, which could make these cycles unviable. A sensitivity analysis of the energy efficiency of the Recompression Cycle and Partial Cooling Cycle, regarding turbomachinery isentropic efficiencies and Recuperator effectiveness variations, has been carried out to show that the Recompression Cycle's energy efficiency is considerably more sensitive than the Partial Cooling Cycle's. From the sensitivity analysis, it can also be concluded that the Recompression Cycle is the best performing cycle for most of the studied cases, with energy efficiencies in the range between 32.97% and 51.91%. Exergetically, the Recompression Cycle is also more suitable in most situations, and the exergy analysis on cycle components shows that irreversibilities occur mainly in the Recuperators, which means that future research should focus on methods to reduce irreversibilities in these components. The state-of-the-art of Supercritical Rankine Cycle plant net energy efficiencies currently reach 45.60% for fossil fuel plants. Although Supercritical CO2 cycles are a simpler and more compact alternative, this work concludes that only the optimized Recompression Cycle with turbomachinery isentropic efficiencies over 92% and Recuperator effectiveness over 95% are able to obtain similar or higher efficiencies than actual Supercritical Rankine Cycles. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis plots permit the areas to be mapped where each of the optimized two-cycle efficiencies can compete with the Supercritical Rankine Cycles regarding the turbomachinery isentropic efficiencies and Recuperator effectiveness. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Concentrating solar power; Exergy; Partial Cooling Cycle; Recompression Cycle; Sensitivity analysis; Supercritical CO2","Carbon dioxide; Cooling; Energy efficiency; Exergy; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Rankine cycle; Recuperators; Solar energy; Solar power plants; Turbomachinery; Component efficiencies; Concentrating solar power; Concentrating solar power plant; Energy and exergy efficiency; Isentropic efficiency; Partial cooling; Recompression cycles; Supercritical CO2; Sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059467727

In this study, the environmental impact of the core design and magnet material for three electric vehicle traction motors was explored with life cycle assessment (LCA): two permanent magnet synchronous machines with neodymium-dysprosium-iron-boron or samarium-cobalt magnets, and a permanent magnet-assisted synchronous reluctance machine (PM-assisted SynRM) with strontium-ferrite magnets. These combinations of motor types and magnets, although highly relevant for vehicles, are new subjects for LCA. The study included substantial data compilation, machine design and drive-cycle calculations. All motors handle equal take-off, top speed, and driving conditions. The production (except of magnets) and use phases are modeled for two countries – Sweden and the USA – to exemplify the effects of different electricity supply. Impacts on climate change and human toxicity were found to be most important. Complete manufacturing range within 1.7–2.0 g CO2-eq./km for all options. The PM-assisted SynRM has the highest efficiency and lowest emissions of CO2. Copper production is significant for toxicity impacts and effects on human health, with problematic emissions from mining.

The various mountain micro-climates provide a natural gradient for space-for-time substitution research that plant responses to climate change. In this study, we surveyed the plant community in term of species composition, diversity and biomass across 189 sites on a hill of the Tibetan Plateau and analysed the individual and integrated effects of soil temperature and moisture on the plant community. The results showed that, at the quadrat scale, there were decrease in richness of 1.08 species for every 1 °C increase in soil temperature and 3.56 species for every 10% decrease in soil moisture. The integrated effects of increasing soil temperature and decreasing moisture are expected to lead to a rapid decrease in species richness. Biomass had no significant correlation with soil temperature but significantly decreased with soil moisture decreasing (p < 0.01). Biomass would decrease when soil moisture was below 20%, no matter how the change of soil temperature. We also found that gramineae and perennial forbs were sensitive to climate change. With soil temperature increased, the proportion of gramineae increased, whereas the proportion of perennial forbs decreased. The integrated effects of soil temperature increasing and moisture decreasing caused a shift from sedge-controlled to gramineae-controlled communities in alpine meadow.

The South East Europe region presents high sensitive climatic parameters due to climate change. Different approaches could be applied to assess the climate change impact on the water resources. Climate models and land cover data were used here in two shift times, present (2011–2040) and future (2041–2070), to evaluate the climate effect on groundwater resources. ’New Implemented Spatial-Temporal On Regions–Climate Effect on Groundwater’ (NISTOR-CEGW) method was proposed for this study because it implies an analysis at spatial scale based on land cover, actual crop evapotranspiration (AETc), effective precipitation, and De Martonne Aridity Index. This method uses an inference matrix to combine the effective precipitation and De Martonne Aridity Index to assess the impact of climate on groundwater giving six classes of effects, from very low to extremely high. For the present period, the findings indicate extremely high climate effect in the Pannonian basin, in the East and South of Romania, in the North and South of Bulgaria, in the East and central parts of Macedonia, in the North and East of Greece and in the European part of Turkey. In the future, the areas with the extremely high climate effect on groundwater increase mainly in the northern, eastern, and southeastern sides of the South East Europe region. The Dinarics and the Alps Mountains are the areas with low and very low effect of climate on groundwater. These areas experience a very humid and extremely humid climate.

The assessment used in this paper is based on effective precipitation and De Martonne Aridity Index, both of them analyzed in three time periods (past, present, and future) using the spatial distribution of these parameters at a regional scale. In addition, the actual crop evapotranspiration using the Budyko method has completed to incorporate the land cover contribution at the evapotranspiration phenomena and further, the effective precipitation pattern was subtracted and defined for the Emilia-Romagna region. The examination of the actual crop evapotranspiration during the three periods show a slight decrease in the maximum values, from 817 mm (in the past) to 762 mm (in the present) and 751 mm (in the future). There was a decrease in the maximum effective precipitation between past and present from 2263 mm to 1922 mm, while for the future the effective precipitation indicates values which reach 1885 mm. The De Martonne Aridity Index indicates a significant decrease during the past (24.8–140.5), present (21.8–136.8), and future (20.5–127.1). These descending values suggest the aridization of the Emilia-Romagna in the northern, eastern, and central sides, where the index values fall below 28 and where the sub-humid and Mediterranean climates were identified. In order to assess the climate change effect on groundwater resources, an improved method based on inference matrix tool was proposed to combine the climate index and the effective precipitation parameter at spatial scale. Through this approach, the very high and high impact of climate change on groundwater resources were verified during all the three periods in the North and Northeast parts of the region, whereas the low impact was verified more in the South and the West sides.

In order to assess these options and the associated environmental impacts, it is necessary to have good estimates of emissions and other inventory factors during the different steps of the life cycle of the compost products. Especially, the impacts occurring after land application are difficult to estimate. The objective of the current paper is to estimate environmental inventory factors for land application of four garden waste products: shredded garden waste, shredded garden waste after removal of the woody fraction, immature garden waste compost and mature garden waste compost. Soil incubations of the materials were conducted in order to assess the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics occurring after incorporation in soil. Subsequently, the results were used to calibrate the mineralisation kinetics of the materials in the agroecosystem model Daisy. Subsequently, the model was used to simulate C and N dynamics under different environmental conditions and emissions to the environment and used to derive inventory factors. Nine soil and climate combinations were included in the simulation study to cover local conditions commonly found in Northern Europe. The degradability of the garden waste products increased when the woody fraction of garden waste was removed and generally the degradability of the product was decreased by composting. All four products showed initial immobilisation of N in soil, but it was clear that removal of the woody fraction and composting reduced the length and severity of the immobilisation phase. The approach taken in the current paper using soil incubations to estimate decomposition parameters for the materials and subsequently an agroecosystem model to extrapolate the observations proved efficient at estimating inventory factors under various environmental conditions and fertilisation levels. Under low N availability conditions, the harvest factor, which estimates the fraction of N harvested in response to application of an amount of compost ranged between 0.10 and 0.18 for a sandy loam soil and medium precipitation conditions for Northern European while it ranged from negative values to 0.12 under conditions of ample N supply. These results were also clearly reflected in the emission factors for N leaching to the groundwater and losses to surface water, which were higher under high N availability than under low. The harvest factor, emission factors for ammonia, N leaching to ground water and loss to surface water proved to be very dependent on the local conditions like the soil type, precipitation regime and general fertilisation level, whereas the biochemical composition of the materials was of less importance for these factors. In contrast, the C sequestration factor was almost unaffected by the environmental conditions but depended to a large extent on the degradability of the added material. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.","C sequestration; Compost; Composting; Daisy; Emission modelling; N2O emissions; Nitrate leaching; Simulation modelling","Ammonia; Composting; Computer simulation; Ecosystems; Groundwater; Harvesting; Leaching; Soils; Surface waters; Waste treatment; Agro-ecosystem modeling; Biochemical composition; C sequestration; Daisy; Emission modelling; Environmental conditions; Environmental life-cycle inventory; Nitrate leaching; Life cycle; carbon sequestration; composting; environmental conditions; garden; inventory; life cycle analysis; recycling; waste; Northern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042231213

However, it remains challenging to obtain high-performance and reliable field-emitter materials. In this work, we report a systematic study on the field emission of novel two-dimensional tin selenide (SnSe) with rational design of its structures and surface morphologies. SnSe in the form of atomically smooth single crystals and nanostructures (nanoflowers) is chemically synthesized and studied as field emitters with varying channel lengths from 6 μm to 100 nm. Our study shows that devices based on SnSe nanoflowers significantly improve the performance and enable field emission at a reduced voltage due to a surface-enhanced local electrostatic field, and further lead to nonlinear dependent channel scaling when the channel length is shorter than 600 nm. We measured a record-high short-channel field-enhancement factor of 50 600 for a 100 nm device. Moreover, we investigated the emission stability and measured the fluctuations of the emission current which are smaller than 5% for more than 20 hours. Our results demonstrated a high-performance and highly reliable field emitter based on 2D SnSe nanostructures and we developed an important building block for nanoscale vacuum field effect transistors.

This paper provides an improved understanding of the spatio-temporal variations in underlying climate processes, and the potential effects climate change may have on Vietnam's agricultural sector. Statistical methods were combined with geostatistical techniques to test the statistical significance of long-term trends in the climatic variables, graphically representing the distribution of climate patterns, identifying variations and trends of changes over time and their likely effects on agricultural production. By using records of monthly precipitation and temperature for a relatively long-term period (1975–2014) over a high density of 112 meteorological stations across the country, robust statistical and visual evidence of climatic change throughout Vietnam are provided. The Mann-Kendall trend test confirms the statistically significant long-term trends of rainfall and temperature in many regions across the country. The visual analysis shows remarkable changes in the spatio-temporal distribution patterns of those variables and most of the ‘hotspot’ areas identified by geostatistical mapping are in areas with confirmed long-term trends. The long-term significant trends are also concentrated in areas with very high proportion of agricultural land, particularly land used for rice production in the Red River and Mekong River deltas. The findings deliver a better understanding of underlying climate processes and impacts across regions of Vietnam and provide a basis to develop effective climate-related policies for agricultural production in response to changing climatic conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Farming; Geostatistical techniques; Spatio-temporal pattern; Statistical methods; Vietnam","rain; agricultural production; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; environmental conditions; farming system; geostatistics; long-term change; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical analysis; trend analysis; agricultural land; agriculture; Article; climate change; crop production; environmental policy; environmental temperature; geostatistical analysis; meteorology; precipitation; river; Viet Nam; human; temperature; Mekong River; Red River [Asia]; Viet Nam; Agriculture; Climate Change; Humans; Rivers; Temperature; Vietnam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055508125

Northern latitudes are expected to get warmer and wetter, and while there is consensus that warming will increase thaw and methane emissions, effects of increased precipitation are uncertain. At a thawing wetland complex in Interior Alaska, we found that interactions between rain and deep soil temperatures controlled methane emissions. In rainy years, recharge from the watershed rapidly altered wetland soil temperatures, warming the top ~80 cm of soil in spring and summer and cooling it in autumn. When soils were warmed by spring rainfall, methane emissions increased by ~30%. The warm, deep soils early in the growing season likely supported both microbial and plant processes that enhanced emissions.

In Switzerland, about 295 PJ of heat was consumed in buildings in 2016 which emitted about 17 million tonnes CO2. However, if the Swiss nationally determined contributions (NDCs) have to be met, the country's aggregate CO2 emissions should be between 8 and 16 million tonnes in 2050. Reduction of specific space heating demand in buildings; integrating renewable energy and increased heat distribution by district heating networks (DHNs); and use of heat pumps are three strategies which have been examined for decarbonising the Swiss heating system. It is estimated that an annual reduction of 1.5%–2.5% in the aggregate heating demand for different categories of buildings would be required. DHNs would have to be expanded from 53 networks in 2016 to about 159–212 networks in 2050 to enable integration of 53–70 PJ of ambient heat. This would require 390–520 heat pumps of 2–50 MW capacity with a coefficient of performance between 3 and 4. If these strategies are implemented, it is estimated that the aggregate CO2 emissions from heating would be between 1.25 and 3.06 million tonnes by 2050 thereby significantly decarbonising the heating system. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Decarbonisation; District heating networks; Heat pump; Heating demand","Aggregates; Carbon dioxide; Coefficient of performance; District heating; Energy utilization; Heat pump systems; Pumps; Decarbonisation; District heating networks; Heat distribution; Heat pumps; Heating and cooling; Heating demand; Heating system; Renewable energies; Heating equipment; alternative energy; carbon emission; emission control; energy use; European Union; heating; implementation process; pump; strategic approach; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059562339

Significant developments are made in unravelling the physiological and biochemical mechanisms underlying the productivity performance of coconut in various agroclimatic conditions. Delineating the seedling and adult palm growth, dry matter partitioning, compositional changes in developing nuts, oil and fatty acid profile in germplasm, drought tolerance mechanism, in situ drought-tolerant palms, responses to root (wilt) disease, drought management strategies, response to climatic parameters and climate change impact and adaptations are important milestones in this area of research. Further efforts eventually led to the development of InfoCrop-COCONUT model for simulating growth, development and yield, opening new vistas in research programmes for improving coconut management for higher yields. Since climate change is projected to have positive and negative impacts on coconut yield depending on the region, it is important to use advanced technologies for harnessing positive impacts while countering measures for overcoming the negative effects.

Five climate model products from the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization initiated Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment of World Climate Research Programme over south Asia region are used for this purpose. Among the several different features of ISMR, this study attempts to investigate expected changes in the average summer monsoon rainfall and percent monthly rainfall to the total monsoon seasonal rainfall using multimodel averages. Furthermore, this study attempts to identify the topographical ranges which are expected to be mostly affected by the changing average monsoon seasonal rainfall over IHR. Results from the multimodel average analysis indicate that the rainfall climatology is expected to increase by >0.75 mm/day over the foothills of northwest Himalaya during 2020–2070, whereas the rainfall climatology is expected to decrease for the flood plains of Brahmaputra under a warmer climate. The monthly percent rainfall of June is expected to rise by more than 1% over the northwestern Himalaya during 2020–2040 (although insignificant at p value <0.05), whereas the same for August and September is expected to decrease over the eastern Himalaya under a warmer climate. In terms of rainfall changes along the altitudinal gradient, this study indicates that the two significant rainfall regions, one at around 900 m and the other around 2000 m of the northwestern Himalaya are expected to see positive changes (>1%) in rainfall climatology during 2020–2070, whereas regions more than 1500 m in eastern Himalaya are expected to experience inconsistent variation in rainfall climatology under a warmer climate scenario. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria.",,"climate modeling; climate variation; climatology; monsoon; rainfall; summer; Himalayas; India; Lacuna",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028850300

The two highest wheat producing states, Punjab and Haryana in northern India, experienced a prolonged period of anomalously low wheat yield during 2002-2010. The extent of climate variability and change in influencing this prolonged reduction in wheat yield was examined. Daily air temperature (T max and T ave ) was used to calculate the number of days above optimum temperature and growing degree days (GDD) anomaly. Two drought indices, the standard precipitation and evapotranspiration index and the radiation-based precipitation index, were used to describe the drought conditions. Groundwater variability was assessed via satellite-based approximation. The analysis results indicate that the wheat yield loss corresponds to the increase in the number of days with a temperature above 35 °C during the maturity stage (March). Reduction in monsoon rainfall led to a depletion of groundwater and reduced surface water for irrigation in the wheat growing season (November-March). Higher temperatures, coupled with water shortage and irregular irrigation, also appear to impact the yield reduction. In hindsight, improving the agronomic practices to minimize crop water usage could be an adaptation strategy to maintain the desired wheat yield in the face of climate-induced drought and precipitation anomaly. © 2019 by the authors.","Groundwater; Irrigation; Northwest India; Precipitation; Temperature; Wheat yield","Cultivation; Drought; Food supply; Groundwater; Irrigation; Precipitation (chemical); Surface waters; Temperature; Water supply; Adaptation strategies; Agronomic practices; Climate variability and change; Growing degree days; Northwest India; Precipitation anomalies; Precipitation indices; Wheat yield; Climate change; agronomy; air temperature; climate change; climate effect; crop yield; drought; environmental factor; evapotranspiration; food security; groundwater; growing season; index method; irrigation; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; satellite altimetry; wheat; Haryana; India; Punjab [India]; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061832852

Design of efficient strategies for safe, long-term storage requires the capability to efficiently simulate processes taking place on very different temporal and spatial scales. The physical laws describing CO2 storage are the same as for hydrocarbon recovery, but the characteristic spatial and temporal scales are quite different. Petroleum reservoirs seldom extend more than tens of kilometers and have operational horizons spanning decades. Injected CO2 needs to be safely contained for hundreds or thousands of years, during which it can migrate hundreds or thousands of kilometers. Because of the vast scales involved, conventional 3D reservoir simulation quickly becomes computationally unfeasible. Large density difference between injected CO2 and resident brine means that vertical segregation will take place relatively quickly, and depth-integrated models assuming vertical equilibrium (VE) often represent a better strategy to simulate long-term migration of CO2 in large-scale aquifer systems. VE models have primarily been formulated for relatively simple rock formations and have not been coupled to 3D simulation in a uniform way. In particular, known VE simulations have not been applied to models of realistic geology in which many flow compartments may exist in-between impermeable layers. In this paper, we generalize the concept of VE models, formulated in terms of well-proven reservoir simulation technology, to complex aquifer systems with multiple layers and regions. We also introduce novel formulations for multi-layered VE models by use of both direct spill and diffuse leakage between individual layers. This new layered 3D model is then coupled to a state-of-the-art, 3D black-oil type model. The formulation of the full model is simple and exploits the fact that both models can be written in terms of generalized multiphase flow equations with particular choices of the relative permeabilities and capillary pressure functions. The resulting simulation framework is very versatile and can be used to simulate CO2 storage for any combination of 3D and VE-descriptions, thereby enabling the governing equations to be tailored to the local structure. We demonstrate the simplicity of the model formulation by extending the standard flow-solvers from the open-source Matlab Reservoir Simulation Toolbox (MRST), allowing immediate access to upscaling tools, complex well modeling, and visualization features. We demonstrate this capability on both conceptual and industry-grade models from a proposed storage formation in the North Sea. The current implementation assumes a sharp interface for the VE model, where the capillary forces do not lead to a capillary fringe. While the examples are taken specifically from CO2 storage applications, the framework itself is general and can be applied to many problems in which parts of the domain are dominated by gravity segregation. Such applications include gas storage and hydrocarbon recovery from gas reservoirs with local layering structure. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CO2 storage; Flow and transport in porous media; Fully-implicit; Gas injection; Hybrid model; Vertical-equilibrium","carbon sequestration; fluid flow; fluid injection; hydrocarbon reservoir; operations technology; porous medium; software; spatiotemporal analysis; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054174288

While measures are being applied in federal forests and large private properties, it remains unclear how small-scale private forest owners, with a property < 20 ha, perceive the possible influence of climate change and whether they will approach required activities. While in the past, the majority of private forest owners had ties to agriculture and cultivated farmland alongside their forests, recent studies revealed new trends and significant deviations from established norms and beliefs. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the motivations for forest ownership, current management practices, and perception of and adaptability to climate change, to discuss successful approaches for information campaigns, advisory services, and monetary incentives. The study applied a questionnaire with an embedded choice experiment, which obtained a thorough understanding of the salient factors influencing decision-making by surveying 919 forest owners across Austria. Results show that small-scale private forest owners are not homogenous. Three distinct segments were identified (utility oriented, recreation oriented, and tradition conscious forest owners) which reacted differently to provided management options and incentives. However, even under a worst-case scenario setting, 84% of forest owners would select some sort of management over no procedure, indicating that forest management is not generally rejected. Information campaigns should rather focus on soft management leading to attractive, stable and highly diverse forest stands resilient to climate change than on cost efficiency and financial benefits. Therefore, advisory services need to convey, that all forest measures are performed with special care and under consideration of the remaining forest and that each stand is treated individually with adequate equipment. Increasing monetary incentives, such as funding, barely influences forest owners’ decision-making and are therefore deemed unfeasible and unable to motivate the owners to undertake climate change adaptation measures. The study shows that a segmentation based on management behavior and preferences rather than on predefined characteristics has the potential to define a new state of the art. Overall, climate change adaptation through tailored forest management is highly supported by the presented findings. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"Agricultural robots; Decision making; Forestry; Surveys; Choice experiments; Climate change adaptation; Financial benefits; Management behavior; Management options; Management practices; Private forest owners; Worst case scenario; Climate change; Adaptation; Decision Making; Forest Management; Forestry; Forests; Incentives; Services; Surveys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031327437

However, because these systems receive pulses of nutrient rich stormwater (SW), they may be contributing excess greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This study quantifies the amount of CO2-eq emitted per L of stormwater treated for both GI basins and conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). GHG and stormwater monitoring were conducted at two stormwater basins in Ithaca, NY: one site was often saturated (anaerobic basin), and the other was quick draining (aerobic basin). In opposition to our hypothesis, rain events did not produce larger CH4 or N2O fluxes at the basins. Compared to literature values of field-scale monitoring at WWTPs (0.22 g CO2-eqL-1), the anaerobic basin produced similar CO2-eq (0.23 g CO2-eqL-1), but the rates were 55 times lower in the aerobic basin (0.004 g CO2-eqL-1). Using EPA calculations, SW sent to a WWTP would produce seven times more CO2 than if it were sent to an aerobic basin. Conversely, SW sent to a WWTP instead of an anaerobic basin would lead to an approximately eight times decrease in CO2. This shows that some GI (aerobic treatments) may be a benefit to reduce GHG emissions instead of the alternative WWTP. However, anaerobic GI may actually increase GHG emissions over the traditional WWTP. These results are especially relevant to combined sewer systems, where decisions must be made to upgrade decaying infrastructure and/or invest in GI. From a GHG perspective, installing aerobic GI practices would likely reduce the GHG emissions from cities. © 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Green infrastructure; Greenhouse gas; Stormwater","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Gas emissions; Storms; Wastewater treatment; Water quality; Aerobic treatment; Combined sewer systems; Green infrastructure; Greenhouse gas fluxes; Stormwater monitoring; Stormwaters; Urban stormwater management; Wastewater treatment plants; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; comparative study; flux measurement; greenhouse gas; infrastructure; monitoring; stormwater; urban area; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; water management; Ithaca [New York]; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065004886

In recent years, there has been discussion of the potential wide-ranging environmental benefits of this form of food production. One aspect of mollusc aquaculture that has received scrutiny is the production of calcareous shells (CaCO3). Mollusc shell growth has sometimes been described as a sink for atmospheric CO2, as it locks away carbon in solid mineral form. However, more rigorous carbonate chemistry modelling, including concurrent changes in seawater pCO2, pH, dissolved inorganic carbon, and total alkalinity, shows that calcification is a net CO2 source to the atmosphere. Combined with discussions about whether mollusc respiration should be included in carbon footprint modelling, this suggests that greater in-depth understanding is required before shellfish aquaculture can be included in carbon trading schemes and footprint calculations. Here, we show that regional differences in the marine carbonate system can alter the amount of CO2 released per unit CaCO3 formation. Our carbonate chemistry modelling shows that a coastal mussel farm in southern Portugal releases up to ~0.290 g of CO2 per g of CaCO3 shell formed. In comparison, an identical farm in the coastal Baltic Sea would produce up to 33% more CO2 per g of CaCO3 (~0.385 g-CO2·(g-CaCO3)−1). This spatial variability should therefore also be considered if mollusc aquaculture is to be included in future carbon trading schemes, and in planning future expansion of production across the industry. © 2018",,"alkalinity; aquaculture production; bivalve; calcification; calcium carbonate; carbon dioxide; carbon footprint; carbon sink; carbonate system; emissions trading; growth rate; seawater; shell; shellfish culture; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Europe; Portugal; Mollusca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057334850

We adopt here an innovative research design to test for motivational crowding effects through a forest conservation game in Colombia's Amazon Piedmont, using individual, collective and crop-price premium economic incentives. We implement a post-experiment survey on different types of motivations based on Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to test for changes in motivations.

However, not all types of payments affected motivations equally: collective payments enhanced social motivations to protect forests and the crop-price premium reduced intrinsic and guilt/regret related motivations.

Endless carbon fiber reinforced polymers are used primarily for products, which require high stiffness and strength while having a minimum weight. The increasing use of these materials results in the issue of production and after lifetime waste recycling. Due to the high costs for carbon fibers the recycling is reasonable from the economic point of view. Currently there are different strategies to reuse carbon fibers. One of them is processing carbon fiber waste in twin screw compounders for the production of short fiber reinforced polymers. One of the main issue during this process is the distributive mixing of the fibers and the fiber degradation of carbon fiber waste which is mostly available as cutted fabric. In order to achive higher fiber lengths while having evenly distributed fibers in the polymer matrix, a new type of compounding machine typically used for recycling of domestic plastic waste is investigated. In a first step the flow region of the machine is calculated numerically. With a particle tracking method that is based on the numerical flow calculation the distributive mixing behavior is determined. In the experimental part the compounding of glass fibers (chopped strands) in a Polypropylene matrix is investigated. Different pre-mixtures of granulate and fibers with fiber proportions of 20%, 30% and 40% are prepared and processed using different parameter settings. For every processing point the fiber length distribution and the fiber mass proportion in the produced granulate is measured. By analyzing the different results the homogeneity and the fiber breakage is determined. Finally there is a comparison between the material properties of the conventionally produced material in the twin screw process and the material produced with the aforementioned machine. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061568171

Relative permeability is probably the greatest source of potential uncertainty in multiphase flow simulation, second only to intrinsic permeability heterogeneity. The specific relative permeability relationship assigned greatly impacts forecasts of CO2 trapping mechanisms, phase behavior, and long-term plume movement. A primary goal of this study is to evaluate the impacts and implications of different methods of assigning relative permeability relationships for CO2-EOR model forecasts. Most simulation studies published in the literature base selection of relative permeability functions on the geologic formation or rock type alone. In this study, we initially implemented reservoir model grids with previously-identified hydrostratigraphic units based on porosity and permeability relationship of the Morrow ‘B’ Sandstone, then assigned relative permeability functions for those hydrostratigraphic units. Specific, constrained relative permeability relationships were created and assigned to each hydrostratigraphic unit using petrophysical data and Mercury Intrusion Capillary Pressure (MICP) measurements, from core samples of each hydrostratigraphic unit.

The present results reveal that dynamical, spectral, and geometrical features of the induced interaction zone depend on the mass of the ablated species and spatial separation between the interacting plumes. It has been observed that a sharp, intense, and more directional interaction zone is formed by the interaction of heavier plume species in comparison to that observed for a lighter atomic mass target.

The merging of all such boundary trajectories provides local zero-flux surfaces in the pseudocurrent density, i.e., separatrices, which split the induced current density field in a number of three-dimensional domains of flow. As a result, a new partition scheme, corresponding to the physical flow that one could observe, has been obtained.

The cross-correlation technique is a well-tested method for exoplanet characterization, having lead to the detection of various molecules, to constraints on atmospheric temperature profiles, wind speeds, and planetary spin rates. A new, potentially powerful application of this technique is the measurement of atmospheric isotope ratios. In particular D/H can give unique insights into the formation and evolution of planets, and their atmospheres. Aims. In this paper we aim to study the detectability of molecular isotopologues in the high-dispersion spectra of exoplanet atmospheres, to identify the optimal wavelength ranges to conduct such studies, and to predict the required observational efforts - both with current and future ground-based instrumentation. Methods. High-dispersion (R = 100 000) thermal emission spectra, and in some cases reflection spectra, were simulated by self-consistent modeling of the atmospheric structures and abundances of exoplanets over a wide range of effective temperatures. These were synthetically observed with a telescope equivalent to the VLT and/or ELT, and analyzed using the cross-correlation technique, resulting in signal-to-noise ratio predictions for the 13CO, HDO, and CH3D isotopologues. Results. We find that for the best observable exoplanets, 13CO is well in range of current telescopes. We predict it will be most favorably detectable at 2.4 μm, just longward of the wavelength regions probed by several high-dispersion spectroscopic observations presented in the literature. CH3D can be best targeted at 4.7 μm, and may be detectable using 40 m-class telescopes for planets below 600 K in equilibrium temperature. In this case, the sky background becomes the dominating noise source for self-luminous planets. HDO is best targeted at 3.7 μm, and is less affected by sky background noise. 40 m-class telescopes may lead to its detection for planets with Tequ below 900 K. It could already be in the range of current 8 m-class telescopes in the case of quenched methane abundances. Finally, if Proxima Cen b is water-rich, the HDO isotopologue could be detected with the ELT in ~1 night of observing time in its reflected-light spectrum. Conclusions. Isotopologues will soon be a part of the exoplanet characterisation tools. Measuring D/H in exoplanets, and ratios of other isotopes, could become a prime science case for the first-light instrument METIS on the European ELT, especially for nearby temperate rocky and ice giant planets. This can provide unique insights in their history of icy-body enrichment and atmospheric evaporation processes. © ESO 2019.","Methods: numerical; Planets and satellites: atmospheres; Radiative transfer","Chemical detection; Correlation methods; Dispersion (waves); Emission spectroscopy; Extrasolar planets; Forecasting; Isotopes; Numerical methods; Radiative transfer; Satellites; Signal to noise ratio; Telescopes; Atmospheric temperature profiles; Cross correlation techniques; Equilibrium temperatures; Formation and evolutions; Ground-based instrumentation; Methods: numericals; Planets and satellites: atmospheres; Self consistent modeling; Atmospheric temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061705644

Three decades later, consumption-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have continued to increase. To achieve ‘well below 2°C’ and 1.5 °C goals, consumption-related emissions must be substantially reduced in the coming decades. This paper provides insights on how to pursue 1.5 °C pathways through changes in household consumption. It draws on original data gathered in the project ‘HOusehold Preferences for reducing greenhouse gas Emissions in four European High Income Countries’ (HOPE) to analyse policies targeting and affecting direct and indirect GHG emissions in three household consumption categories (mobility, housing and food) in four countries (France, Germany, Norway and Sweden) and four medium-sized cities. This paper demonstrates discrepancies and similarities between current governmental policy approaches in the four countries and household perceptions of consumption changes with respect to policy mechanisms, responsibilities and space for acting on mitigation. Current demand-side policy strategies rely heavily on instruments of self-governance and nudging behaviour. Whilst some of our data suggests that households broadly accept this, it also suggests that governments could more actively lead and steer demand-side mitigation via adjusting and supplementing a comprehensive list of 20 climate policy measures currently in place in one or more of the case countries. The paper concludes by suggesting areas for more effective policy change and household-level climate change mitigation to feed the next update of climate pledges under the Paris Agreement. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Behaviour; Climate change mitigation; Climate policy; Energy consumption; Governmentality; Household energy use","Aerospace vehicles; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Behaviour; Climate change mitigation; Climate policy; Governmentality; Household energy use; Climate change; climate change; demand-side management; emission control; energy policy; energy use; environmental policy; government; greenhouse gas; mitigation; policy reform; France; Germany; Norway; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049125083

In a bid to do so, the odd-even driving scheme was implemented a few years ago in Delhi city on a trial basis requiring the vehicles bearing odd and even registration numbers to run on alternative days with effect from 1st January 2016. Applied for the very first time in India and lasting on a pilot basis for 15 days and also referred to as Phase 1 of implementation, the scheme ended on 15th January 2016 with primary goal of assessing the extent to which such a scheme could serve as an effective measure to bring down and control the excessively high ambient air pollution levels. Other associated benefits, which the study considered, were decongestion of city roads, and promoting use of public transport system and carpooling, besides other alternative modes of transport. The paper presents a comparative analysis of particulate matter concentrations recorded before and during the implementation of odd-even scheme of Phase 1 for three key traffic corridors of the city. The study reports an average reduction of PM 2.5 of 5.73% and that of PM 1.0 of 4.70% in the ambient air across all the corridors during the days of implementation of scheme, which depicts a small but positive impact of the measure adopted towards abatement of urban air pollution in the megacity of Delhi.

Based on carbon felt/organic–inorganic talc like hybrid (TLH), the electrodes were successfully prepared by a simple one-step sol–gel procedure at room temperature, from aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, magnesium and iron(III) hexahydrated chlorides, carbon felt, and ethanol. They were characterized by X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence, thermal analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance. It was shown that the order of carbon felt addition to the prepared solution is a key point to form a thin and homogeneous TLH layer at the surface of the carbon fibers. Also, composites having different Fe/Mg molar ratios can be obtained. The composite containing 100 wt % Fe was successfully tested as an electrode for the electro-Fenton process, because 98% degradation yield was obtained after 4 h of electrolysis. These results show that Fenton's reaction can be achieved with immobilized iron and H 2 O 2 produced at the cathode, which can account for the better degradation yield as compared with 70.5% obtained during electrolysis with a nonmodified cathode under the same operating conditions. Consequently, the use of such a material as an electrode for the electro-Fenton process was proven to merit further studies and, notably, to be used for the processing of industrial pharmaceutical effluents. © 2019 Académie des sciences","Carbon felt electrode; Composite material; Electro-fenton process; Layered organic–inorganic hybrid",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061804065

Instead of internationally agreed-upon emission reduction targets, the agreement relies on countries’ repeated, voluntary pledges and actions. A key mechanism for monitoring progress toward shared global goals, putting pressure on countries to live up to their promises, and increasing ambition over time is the global stocktake. The stocktake’s twin-purposes to act simultaneously as a review and ambition mechanism render it a global governance innovation. Absent a clear institutional precedent, the global stocktake presents a design challenge for the climate negotiation community. This paper develops a number of lessons for designing the stocktaking process based on a review of relevant scholarship and an analysis of the 2013–2015 Periodic Review as a limited precedent within the climate regime.

The Paris Agreement galvanises all signatory nations in a common cause-combating climate change and adapting to and investigating its effects, and with enhanced support to assist developing countries to do so. As such, it charts a new course in the global climate effort. The goals of the Paris Agreement will only be achieved through massive investment in pursuit of a common objective. According to the International Finance Corporation, an estimated US$90 trillion investment is required to implement the Paris Agreement. The current regime of international investment agreements (IIAs) provides an invaluable opportunity to promote the investment required to achieve the Paris Agreement objectives, including mitigation, adaptation and transition from fossil fuels. However, users must take care to ensure that investment is, in fact, protected and encouraged, and to maintain critical progress in promoting international climate change policy. ICSID is one of the five arms of the World Bank Group, which recognises that ""[c]limate change is a threat to the core mission of the World Bank Group"". The ICSID Convention is also designed to promote international private investment. As such, ICSID sits at an important nexus in this discussion. This article: (i) provides an overview of several influential arbitration decisions relating to international environmental disputes, and the way in which the existing climate change regime uses arbitration as a dispute resolution mechanism; (ii) examines the evolution of investment treaties, prior decisions, especially in the field of renewable energy, and the tools available within IIAs for tribunals to promote the Paris Agreement objectives; (iii) discusses what arbitral institutions have done to date, in terms of tools, procedures, rules and other mechanisms, to promote climate change expertise and facilitate the resolution of disputes in a way that is consistent with climate change concerns; and (iv) considers ICSID's position as an arm of the World Bank, particularly in light of the WBG Climate Change Action Plan commitment to scaling up climate action and aligning internal processes with intentionally agreed climate change goals. © 2019 The Author(s).

Box 111, Joensuu, 80101, Finland","Industrial processes, coal combustion, biomass burning (BB), and vehicular transport are important sources of atmospheric fine particles (PM2.5) and contribute to ambient air concentrations of health-hazardous species, such as heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and oxygenated-PAHs (OPAH). In China, emission controls have been implemented to improve air quality during large events, like the Youth Olympic Games (YOG) in August 2014 in Nanjing. In this work, six measurement campaigns between January 2014 and August 2015 were undertaken in Nanjing to determine the effects of emission controls and meteorological factors on PM2.5 concentration and composition. PAHs, OPAHs, hopanes, n‑alkanes, heavy metals, and several other inorganic elements were measured. PM2.5 and potassium concentrations were the highest in May–June 2014 indicating the prevalence of BB plumes in Nanjing. Emission controls substantially reduced concentrations of PM2.5 (31%), total PAHs (59%), OPAHs (37%), and most heavy metals (44–89%) during the YOG compared to August 2015. In addition, regional atmospheric transport and meteorological parameters partly explained the observed differences between the campaigns. The most abundant PAHs and OPAHs were benzo[b,k]fluoranthenes, fluoranthene, pyrene, chrysene, 1,8‑naphthalic anhydride, and 9,10‑anthracenedione in all campaigns. Carbon preference index and the contribution of wax n‑alkanes indicated mainly biogenic sources of n‑alkanes in May–June 2014 and anthropogenic sources in the other campaigns. Hopane indexes pointed to vehicular transport as the major source of hopanes, but contribution of coal combustion was detected in winter 2015. The results provide evidence to the local government of the impacts of the air protection regulations. However, differences between individual components were observed, e.g., concentrations of potentially more harmful OPAHs decreased less than concentrations of PAHs. The results suggest that the proportions of hazardous components in the PM2.5 may also change considerably due to emission control measures. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosol; Air quality; Chemical composition; Fine particles; Health effects","Aerosols; Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Biohazards; Coal combustion; Emission control; Heavy metals; Paraffins; Particles (particulate matter); Quality control; Ambient air concentration; Atmospheric fine particles; Chemical compositions; Emission control measures; Fine particles; Health effects; Meteorological parameters; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; 3 nitronaphthalic anhydride; alkane; anthraquinone; benzo[b]fluoranthene; benzo[k]fluoranthene; chrysene; fluoranthene; heavy metal; hopanoid; inorganic compound; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; potassium; pyrene; aerosol; air quality; chemical composition; concentration (composition); emission control; health impact; Olympic Games; particulate matter; urban atmosphere; air pollution control; Article; atmospheric transport; biomass; biomass burning; chemical composition; China; coal combustion; combustion; exhaust gas; particulate matter; plume; priority journal; seasonal variation; sporting event; urban area; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]; Lamprididae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055057126

By comprehensively comparing production- and consumption-based emissions, we found that six developed cities were consumers with import-depended trade patterns, while the five other cities were producers, mostly medium in size, with the potential to transform into consumer cities with socioeconomic development. Emissions embodied in imports accounted for more than half of the consumption-based emissions in most cities, which shows the significance of interregional cooperation in tackling climate change. International cooperation is also important at the city level, as international imports also impact consumption-based emissions.

In China, pollution with PM2.5 has caused widespread government and public concern. Many studies report that the PM2.5 increase is associated with the increase of other molecules. Using statistics and spatial autocorrelation analysis methods, this study analyzes the temporal-spatial characteristics and agglomeration distribution of PM2.5 concentrations in 21 cities of Anhui Province, China (one of the most polluted provinces in the Yangtze River Delta) over 2015 and 2016. In Hefei, the capital city of Anhui Province, a Pearson correlation coefficient was used to identify the relationship between PM2.5 and SO2, CO, NO2, and O3. The concentration levels show that (1) daily average PM2.5 concentrations fluctuated wildly in different seasons of both years, (2) monthly average PM2.5 concentrations were low in the spring and summer but high in the winter and autumn, and (3) PM2.5 concentrations in 21 cities exceeded the annual PM2.5 standards (≤ 35 μg/m³) and daily limit (≤ 75 μg/m³) with the second year showing lower levels. The annual average PM2.5 had significant spatial autocorrelation and clustering characteristics with high concentrations of PM2.5 expanding in northern Anhui, whereas lower concentrations occurred in the south. Additionally, SO2, CO, and NO2 had significant correlations with PM2.5, but O3 had no significant correlation with PM2.5. This study provides a scientific basis for understanding the impact mechanisms of atmospheric pollution. It also outlines an understanding of pollution characteristics, which enables government to make efficient policies that jointly prevent and control pollution. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Anhui; Gas pollutants; PM2.5; Spatiotemporal characteristics","Air quality; Autocorrelation; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution control; Spatial variables measurement; Anhui; Gas pollutants; Pearson correlation coefficients; PM2.5; Spatial autocorrelation analysis; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Temporal-spatial characteristics; River pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057744970

The empirical basis of our study regards Ethiopia’s Climate Resilient Strategy for Agriculture and Forest. Data was collected using policy document review and semi-structured interviews with policy actors. We establish that the policy and strategy documents fail to explicitly address gender dimensions of climate change problems and the proposed adaptation responses are often limited to using ‘gender neutral’ language. Analysis of interaction among policy actors points to factors that account for these findings. Lack of extensive discussion on the gender dimension of climate problems and adaptation responses emanates from limited participation by policy actors with an explicit gender agenda, limited conceptual and analytical capacity to unpack gender and the perception of the gender dimension as an issue of implementation. Thus, we conclude that there is a need to improve our understanding of factors that hinder or facilitate the emergence of gender-responsive climate change policies. In order to explicitly address gender, policy interaction discourses, including the represented actors, the interaction and the institutional setting, should be critically examined from a gender perspective. This special focus on gender should go accompanied by an analysis of and attention for the broader social dimension of climate policies that also includes categories such as ethnicity, age, localities and livelihoods, as well as their interplay. © 2018, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate policy; Discourse; Ethiopia; Gender",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053475812

Capparaceae have a pantropical distribution, although traditionally they have been considered mainly to be distributed in dry areas and therefore influenced by climatic constraints. We carried out an analysis of endemicity (NDM/VNDM) using 7602 records of 21 genera and 104 species in order to test whether climatic constraints of NSDF have shaped endemic species and areas of endemism of Capparaceae geographically confined to NSDF floristic nuclei. A total of three genera (monogeneric) and 29 endemic species included in 38 areas of endemism and 14 consensus areas were recovered. From Consensus areas, we proposed five generalized areas of endemism, mainly located in NSDF: Lower Central America, Northern South America, Northwestern South America, Northeastern South America and Central South of South America.

Soil microbial communities were also locally analysed according to environmental variables, including geological, physico-chemical, biogeochemically, and climatic data. Typical soil characteristics, climate data, and plant composition clearly split the two sites and major differences among the microbial communities for the areas were initially expected. Overall, high values of microbial species richness (up to 2300 taxa) and ecological diversity was detected in both sites. High genetic novelty levels were found mostly to environmental sequences, highlighting the high potential for microbiological studies. In contrast to the initial expectations, a substantial overlapping between Monegros and Gallocanta microbes was observed, indicating a high similarity despite of the geographical, botanical and environmental distances between sites, in agreement with both high dispersal and local selection inherent to the microbial world. The potential biogeochemical cycling showed small differences between sites, with presence of photosynthetic green and purple sulfur bacteria, cyanobacteria and aerobic and anaerobic chemolitotrophs. Potential for aerobic methane oxidation and anaerobic methanogenesis was observed in both sites, with predominance of potential nitrification mostly by ammonia-oxidizing archaea, nitrite oxidation and denitrification, and minor contribution for nitrate reduction and nitrate ammonification. The predicted functions based on the taxonomic composition showed high overlapping between the two studied regions, despite their difference in gypsum richness. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Genetic novelty; Gypsum; Hypersaline soils; Microbial community","Ammonia; Gypsum; Nitrates; RNA; Soils; Ammonia-oxidizing archaea; Biogeochemical cycling; Environmental variables; Genetic novelty; Hypersaline; Microbial communities; Potential nitrification; Soil microbial community; Aerobic bacteria; calcium sulfate; methane; nitrite; RNA 16S; RNA 16S; salt water; biogeochemical cycle; community composition; gypsum; hypersaline environment; methanogenesis; microbial community; nitrification; oxidation; physicochemical property; soil biota; soil chemistry; aerobic bacterium; ammonia oxidizing archaeon; ammonification; anaerobic bacterium; Article; biodiversity; biogeochemical cycle; chemical reaction; Chlorobi; cyanobacterium; denitrification; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; environmental factor; genetic analysis; geochemistry; hypersaline soil; methanogenesis; microbial community; nitrification; nonhuman; photosynthesis; priority journal; Rhodospirillaceae; soil; Spain; species richness; archaeon; bacterium; biodiversity; biosynthesis; carbon cycle; chemistry; classification; comparative study; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; nitrogen cycle; soil; Spain; Chromatiaceae; Cyanobacteria; Archaea; Bacteria; Biodiversity; Calcium Sulfate; Carbon Cycle; Methane; Nitrogen Cycle; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Saline Waters; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052948164

This ideology mainly focuses on diminishing the time involved in discovering the parking space and also it decreases the unwanted travelling, through filled parking slots in a parking arena.

Climate change will exacerbate those pressures and the effects of habitat loss and species decline. Current approaches to conservation law in most countries focus on establishing protected areas and limiting activities outside reserves that might affect priority species, habitats, and ecological communities. These measures have had mixed success depending on scale and implementation, but are likely to perform poorly under conditions of future change. To prepare for the future, we consider how conservation law and policy needs to anticipate and manage for future change; widen its scope beyond species and ecological communities that are currently threatened; and support adaptive management of priority areas and species. Using Australian conservation law as a case study, we outline three possible routes by which this shift could occur. The first involves enhancing the adaptiveness of conservation law, the second expands the focus of conservation law from protected areas and listed species to include ecosystems and ecosystem services, while the third attempts to do both simultaneously. We examine the legal mechanisms needed to implement each route, examples of their use in practice, and barriers that must be overcome for successful implementation.

Field-chamber green-house gas fluxes and site characteristics were analysed in two Mediterranean peri-urban pine forests showing degradation symptoms. We examined the effect of different thinning interventions on soil CO2, CH4 and N2O fluxes, addressing the relationships with the environmental variables and C and N contents along forest floor-soil layers. Soil temperature resulted as the main driving variable for CO2 efflux and CH4 uptake. Soil moisture content and organic matter availability affected CO2 emission patterns in the two sites. N2O fluxes showed a positive correlation with soil moisture under wetter climatic conditions only. GHG fluxes showed significant correlations with C and N content of both forest floor and mineral soil, especially in the deepest layers, suggesting that it should be considered, together with environmental variables when accounting GHG fluxes in degraded forests. Short-term effects of thinning on CO2 emissions were dependent on disturbance induced by logging operations and organic matter inputs. After thinning CH4 uptake increased significantly under selective treatment, independently from specific site-induced effects. N2O fluxes were characterized by low emissions in both sites and were not affected by treatments. Soil CO2 efflux was the largest component of global warming potential (GWP) from both sites (11,553 kg ha−1 y−1 on average). Although it has a large global warming potential, N2O contribution to GWP was about 131 kg CO2eq ha−1 y−1. The contribution of CH4-CO2 equivalent to total GWP showed a clear and significant CH4 sink behaviour under selective treatment (36 kg ha−1 y−1 on average). However, in the short-term both thinning approaches produced a weak effect on total GWP. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Forest floor; Global warming potential; Green-house gas fluxes; Pine plantations restoration; Soil moisture; Soil temperature","Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Carbon dioxide; Conservation; Ecosystems; Floors; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Organic compounds; Soil moisture; Temperature; Urban growth; Environmental variables; Forest floors; Global warming potential; Mediterranean ecosystem; Mediterranean forest ecosystems; Pine plantations; Positive correlations; Soil temperature; Forestry; carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; mineral; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; organic matter; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; carbon dioxide; environmental restoration; forest ecosystem; greenhouse gas; Mediterranean environment; methane; nitrogen oxides; plantation; soil carbon; soil moisture; soil temperature; thinning; Article; canopy thinning; carbon footprint; climate; controlled study; environmental factor; forest; greenhouse effect; priority journal; soil; soil moisture; soil temperature; Southern Europe; air pollutant; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; soil; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Global Warming; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053779467

The required structural change to limit anthropogenic forcing is expected to fundamentally change daily social and economic life. The production of iron and steel is a special case of economic activities since it is not only associated with combustion but particularly with process emissions of greenhouse gases which have to be dealt with likewise. Traditional mitigation options of the sector like efficiency measures, substitution with less emission-intensive materials, or scrap-based production are bounded and thus insufficient for rapid decarbonization necessary for complying with long-term climate policy targets. Iron and steel products are basic materials at the core of modern socio-economic systems, additionally being essential also for other mitigation options like hydro and wind power. Therefore, a system-wide assessment of recent technological developments enabling almost complete decarbonization of the sector is substantially relevant. Deploying a recursive-dynamic multi-region multi-sector computable general equilibrium approach, we investigate switches from coke-to hydrogen-based iron and steel technologies in a scenario framework where industry decisions (technological choice and timing) and climate policies are misaligned. Overall, we find that the costs of industry transition are moderate, but still ones that may represent a barrier for implementation because the generation deciding on low-carbon technologies and bearing (macro)economic costs might not be the generation benefitting from it. Our macroeconomic assessment further indicates that anticipated bottom-up estimates of required additional domestic renewable electricity tend to be overestimated. Relative price changes in the economy induce electricity substitution effects and trigger increased electricity imports. Sectoral carbon leakage is an imminent risk and calls for aligned course of action of private and public actors. © 2018","CGE; Iron and steel; Macroeconomics; Mitigation; Process emissions","Carbon; Climate change; Decarbonization; Greenhouse gases; Industrial economics; Steelmaking; Wind power; Computable general equilibrium; Iron and steel; Iron and steel productions; Low-carbon technologies; Macroeconomics; Mitigation; Process emissions; Technological development; Iron and steel industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056856453

This accelerated warming of northern regions is associated with multiple climate feedbacks, including those linked to the mobilization of old organic carbon previously sequestered in the frozen ground. This critical climate-feedback mechanism has major uncertainties, and may respond nonlinearly to ongoing warming at high latitudes. This study examines the role of freshwater ecosystems in the subarctic carbon balance, and addresses some sources of nonlinearity in the effect of climate warming on these ecosystems. Specifically, I examine the CO2 and CH4 dynamics in permafrost thaw-related ecosystems, and the associated biogeochemical processes. Our results show that major sources of variation in the dynamics of these two gases are associated with the geomorphological properties of the landscape, the degree of ground warming and seasonal biogeochemical dynamics. Accelerated climate change in northern regions may also intensify the CO2 and CH4 cycles in these regions, and may substantially increase the current CH4 flux from these ecosystems. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Forestry; Organic carbon; Soils; Timber; Biogeochemical dynamics; Biogeochemical process; Climate feedbacks; Freshwater ecosystem; High-latitude regions; Northern regions; Permafrost thaws; Sources of variation; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062547198

They lack a stable 3D structure and are able to adopt many different conformations in dynamic equilibrium. The interplay between local dynamics and global rearrangements is key for their function. A widely used experimental NMR spectroscopy approach to study long-range contacts in IDPs exploits paramagnetic effects, and 1 H detection experiments are generally used to determine paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) for amide protons. However, under physiological conditions, exchange broadening hampers the detection of solvent-exposed amide protons, which reduces the content of information available.

However, the underlying pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. In this prospective longitudinal study, we used a multimodality approach including positron emission tomography, computed tomography, and echocardiography to investigate the pathophysiology of MAC and assess factors associated with disease activity and progression. Methods: A total of 104 patients (age 72±8 years, 30% women) with calcific aortic valve disease, therefore predisposed to MAC, underwent 18F-sodium fluoride (calcification activity) and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (inflammation activity) positron emission tomography, computed tomography calcium scoring, and echocardiography. Sixty patients underwent repeat computed tomography and echocardiography after 2 years. Results: MAC (mitral annular calcium score &gt;0) was present in 35 (33.7%) patients who had increased 18F-fluoride (tissue-to-background ratio, 2.32 [95% CI, 1.81-3.27] versus 1.30 [1.22-1.49]; P&lt;0.001) and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose activity (tissue-to-background ratio, 1.44 [1.37-1.58] versus 1.17 [1.12-1.24]; P&lt;0.001) compared with patients without MAC. MAC activity (18F-fluoride uptake) was closely associated with the local calcium score and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, as well as female sex and renal function. Similarly, MAC progression was closely associated with local factors, in particular, baseline MAC. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors and calcification activity in bone or remote atherosclerotic areas were not associated with disease activity nor progression. Conclusions: MAC is characterized by increased local calcification activity and inflammation. Baseline MAC burden was associated with disease activity and the rate of subsequent progression. This suggests a self-perpetuating cycle of calcification and inflammation that may be the target of future therapeutic interventions. © 2019 American Heart Association, Inc.","disease progression; inflammation; mitral valve; positron emission tomography computed tomography","cholesterol; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; low density lipoprotein; aged; aortic valve; Article; atherosclerosis; calcification; cardiovascular risk; computer assisted tomography; disease activity; disease burden; disease exacerbation; echocardiography; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; gender; heart valve calcification; human; image analysis; inflammation; kidney function; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mitral annular calcification; pathophysiology; positron emission tomography; priority journal; prospective study; aortic valve stenosis; calcinosis; computed tomographic angiography; coronary angiography; diagnostic imaging; incidence; middle aged; mitral valve; multimodal imaging; pathology; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; predictive value; prevalence; procedures; prognosis; time factor; valvular heart disease; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aortic Valve; Aortic Valve Stenosis; Calcinosis; Computed Tomography Angiography; Coronary Angiography; Disease Progression; Echocardiography; Female; Heart Valve Diseases; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Mitral Valve; Multimodal Imaging; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Predictive Value of Tests; Prevalence; Prognosis; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061037376

Recently, the use of Construction Waste and Demolition (C&WD) in different construction fields has been reported by different authors as its composition includes a wide range of materials. One example of C&WD with potential use in Pavement Infrastructure is Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA). RCA have been studied as suitable replacement to Natural Aggregates (NA) in asphalt pavement, results have shown good performance and important environmental and economic benefits from the use of RCA with respect to conventional aggregates. This paper aims to evaluate the feasibility of using RCA obtained from different resources as a replacement material to NA in asphalt concrete mixtures. NA from regional representative quarries were used in this investigation. Instead, RCA was obtained from two different sources; one source, was obtained from a concrete pavement demolition project (Recycled Concrete Aggregate Pavement source-RCAP), and the second source was obtained from the demolition of some concrete structures in a baseball stadium in Barranquilla's city (Recycled Concrete Aggregate Building source - RCAB). Characterization of both RCA and NA includes determination of physical, mechanical and chemical properties according to Colombian Standards. Laboratory test results indicates that RCA could be a viable option as potential replacement of natural aggregate in asphalt pavement and to reduce the carbon footprint during the production of asphalt mixtures. Nevertheless, some intrinsic properties of the material must be considered with special care, e.g. absorption, gradation, abrasion resistance, pH, among others. Finally, scanning electron microscope (SEM) techniques were used to provide images on RCA's surface morphology and its composition, giving significant differences between RCA and NA. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Asphalt pavements; Carbon footprint; Concrete mixtures; Construction industry; Demolition; Mixtures; Natural resources; Recycling; Scanning electron microscopy; Urban planning; Baseball stadiums; Construction fields; Construction wastes; Demolition projects; Intrinsic property; Non-renewable natural resources; Recycled concrete aggregates; Replacement materials; Asphalt concrete",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062392551

In urban areas, transport and dispersion is particularly difficult to simulate using current mesoscale meteorological models due, in part, to added complexity from surface heterogeneity and fine spatial/temporal scales. It is generally assumed that the errors in GHG estimation methods in urban areas are dominated by errors in transport and dispersion. Other significant errors include, but are not limited to, those from assumed emissions magnitude and spatial distribution. To assess the predictability of simulated trace gas mole fractions in urban observing systems using a numerical weather prediction model, we employ an Eulerian model that combines traditional meteorological variables with multiple passive tracers of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) from anthropogenic inventories and a biospheric model. The predictability of the Eulerian model is assessed by comparing simulated atmospheric CO2 mole fractions to observations from four in situ tower sites (three urban and one rural) in the Washington DC/Baltimore, MD area for February 2016. Four different gridded fossil fuel emissions inventories along with a biospheric flux model are used to create an ensemble of simulated atmospheric CO2 observations within the model. These ensembles help to evaluate whether the modeled observations are impacted more by the underlying emissions or transport. The spread of modeled observations using the four emission fields indicates the model's ability to distinguish between the different inventories under various meteorological conditions. Overall, the Eulerian model performs well; simulated and observed average CO2 mole fractions agree within 1% when averaged at the three urban sites across the month. However, there can be differences greater than 10% at any given hour, which are attributed to complex meteorological conditions rather than differences in the inventories themselves. On average, the mean absolute error of the simulated compared to actual observations is generally twice as large as the standard deviation of the modeled mole fractions across the four emission inventories. This result supports the assumption, in urban domains, that the predicted mole fraction error relative to observations is dominated by errors in model meteorology rather than errors in the underlying fluxes in winter months. As such, minimizing errors associated with atmospheric transport and dispersion may help improve the performance of GHG estimation models more so than improving flux priors in the winter months. We also find that the errors associated with atmospheric transport in urban domains are not restricted to certain times of day. This suggests that atmospheric inversions should use CO2 observations that have been filtered using meteorological observations rather than assuming that meteorological modeling is most accurate at certain times of day (such as using only mid-afternoon observations). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate; CO2; Emissions; Flux; Urban","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Biospherics; Carbon dioxide; Errors; Fluxes; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Particulate emissions; Urban growth; Weather forecasting; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Atmospheric transport and dispersions; Climate; Mesoscale meteorological model; Meteorological observation; Numerical weather prediction models; Transport and dispersions; Urban; Urban transportation; carbon dioxide; atmospheric transport; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon flux; climate change; climate conditions; emission inventory; error correction; Eulerian analysis; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; simulation; spatial distribution; trace gas; urban pollution; urban region; urban site; analytical error; Article; atmospheric dispersion; atmospheric transport; city; District of Columbia; greenhouse gas; Maryland; meteorology; model; prediction; priority journal; quantitative analysis; simulation; surface property; urban area; Baltimore; Maryland; United States; Washington [United States]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056737802

In this paper, we question the transformative credentials of smartness and argue that it is better understood as a partial fix for the economic, environmental and social challenges faced by cities. Drawing on the urban sustainability and smart city literatures, we develop the concept of the urban smart-sustainability fix. This concept focuses on how smart-sustainable city initiatives selectively integrate digital and environmental agendas via entrepreneurial forms of urban governance. We develop this concept by examining how the urban smart-sustainability fix is constructed in the European Commission's flagship smart cities and communities lighthouse projects, focusing on the Triangulum initiative. Our research reveals three elements of the urban smart-sustainability fix: (1) the spatial development of smart-sustainable districts; (2) the digitisation of urban infrastructure to reveal hidden processes; and, (3) collaborative experimentation with low-carbon and digital technologies. We argue that this has produced urban districts that are attempting to reduce their carbon emissions while promoting green economic growth. The main aim of the urban smart-sustainability fix is to make the urban realm more manageable resulting in amplification, rather than transformation, of the dominant ecological modernisation agenda of sustainable development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Ecological modernisation agenda; Smart city; Smart-sustainability fix; Urban sustainability","Carbon; Ecology; Economics; Smart city; Sustainable development; Digital technologies; Ecological modernisation; Environmental agendas; European Commission; Smart-sustainability fix; Spatial development; Urban infrastructure; Urban sustainability; Urban growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059301989

Whether this would lead to identifiable near-term responses in “iconic” climate quantities of wide scientific and public interest is unclear, because the climate response would be obscured by quasi-random internal variability. I define the climate response as an increase or decrease in a linear climate trend over the period 2021–2035, compared to 2006–2020, and establish the probability of such a trend change being caused by an assumed policy shift toward emissions reductions after 2020. I quantify the irreducible uncertainty in projecting such a trend change through very large (100-member) ensembles of the state-of-the-art climate model MPI-ESM-LR. Trends in global-mean surface temperature (GMST) are higher over the period 2021–2035 than over 2006–2020 in one-third of all realizations in the mitigation scenario RCP2.6, interpreted as implementing the Paris agreement, compared to around one-half in the no-mitigation scenario RCP4.5. Mitigation is sufficient to cause a GMST trend reduction with a probability of 0.40 and necessary with a probability of 0.33. Trend increases in Arctic September sea-ice area and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation are caused by the emissions reductions with a probability of only around 0.1. By contrast, emissions reductions are necessary for a trend decrease in upper-ocean heat content with a probability of over one-half. Some iconic climate quantities might thus by year 2035 exhibit an identifiable response to a successful Paris agreement but sometimes with low probability, creating a substantial communication challenge.

We qualitatively assessed advanced silvopastoral experiences in five ecologically and culturally distinct regions in Chiapas, Mexico, given their ability to provide key services: internal (productivity and productive resiliency) and external (climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation). We propose 20 indicators that reflect management, resources, use of external inputs, availability of food, commercial products and animal feed and trees in grazing and forest areas. Sets of some indicators form criteria for dependence on external inputs, productive diversification with emphasis on food security, soil conservation, tree cover and landscape connectivity, among others. Indicators and thresholds were adjusted to critical (traffic light) levels, based on field data. Comparing the levels reached by the studied experiences, we found that most of the resulting services go hand in hand; so 'win-win' situations are possible to be achieved. The elements and practices that affect both internal and external services were explored. The red light critical points in each production unit were identified so that they could be attended. Experiences that presented higher levels in assessment criteria could serve as examples to enable the improvement of livestock systems under similar conditions. We propose this assessment as a tool for rapid intervention that can be widely applied to livestock systems, from conventional to organic or diversified, because of the criteria used. However, it can be more flexible, as new criteria can be added and thresholds can be adjusted for other types of production systems, always reflecting local and desired conditions. The proposed indicators can be also used as a basis for a quantitative agroecosystem assessment. © Cambridge University Press 2017.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034616830

The introduction outlines the global threat to forests, the contribution that forest-based emissions make to climate change, and the policy response of the international and national communities including REDD +. The next section provides a snapshot of CBFMS in the four case study countries, and is followed by an account of the methodology, approach, framework of analysis and sampling surveys undertaken during the course of, and informing, the research. The results of the surveys revealed that perceptions of governance quality, as well as governance priorities, varied between the countries, and also at the three levels of government (national, sub-national and local) within a country. For example, Myanmar and Bhutan had very high governance ratings from local levels compared to other levels, whereas, Nepal and India had similar ratings for all levels. Further, regarding the prioritisation of different indicators, Myanmar gave highest priority to “inclusiveness” at the local level but “democracy” at the national level. The reasons for the similarities and differences between and within these countries and the possible implications are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bhutan; Community forestry; India; Indicators; Myanmar; Nepal; Quality of governance","community forestry; developing world; forest management; governance approach; perception; prioritization; Bhutan; India; Myanmar; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057315824

To do this, we focus on the northwestern part of Peru and bias correct 1- and 4-month lead seasonal predictions of boreal winter (DJF) precipitation from the ECMWF System4 forecasting system for the period 1981–2010. In order to include information about the underlying large-scale circulation which may help to discriminate between precipitation affected by different processes, we introduce here an empirical quantile–quantile mapping method which runs conditioned on the state of the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI), which is accurately predicted by System4 and is known to affect the local climate. Beyond the reduction of model biases, our results show that the SOI-conditioned method yields better ROC skill scores and reliability than the raw model output over the entire region of study, whereas the standard unconditioned implementation provides no added value for any of these metrics. This suggests that conditioning the bias correction on simple but well-simulated large-scale processes relevant to the local climate may be a suitable approach for seasonal forecasting. Yet, further research on the suitability of the application of similar approaches to the one considered here for other regions, seasons and/or variables is needed. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bias correction; ENSO; Peru; Precipitation; Process-conditioning; Seasonal forecasting; SOI","correction; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; forecasting method; precipitation assessment; prediction; seasonal variation; Southern Oscillation; Peru",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046730275

At the center of many cities plans to address sustainability issues, are plans for urban canopy development (i.e. increases the number of trees in cities). In this paper, we propose an approach to educate residents about the environmental and socio-economic benefits of trees in urban settings and incentivize tree growth in cities. In addition to environmental benefits, trees have been shown to have many significant socio-economic benefits (e.g. real estate values, pedestrian traffic, motor traffic, and many other aspects of urban life) [1], [2], [3]. Our approach can also be leveraged to encourage resident participation in city tree development programs, such as Free Tree Programs [4]. By quantifying and displaying tree environmental and economic benefits at the selected locations on an interactive map, citizens and policymakers can determine the best locations to plant trees in the city. The system aggregates data from the distributed city sensors to model tree benefits and provide an overall score which quantifies the benefit of planting a tree(s) at a given location(s). The system models tree benefits by taking historical data from the pedestrian, environmental, and traffic sensors to predict the potential impacts (e.g. carbon reduction, evapotranspiration, average pedestrian traffic, and average vehicular traffic, property values, ) of a tree(s) at a given location(s) [1], [2], [3], [5]. By using the system, citizens learn about the positive effects of having trees in their neighborhood and policy makers may also better conduct city planning and develop urban policies/strategies to maximize the impact of trees in their communities. Results show moderate to strong correlations between a sample of key socio-economic parameters and trees. © 2018 IEEE.","Machine Learning; Smart Cities; Urban Development","Climate change; Economics; Forestry; Learning systems; Location; Smart city; Sustainable development; Trees (mathematics); Urban growth; Data-driven approach; Development programs; Environmental benefits; Pedestrian traffic; Socio-economic benefits; Strong correlation; Sustainability issues; Urban development; Economic and social effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063455627

These enzymes are implied to cycle through a series of nickel-based organometallic intermediates during catalysis, though identification of these intermediates remains challenging. In this work, we have developed and characterized a nickel-containing metalloprotein that models the methyl-bound organometallic intermediates proposed in the native enzymes. Using a nickel(I)-substituted azurin mutant, we demonstrate that alkyl binding occurs via nucleophilic addition of methyl iodide as a methyl donor. The paramagnetic NiIII-CH3 species initially generated can be rapidly reduced to a high-spin NiII-CH3 species in the presence of exogenous reducing agent, following a reaction sequence analogous to that proposed for ACS. These two distinct bioorganometallic species have been characterized by optical, EPR, XAS, and MCD spectroscopy, and the overall mechanism describing methyl reactivity with nickel azurin has been quantitatively modeled using global kinetic simulations. A comparison between the nickel azurin protein system and existing ACS model compounds is presented. NiIII-CH3 Az is only the second example of two-electron addition of methyl iodide to a NiI center to give an isolable species and the first to be formed in a biologically relevant system. These results highlight the divergent reactivity of nickel across the two intermediates, with implications for likely reaction mechanisms and catalytically relevant states in the native ACS enzyme. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"acetyl coenzyme A; azurin; nickel; organometallic compound; catalysis; chemistry; enzymology; gas chromatography; gene expression regulation; genetics; kinetics; magnetism; metabolism; mutation; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; spectroscopy; Acetyl Coenzyme A; Azurin; Catalysis; Chromatography, Gas; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Kinetics; Magnetic Phenomena; Mutation; Nickel; Organometallic Compounds; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Spectrum Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069890276

In this study, we explore how human interventions and climate altered the wetland's hydrological conditions and habitats, leading to changing wetland functions over time. Our interpretations are based on a mixed methodological approach combining conceptual hydrologic models, analysis of aerial photographs, local knowledge, field observations, and GIS (Geographic Information System) analyses. The results show that the combined effects of human interventions and climate have led to increased salinity in the wetland over time. As a result, the fresh and brackish water marshes have gradually been turned into open water or replaced by halophytic vegetation with profound ecological implications. Furthermore, current human activities inside the Natura 2000 area and in the surrounding areas could further impact on the water quantity and quality in the wetland, and on its sensitive ecosystems. We suggest that a more holistic understanding of the broader socio-ecological system is needed to understand the dynamics of the wetland and to achieve sustainable long-term management and conservation strategies. © 2019 by the authors.","Agriculture; Human interventions; Hydrology; Land use/land cover change; Mediterranean climate; Natura 2000; Salinity; Tourism; Vegetation; Wetland","Agriculture; Antennas; Climate change; Ecology; Hydrology; Land use; Vegetation; Human intervention; Land use/land cover change; Mediterranean climates; Natura 2000; Salinity; Tourism; Wetlands; agricultural development; anthropogenic effect; brackish water; coastal wetland; conservation management; ecotourism; freshwater environment; GIS; halophyte; land cover; land use change; marsh; Mediterranean environment; Mediterranean Water; open water; water quality; Gialova Lagoon; Greece; Messenia; Peloponnisos",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061782608

In India, it provides an individual with 32% of the total calorie and 24% of the total protein daily. This crop is mostly grown in puddled soil by transplanting, and flood irrigation is practised by farmers. Water or irrigation input to transplanted rice typically ranges from 1000 to 2000 mm depending upon the growing season, climatic condition, soil type and hydrological conditions. Facing water scarcity and climate change, reducing water requirement of this crop is a challenge. Out of 42.75 million hectare (m ha) rice area, only 25.12 m ha is under irrigation. Regarding water resources, depletion of groundwater is alarming in the north Indian states. On the other hand, it is under-utilized in eastern India. Microirrigation, i.e. sprinkler and drip methods have been used with the aim of minimizing water use and enhancing water use efficiency of rice. In addition, evidence-based scientific understandings on microirrigation for rice have been elucidated in this article. The potential of drip or sprinkler irrigation to rice on water saving as well as scientific insight and critical appraisal have been expounded on reasons of yield reduction.

The methodology for capturing intercity freight fleet operations is already available. However, urban freight activity and characteristics may be quite different from intercity freight operations. The present study thus aims to provide a generalised methodology to capture urban freight operations data relevant to emission estimates. Delhi has been selected as the case study city to illustrate the application of the proposed methodology. In order to quantify freight fleet emissions, relevant freight fleet characteristics such as age distribution, fuel distribution, fuel economy, and the number of in-use freight vehicles are established through on-field surveys. Further, special attention is paid to quantify the contribution of previously neglected external freight trips entering Delhi to the city's air pollution. Comprehensive disaggregated analysis for external freight trips terminating in Delhi and transiting through Delhi is presented. 72-hour traffic count and a 24-hour origin and destination surveys are conducted at 17 entry locations of Delhi. Based on the captured characteristics, different emission scenarios are estimated for future policy intervention in the city. The developed methodology will serve as a means of generating emission relevant freight data for various urban areas.

Their complementary efforts in adaptation to climate change are sternly important for farm productivity and income. This study evaluates factors explaining individual and multiple adoption of climate change management strategies and their differential impacts on productivity and income using a sample of 1172 smallholder farmers from Malawi and Zimbabwe. The study employs multinomial logistic regression to evaluate factors of individual and multiple adoption and regression adjustment with inverse probability weighting to evaluate impacts of the different adoption regimes on farm productivity and income. The results show that multiple adoption of innovations is mostly explained by access to key resources (credit, income and information), level of education and size of land owned by the farmer. More so, the concurrent adoption of conservation agriculture, stress adapted legume varieties and drought tolerant maize has far greater dividends on productivity and income than when considered individually.

Main inputs are soil and climate data in order to simulate model response variables such as crop yield. We investigate the effect of changing the resolution of input data on simulated crop yields at a regional scale using up to ten dynamic crop models. For these models we compared the effects of spatial input data aggregation for wheat and maize yield of two regions with contrasting climate conditions (1) Tuscany (Italy, Mediterranean climate) and (2) North Rhine Westphalia (NRW, Germany, temperate climate). Soil and climate data of 1 km resolution were aggregated to resolutions of 10, 25, 50, and 100 km by selecting the dominant soil class (and corresponding soil properties) and by arithmetic averaging, respectively. Differences in yield simulated at coarser resolutions from the yields simulated at 1 km resolution were calculated to quantify the effect of the aggregation of the input data (soil and climate data) on simulation results. The mean yield difference (bias) at the regional level was positive due to the upscaling of productive dominant soil(s) to coarser resolution. In both regions and for both crops, aggregation effects (i.e. errors in simulation of crop yields at coarser spatial resolution) due to the combined aggregation of soil and climate input data increased with decreasing resolution, whereby the aggregation error for Tuscany was larger than for North Rhine Westphalia (NRW). The average absolute percentage yield differences between grid cell yields at the coarsest resolution (100 km) compared to the finest resolution (1 km) were by about 20–30% for Tuscany and less than 15 and 20% for NRW for winter wheat and silage maize, respectively. In the Mediterranean area, the prediction errors of the simulated yields could reach up to 60% when looking at individual crop model simulations. Additionally, aggregating soil data caused larger aggregation errors in both regions than aggregating climate data. Those results suggest that a higher spatial resolution of climate and especially of soil input data are necessary in Mediterranean areas than in temperate humid regions of central Europe in order to predict reliable regional yield estimations with crop models. For generalization of these outcomes, further investigations in other sub-humid or semi-arid regions will be necessary. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Climate; Data resolution; Modelling; Regional yield; Scale; Soil","climate conditions; crop yield; data set; maize; Mediterranean environment; model; modeling; regional pattern; simulation; spatial resolution; temperate environment; wheat; Germany; Italy; North Rhine-Westphalia; Tuscany; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057881613

An environmental niche model (ENM) of 11 high-conservation-value tree species was used to assess the effectiveness of the PAN within the Caribbean island of Trinidad under future (2050s) climate conditions. Overlay analyses were conducted inside and outside of existing PANs to determine the proportions of natural and plantation (monoculture) forests. Proportions of this species group's climate space projected to be critical for conservation (combination of stable and expanding zones or ‘Z4’) that are under forest cover were also calculated. Approximately 63% of Trinidad is forested, with the majority of plantation forests located within the PAN, producing noticeable areas of cleared forest when harvested. The ENM projected a drastic reduction in climate space for this group of high-conservation-value tree species across the island. However, approximately 54% of the Z4 space was projected to occur within the PAN; and 61% of the Z4 falling outside the PAN was under forest cover. Consequently, conservation of this species group could be greatly enhanced by increasing the proportion of its Z4 climate space outside the PAN under maintained forest/secondary vegetation cover. Given the small size of small island states (SIS) (such as those in the Caribbean) relative to the macro-scale of climate change, a more effective means of managing climate-induced species loss could involve the development of regional-scale PANs rather than separate efforts of individual SIS. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","biodiversity; Caribbean; climate change; environmental niche modelling; protected areas; Small island","biodiversity; climate change; climate conditions; forest cover; modeling; nature conservation; plantation forestry; protected area; small island state; Caribbean Islands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055964478

Following the most recent drought period (2015-2018), local authorities such as the City of Cape Town are being tasked with restructuring policy to include climate change adaptation strategies to adapt more adequately and proactively to these new challenges. This paper describes an evaluation of the water governance processes required to implement Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) in Cape Town-with a specific focus on the barriers to, and opportunities for, those processes related to wastewater treatment, flood risk and the pressing issue of water scarcity. The City Blueprint Approach (CBA) was selected as the indicator assessment approach for this task. The CBA is a set of diagnostic tools comprising the Trends and Pressures Framework, the City Blueprint Framework and the Governance Capacity Framework. This was applied to Cape Town based on in-depth interviews and publicly available information. The analysis revealed that smart monitoring, community knowledge and experimentation with alternative water management technologies are important when considering uncertainties and complexities in the governance of urban water challenges. We conclude that there is potential for Cape Town to transition to a water sensitive city through learning from this experimentation and by implementing WSUD strategies that address water scarcity following the shifts in governance caused by the 2015-2018 drought. © 2019 by the authors.","Cape Town; City Blueprint Approach; Climate change adaptation; Water governance; Water scarcity; Water sensitive cities","Drought; Floods; Uncertainty analysis; Wastewater treatment; Water management; Cape Town; City blueprints; Climate change adaptation; Water governance; Water scarcity; Water-sensitive cities; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; drought stress; flood forecasting; governance approach; learning; urban design; wastewater treatment; water management; water planning; water stress; Cape Town; South Africa; Western Cape",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061139502

While this might reduce many climate change impacts, the resulting climate would not be the same as one with the same global mean temperature due to lower GHG concentrations. The primary question we consider is how long it would take to detect these differences in a hypothetical deployment. We use a 20-member ensemble of stratospheric sulfate aerosol geoengineering simulations in which SO 2 is injected at four different latitudes to maintain not just the global mean temperature, but also the interhemispheric and equator-to-pole gradients. This multiple-latitude strategy better matches the climate changes from increased GHG, while the ensemble allows us both to estimate residual differences even when they are small compared to natural variability and to estimate the statistics of variability. We first construct a linear emulator to predict the model responses for different scenarios. Under an RCP4.5 scenario in which geoengineering maintains a 1.5 °C target (providing end-of-century cooling of 1.7 °C), the projected changes in temperature, precipitation, and precipitation minus evaporation (P − E) at a grid-scale are typically small enough that in many regions the signal-to-noise ratio is still less than one at the end of this century; for example, for P − E, only 30% of the land area reaches a signal-to-noise ratio of one. These results provide some context for the projected magnitude of climate changes associated with a limited deployment of stratospheric aerosol cooling. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

This study analyzes the driving factors of freight transport carbon emissions and the effects of urbanization on freight transport carbon emissions in China. The spatial durbin model (SDM)-stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model and geographically weighted regression model (GWR)-STIRPAT model are constructed to analyze the common characteristics and regional disparity of the above effects in China. The results show that: (1) The total amount of freight carbon emissions in China has increased from 3.7352 Mt in 1988 to 96.4158 Mt in 2016. Road freight is the largest increasing sub-sector of carbon emissions in the freight transport sector. (2) Urbanization level has a positive impact on road and aviation transport carbon emissions and has a significant negative impact on railway and waterway transport carbon emissions in some provinces, but has a positive impact on their neighboring provinces. There is a significant regional disparity in multi-freight transport carbon emissions. (3) The carbon emissions of freight transport have a characteristic of “path dependence”. The population size and energy intensity have a significant impact on freight carbon emissions.

Chloroplast differentiation and activity are highly regulated by light, and several proteins involved in these processes have been characterised. Such is the case of the GOLDEN 2-LIKE (GLK) transcription factors, which induces the expression of genes related to chloroplast differentiation and photosynthesis. The tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) genome harbours two copies of this gene, SlGLK1 and SlGLK2, each with distinct expression patterns. While the former predominates in leaves, the latter is mainly expressed in fruits, precisely at the pedicel region. During tomato domestication, the selection of fruits with uniform ripening fixed the mutation Slglk2, nowadays present in most cultivated varieties, what penalised fruit metabolic composition. In this study, we investigated how SlGLK2 is regulated by light, auxin and cytokinin and determined the effect of SlGLK2 on tocopherol (vitamin E) and sugar metabolism, which are components of the fruit nutritional and industrial quality. To achieve this, transcriptional profiling and biochemical analysis were performed throughout fruit development and ripening from SlGLK2, Slglk2, SlGLK2-overexpressing genotypes, as well as from phytochrome and hormonal deficient mutants. The results revealed that SlGLK2 expression is regulated by phytochrome-mediated light perception, yet this gene can induce chloroplast differentiation even in a phytochrome-independent manner. Moreover, auxin was found to be a negative regulator of SlGLK2 expression, while SlGLK2 enhances cytokinin responsiveness. Additionally, SlGLK2 enhanced chlorophyll content in immature green fruits, leading to an increment in tocopherol level in ripe fruits. Finally, SlGLK2 overexpression resulted in higher total soluble solid content, possibly by the regulation of sugar metabolism enzyme-encoding genes. The results obtained here shed light on the regulatory network that interconnects SlGLK2, phytohormones and light signal, promoting the plastidial activity and consequently, influencing the quality of tomato fruit. © 2019 Lupi et al.

In current regulatory applications, a regional-scale air quality model is applied for a base year and a future year with reduced emissions using the same meteorological conditions as those in the base year. Because of the stochastic nature of the atmosphere, the same meteorological conditions would not prevail in the future year. Therefore, we use multi-decadal observations to develop a new method for estimating the confidence bounds for the future ozone design value (based on the 4th highest value in the daily maximum 8-hr ozone concentration time series, DM8HR) for each emission loading scenario along with the probability of the design value exceeding a given ozone threshold concentration at all monitoring sites in the contiguous United States. To this end, we spectrally decompose the observed DM8HR ozone time series covering the period from 1981 to 2014 using the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter and examine the variability in the relative strengths of the short-term variations (induced by synoptic-scale weather fluctuations; referred to as synoptic component, SY) and the long-term component (dictated by changes in emissions, seasonality and other slow-changing processes such as climate change; referred to as baseline component, BL). Results indicate that combining the projected change in the ozone baseline level with the adjusted synoptic forcing in historical ozone observations enables us to provide a probabilistic assessment of the efficacy of a selected emissions control strategy in complying with the ozone standard in future years. In addition, attainment demonstration is illustrated with a real-world application of the proposed methodology by using air quality model simulations, thereby helping build confidence in the use of regional-scale air quality models for supporting regulatory policies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality models; Attainment demonstration; Emission control strategies; Ozone; Probability of exceeding the standard; Time series analysis","Air quality; Climate change; Computational complexity; Emission control; Ozone; Stochastic systems; Time series analysis; Air quality models; Air quality monitoring; Control strategies; Meteorological condition; Probabilistic assessments; Regulatory applications; Slow-changing process; Threshold concentrations; Quality control; ozone; air quality; atmospheric modeling; climate change; concentration (composition); decadal variation; emission control; long-term change; ozone; probability; time series analysis; weather; air monitoring; air pollution control; air quality standard; Article; climate change; control strategy; decomposition; mental capacity; meteorology; priority journal; simulation; time series analysis; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057069130

As a case study, we conduct a hotspot analysis of four sample projects from a single company in the wind energy sector. Calculated energy payback times vary between 8.1 and 12.5 months, and greenhouse gas intensities vary between 11.7 and 18.3 g CO2-e/kWh across the four projects. Impacts in the country of installation and production are mainly caused by the electricity, metal and concrete sectors. The supply chain dominates the overall impacts, with supplier tiers 2 to 4 causing the largest share of greenhouse gas emissions. The results allow management to better prioritize actions to manage and alleviate global impacts more effectively.

The photosynthetic efficiency of the plants through the emission of fluorescence of PSII, the degree of oxidative stress (enzymatic activities related to the ascorbate-glutathione cycle), the redox state (reduced and oxidized forms of ascorbate and glutathione) and the concentration of malondialdehyde have been evaluated. During the development period of the plants, Madrid had higher levels of NO2 and SO2 than Ciudad Real. The greater degree of air pollution suffered by Madrid plants was reflected on a lower photosynthetic efficiency and a greater degree of oxidative stress. In addition, NADPH oxidase activity and H2O2 levels in pollen from Madrid were significantly higher, suggesting a likely higher allergenic capacity of this pollen associated to a higher air pollution. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS","Air pollution; Allergy; Antioxidant systems; Lolium perenne; Oxidative stress; Pollen","allergen; ascorbic acid; chlorophyll; glutathione; malonaldehyde; air pollutant; air pollution; drug effect; immunology; Lolium; metabolism; oxidative stress; pharmacology; photosynthesis; pollen; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Allergens; Ascorbic Acid; Chlorophyll; Glutathione; Lolium; Malondialdehyde; Oxidative Stress; Photosynthesis; Pollen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059157462

PM2.5 concentrations for most of the provinces/cities remained stable from 2001 to 2012; however, following the issue of the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (APPCAP) by the central government of China, a dramatic decrease in PM2.5 concentrations from 2013 to 2017 occurred. Premature mortality caused by PM2.5 dropped from 1,078,800 in 2014 to 962,900 in 2017. The PM2.5 caused 17-year average mortality ranges from 3800 in Hainan Province to 124,800 in Henan Province. The health cost benefits gained by the reduction of PM2.5 pollution amounted to US $193,800 in 2017 (compared to the costs due to PM2.5 concentrations in 2013), amounting to 1.58% of the total national GDP. The impacts of urbanization on PM2.5 concentration and mortality are analyzed. The PM2.5 concentration and its induced mortality density in dense urban areas are much higher than those in rural areas. The aggravation of PM2.5 associated premature mortality in urban areas is mainly due to the larger amount of emissions and to urban migration, and 6500 deaths in 2014 could have been avoided were the population ratios in dense-urban/normal-urban/rural areas to be reversed to the ones in 2001.

The results showed that the descriptions of three icing events in southern China by the TLIT were consistent with the actual observational data, and the icing thickness differences were less than 2 mm. The spatial distribution of annual icing days and icing thickness calculated using meteorological observation station icing data (OIT) and the TLIT data had a similar pattern, with small differences in the numerical values. A rotated empirical orthogonal function (REOF) decomposition was conducted for 67 transmission line icing events. It was found that the spatial distributions of the first three characteristic vectors of the TLIT and OIT data were similar, and the correlation coefficients for the time coefficients of the first three characteristic vectors were 0.801, -0.443, and 0.576, respectively.

This paper analyzes data of 28 selected European countries dating from 2009 to 2013 to study the effects of the undesirable output to the energy efficiency ranking. The variables in the model are the input variables: labor force, real capital stock, and energy consumption and the output variable is the undesirable output of fossil fuel CO 2 emissions. In the model, the carryover intermediate activity is real gross domestic product. After the Paris Protocol formally replaced the Kyoto Protocol in 2015, the emphasis of this study is on the future state’s pursuit of economic growth, the gross domestic product as a variable in terms of intertemporal efficiency and using CO 2 as a variable of undesirable output to analyze the relationship between national economic development and the greenhouse gas emissions for getting a policy indicator of the environmental protection and economic development. © The Author(s) 2018.","CO 2 emission; dynamic data envelopment analysis; gross domestic product; intertemporal efficiency; Undesirable output","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Data envelopment analysis; Economic analysis; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; International law; CO2 emission reduction; CO2 emissions; Dynamic data; Economic development; European Union countries; Gross domestic product growths; Gross domestic products; Undesirable output; Economic and social effects; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; energy efficiency; European Union; fossil fuel; Gross Domestic Product; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052304520

The accurate emission accounts of cities provide robust and solid data support for further emission analysis as well as the local low-carbon policy making. Restricted by the data and method lacking, there is a relative lag in city-level emission accounts. Thus, this study attempts to build an investigation-based GHG emission inventory framework for cities. We include CO2, CH4, N2O, and SF6 emissions from five sources: energy activity, industrial processes/product use, agriculture, land use change/forestry, and waste disposal. This study then uses Baoding as a case study to analyse its emission characteristics. Baoding is a low-carbon pilot city in China, which is a core and crucial city in Jing-Jin-Ji area. It is also the origin of the recently established Xiongan New Area, which has great strategic development significance. The results show that energy activity is the highest emission source followed by waste disposal processes in Baoding. Emissions induced by electricity input that brought from other provinces or cities account for another considerable emission proportion as well. Moreover, agricultural activity, which is a pillar industry in Baoding, contributes the most to methane emissions.

Krygowskiego 10, Poznan, 61-680, Poland","Air pollution is the single largest environmental health risk. It significantly impacts human life and the condition of ecosystems. One type of dangerous pollutant is particulate matter (PM). All EU countries, especially Poland, should take intensive actions to achieve the necessary standards of air quality. These actions should be aimed at reducing emissions on the one hand, and on the other, at reducing the PM concentrations in the air. To achieve this, identification of the factors influencing air pollution is needed. In this study, the landscape pattern, climate and emissions around PM monitoring points were recognized. Climate factors, particularly wind speed, prove to be most important for PM pollution. In addition, the landscape pattern modifies the concentration significantly, especially in the case of PM2.5. The presence in the landscape of green areas with a large surface and complex shape is connected to the lesser concentration of PM. The importance of emissions, although statistically significant, was rather small. In particular, the relationship between the distance to large point sources and PM concentration was not demonstrated, meaning that the pollution from high chimneys is strongly dispersed and does not affect the concentrations of PM in their vicinity. It is concluded that the landscape indicators provide new information to explain the PM concentration and that it is very important to shape the landscape with consideration of green areas as a pollutant filter. Taking into account the green areas together with pollution sources in spatial planning can significantly support the effectiveness of air protection, and at the same time, can increase the comfort of life by providing a whole range of ecosystem services, both regulating and cultural. The landscape approach best suits the needs of spatial planning, especially in cities where the highest anthropogenic pressure and increased demand for ecosystem services are evident. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cities; Ecosystem services; Green urban areas; Landscape metrics; Particulate pollution","Ecosystems; Health risks; Urban planning; Wind; Cities; Ecosystem services; Landscape metrics; Particulate pollution; Urban areas; Air quality; atmospheric pollution; climate conditions; ecosystem service; environmental factor; environmental indicator; greenspace; landscape structure; particulate matter; pollutant source; urban pollution; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054291910

Two indicators, the wind energy exploitation rate and the growing trend, are defined to represent onshore wind use level by country. The wind energy exploitation rate (ER) is the ratio of current installed capacity to technical potential, and growing trend (Tr) is the linear slope of installed capacity depended on GDP per capita. Non–linear functions are used to fit the average curve of ER and Tr and divide them to 5 and 3 grades. According to these classifications, we calculate the new installed capacity and associated investment for countries that are now in lower ER grade to reach the world average level in 2030. Three main conclusions are drawn from the results. (1) Africa is the poorest wind power developed region over the world, where 34 countries still not utilize their wind power. Europe is the best wind power developed region, where 60% of the countries are in high to very high ER grades. Polarization is found in Asia and Central America and the Caribbean, where there are many countries with higher and lower ER while few in normal level. (2) The total new installed onshore wind capacity and the associated investment are 1626.7 [1448.0–1828.5] GW and 3257.2 [2899.9–3661.4] billion USD for 90 countries with ER now in low to zero grades to reach the world average level in 2030, in which 80 non–Annex I countries account for 339.2 [301.2–383.4] GW and 754.3 [669.8–852.2] billion USD. It could help evaluate whether a country's wind investment plan is sufficient to catch up with the world average level. (3) Most countries in Middle East, Africa and Asia need to increase investment to keep their ER with world average level, in which there are 13 non–Annex I countries in both low Tr and low to very low ER grades. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Financial investment; Installed wind capacity; Wind use level","Developing countries; Greenhouse gases; Wind power; Developed regions; Energy generations; Financial investments; Installed capacity; Technical potential; Wind capacity; Wind energy development; Wind energy exploitation; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057621574

Here, we aim to 1) evaluate the plant richness patterns in Inner Asian drylands; 2) compare the relative importance of contemporary environment, historical climate, vegetation changes, and mid-domain effect (MDE); and 3) explore whether the dominant drivers of species richness differ across growth forms (woody vs herbaceous) and range sizes (common vs rare). Distribution data and growth forms of 13 248 seed plants were compiled from literature and species range sizes were estimated. Generalized linear models and hierarchical partitioning were used to evaluate the relative contribution of different factors. We found that habitat heterogeneity strongly affected both woody and herbaceous species. Precipitation, climate change since the mid-Holocene and climate seasonality dominated herbaceous richness patterns, while climate change since the Last Glacial Maximum dominated woody richness patterns. Rare species richness was strongly correlated with precipitation, habitat heterogeneity and historical climatic changes, while common species richness was strongly correlated with MDE (woody) or climate seasonality (herbaceous). Temperature had little effects on the species richness patterns of all groups. This study represents the first evaluation of the large-scale patterns of plant species richness in the Inner Asian drylands. Our results suggest that increasing water deficit due to anthropogenic activities combined with future global warming may increase the extinction risk of many grassland species. Rare species (both herbaceous and woody) may face severe challenges in the future due to increased habitat destruction caused by urbanization and resource exploitation. Overall, our findings indicate that the hypotheses on species richness patterns based on woody plants alone can be insufficient to explain the richness patterns of herbaceous species. © 2018 The Authors","drylands; herbaceous diversity; plant richness patterns","climate change; climate variation; desert; environmental effect; exploitation; extinction risk; forest ecosystem; global warming; grassland; growth form; herb; heterogeneity; human activity; Last Glacial Maximum; mountain region; precipitation (climatology); Quaternary; seasonality; species diversity; species richness; Asia; Spermatophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052403110

With the Revitalizing Old Industrial Base of Northeast China strategy, Northeast China has been a typical developing region with rapid industrialization and urbanization accompanied by substantial energy consumption and carbon emissions. Therefore, northeastern Chinese cities should play an important role in regional low-carbon developments. This study presents several improvements to the previous method to improve the accuracy of the results. Using the modified method, for the first time, we compile carbon emission inventories for 30 cities in Northeast China based on fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes. The results indicate that Anshan emitted the most carbon emissions annually, followed by Benxi and the vice-provincial cities (including Changchun, Shenyang, Dalian and Harbin). In 2012, the total carbon emissions of the 30 cities amounted to 973.95 million tonnes, accounting for 9.71% and 2.75% of national and global carbon emissions, respectively. Most of the CO2 emissions of these cities were from the ‘nonmetal and metal industry’ and ‘energy production and supply’. Raw coal was the primary source of carbon emissions in Northeast China, and industrial processes also played a significant role in determining carbon emissions. Additionally, both the average per capita carbon emissions and carbon emission intensity in the 30 cities were higher than the national levels. According to the differences in carbon emissions characteristics, we present several policy recommendations for carbon mitigation for northeastern Chinese cities. This study provides consistent and comparable spatial-temporal city-level emission database for further research on relationships between economic development and environmental protection in Northeast China. Simultaneously, this study provides practical reference values for other developing regions throughout the world to create low-carbon roadmaps. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Emission intensity; Low-carbon developments; Northeastern Chinese cities; Per capita emissions","Carbon; Climate change; Coal combustion; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Carbon emissions; Chinese cities; Emission intensity; Low carbon; Per capita; Industrial emissions; carbon emission; economic development; emission control; environmental economics; environmental protection; industrial technology; pollution policy; spatiotemporal analysis; Anshan; Benxi; Changchun; China; Dalian; Harbin; Heilongjiang; Jilin; Liaoning; Shenyang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058548633

However, the bromide-rich perovskite, such as CsPbBr3, always suffer from a low phase-purity and poor morphology synthesized by traditional two-step deposition route. Herein, we demonstrate a facile multistep spin-coating strategy to fabricate high-quality CsPbBr3 films on the low-temperature processed compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) electron transport layer (ETL) of the carbon-based PSCs. As-prepared films exhibit more homogeneous with higher CsPbBr3-phase purity and larger average grain sizes up to 1 µm, compared to those prepared through traditional two-step deposition process. The champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the planar CsPbBr3 PSC is boosted from 7.05% to 8.12%, getting an increase by 15.2%, due to the increased crystallinity and light-harvesting ability as well as reduced trap states of the CsPbBr3 film. To further enhance the device performance, a SnO2 thin layer with much higher carrier mobility than TiO2 is introduced to passivate the c-TiO2 ETL. It is found that the SnO2 layer can not only improve the surface morphology of the ETL, but also reduce the current shunting pathways in the c-TiO2. The TiO2/SnO2 bilayered ETL possesses a superior electron extraction capability, beneficial to the charge transport and suppression of the interfacial trap-assisted recombination. The best-performing TiO2/SnO2-based CsPbBr3 PSC delivers an excellent fill factor of 0.817 and a high PCE of 8.79%, which is the highest efficiency for planar CsPbBr3 PSCs reported to date. More importantly, the unencapsulated all-inorganic PSCs show a promising humidity and thermal stability with no decline in efficiency when stored in ambient air at room temperature (25 °C) for over 1000 h and 60 °C for one month, respectively.

Higher IPTV may increase a population's niche breath and benefit interspecies competition under a resource-limited environment, thus affecting the ability of a species to move into novel habitats. However, the reciprocal influences of variation in environmental conditions and phenotypic trait expression in spreading plant populations are not clearly defined. We propose that during invasion, IPTV and its relative change in response to key resource enrichment may increase with the resource deficit of invaded sites, and that this relationship may facilitate plant invasions into resource-limited environments. We analyzed the invasion trend, IPTV and its response to water enrichment, and moisture variability among populations of an annual grass Brachypodium hybridum in California, United States. We incorporated a genotyping-by-sequencing approach, a common garden experiment that had two water level treatments, and public plant and climate databases. Our hypothesis was supported by the observation that for populations that invaded sites with higher spring moisture deficit, both their seed biomass IPTV (for the water-enriched treatment only) and relative change of the IPTV across water treatments were larger when examined in the common garden experiment.

However, behind this economic success, the country also faces serious challenges, including pressures to reduce emissions and to address imbalances in its growth. Increasing attention is thus being paid to the task of exploring the relationship between income inequality and CO2 emissions. The majority of previous studies have engaged with this question on the basis of conventional inequality measurements, neglecting the use of indexes that explicitly take into account spatial effects. In this paper, we employed two measures, the Gini coefficient and Global Moran's I, in order to estimate income inequality from non-spatial and spatial perspectives, using income data for 403 prefecture-level cities. Under the framework of Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis, we investigated how the level of income distribution within 30 Chinese provinces influenced that province's CO2 emissions, using panel data from 1996 to 2014 to estimate both the Gini coefficient and Global Moran's I. The empirical results show that income growth increased China's CO2 emissions during the study period, but that an inverted U-shaped relationship existed between income and emissions, thereby confirming the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis. The continuously widening income gap, and especially the uneven spatial distribution of income, can thus be expected to deteriorate environmental quality and increase CO2 emissions. The effect of the self-reinforcing agglomeration of income on emissions was clearly evident. Other control factors were also shown to maintain a positive relation with CO2 emissions. Our results shed new light on the relationship between income inequality and CO2 emissions and provide support for policy makers in tackling the dual tasks of income redistribution and emissions mitigation. A more equitable income distribution, our findings suggest, may exert positive effects in relation to the mitigation of CO2 emissions in China. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Gini; Global Moran's I; Panel regression model","Carbon dioxide; Regression analysis; CO2 emissions; Emissions mitigation; Environmental kuznets curve hypothesis; Environmental quality; Gini; Income distribution; Mitigation of co2; Regression model; Economic analysis; agglomeration; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; environmental quality; equity; income distribution; Kuznets curve; numerical method; panel data; spatial distribution; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057307749

The ±30% and ±50% perturbations of base values were used as the ranges of parameter variation, and local fertilization and irrigation managements were considered. Results showed that the influential parameters were the same under different environmental conditions, but their orders were often different. Climate conditions had obvious influence on the sensitivity index of several parameters (e.g. RGRLMX, WGRMX and SPGF). In particular, the sensitivity index of RGRLMX was larger under cold climate than under warm climate. Differences also exist for parameter sensitivity of early and late rice in the same site. The CO2 concentration did not have much influence on the results of sensitivity analysis. The range of parameter variation affected the stability of sensitivity analysis results, but the main conclusions were consistent between the results obtained from the ±30% perturbation and those obtained the ±50% perturbation in this study.

The total nitrogen (TN) removal was significantly higher in aerated VFCWs (91.31%–93.91%) compared with non-aerated VFCWs (12.22%–53.92%), with the highest removal rate in system VI filled with fly-ash brick. Nitrification/denitrification was the main N sink in aerated VFCWs accounting for 36.79%–55.44%, while media storage (8.47%–48.64%) dominated in non-aerated systems because of nitrification limitation. &lt;16% of the TN removal was uptake by plants, and N2O emission contributed about 0.08%–0.39%.

The infrared (IR) instruments generally collect band averaged radiance which are usually different from the RT codes simulated spectral one. Although IR band RTE is widely used, the effects of substituting the band-averaged RTE for the corresponding spectral one for those broadband observations (e.g., the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) thermal IR bands) have not been evaluated. In this paper, mathematical analysis and numerical experiments have been conducted to clarify the uncertainties arising from this substitution treatment. Firstly, we present the IR spectral RTE in a concise manner, and then, based on the law of conservation of energy and the integral assumption, a detailed mathematical derivation of the commonly-used IR band RTE has been derived. The significant improvement of the derivation is the validation of the integral assumption, which states that over a small spectral region, the integral of a product is approximately equal to the product of integrals. In the IR spectral region, taking the most significant term of the IR band RTE as an example (i.e., the surface emission term), we confirmed that, for the satellite collected IR signals emitted from the Earth's surface, over any bandwidth at any band-location and under any instrument spectral response function (SRF), the integral approximation (IA) is a well-founded approximation and thus the IR band RTEs are good approximations for the corresponding spectral ones. Furthermore, in the ST, especially the land ST, product validation investigations, the ST errors introduced by the substituting treatment are negligible and do not need to be taken into consideration. © 2019 by the authors.","Attenuated surface-leaving radiance; Bandwidth; IR band RTE; IR spectral RTE; Lambertian reflection assumption; Spectral response function; Surface temperature; Surface-leaving radiance","Bandwidth; Radiative transfer; Radiometers; Surface properties; Uncertainty analysis; Attenuated surface-leaving radiance; IR bands; Lambertian reflection; Spectral response functions; Surface temperatures; Atmospheric temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061364427

These drivers are likely to interact, but their effects are frequently quantified independently. Here, we report the results of a 13-year study of temperate woodland birds in south-eastern Australia to quantify how different-sized birds respond to the interacting effects of: (a) short-term weather (rainfall and temperature in the 12 months preceding our surveys), (b) long-term climate (average rainfall and maximum and minimum temperatures over the period 1970–2014), and (c) broad structural forms of vegetation (old-growth woodland, regrowth woodland, and restoration plantings). We uncovered significant interactions between bird body size, vegetation type, climate, and weather. High short-term rainfall was associated with decreased occurrence of large birds in old-growth and regrowth woodland, but not in restoration plantings. Conversely, small bird occurrence peaked in wet years, but this effect was most pronounced in locations with a history of high rainfall, and was actually reversed (peak occurrence in dry years) in restoration plantings in dry climates. The occurrence of small birds was depressed—and large birds elevated—in hot years, except in restoration plantings which supported few large birds under these circumstances. Our investigation suggests that different mechanisms may underpin contrasting responses of small and large birds to the interacting effects of climate, weather, and vegetation type. A diversity of vegetation cover is needed across a landscape to promote the occurrence of different-sized bird species in agriculture-dominated landscapes, particularly under variable weather conditions. Climate change is predicted to lead to widespread drying of our study region, and restoration plantings—especially currently climatically wet areas—may become critically important for conserving bird species, particularly small-bodied taxa. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","birds; climate change; rainfall and temperature effects on biodiversity; revegetation; south-eastern Australia; weather","biodiversity; bird; body size; climate change; climate effect; endangered species; long-term change; rainfall; revegetation; temperature effect; vegetation type; woodland; Australia; Aves; animal; bird; body size; climate; climate change; forest; forestry; New South Wales; physiology; weather; Animals; Birds; Body Size; Climate; Climate Change; Forestry; Forests; New South Wales; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058386509

The study evaluates the impact of this mitigation strategy on the existing supply chains published by Lim and Biswas. The experience of a local palm oil mill installed with the KUBOTA biogas trapping system was incorporated into a typical 60 metric tonne per hour palm oil mill for effluent treatment. This allowed us to assess the changes in sustainability performance of the whole crude palm oil supply chain using the Palm Oil Sustainability Assessment (POSA) framework. Installing the biogas trapping system increased waste recycling and reuse percentage of the mill from 81.81% to 99.99% and the energy ratio (energy output/fossil fuel and biomass energy input) from 2.45 to 2.56; and reduced the Greenhouse Gas emission of the supply chain from 0.814 tonne CO2eq to 0.196 tonne CO2eq per tonne of Crude Palm Oil. This system could also potentially increase the mill's annual revenue by 2.3%, while sacrificing the sustainability performance of other economic indicators (i.e., a further 3% negative deviation of actual growth rate from sustainable growth rate).

Egg-burying reptiles that exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, such as critically endangered hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), are particularly vulnerable to changes in thermal regimes because nest temperatures affect offspring sex, fitness, and survival. It is unclear whether hawksbills possess sufficient behavioral plasticity of nesting traits (i.e., redistribution of nesting range, shift in nesting phenology, changes in nest-site selection, and adjustment of nest depth) to persist within their climatic niche or whether accelerated changes in thermal conditions of nesting beaches will outpace phenotypic adaption and require human intervention. For these reasons, we estimated sex ratios and physical condition of hatchling hawksbills under natural and manipulated conditions and generated and analyzed thermal profiles of hawksbill nest environments within highly threatened mangrove ecosystems at Bahía de Jiquilisco, El Salvador, and Estero Padre Ramos, Nicaragua. Hawksbill clutches protected in situ at both sites incubated at higher temperatures, yielded lower hatching success, produced a higher percentage of female hatchlings, and produced less fit offspring than clutches relocated to hatcheries. We detected cooler sand temperatures in woody vegetation (i.e., coastal forest and small-scale plantations of fruit trees) and hatcheries than in other monitored nest environments, with higher temperatures at the deeper depth. Our findings indicate that mangrove ecosystems present a number of biophysical (e.g., insular nesting beaches and shallow water table) and human-induced (e.g., physical barriers and deforestation) constraints that, when coupled with the unique life history of hawksbills in this region, may limit behavioral compensatory responses by the species to projected temperature increases at nesting beaches. We contend that egg relocation can contribute significantly to recovery efforts in a changing climate under appropriate circumstances. © 2019 The Authors.

This study sought to determine net GWP for three semiarid cropping systems under no-tillage management in the northern Great Plains of North America: spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-fallow (SW-F), continuous spring wheat (CSW) and spring wheat-safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.)-rye (Secale cereale L.) (SW-S-R). Management records, coupled with published carbon dioxide (CO2) emission estimates, were used to determine emissions from production inputs and field operations. Static chamber methodology was used to measure soil-atmosphere methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes over a 3-year period and changes in profile soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks were determined over 18 years. Carbon dioxide emissions associated with production inputs and field operations were greatest for CSW, intermediate for SW-S-R and lowest for SW-F. All cropping systems were minor CH4 sinks (≤0.5 kg CH4-C ha-1 yr-1) and moderate N2O sources (1.0 to 2.8 kg N2O-N ha-1 yr-1). No differences in SOC stocks were observed among cropping systems (P = 0.78), nor did SOC stocks change significantly from baseline conditions (P = 0.82). Summing across factors, net GWP was positive for SW-F and CSW, implying net greenhouse gas (GHG) emission to the atmosphere, while net GWP for SW-S-R was negative, implying net GHG uptake. Net GWP, however, did not differ among cropping systems (P = 0.17). Management practices that concurrently improve N use efficiency and increase SOC stocks are needed for semiarid cropping systems to be net GHG sinks. © 2019 by the authors.","GRACEnet; Nitrous oxide; Soil organic carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079743512

The impact of various energy policies on the energy system in Hebei Province was analysed by considering four scenarios: a Reference Scenario (REF), Industrial Structure Optimization Scenario (ISO), Terminal Consumption Structure Optimization Scenario (TOS) and Low-carbon Development Scenario (LCD). By designing strategic policies from the perspective of industrial adjustment, aggressive energy structure policies and measures, such as the ISO and the TOS, and even more aggressive options, such as the LCD, where the percentage of cleaner alternative energy sources has been further increased, it has been indicated that energy consumption will have increased from 321.618 million tonnes of coal equivalent (Mtce) in 2015 to 784.88 Mtce in 2050 in the REF, with a corresponding increase in GHG emissions from 920.56 million metric tonnes (Mt) to 2262.81 Mt. In contrast, the more aggressive policies and strategies involved in the LCD, which combines the ISO with the policy-oriented TOS, can lower energy consumption by 50.82% and CO 2 emissions by 64.26%. The results shed light on whether and how these scenarios can shape the energy-carbon emission reduction trajectories and develop the low-carbon pathways in Hebei Province. © 2019 by the authors.","Bottom-up approach; Carbon emission; Energy consumption; Long-range Energy Alternative Planning (LEAP); Scenario analysis","Carbon; Emission control; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Structural optimization; Alternative energy source; Bottom up approach; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; Long-range Energy Alternative Planning (LEAP); Low-carbon development; Scenario analysis; Scenario-based analysis; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061989551

The reservoirs of 2 nd member are distributed in the middle part of the stratum. The reservoir quality is controlled by supergene karst and the distribution of mound-shoal complex. The bedded elongated isolated algal framework solution-cave and the residual “grape-lace” cave, which are partially filled with multi-stage dolosparite, constituted the main reservoir space of the 2 nd member. There is no asphalt distribution in the pores. The pore connectivity is poor, and the porosity and permeability of the reservoir is relatively low. The reservoirs of 4 th member were distributed in the upper and top part of the stratum. The reservoir quality is controlled by burial dissolution and the distribution of mound-shoal complex. The bedded algal framework solution-pores or caves, intercrystalline pores and intercrystalline dissolved pores constituted the main reservoir space of the 4 th member. It's partially filled with asphalt and quartz, without any dolosparite fillings in the pores and caves. The pore connectivity is good. Most of the 4 th member reservoirs had medium-low porosity and low permeability, and, locally, medium-high porosity and medium permeability. Affected by the development of mound-shoal complex and heterogeneous dissolution, the platform margin along Ningqiang, Guangyuan, Jiange and Langzhong is the most favorable region for reservoir development.

However, the effect of biochar on the biodegradation of petroleum hydrocarbons and electricity generation in soil microbial fuel cells (MFCs) remains unclear. Here, three biochars respectively derived from poultry (chicken manure, CB), agriculture (wheat straw, SB) and forestry industries (wood sawdust, WB) were investigated after 223 days of amendment. Consequently, high removal for alkanes was in CB with the mineral nutrition and phosphorus while aromatics were in SB with the most N content and the highest molecular polarity. The lowest removal efficiency of total petroleum hydrocarbons was observed in WB with the highest surface area, whereas the most charge was obtained. The different performance of soil MFCs was due to physicochemical properties of biochar and colonized microbial communities of bacteria and archaea. The abundance of Actinotalea increased by 144–263% in SB and CB while that of Desulfatitalea distinctly increased in WB.

To repair these buried assets, ultraviolet (UV) light cured-in-place-pipes (CIPP) are being installed. Chemical emission and residual material left behind from the installation process was investigated in New York and Virginia, USA. Samples of an uncured resin tube and field-cured styrene-based resin CIPPs were collected and analyzed. Also collected were air and water samples before, during, and after installations. Chemicals were emitted into air because of the installation and curing processes. Particulates emitted into the air, water, and soil contained fiberglass, polymer, and contaminants, some of which are regulated by state-level water quality standards. The uncured resin tube contained more than 70 chemical compounds, and 19 were confirmed with analytical standards. Compounds included known and suspected carcinogens, endocrine disrupting compounds, hazardous air pollutants, and other compounds with little aquatic toxicity data available. Compounds (14 of 19 confirmed) were extracted from the newly installed CIPPs, and 11 were found in water samples. Aqueous styrene (2.31 mg/L), dibutyl phthalate (12.5 μg/L), and phenol (16.7 μg/L) levels exceeded the most stringent state water quality standards chosen in this study. Styrene was the only compound that was found to have exceed a 48 h aquatic toxicity threshold. Newly installed CIPPs contained a significant amount volatile material (1.0 to > 9.0 wt%).

Using a quasi-experimental approach, we find that the Clean Air Action significantly reduced the manufacturing output in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, which was subject to the most stringent air pollution regulation, by 6.7% during its first two years of implementation. The losses add up to 408.7 billion yuan (2013 price level), equal to 6.5% of the regional GDP in 2013. The action slowed the growth of manufacturing in Hebei and Tianjin by 9.6% and 5.9%, respectively. We find no evidence that it caused a significant reduction of manufacturing output in Beijing. The heterogeneous treatment effects can be explained by the difference in industrial structure between Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei. Our analysis empirically suggests that the Clean Air Action helped drive the structural change of the Chinese economy by substantially suppressing “dirty” manufacturing sectors. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Economic cost; Environmental regulation; Porter Hypothesis; Quasi-experiment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054769335

An appropriate clean solid fuel to reduce residential emissions is urgently needed. This study evaluates the reduction in pollutant emissions achieved by carbonized solid fuels in residential cooking practice. Four biochar samples, three semi-coke briquette samples and their raw materials were tested in a typical cooking stove. These carbonized samples showed higher thermal efficiencies and lower particulate matter (PM) emission factors (EFs) than their raw material samples. Owing to distilled volatile matter during carbonization treatment, average energy delivered-based PM 2.5 EFs were 10 ± 5 mg/kJ (carbonized) and 50 ± 28 mg/kJ (raw) for the biomass and 0.33 ± 0.04 mg/kJ (carbonized) and 3.0 ± 1.3 mg/kJ (raw) for the coal samples. The energy delivered-based EFs of organic carbon, elemental carbon, and 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons extracted from PM 2.5 samples from carbonized fuels were reduced by 97 ± 1%, 93 ± 3%, and 97 ± 2%, respectively, for the tested biomass samples, and those for the tested coal samples were 96 ± 1%, 90 ± 6%, and 98 ± 2%, respectively. Average EFs of benzo[a]pyrene equivalent carcinogenic potency for individual polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were reduced 95 ± 3% to ~0.51 μg/kJ (carbonized) from ~19.6 μg/kJ (raw). Furthermore, the average ratio of volatile organic compounds contained in PM 2.5 samples was also reduced from 38.8 ± 5.4% to 7.1 ± 3.9%. These results suggest that carbonized solid fuels exhibit better performance in reducing carcinogenic potency and pollutants, most of which are highly correlated with the volatile matter content of the fuel. Switching from raw solid fuel to carbonized solid fuel will help to reduce pollutant emissions from household combustion and achieve both environmental benefits and health benefits for household residents. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbonization treatment; Carcinogenic potency; Clean fuels; Household combustion; Particle emission; Pollution control","Coal carbonization; Coal combustion; Housing; Hydrocarbons; Indoor air pollution; Mineral oils; Organic carbon; Pollution control; Pyrene; Stoves; Volatile organic compounds; Air pollutant emission; Carcinogenic potency; Clean fuel; Environmental benefits; Particle emissions; Particulate matter emissions; Residential emissions; Solid fuel combustion; Fuels; antimony; arsenic; benzo[a]pyrene derivative; biochar; cadmium; carbonized fuel; charcoal; coal; coke briquette; copper; elemental carbon; fuel; gold; lead; lignite; nickel; organic carbon; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; raw solid fuel; selenium; unclassified drug; volatile agent; carbon; coal; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; volatile organic compound; alternative fuel; atmospheric pollution; carcinogen; cooking appliance; emission control; particulate matter; residential energy; air pollution control; Article; biomass; bituminous; carbonization; carcinogenicity; combustion; controlled study; cooking; energy; environmental health; exhaust gas; extraction; household; household cooking stove; material state; particulate matter; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); residential home; sawdust; thermal analysis; thermal efficiency; air pollutant; analysis; chemistry; cooking; devices; energy resource; indoor air pollution; particle size; prevention and control; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Biomass; Carbon; Coal; Cooking; Energy-Generating Resources; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053031037

Simultaneous temperature and OH intensity observations from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument onboard the TIMED satellite and wind measurement by a Doppler meteor radar were used to characterize the environment of the bore propagation. A large mesospheric inversion layer was identified from the temperature measured by the SABER instrument. The observed winds in the height range of the OH layer were almost orthogonal to the propagation direction of the mesospheric bore. Both hydraulic jump theory and observations showed that the duct initially shrank followed by an expansion. The duct mainly existed in the OH layer but was weak in the OI layer, as revealed by the double-layer imaging and satellite observations. The horizontal wavelengths and observed phase speeds of the bore packet decreased as the duct shrank and increased as the duct expanded. The intensity amplitude of the bore packet decreased slowly and then decreased sharply after dissipation. With the variation of the depth of the duct, the bore may have leak out of the duct.

This paper adopts a multi-regional, general equilibrium model to simulate linkages between China's national ETS and the EU ETS and analyze the emissions, energy and economic impacts of such linkages. In order to study the role of linking in further increasing mitigation ambitions of China and the EU, and compare unlimited linkage with limited linkage, the paper further develops scenarios in which both China and the EU set higher ambition cap for their ETSs and unlimited or limited linkage is established between the two ETSs. The results indicate that unlimited linking can effectively promote the emission reduction ambitions of both China and the EU without inducing additional welfare losses to them. When both China and the EU set more intensified targets for ETS sectors and undertake additional 169 million tons carbon reductions, unlimited linking can make China's welfare remain basically unchanged and the EU's welfare increase by 0.29%, compared to implementing ETS independently under original reduction targets. However, unlimited linking has adverse effects on the competitiveness of China's energy intensive sectors and the development of EU's renewable energy. Compared to unlimited linking, limited linking effectively reduces these adverse effects. The paper concludes that China's national ETS and the EU ETS can establish a linkage to further increase their ambitions, while at the same time use import quotas to limit the permits that can be traded to reduce the negative impacts of linking on the two systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","CGE model; China’ national ETS; EU ETS; Linking","Climate change; Commerce; Emission control; Gas emissions; International cooperation; CGE model; Emission reduction; Emission trading systems; Energy-intensive sectors; General equilibrium models; Linking; Reduction targets; Renewable energies; Economic and social effects; climate change; competitiveness; economic impact; emission control; emissions trading; European Union; international cooperation; mitigation; renewable resource; scenario analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056853910

Mandates for closure of small coal-fired power plants (CFPPs), and replacement with large ones, together with the promulgation of air emissions standards and the development of renewable energy projects, have resulted in an improvement of 15% in energy efficiency and a reduction of 91%, 89% and 96% in emission rates of SO2, NOx and PM from China's electric power sector over the last decade. Compared to the United States, the Chinese electric power generation fleet is more energy efficient and has lower average emissions rates of SO2 and NOx. Despite these achievements, two characteristics of the current system pose serious challenges for China's clean power development: a) two thirds of China's power generation still rely on coal, and more CFPPs are being built and approved to be built; and b) high curtailment of renewable energy limits its benefits. We review the root causes of these challenges and highlight opportunities for enacting policies to address them. © 2018","China; Electric power sector; Emissions reduction; Energy savings","Air pollution; Coal; Electric power generation; Electric power plants; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Fossil fuel power plants; Nitrogen oxides; Plant shutdowns; Small power plants; China; Coal-fired power plant; Electric power sector; Emissions reduction; Energy efficiency improvements; Policy formulation; Renewable energies; Renewable energy projects; Energy efficiency; electricity generation; emission control; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy policy; policy development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056706645

However, some important processes relating to the response of vegetation to climate change in alpine regions, such as treeline composition and associated plant diversity change, have not been well understood in terms of multi-centennial scales. Here, we present a well-dated high-resolution palynological record from Basomtso, southeastern Tibetan Plateau (TP), to discuss the vegetation change and the relevant climate forcing. Our results manifest that the treeline position, composition and plant diversity around Basomtso did change greatly during the past millennium. The cold events (ca. 720-650 cal yr BP and ca. 400-50 cal yr BP) were considered crucial to force these changes. Cold temperature limited the growth of trees in the high elevations and thus led to downslope movement of treeline and conspicuous decrease of dominant tree species. Space and resource released from the upper forest triggered shrub and herb taxa expanded to lower elevations and even new species can dispersed to this area and survived, leading to changes in vegetation composition and diversity. Although the climate warming is pronounced since the 20th century, treeline distribution, vegetation composition and species diversity seem have not been recovered from the previous cold period.

However, the key functional genes and microbes related to the nitrogen removal remain largely unknown in the free water surface constructed wetland (FWS CW). Here we studied the abundances of denitrifiers by targeting the key functional genes (nirS, nirK and nosZ) and investigated the community compositions of denitrifiers and their correlations with the abiotic variables in a FWS CW. The increase of nosZ/(nirS + nirK) and nirS/nirK ratios in the outlet indicated a shift of denitrifiers’ communities which tended to release less nitrous oxide at the genetic potential level. The denitrifiers dominated the bacterial community which also remarkably changed from the inlet to the outlet. PICRUSt analysis revealed that the denitrifiers contributed to 39.1% of the nitrogen metabolism, 38.9% of the amino acid metabolism and 25.6% of the amino acid related enzymes. Four bacterial genera including Hydrogenophaga, Hylemonella, Aquabacterium and Cellvibrio were detected as the putative keystone denitrifiers. The abundance (nirS, nirK and nosZ) and the relative abundance of putative keystone denitrifiers were significantly correlated with total organic carbon, oxidation-reduction potential and C/N ratio, which could be regarded as the determinants for the denitrification process in the free water. © 2018","Abundance; Denitrifiers’ community composition; Free water surface constructed wetland; Functional genes","Amino acids; Arches; Bacteria; Genes; Metabolism; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Organic carbon; Physiology; Redox reactions; Wetlands; Abundance; Amino acid metabolism; Community composition; Constructed wetlands; Denitrification process; Functional genes; Nitrogen removal process; Oxidation reduction potential; Denitrification; amino acid; nitrogen; surface water; abundance; community composition; constructed wetland; denitrification; gene; microorganism; amino acid metabolism; Aquabacterium; Article; Cellvibrio; constructed wetland; controlled study; denitrification; denitrifyer; gene; Hydrogenophaga; Hylemonella; microbial community; nirK gene; nirS gene; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; nosZ gene; oxidation reduction potential; priority journal; total organic carbon; Aquabacterium; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cellvibrio; Hydrogenophaga; Hylemonella",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053187834

Selection of an appropriate structure and quantity of quantum dots can improve the rate performances. Here we report a unique molecular beam template approach to inlay MnO quantum dots (MnOQD) into walls of carbon hetero-nanotubes to form a brand-new composite (MnOQD@CHNTs) and investigate the influences of the inlaid quantum dots on the structures and the fast charging properties of carbon hetero-nanotubes. Plenty of tiny inlaid MnOQD in the walls of carbon nanotubes are proved to be capable of expanding the carbon layer spacing, decreasing the degree of order, forming heterojunctions with carbon, and altering the local electronic cloud density of carbon. Therefore, the capability of MnOQD@CHNTs for Li+/Na+ transfer and storage is greatly improved due to the quantum dot effect of MnO. As a result, the MnOQD@CHNTs exhibit excellent cycling and rate performances as both lithium-ion battery (LIB) and sodium-ion battery (SIB) anodes, e.g. fully charged in 28.3 s with a capacity of 392.8 mA h g-1 (~ 125.6 C) in LIB (the best ever reported). © 2018","Lithium/sodium-ion battery; Molecular beam template; Quantum dot effect; Ultra-fast charging","Anodes; Charging (batteries); Heterojunctions; Lithium compounds; Lithium-ion batteries; Manganese oxide; Metal ions; Molecular beams; Nanocrystals; Nanotubes; Sodium compounds; Sodium-ion batteries; Storage (materials); Yarn; Carbon material; Degree of order; Energy storage and conversions; Quantum dot effects; Rate performance; Related systems; Template approach; Ultra-fast; Semiconductor quantum dots",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050693810

However, surface wind simulated from the regional climate model generally features substantial bias from observation. For the first time, this study compares the performance of five bias correction techniques, (1) linear scaling, (2) variance scaling, (3) quantile mapping based on empirical distribution, (4) quantile mapping based on Weibull distribution, and (5) cumulative distribution functions transformation, in reducing the statistical bias of a regional climate model wind output, which was downscaled from a global climate model CNRM-CM5 during 1991–2000. The surface wind of JRA55 reanalysis data is used as reference. Results show that all bias correction methods are consistent in reducing the climatological mean bias in spatial patterns and intensities. The linear scaling method always performs the worst among all methods in correcting higher-order statistical biases such as skewness, kurtosis, and wind power density. The other four bias correction methods are generally similar in reducing the statistical biases of different measures based on spatial distribution maps. However, when it comes to spatial averaged mean of statistical measures over CORDEX-East Asia in January and July, the quantile mapping based on Weibull distribution generally shows the best skills among all methods in bias reduction. ©2019.

Balanced fertilization (BF) of cropland has been widely promoted and applied and has great potential to reduce GHG emissions. This study assesses GHG mitigation of BF cropland systems including winter wheat and summer maize double-cropping system (wheat-maize) and winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and rice double-cropping system (rape-rice) in Shaanxi province, China. We determined the boundaries, scenarios, leakage, and sources of GHG mitigation and developed a measurement system for GHG mitigation under these cropping systems for BF farmland. In the measurement system, except for the changes in nitrogen fertilizer rates, soil carbon storage, mechanical fuel consumption, and fertilizer management mode (paddy), change in crop yield was recommended as a primary source of GHG mitigation. The BF cropland areas of wheat-maize and rape-rice were 2818.89 ha and 1671.73 ha, respectively. The use of BF reduced the GHG emissions of wheat-maize by 1.15 tCO 2 equivalent (CO 2 e) ha −1 per year and the emissions of rape-rice by 1.05 tCO 2 e ha −1 per year. The BF cropland produced 5007.6 tCO 2 e per year.

Two rules that govern molecules are that there is no dual emission (Kasha) and there is no spectrum to the emission quantum yield (Vavilov). We show that the latter rule of molecular spectroscopy is generally violated in semiconductor nanocrystals. Through experiments and theory on CdSe and perovskite nanocrystals, these violations are shown to arise via hot carrier effects. Experiments and simple phenomenology reveal that quantum yield spectra arise because of enhanced hot carrier trapping rates. A semiclassical electron-transfer theory rationalizes a microscopic picture of the carrier kinetics. These effects are especially significant when quantifying syntheses of bright emitters such as perovskite nanocrystals.

Lawns dominate urban lands in the U.S. and require intensive management, including frequent mowing, which may influence CO2 emissions from both biogenic and anthropogenic sources. We tested whether different lawn mowing frequencies (every one, two or three weeks) affected soil respiration (i.e., biogenic CO2 emissions), by changing soil moisture and temperature, and the gasoline emissions associated with lawn maintenance via lawn mowing (i.e., anthropogenic CO2 emissions). Sixteen yards in Springfield, Massachusetts USA were assigned a mowing frequency for two seasons (2013–2014). We measured grass height, air and soil temperature, soil moisture, soil CO2 flux, lawn mower emissions, tree canopy coverage and precipitation. We used a mixed effects modeling approach to test how these variables interacted with each other and responded to mowing frequency. Lawn-mowing frequency did not influence soil temperature, moisture, or biogenic soil CO2 fluxes. Soil microclimate and soil respiration varied more with ambient climatic fluctuations and tree canopy cover. By contrast, anthropogenic emissions increased with more frequent mowing due to emissions associated with the mower. When scaled to the entire mowing season, biogenic CO2 fluxes far exceeded the anthropogenic fluxes, thus requiring consideration for accurate accounting of urban greenhouse gas emissions.

Depleted gas reservoirs are promising candidates for the storage of carbon dioxide (CO2). Therefore, a depleted gas reservoir in the Upper Miocene sandstone located in Northern Croatia was taken as an example. The purpose of this study was to compare CO2 storage capacity obtained with two analytical equations to total storage capacity obtained through the simulator, in order to validate the equations. The frst equation takes the average reservoir pressure and available production data into account, while the other one is more general and includes produced volume, CO2 density and formation volume factor of the original fuid. The tools used for these calculations were Schlumberger PVTi soft-ware, in which the equation of state was obtained, and ECLIPSE (E300 Module) which is a reservoir engineering simulator used for reservoir behaviour prediction. The results confrmed analytical solutions, indicating that, depending on the depth, the mass of the CO2 that can be injected is twice as big as the mass of CH4 produced. The results of analytical solutions, 16.7 × 106 m3 and 14.6 × 106 m3, are in accordance with the results obtained by the simulation of CO2 injection in depleted reservoirs-16.2 × 106 m3. Based on this, a conclusion is derived that these analytical solutions can be used as a frst approximation of injection in a depleted gas reservoir. © 2019, University of Zagreb.

The main objective of this study was to quantify the effect of different extended lactation strategies on herd productivity, farm economics and sustainability at product level with focus on greenhouse gas emission. The herd model SimHerd simulated cow state, production, replacement and herd dynamics that supported a quantification of the effect of managing either first lactation, older or all cows for calving intervals of either 15 or 17 months compared with 13 months. The initial herd was self-sufficient with replacement heifers, and the extended lactations were achieved by only changing time of first possible insemination while keeping insemination and conception rates as well as all other production and management parameters unchanged. The different extended lactation strategies reduced annual milk production and herd feed use up to 4.1 and 7.1%, respectively, which combined caused herd milk production per kg DM herd feed use to increase with up to 3.5%. Replacement rate per annual cow (per cow per year) was reduced with up to 13.6% points and the number of youngstock per annual cow with 27%. Managing only first lactation cows for extended lactations resulted in close to negligible production effects compared with baseline scenario and positively affected farm contribution margin whereas the other strategies had a negative effect on farm contribution margin per cow of up to 3.2%. The reduction in herd feed use reduced farm area for feed production, and the economic effect of using this area to either feed more cows or grow a cash crop was greater than the negative economic effect of the extended lactation strategy itself. Hence, the overall economic effect depends on the ability of the farmer to realise savings and utilise a potential freed area. Finally, the extended lactation strategies reduced greenhouse gas emissions with up to 8.1% per annual cow where less feed production and less enteric fermentation were determining factors. However, the weight ratio between milk and meat increased up to 34.7% across scenarios, which affected the allocation of emissions. Hence, emissions were reduced per cow but unchanged per kg milk. If the market requires an unchanged supply of milk and beef meat, then these extended lactation strategies caused an indirect emission from production of substitute beef meat, which can lead to an increased total emission. In conclusion, managing dairy cows for extended lactations can be an economically viable production strategy if the farmer is able to realise potential savings and gains. Emissions are reduced per cow but the sector level effect for milk and beef meat can be unchanged or even increased. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Dairy cow; Economics; Efficiency; Extended lactation; Farm system dynamics; GHG emission","agricultural worker; animal food; Article; biodiversity; body weight; carbon footprint; catering service; controlled study; cow milk; dairy cattle; dairying; economic aspect; fermentation; food availability; food intake; heifer; insemination; lactation; milk production; nonhuman; pregnancy rate; productivity; raw meat; simulation; sustainable agriculture; time factor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058710805

In 2012, the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) installed CO 2 monitoring systems at Anmyeondo (AMY) in the west, Jejudo Gosan Suwolbong (JGS) in the southwest, and Ulleungdo (ULD) in the east of South Korea. Three stations were instrumented with identical greenhouse gas measurement systems based on cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) and a new drying system developed by KMA and the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS). This drying system is suitable in humid areas; water vapor measured using CRDS in ambient air was 0.001% to 0.004% across the stations. Measurement uncertainties expressed by the quadrature sum of the uncertainties from the drying system, scale propagations, repeatability, and reproducibility were ∼0.11ppm from all KMA stations in the 68% confidence interval. Average monthly CO 2 enhancements above the local background at each station were 4.3±3.3ppm at AMY, 1.7±1.3ppm at JGS, and 1±1.9ppm (1 σ) at ULD, respectively, during 2012 to 2016. At AMY station, located between China and South Korea, CO 2 annual means and seasonal variations are also greater than the other KMA stations, indicating that it is affected not only by local vegetation, but also added anthropogenic sources. Selected baseline CO 2 at AMY and at JGS in the west of South Korea is more sensitive to East Asia (e.g., China) according to wind direction and speed. Through the comparison of long-term trends and growth rates at AMY with other East Asian stations over 15 years, it was suggested that they could be affected not only by local vegetation but also by measurement quality. © 2019 Author(s).",,"carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; comparative study; data quality; greenhouse gas; long-term change; measurement method; vegetation; Anmyeon Island; Cheju [South Korea]; China; North Kyongsang; South Chungcheong; South Korea; Ulleung Island",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061839375

The first approach employed by the Southwest Carbon Partnership assumes CO2 is injected into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs but no fluids are withdrawn. The second method analyzes the storage capacity of the Denver Basin assuming CO2 is injected until the pressure in each oil reservoir reaches the hydrostatic gradient, and CO2 then continues to be injected into the oil reservoirs in order to recover additional oil, until the incremental oil recovery would no longer be commercially viable. The amount of CO2 sequestered in the 30 oil fields studied was found to be 160 Mt with the first method but only 50 to 70 Mt using the second method.

Most American university programs lack courses covering the rising deaths and illnesses from climate change. Consequently, graduates in health and other disciplines are underprepared for providing services in a world affected by climate change. They also lack the training to communicate this transformative development effectively. Universities should fill this gap and this paper aims to provide guidance on approaches to teaching climate-related health effects (CRHE). Design/methodology/approach: Three analyses guide university coursework on CRHE. First, consider what current practitioners observe about the challenges they face and capability of trainees. Second, identify gaps in accreditation standards for university programs regarding these competencies. Third, draw lessons from innovative courses at a major American university. Findings: Leading associations of practitioners in healthcare services, public health, social work, urban planning, civil engineering, law and other professions call for training students on CRHE. In contrast, accreditation bodies for most university programs fail to specify such curricula and competencies. Four offerings at a major American public university in 2016-2017 developed knowledge of CRHE, skills to improve professional services, appreciation of professional responsibilities and communication competencies. Originality/value: Building on recommendations for climate change and sustainability in higher education, this study focuses on health effects, finds gaps in many programs and accreditation standards within and outside health sciences and draws lessons from innovative offerings. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Accreditation; Climate change; Competencies; Curriculum; Global health; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056151535

Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is a commonly used and well-established tool to estimate the total emissions caused by buildings throughout their entire life cycle. Yet, LCAs of more complex systems such as neighbourhoods are scarce. We have developed an LCA model for neighbourhoods with a focus on GHG emissions based on a modular structure with five physical elements: buildings, mobility, open spaces, networks and on-site energy infrastructure. We applied it on the Zero Village Bergen pilot project in Norway. The results give total GHG emissions of 117 ktons CO2-eq over 60 years, equivalent to 1.5 tons CO2-eq/capita/year or 21.2 kg CO2-eq/m2/year on average over the period. The buildings constitute the largest share of emissions among the elements with 52%, then mobility with 40%, and only 2.3% from networks and open spaces. Emissions embodied in the materials consumed in all the elements of the neighbourhood account for as much as 56% of total emissions, with a large share coming from materials consumed in mobility vehicles. Critical parameters are emission intensities for electricity and heat production by waste incineration, as well as the daily distance travelled by the inhabitants. © 2018","Early stage planning; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Zero emission neighbourhoods","Air pollution; Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Gas emissions; Life cycle; Waste incineration; Building sectors; Emission intensity; Entire life cycles; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mobility vehicles; Modular structures; Physical elements; Zero emission; Greenhouse gases; building; carbon emission; emission control; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; neighborhood; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058716813

Natural carbon cycle process will not be effective in reducing the pollutant content, as the amount and rate of CO2 dissipation raise at a drastic rate. This alarming situation urgently requires technologies for carbon dioxide capture and sequestering (CCS). With the development of technologies every day, the amount of CO2 emission is expected to increase steeply, which necessitates more technologies to sequester CO2 with a target of 50 ppm by 2050. CCS involves the capture of gas at some stage of the industrial process followed by pressurization and transporting it to stable geological sites like saline aquifers, depleted oil and gas fields, deep coal seams where it can be trapped for thousands of years. CO2 sequestration requires multiple fundamental R&amp;D approaches and significant breakthroughs. The purpose of this review is to have an integrated analysis of the carbon sequestration process including the state of the art technologies for CO2 capture, separation, transport, storage, leakage, monitoring, and life cycle analysis. Depending on the source of emission, different techniques and methodologies adopted by the scientific community were analyzed and discussed. A brief description of the best practices and techniques for CO2 capturing like absorption, adsorption, cryogenic, and membranes will be reviewed. A comparative study on the same will be analyzed based on their performance, efficiency, regeneration, adsorption rate, the volume of adsorption, cost, and energy required for regeneration. Some of the prerequisites for sequestering the captured carbon dioxide are safety, environmentally benign, effective, economical, and acceptable to the public. Natural sequestration methods include plantation, soil carbon sequestration, and CH4-CO2 reforming. Industrially acceptable sequestration process involves isolating the captured gas into places which are nonaccessible to living creatures which include basically geologic, oceanic, and terrestrial dumping sites. All the three geoengineering techniques and their subdivisions will be discussed in detail with up to date improvisations and results. Moreover, the concerns related to potential leakages while transporting supercritical CO2, uncertainty in terms of quantification of storage potential, accompanied by monitoring and engineering challenges have to be given prior attention in developing any sequestration process, which this review will give an overall picture and suggestions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

With 86% of American commuters continuing to drive to work, meeting the urgent climate-change challenge requires a pronounced shift to alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs). Standing in the way of this transition, however, is the dearth of conveniently located refueling and recharging stations. This paper argues that we cannot generalize from the refueling habits of people driving gasoline cars, or from their stated preferences for where they would need or want stations, because they formed those habits and preferences while using a ubiquitous network of gasoline stations. We also must distinguish among the different behaviors engendered by slow and/or home charging of electric vehicles, flexible refueling and recharging of hybrids and flex-fuel vehicles, and fast refueling/charging AFVs. Therefore, this paper reviews the limited literature on the revealed preferences of where actual early adopters of single-fuel, fast-filling AFVs choose to refuel or recharge when faced with the reality of a sparse network of stations. Refueling preferences have been revealed by (1) surveys asking drivers where they usually refuel, (2) intercept surveys at stations, and (3) GPS and card-swipe data. The few existing studies suggest that drivers adapt by focusing more on convenience of locations than price. Drivers refuel more frequently at the same stations, at higher tank or battery levels, more on work-anchored trips, more in the middle of trips, less often near home, more often on their way, and take larger detours compared with drivers of gasoline and diesel vehicles. To put these results in a broader context, the paper compares them briefly with revealed-preference results for slow charging of electric vehicles and with stated-preference results for hydrogen and similar fuels. The paper discusses the implications of these findings for the initial rollout of fast-refueling station infrastructure and identifies gaps in what we know about actual AFV refueling and recharging behavior. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Compressed natural gas (CNG); Electric vehicle fast charging; Hydrogen fuel cell vehicle; Refueling station choice; Revealed preference","electric vehicle; fuel cell; hydrogen; natural gas; preference behavior; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060614529

Studies so far relied either on remote sensing-based spatial mapping of physical vulnerability or on certain socio-economic aspects with limited scope for upscaling or replication. The current study is an attempt to develop a holistic and robust framework to assess the vulnerability of coastal India at different levels. We propose and estimate cumulative vulnerability index (CVI) as a function of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity, at the village level, using nationally comparable and credible datasets. The exposure index (EI) was determined at the village level by decomposing the spatial multi-hazard maps, while sensitivity (SI) and adaptive capacity indices (ACI) were estimated using 23 indicators, covering social and economic aspects. The indicators were identified through the literature review, expert consultations, opinion survey, and were further validated through statistical tests. The socio-economic vulnerability index (SEVI) was constructed as a function of sensitivity and adaptive capacity for planning grassroot-level interventions and adaptation strategies. The framework was piloted in Sindhudurg, a coastal district in Maharashtra, India. It comprises 317 villages, spread across three taluks viz., Devgad, Malvan and Vengurla. The villages in Sindhudurg were ranked based on this multi-criteria approach. Based on CVI values, 92 villages (30%) in Sindhudurg were identified as highly vulnerable. We propose a decision tool for identifying villages vulnerable to changing climate, based on their level of sensitivity and adaptive capacity in a two-dimensional matrix, thus aiding in planning location-specific interventions. Here, vulnerability indicators are classified and designated as ‘drivers’ (indicators with significantly high values and intervention priority) and ‘buffers’ (indicators with low-to-moderate values) at the village level. The framework provides for aggregation or decomposition of CVI and other sub-indices, in order to plan spatial contingency plans and enable swift action for climate adaptation. © 2018, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.","Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Exposure; Multi-hazard map; Sensitivity; Socio-economic","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; coastal zone; decision making; hazard assessment; mapping method; sensitivity analysis; socioeconomic impact; spatial analysis; vulnerability; India; Maharashtra; Malvan; Sindhudurg; Vengurla; climate change; decision making; flooding; hurricane; India; Climate Change; Cyclonic Storms; Decision Making; Floods; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047949136

This is resulting in flooding of poorly-drained upland soils, which can feed back on climate change by altering greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). The objective of this study was to determine if soil drainage history affects the response of soil GHG emissions to rain events. To do this, we measured N 2 O and CO 2 fluxes from poorly-drained (PD) and well-drained (WD) soils in an agricultural field in Urbana, Illinois before and after large rain events. We also performed a lab experiment to separate effects of soil drainage history from contemporary effects of ponding. Finally, we utilized stable isotope techniques to measure gross N 2 O dynamics and to determine the contributions of nitrifiers and denitrifiers to net N 2 O fluxes. We found that ponding of WD soils led to pulses of net N 2 O efflux caused by stimulation of gross N 2 O production by denitrifiers. In contrast, PD soils had high net N 2 O effluxes only between large rain events, and gross N 2 O production was inhibited following ponding. Soil CO 2 efflux was greater from PD soils under lab conditions, but autotrophic respiration obscured this trend in the field. Soil GHG emissions were a result of different contemporary ponding status as well as historical soil drainage, suggesting that historical soil redox regimes regulate soil GHG dynamics in response to precipitation. These soil drainage legacy effects are likely important in predicting soil GHG feedback effects on climate change. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Denitrification; Drainage; Nitrification; Nitrous oxide; Redox; Soil oxygen","carbon dioxide; climate change; denitrification; flooding; greenhouse gas; nitrification; nitrous oxide; precipitation intensity; redox conditions; soil drainage; soil respiration; stable isotope; Illinois; Midwest; United States; Urbana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060974642

Thus, based on equality and efficiency principles, we apply a methodology combining DEA models with entropy method to analyze China's carbon quota allocation from both provincial and regional perspectives. We integrate three indicators (total population, accumulated historical carbon emissions and emission efficiency) to construct a comprehensive indicator and use the integrated weighting approach to simulate the allocation of carbon emission quotas among China's 30 provinces. Different from previous studies, we use the non-radial directional distance function based on Kuosmanen technology to calculate emission efficiency. Also, we introduce an environmental Gini coefficient to evaluate the equality level of allocation results. Our main findings are as follows: (1) In 2030, provinces with large shares of carbon emission quotas are mainly located in China's southern region (e.g. Guangdong), while most northern provinces have small shares of carbon emission quotas (e.g. Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia). (2) Due to low emission efficiency, the emission quota shares of Hebei, Xinjiang, Shandong and Inner Mongolia decrease significantly during 2015–2030, indicating that these provinces will face greater pressure to reduce carbon emissions in the future. (3) The environmental Gini coefficient is 0.3177, which proves the equality of allocation results. (4) From the regional perspective, due to the low emission efficiency and large historical emissions, the carbon quota shares of the Middle Yellow River and Northern coastal regions decrease significantly during 2015–2030. This indicates that the two regions will need to purchase emission quotas from other regions in the future. Based on the results above, provinces and regions which undertake large emission reduction obligations need to further improve emission efficiency such that the 2030 emission reduction target can be realized. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission quota allocation; Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency principle; Environmental Gini coefficient; Equality principle","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Emission control; Carbon emission trading; Carbon emissions; Directional distance function; Efficiency principles; Emission efficiencies; Emission reduction targets; Equality principle; Gini coefficients; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059324747

Most regions exhibit under-use (potential > actual), especially in regions with large forest areas, presumably because of limited accessibility or abandonment. Over-use (actual > potential) is prevalent in regions with a snowy climate, which might increase plant quantity and quality by supplying enough water.

The cause of such recent decadal variations in the tropics was studied using a meteorological reanalysis dataset. Cooling of the equatorial southeastern Pacific Ocean occurred in association with enhanced cross-equatorial southerlies that were associated with a strengthening of the deep ascending branch of the boreal summer Hadley circulation over the continental sector connected to stratospheric circulation. From boreal summer to winter, the anomalous convective activity center moves southward following the seasonal march to the equatorial Indian Ocean-Maritime Continent region, which strengthens the surface easterlies over the equatorial central Pacific. Accordingly, ocean surface cooling extends over the equatorial central Pacific. We suggest that the fundamental cause of the recent decadal change in the tropical troposphere and the ocean is a poleward shift of convective activity that resulted from a strengthening of extreme deep convection penetrating into the tropical tropopause layer, particularly over the African and Asian continents and adjacent oceans. We conjecture that the increase in extreme deep convection is produced by a combination of land surface warming due to increased <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">CO2</span> and a reduction of static stability in the tropical tropopause layer due to tropical stratospheric cooling. © 2019.

Thus, the object of this study is to analyze the on-road PN emissions characteristics under a cold start condition of a gasoline direct injection (GDI) vehicle depending on a catalytic stripper (CS), a gasoline particulate filter (GPF), the cold start phase, and the trip section using a corona charger type particle sensor, a CS, and an exhaust flow meter. Because the fuel-rich mode and retarded injection timing were applied to compensate for engine instability and caused incomplete combustion and deterioration of fuel vaporization during the cold start phase, PN emissions during the cold start phase accounted for a significant portion of the total PN. On-road PN emissions for the total trip were 2.71 × 1012 (without CS and GPF), 1.72 × 1012 (with CS and without GPF), 1.47 × 1012 (without CS and with GPF) and 9.50 × 1011 (with CS and GPF) #/km for cases A, B, C and D, respectively.

This paper investigates a new potential strategy: the application of the thermal mountain effect to artificially increase rainfall in desert regions and transform such regions into a vegetated state, thus sequestering significant quantities of carbon. A preliminary systems engineering analysis evaluating the design parameters of an artificial thermal mountain is provided, along with the analysis of its potential for carbon capture and agricultural applications. It is estimated that a large-scale low-albedo coating, between 15000 and 50000 km 2 in surface area, would, in principle, be sufficient to provide enough rainfall to irrigate a 1000 km × 2000 km section of the Sahara desert.

Therefore, the GHG intensity, water intensity and water-related risks are analysed simultaneously for conventional diesel and soya bean-based biodiesel from Argentina, Brazil, Unites States (U.S.), Thailand and Iran on a life cycle basis. The water-related risks are estimated with a water scarcity—consumption matrix, which was recently developed. Results show that a significant share (9%-38%) of the GHG emissions in all biodiesel cases is caused by soil N 2 O emissions. In addition, the ranges in water consumption intensity for soya bean-based biodiesel are considerably larger than for fossil fuels. However, whether this leads to high water-related risks depends on the local water scarcity. Soya bean-based biodiesel from Argentina has low water-related risks to all nodes of the supply chain due to low local water stress combined with a low direct water consumption intensity (20 L/GJ fuel ). In addition, high GHG emission reduction (71%) and a low-specific eutrophication potential (0.04 kg PO 4 3− /GJ fuel ) are achieved. The indirect water consumption intensity is estimated at 120–420 L/GJ for soya bean-based biodiesel, which is significant if the soya beans are rainfed, like in Argentina and Brazil. If irrigation is required, indirect water consumption is dwarfed by irrigation water. Overall, it is concluded that soya bean-based biodiesel can have significant lower GHG emission intensity than fossil diesel, without causing additional water stress in the supply chain if they are produced in water abundant areas and good agricultural practices are used. The used method shows disaggregated water-related risks for the different nodes of the supply chain to acknowledge the regional nature of water scarcity and enables decision makers to identify “hot spots” and take targeted actions. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"Biodiesel; Emission control; Eutrophication; Fossil fuels; Irrigation; Life cycle; Oilseeds; Risk perception; Supply chains; Water supply; Decision makers; Eutrophication potentials; Good agricultural practices; Irrigation waters; Nature of water; Targeted actions; Water consumption; Water scarcity; Greenhouse gases; bioenergy; biofuel; carbon emission; emission control; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; soybean; water stress; water use; Argentina; Brazil; Iran; Thailand; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054345284

We simulate which policy measures could induce an almost complete decarbonisation of residential heating, the by far largest source of direct emissions in residential buildings. Under which assumptions is it possible, and how long would it take? We use the non-equilibrium bottom-up model FTT:Heat to simulate policies for a transition towards low-carbon heating in a context of inertia and bounded rationality, focusing on the uptake of heating systems. Our results indicate that the near-zero decarbonisation is achievable by 2050, but requires substantial policy efforts. We find that policy mixes are more effective for incentivising the uptake of fuel-efficient low-carbon technologies, compared to a residential carbon tax as the only policy. In combination with subsidies and procurement policies for renewables, near-complete decarbonisation could be achieved with a tax of 50–200 €/tCO 2. Without being complimented by additional policies, carbon taxes show a decreasing marginal impact on total emission reductions, thus remaining insufficient for deep decarbonisation. In all scenarios, the decarbonisation of heating would increase projected heating costs faced by households initially, but could lead to cost reductions in most world regions in the medium term. We show that the potential impacts of policies highly depend on behavioural decision-making by households, especially in a context of deep decarbonisation and rapid transformation. © 2018, The Author(s).","1.5 °C target; Behavioural modelling; Low-carbon heating; Technology diffusion","Behavioral research; Carbon; Cost reduction; Decarbonization; Decision making; Emission control; Global warming; Housing; Behavioural modelling; Bounded rationality; Low-Carbon heating; Low-carbon technologies; Rapid transformations; Residential building; Residential heating; Technology diffusion; Heating; building; carbon emission; emission control; global warming; heating; modeling; residential energy; technology diffusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049591364

Abstract: Information on the physiological mechanisms underlying species-specific photosynthetic responses to ambient air pollution is essential for enhancing the multiple services provided by urban trees. We conducted an on-site investigation of Rhododendron × pulchrum and Ginkgo biloba, which are the most common shrub and tall roadside tree used in Japan, in order to clarify their photosynthetic responses at sites with different air pollution levels in Kyoto city, Japan. The shrub tree R. × pulchrum and tall tree G. biloba exhibited contrasting responses to air pollution mainly from automobile exhaust gas. R. × pulchrum had a lower photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance at high-pollution sites than at low-pollution sites, while no reductions were observed at high-pollution sites for G. biloba. The stomatal density of R. × pulchrum negatively correlated with atmospheric nitrogen oxides (NO and NO 2 ) concentrations. R. × pulchrum avoided the effects of air pollution by reducing stomatal density at high-pollution sites at the expense of reducing CO 2 uptake, while G. biloba appeared to have the ability to tolerate high air pollution levels by reducing the pollution load per mesophyll cell surface area with a low stomatal density and large mesophyll thickness. In conclusion, R. × pulchrum and G. biloba both acclimate to urban environments through an avoidance or tolerance strategy for air pollution by regulating stomatal and/or mesophyll morphologies. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Mesophyll anatomy; Nitrogen oxide; Stomatal conductance; Stomatal density; Vehicle emissions","Cell membranes; Forestry; Nitrogen oxides; Physiological models; Ambient air pollution; Mesophyll anatomy; On site investigations; Photosynthetic response; Physiological mechanisms; Stomatal conductance; Stomatal density; Vehicle emission; Air pollution; Air Pollution; Density; Forestry; Ginkgo; Nitrogen Oxides; Sites; Thickness; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052936150

We investigate the accuracy of coarse woody debris (CWD) carbon stock estimates obtained from periodic inventories of New Zealand's natural forest. Dimensions and decay classes of standing-dead spars, fallen logs and stumps over 10 cm diameter were assessed in permanent plots during two inventory cycles (2002–07 and 2009–14). Carbon in CWD was estimated by multiplying CWD volume with species-specific mean wood and bark density, a density modifier based on decay class, and the carbon fraction. The measured change in CWD between inventories was obtained by subtracting 2002–07 from 2009–14 mean CWD carbon stocks. This measured change in CWD carbon stocks was compared with the modelled change derived by applying a decay model to 2002–07 stocks to determine the losses from decay and adding inputs from the tree mortality recorded between the two measurement cycles. Estimates of CWD carbon stocks from field measurements were 19.9 and 19.5 tC ha−1 in 2002–07 and 2009–14 respectively, with a statistically non-significant change of −0.4 ± 0.6 tC ha−1 (95% C.I.) over the period between measurements implying that CWD carbon is in a steady state. However, the modelling approach gave a significant increase of 2.5 ± 0.7 tC ha−1, implying that CWD stocks are increasing. It appears likely that the primary reason for the discrepancy between the direct measurement and modelling approaches is that CWD carbon stocks are substantially underestimated using current measurement protocols used in the inventory of New Zealand's natural forest. If CWD carbon stocks in New Zealand's natural forests are approximately in balance as implied by the direct measurement of CWD stocks, CWD inputs from mortality would have to be balanced by losses from decay. For this to be true, the CWD pool would have to approximate 35.4 tC ha−1 which is 78% higher than its measured value. © 2018","Carbon sequestration; Carbon stocks; Coarse woody debris; Dead wood; Decay rates; Forest inventory; Tree mortality","Carbon; Debris; Environmental regulations; Forestry; Global warming; Carbon sequestration; Carbon stocks; Coarse woody debris; Dead wood; Decay rate; Forest inventory; Tree mortality; Decay (organic); carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; coarse woody debris; comparative study; dead wood; diameter; forest inventory; measurement method; mortality; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Averages; Carbon; Dead Wood; Decay; Environmental Regulations; Forestry; Inventories; Measurement; New Zealand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058010303

The ITO film was prepared by the sol-gel method and annealed by excimer-laser pulses with an energy density up to 240 mJ/cm2. Hall measurements showed that the ELA substantially enhanced the electrical properties of the ITO films, including their resistivity, carrier density, and mobility, as increasing the laser energy density. In-depth x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the chemical states in the film surface showed that the ELA reduced carbon species and promoted both an oxidation and crystallization. These changes were consistent with results of x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy measurements, where expansions in the microcrystal growth were observed for higher laser energy density.

Yet most studies on the emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from plants in response to insect herbivore feeding focus on one plant species. Whether the presence and identity of neighboring plants or plant community attributes, such as plant species richness and plant species composition, affect the herbivore-induced VOC emission of a focal plant is poorly understood. Methods: We established experimental plant communities in pots in the greenhouse where the focal plant species, red clover (Trifolium pratense), was grown in monoculture, in a two species mixture together with Geranium pratense or Dactylis glomerata, or in a mixture of all three species. We measured VOC emission of the focal plant and the entire plant community, with and without herbivory of Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars caged on one red clover individual within the communities. Results: Herbivory increased VOC emission from red clover, and increasing plant species richness changed emissions of red clover and also from the entire plant community. Neighbor identity strongly affected red clover emission, with highest emission rates for plants growing together with D. glomerata. Conclusion: The results from this study indicate that the blend of VOCs perceived by host searching insects can be affected by plant-plant interactions. © 2019 The Author(s).","Biodiversity effects; Experimental grassland; Fabaceae; Geraniaceae; Herbivore-induced plant volatiles (HIPV); Poaceae","volatile organic compound; animal; clover; Dactylis; ecosystem; Geranium; herbivory; larva; metabolism; plant; Spodoptera; Animals; Dactylis; Ecosystem; Geranium; Herbivory; Larva; Plants; Spodoptera; Trifolium; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061105100

These stromatoporoid buildups are mainly characterized by the high percentage of intraclastic-bioclastic debris, as main components of buildup bodies. However, the source of hydrodynamic energy resulted in debris production, is still a matter of debate. This study examines the Upper Jurassic-Lower Cretaceous stromatoporoid-rich buildups of Monte Sacro Limestones (MSL), Apulia Carbonate Platform (ACP), in order to describe the main carbonate facies along the study area, as well as the possible source of turbulence. Three main lithofacies have been distinguished: LF1 — stromatoporoid-rich facies with two subfacies (LF1-S1: floatstone with wackestone to fine-grained packstone, LF1-S2: rudstone-floatstone with intraclastic-bioclastic packstone-grainstone), LF2 — stromatoporoid-coral facies distributed in wackestone to packstone matrix (LF2-S1) and tabular stromatoporoid-corals surrounded by wackestone matrix (LF2-S2) and, LF3 — stromatoporoid-microbial facies. These facies were deposited along the mid part of a distally steepened ramp. The in-situ form of stromatoporoids was developed in a mud-dominated matrix (LF1-S1) under low-energy conditions while the intraclastic-bioclastic rich facies (LF1-S2) were deposited under a high-energy condition. The distribution of LF2 and LF3 in muddy matrix suggests occurrence of these lithofacies in quiet environments. The biotas were influenced by several factors including nutrient and light availability as well as by hydrodynamism. The stromatoporoid-rich buildups in ACP can be categorized as phototrophic-heterotrophic reefs generated in a pure carbonate environment. The light penetration was confined, resulted in the high development of light-independent micro-encrusters (Tubiphytes morronensis), in a mesophotic condition, where the environment was not ideal for light-dependent microencrusters (Lithocodium-Bacinella) to grow. We suggest that debris-dominated stromatoporoid-rich lithofacies (LF1) thrived in meso-oligophotic setting, along the nutricline and were affected by more than episodic high-energy events in a context where the surface waves were not effective. In such environments, internal waves can be an effective candidate to explain the episodic turbulences to produce the debris-rich facies of LF1-S2. Moreover, internal waves can pump the nutrient-rich waters to the buildups, and create an ideal setting where these metazoan communities thrived. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Apulia Carbonate Platform (ACP); Debris-rich reefs; Internal waves; Stromatoporoid; Upper Jurassic reefs","Carbonation; Lime; Nutrients; Reefs; Surface waves; Turbulence; Carbonate platforms; Controlling factors; Internal waves; Jurassic; Light availability; Low-energy conditions; Nutrient-rich water; Stromatoporoid; Debris; carbonate platform; coral reef; hydrodynamics; internal wave; invertebrate; Jurassic-Cretaceous boundary; lithofacies; metazoan; Gargano Promontory; Italy; Puglia; Anthozoa; Metazoa; Shamovella; Stromatoporoida",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057595441

While projected to experience the largest global urban transition with significant infrastructure investment in the next few decades, the welfare of Indian cities remains poor, which complicates the implications for climate change mitigation and adaptation. This paper traces, synthesizes and characterizes the emerging literature on Indian urban climate debates. It discusses the arc of urban climate efforts, from an initial emphasis on climate vulnerabilities and risks, broadening over time to include climate mitigation. The paper examines the governance forms and political motivations with which such actions are pursued in cities and finds three overarching characteristics: the use of local development priorities as an entry point to climate mitigation and adaptation; the role of nonstate actors in promoting climate-relevant outcomes; and the proclivity for discrete project-based activities. The paper suggests that while a range of Indian cities are beginning to consider climate concerns, a larger strategic understanding of the interaction between climate and development priorities, across policy and governance levels, is yet to be developed. The future trajectory of urban India's responses to climate change will be shaped by the institutional prioritising, linking and integrating of urgent local development and mitigation and adaptation goals.

The key challenges of the approach are the choice of the meteorological variables and statistics thereof and how to generate time series representing altered climatologies of the selected variables. Different methods have been proposed to achieve this, and it remains unclear if and to which extent they result in comparable flood change projections. Here, we compare projections of annual maximum floods (AMFs) derived from three different scenario-neutral methods for a prealpine study catchment. The methods chosen use different types of meteorological data, namely, observations, regional climate model output, and weather generator data. The different time series account for projected changes in the seasonality of temperature and precipitation, in the occurrence statistics of precipitation, and of daily precipitation extremes. Resulting change in mean AMF peak magnitudes and volumes differs in sign between the methods (range of −6% to +7% for flood peak magnitudes and −11% to +14% for flood volumes). Moreover, variability of projected peak magnitudes and flood volumes depends on method with one approach leading to a generally larger spread. The differences between the methods vary depending on whether peak magnitudes or flood volumes are considered and different relationships between peak magnitude and volume change result. These findings can be linked to differing flood regime changes among the three approaches. The study highlights that considering selected aspects of climate change only when performing scenario-neutral studies may lead to differing representations of flood generating processes by the approaches and thus different quantifications of flood change. As each method comes with its own strengths and weaknesses, it is recommended to combine several scenario-neutral approaches to obtain more robust results. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","climate change; flood peak; flood volume; impact assessment; scenario-neutral; uncertainty","Catchments; Climate models; Flood control; Floods; Runoff; Time series; Climate change impact; Flood characteristics; Flood peak; Impact assessments; Meteorological variables; Regional climate modeling; scenario-neutral; uncertainty; Climate change; catchment; climate change; climate effect; comparative study; flood; peak discharge; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058947911

Shipping emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO x ) in air over the Baltic Sea are of similar magnitude (330 ktyr -1 ) as the combined land-based NO x emissions from Finland and Sweden in all emission sectors. Deposition of nitrogen compounds originating from shipping activities contribute to eutrophication of the Baltic Sea and coastal areas in the Baltic Sea region. For the North Sea and the Baltic Sea a nitrogen emission control area (NECA) will become effective in 2021; in accordance with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) target of reducing NO x emissions from ships. Future scenarios for 2040 were designed to study the effect of enforced and planned regulation of ship emissions and the fuel efficiency development on air quality and nitrogen deposition. The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was used to simulate the current and future air quality situation. The meteorological fields, the emissions from ship traffic and the emissions from land-based sources were considered at a grid resolution of 4 × 4 km2 for the Baltic Sea region in nested CMAQ simulations. Model simulations for the present-day (2012) air quality show that shipping emissions are the major contributor to atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations over the Baltic Sea. In the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, with the introduction of the NECA, NO x emissions from ship traffic in the Baltic Sea are reduced by about 80 % in 2040. An approximate linear relationship was found between ship emissions of NO x and the simulated levels of annual average NO2 over the Baltic Sea in the year 2040, when following different future shipping scenarios. The burden of fine particulate matter (PM 2:5 ) over the Baltic Sea region is predicted to decrease by 35 %-37 % between 2012 and 2040. The reduction in PM2:5 is larger over sea, where it drops by 50 %-60 % along the main shipping routes, and is smaller over the coastal areas. The introduction of NECA is critical for reducing ship emissions of NO x to levels that are low enough to sustainably dampen ozone (O 3 ) production in the Baltic Sea region. A second important effect of the NECA over the Baltic Sea region is the reduction in secondary formation of particulate nitrate. This lowers the ship-related PM 2:5 by 72 % in 2040 compared to the present day, while it is reduced by only 48 % without implementation of the NECA. The effect of a lower fuel efficiency development on the absolute ship contribution of air pollutants is limited. Still, the annual mean ship contributions in 2040 to NO 2 , sulfur dioxide and PM 2:5 and daily maximum O3 are significantly higher if a slower fuel efficiency development is assumed. Nitrogen deposition to the seawater of the Baltic Sea decreases on average by 40 %-44 % between 2012 and 2040 in the simulations. The effect of the NECA on nitrogen deposition is most significant in the western part of the Baltic Sea. It will be important to closely monitor compliance of individual ships with the enforced and planned emission regulations. © 2019 Author(s).",,"air quality; annual variation; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; coastal zone; concentration (composition); emission control; future prospect; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Finland; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061312457

Globally, cities have established sustainability agendas and policies to guide the shift from traditional private automobile dependent transportation systems towards an increased use of public transportation, cycling, and walking. While the surrounding physical urban form and governance structures condition public transportation services, there are also many other factors to consider when discussing sustainability. As such, comprehensive planning and policy-oriented assessment frameworks that are independent of local conditions are still largely missing in literature. This paper presents a Public Transportation Sustainability Indicator List (PTSIL) that provides a platform for an integrated assessment of environmental, economic, and social dimensions of sustainability through an indicator-based approach. To demonstrate its use, the PTSIL is applied to analyze the policy documents of public transportation agencies in Helsinki, Finland, and Toronto, Canada.

Trace gas fluxes can be estimated using a variety of approaches that translate observed atmospheric species mole fractions into fluxes or emission rates, often identifying the spatial and temporal characteristics of the emission sources as well. Meteorological models are commonly combined with tracer dispersion models to estimate fluxes using an inverse approach that optimizes emissions to best fit the trace gas mole fraction observations. One way to evaluate the accuracy of atmospheric flux estimation methods is to compare results from independent methods, including approaches in which different meteorological and tracer dispersion models are used. In this work, we use a rich data set of atmospheric methane observations collected during an intensive airborne campaign to compare different methane emissions estimates from the Barnett Shale oil and natural gas production basin in Texas, USA. We estimate emissions based on a variety of different meteorological and dispersion models. Previous estimates of methane emissions from this region relied on a simple model (a mass balance analysis) as well as on ground-based measurements and statistical data analysis (an inventory). We find that in addition to meteorological model choice, the choice of tracer dispersion model also has a significant impact on the predicted downwind methane concentrations given the same emissions field. The dispersion models tested often underpredicted the observed methane enhancements with significant variability (up to a factor of 3) between different models and between different days. We examine possible causes for this result and find that the models differ in their simulation of vertical dispersion, indicating that additional work is needed to evaluate and improve vertical mixing in the tracer dispersion models commonly used in regional trace gas flux inversions. © 2019.

Parallel hybrid construction, which is equipped with internal combustion engine and electric motor, for the propulsion of vehicle is one of the most preferred alternatives for hybridization. The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes in the fuel consumption and exhaust emissions in the powertrain components for a parallel hybrid with torque coupling unit for different values of gear ratios. Investigation of the effects of gear ratios on the torque coupling unit, gearbox unit, and differential is performed by simulating the parallel hybrid powertrain in the MATLAB® and Simulink® environment. New European Drive Cycle speed and acceleration requirements are defined as the input parameters for this simulation. The fuel consumption, exhaust emission, and state of charge of the battery are determined according to the power requirement of internal combustion engine and electric motor. Five different gear ratio combinations are simulated. These combinations are arranged by using alternative ratios in the third stage of gearbox unit, torque coupling unit, and differential. The best gear ratio distribution among these combinations are determined for reducing the fuel consumption and the carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. It is found that an improvement of 17% in the fuel consumption and reductions of 9.1% in the CO2, 18% in the CO, 4% in the HC, and 8% in the NOx emissions can be achieved by the proper arrangements of gear ratios in the powertrain components. © 2018","Exhaust emissions; Fuel consumption; Hybrid vehicle; Powertrain simulation","Air pollution; Automotive industry; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Charging (batteries); Combustion; Fuel consumption; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gears; Greenhouse gases; Internal combustion engines; MATLAB; Nitrogen oxides; Powertrains; Traction motors; Automotive sector; Exhaust emission; Hybrid applications; Parallel hybrid vehicle; Parallel hybrids; Power requirement; Powertrain components; Powertrain simulation; Hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057148326

The SDGs set a number of socioeconomic and environmental targets to be achieved by 2030, and the Paris Climate Agreement provides a framework for the international community to stay below the 2 °C temperature threshold. Such a range of ambitious goals will require measures that can simultaneously address several issues and produce multiple co-benefits, from improved water quality to reduced food waste. A joint approach to reducing nitrogen and phosphorus pollution is a prime example given their myriad impacts on the environment and human health. This study assesses the national climate plans of fifteen countries for language indicating a target or clear commitment that could involve improved N and P management. These countries represent 75% of both global greenhouse gas emissions and N and P consumption. We find that a joint approach could make important contributions to achieving all the national climate plans analyzed and 7 out of 17 SDGs. Joint abatement measures exist for wastewater, agriculture and consumer behavior. Challenges to a joint approach to nitrogen and phosphorus management include their role as essential nutrients and key differences in their availability and chemistry. Whilst there is currently insufficient integration between science, policies and practice on this issue, near-term policy opportunities exist. Looking forward, how humanity manages its relationship with these essential nutrients over the coming decades will be a key bellwether of whether sustainable development is truly achievable. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental Policy; Nitrogen; Paris Climate Agreement; Phosphorus; Sustainable Development Goals","nitrogen; phosphorus; agriculture; Article; carbon footprint; climate; consumer attitude; environmental management; environmental policy; environmental temperature; food waste; priority journal; sustainable development; United Nations; waste management; waste water; water quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056462611

In order to assess a community’s adaptation strategies, understanding of how different groups in that community comprehend climate change is crucial. Public risk perception is important as it can induce or confine political, economic, and social actions dealing with particular hazards. Climate change adaptation is a well-established policy discourse in Bangladesh that has made its people more or less aware of it. Similarly, shrimp-farming communities in southwestern Bangladesh understand environmental and climate change in their own ways. In order to understand how the shrimp-farming communities in coastal Bangladesh perceive current climate instabilities, we conducted a qualitative study in shrimp-farming villages in coastal Bangladesh where about 80% of commercial shrimp of the country is cultivated. We compared farmers’ perceptions of local climate change with existing scientific knowledge and found remarkable similarities. Our assessment shows that at least two factors are critical for this outcome: coastal people’s exposure to and experience of frequent climate extremes; and a radical approach to defining climate regimes in Bangladesh by various stakeholders and the media, depicting anthropogenic global warming as a certainty for the country. Thus, a convergence of scientific construct and sociocultural construct construes the level of awareness of the general public about climate change. © 2019 by the authors.","Bangladesh; Industrial aquaculture; Popular discourse of climate change; Radical approach","adaptive management; assessment method; climate change; global warming; perception; qualitative analysis; shrimp culture; stakeholder; agricultural worker; aquaculture; Article; awareness; Bangladesh; climate change; drought; flooding; human; hurricane; perception; salinity; sea level rise; shrimp farming; social class; summer; temperature sensitivity; winter; animal; environmental policy; follow up; Penaeidae; psychology; risk; shellfish; Bangladesh; Decapoda (Crustacea); Animals; Aquaculture; Bangladesh; Climate Change; Environmental Policy; Farmers; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Penaeidae; Perception; Risk; Shellfish",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065544729

NOx emissions depended on the combustion and working temperature of the SCR catalysts, and PM emissions were low. Alkanes dominated the non-methane volatile organic compound (NMVOC) emissions, 43–59% of which resulted from the low efficiency of the oxidation catalyst for alkane. The after-treatment system and the engine start conditions influenced the chemical components of the NMVOC emissions due to incomplete combustion and the evaporation of liquid fuel. Formaldehyde comprised the largest portion of the aldehydes, whereas PAH emissions remained largely undetected. Furthermore, formaldehyde was the largest contributor to the NMHCs, forming 14–29%.

It will start with a coverage of electricity supply sector and eight pilot regions. Due to a highly regulated dispatch and pricing system in the electricity supply sector, the additional emission abatement costs brought by the ETS cannot be automatically conveyed between consumers and producers in all regions. This paper modeled the cost transmission of ETS in three scenarios based on the quantification results of regional and sectoral emission flows in the electricity supply sector under consumption-based accounting. The results show that the emissions transferred into pilot cities outweighed the emissions transferred out, not only through direct electricity uses but also through the indirect emissions embodied in other sectors that required intermediate inputs from electricity supply sectors in the pilot cities. Through the cost transmission mechanism, the additional abatement cost caused by the national ETS drove the increases in the household consumption of several energy-intensive sectors, including the metal mining sector in Hebei, the petroleum and gas sector in Heilongjiang, and the nonmetal mining sector in Sichuan, with a sensitive increase of 10.1%, 9.9%, and 3.5%, respectively. However, most sectors (745 of the 810) would suffer an increase rate below 0.1%.

It provides evidence that resilience, as commonly understood, is inadequate for understanding the intersecting vulnerabilities that women face because of embedded socio-cultural norms and practices. These vulnerabilities culminate in a gendered experience of climate stress, where some groups of women are more likely go without education, food and access to good quality water. Such circuits of control highlight the importance of a more radical, transformational, gendered and power sensitive frame for moving beyond coping mechanisms to strategies that deal with the fundamental root causes of vulnerability to climate stress.

Climatic and environmental shifts also had profound effects on human societies in the past, and archaeology has a key role in helping us understand how humans, animals and the broader ecosystem responds and adapts to environmental change. Understanding human-environmental interactions on local, regional, and global scales is therefore not only a key part of better understanding the past, but also for informing the present. A significant area to explore is the palaeoecology of archaeologically-important prey-species, both as a means of more accurately reconstructing ancient landscapes and ecosystems, but also for better understanding past human activity, landscape use and faunal resource exploitation. New biomolecular approaches, and particularly isotope zooarchaeology, have enhanced our ability to reconstruct past ecosystem dynamics, paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic conditions, and the economic strategies that humans used to cope with them. However, the integration of multiple lines of evidence and methodologies remains the most powerful approach towards studying environmental change, resilience and adaptation in the past, not only for the benefit of archaeologists but other specialists. This special section of Journal of Archaeological Science Reports draws together papers using a range of methodologies to understand past human interactions with their environments, from Alaska, to Coastal Brazil, Europe and beyond. Studies are on a range of scales, from individual sites to big data, multi-site analyses, and encompass periods from Palaeolithic to the Middle Ages. Given the multi-faceted nature of the human past, archaeologists need to use a broad range of datasets to best understand environmental change and its impact on humans and animals. By drawing on inter-disciplinary specialisations and working alongside experts from other fields it will be possible to gain a more integrated and complete understanding of the ecological, economic, social and cultural effects of climatic and environmental changes on past populations. © 2019","Palaeoclimate; Palaeoecology; Palaeoenvironment; Prehistory; Stable isotope analysis",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063087430

We focus on countries that hold 80% of global fossil fuel reserves and compare them with key countries that have meagre fossil fuel reserves. We show that those countries with large domestic fossil fuel reserves have experienced a large increase in primary energy demand from fossil fuels, but only a moderate or no increase in primary energy from renewables, and in particular from non-hydro renewable energy sources (NHRES), which are assumed to represent the cornerstone of the future transformation of the global energy system. This implies a tremendous threat to climate change mitigation, with only two principal mitigation options for fossil-fuel-rich economies if there is to be compliance with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement: (1) leave the fossil fuels in the ground; and (2) apply carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Combinations of these two options to exploit their respective possibilities synergistically will require strong initiatives and incentives to transform a certain amount of the domestic fossil fuel reserves (including the associated infrastructure) into stranded assets and to create an extensive CCS infrastructure. Our conclusion is that immediate and disruptive changes to the use of fossil fuels and investments in non-carbon-emitting technologies are required if global warming is to be limited to well below 2°C. Collective actions along value chains in business to divert from fossil fuels may be a feasible strategy. Key policy insights The main obstacle to compliance with any reasonable warming target is the abundance of fossil fuels, which has maintained and increased momentum towards new fossil-fuelled processes. So far, there has been no increase in the share of NHRES in total global primary energy demand, with a clear decline in the NHRES share in India and China. There is an immediate need for the global community to develop fossil fuel strategies and policies.

However, due to the limited geographic range in which MFI branches can provide their services, households located far from a branch typically do not have access to microfinance. In this study, we measured how spatial accessibility (SA) to microfinance varied across 18 sub-districts (upazilas) of southwest Bangladesh, a region heavily affected by climate-related hazards including flooding and high soil salinity. Our objective was to identify if accessibility to microfinance was negatively affected by climate hazards due to, e.g., higher lending risks in hazard-prone areas. For this, we incorporated geospatial data sets related to flood hazard, soil salinity, population density, and transportation infrastructure as explanatory variables for regression modeling of SA. We tested both ordinary least squares (OLS) regression and geographically-weighted regression (GWR) approaches, and found that GWR was better able to predict SA. The GWR model for the SA measure “distance to nearest branch” had the strongest relationship with the explanatory variables (adjusted R2 = 0.717), and in this model (and four of five other models tested), high flood hazard and high soil salinity were negatively correlated with accessibility to microfinance. To increase microfinance accessibility in these climate hazard-prone areas, additional funding for MFI outreach activities (e.g. utilizing national/international climate change funds), reduction of transaction costs, and further experimentation with adapting/packaging MFI services, may be required. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate vulnerability; Disaster resilience; Gravity model; GWR; Kernel density estimation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054434163

For a precise model of the LP-EGR rate, the transport delay for each cycle and the highly nonlinear flow characteristics should be considered. This paper proposes an artificial neural network (ANN) architecture using multiple combustion parameters calculated from the in-cylinder pressure to precisely estimate the LP-EGR rate without time delay and capture the highly nonlinear flow characteristics. The ANN model was trained with Levenberg-Marquardt back-propagation using steady-state data of 9000 cycles and validated using the cross-validation technique. In this work, three optimization algorithms are introduced and compared to search for the optimal values of the ANN's hyper-parameters: random search (RS), tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE), and hyper-parameter optimization via radial basis function and dynamic coordinate search (HORD). As a result, all three algorithms effectively improved the efficiency to search multidimensional hyper-parameters, with the validation performance R2 above 0.98 and a total RMSE of less than 0.76%. This means that all three methods were successful to find the hyper-parameters’ values for the precise LP-EGR rate estimation. Among the three algorithms the HORD showed the best performance with stable convergence, the R2 values of 0.9896 or more, and a total RMSE of 0.63%. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial neural network (ANN); EGR estimation; Hyper-parameter optimization; In-cylinder pressure; LP-EGR; Turbocharged GDI engine","Backpropagation; Diesel engines; Efficiency; Engine cylinders; Neural networks; Optimization; Radial basis function networks; Combustion parameters; Cross-validation technique; GDI engine; Hyper-parameter optimizations; In-cylinder pressures; LP-EGR; Optimization algorithms; Radial basis functions; Parameter estimation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059316304

To this end, we employ a panel quantile regression to test the endogenous relationship between public transportation scale and carbon emissions. The results suggest that the effect of public transportation scale on carbon emissions is heterogeneous across China’s provinces based on the level of carbon emissions. Even so, the results still support a stable inverted U-shaped relationship between public transportation scale and carbon emissions for provinces with different levels of carbon emissions. That is, when public transportation scale exceeds a threshold value, the relationship between public transportation and carbon emissions will turn from positive to negative.

Consistent assessment of storm surge inundation risk that links probability of hazard occurrence to distribution of economic consequence are scarce due to the lack of historical data and uncertainty of climate change, especially at local scales. This paper proposes a simulation-based method to construct exceedance probability (EP) curves for representing storm surge risk and identifying the economic impact of climate change in the coastal areas of Ise Bay, Japan. The region-specific exceedance probability curves show that risk could be different among different districts. The industry-specific exceedance probability curves show that manufacturing, transport and postal activities, electricity, gas, heat supply and water, and wholesale and retail trade are the most affected sectors in terms of property damage. Services also need to be of concern in terms of business interruption loss. Exceedance probability curves provide complete risk information and our simulation-based approach can contribute to a better understanding of storm surge risk, improve the quantitative assessment of the climate change-driven impacts on coastal areas, and identify vulnerable regions and industrial sectors in detail. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Economic impact; Exceedance probability curves; Ise Bay; Storm surge inundation","climate change; coastal zone; economic impact; hazard assessment; probability; risk assessment; simulation; storm surge; vulnerability; Honshu; Ise Bay; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061791972

It might still be long before air quality reaches the National Class II standard of 35 μg/m3. Objective: We aim to estimate the potential reduction in premature mortality by reducing indoor PM2.5 levels in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region and compare it with reducing outdoor levels. Methods: We combined PM2.5 transport model and the Global Burden of Disease (2016) methodology to estimate potential reductions in premature mortality attributable to PM2.5 by reducing indoor PM2.5 to National Class I standard of 15 μg/m3, and compared with reducing outdoor PM2.5 to Government 2020 Interim target of 64 μg/m3 or National Class II standard of 35 μg/m3. Results: A total of 74,000 (95% confidence interval (CI): 43,000–111,000) premature deaths were attributable to PM2.5 exposure in 2013. Thirty percent, or 22,000 (95% CI: 17,000–32,000) deaths, would have been averted if indoor PM2.5 had reached the National Class I standard. The benefit is greater than that from reaching the Government 2020 Interim target for outdoor PM2.5 [22%, or 16,000 (95% CI: 12,000–23,000), deaths], although still smaller than that from reaching the National Class II standard [42%, or 31,000 (95% CI: 24,000–45,000), deaths]. Conclusions: Reaching the National Class I level of indoor PM2.5 at current outdoor pollution levels could bring considerable health benefits, which are comparable to those from reaching the Government 2020 Interim target for outdoor PM2.5.

In response to PM2.5 pollution problem in China, this study first analyzed the correlation between the intercalibrated Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Operational Linescan System (OLS) sensor nighttime stable light (NSL) data and statistical PM2.5 emissions at the provincial level from 1992 to 2012 respectively and the results demonstrated that there was a positive correlation between the intercalibrated DMSP-OLS NSL data and PM2.5 emissions. Then linear regression analysis was proposed to simulate spatiotemporal dynamics of PM2.5 emission at the 1 km resolution level in China by the intercalibrated DMSP-OLS NSL data and PM2.5 emission. Spatiotemporal dynamics of PM2.5 emission were analyzed from national scale down to regional and urban agglomeration scales. The results clearly showed that the variations of PM2.5 emissions in different regions and urban agglomerations were different and large. The high growth type and high grade of PM2.5 emissions were mainly located in the Eastern region, Central region, Shandong Peninsula and Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan, with significant lower concentrations in the Western region, Northeastern region, Sichuan-Chongqing and Middle south of Liaoning. Considering the spatial and temporal patterns of PM2.5 emissions between the four economic regions, the mitigation strategies for Eastern and Central China should mainly focus on the industry structure adjustments, while Western and Northern China should pay more attention to the optimizations of regional energy structures and improvements of energy efficiencies. The results of this study is not only beneficial to understand accurately the regional discrepancies of spatiotemporal PM2.5 emission dynamics, but also helpful for proposing mitigation policies in air pollution control and providing scientific support for regional sustainable development. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","China; DMSP-OLS; PM2.5 emissions; Spatiotemporal dynamics","Agglomeration; Dynamics; Energy efficiency; Planning; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; China; Defense Meteorological Satellite Programs; Dmsp-ols; Nighttime stable lights; Operational linescan system (OLS); Regional sustainable development; Spatial and temporal patterns; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057153492

In this paper, a three-dimensional dynamic simulation model coupling with the chemical kinetic mechanisms was established using CONVERGE software and validated by the experimental data. The numerical model was implemented for evaluating the influences of varying duel-spark plug locations on flow field distributions, combustion processes and major emissions formation of a gasoline rotary engine with hydrogen direct injection enrichment. Simulation results showed that, a mainstream flow field formed during the end period of the compression stoke whose direction was identical to the rotor rotating direction. The variation of trailing-spark plug location resulted in slight influence on the mean flow velocity as well as notable impact on hydrogen concentration and turbulent kinetic energy distribution. It was conducive to initial ignition when the local equivalence ratio was intensified near the duel-spark plug on the leading side of the combustion chamber. Higher hydrogen concentration near spark plugs could effectively improve the combustion intensity. The preferable combustion and emission performance were achieved when the duel-spark plug positioned symmetrically with respect to the minor axis. Compared with the scheme of the closest duel-spark plug, the peak pressure increased by 24.4% and corresponding crank position advanced by 9.2°CA. Despite nitric oxides emissions increased slightly, carbon monoxide emission notably reduced by 57.6% versus the scheme of the farthest duel-spark plug. When the leading-spark plug remained constant, the trailing-spark plug arranged on the major axis of cylinder wall and kept an appropriate offset from the minor axis was recommended in engineering applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Combustion process; Dual-spark plug; Gasoline rotary engine; Hydrogen direct-injection; Ignition arrangement","Carbon monoxide; Combustion chambers; Computer software; Direct injection; Flow fields; Flow velocity; Gasoline; Ignition; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Nitric oxide; Carbon monoxide emissions; Chemical kinetic mechanism; Combustion and emission performance; Combustion pro-cess; Dual spark plugs; Engineering applications; Three-dimensional dynamics; Turbulent kinetic energy distribution; Spark plugs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058675931

Furthermore, non-exhaust emissions are a growing concern due to the high concentrations of redox active metals that can be present. The temporal and spatial variabilities of traffic-related PM2.5 sources were investigated in this study by comparing source contributions between two near-road sites. In order to identify local PM2.5 sources with greater temporal and spatial resolution, receptor modeling was performed for hourly-resolved organics, inorganic ions, trace elements, and black carbon in PM2.5 simultaneously measured at downtown and highway sites located within 15 m of a major roadway and highway, respectively, in Toronto. The source apportionment study revealed that traffic-related PM2.5 sources were mainly from exhaust emissions (9%–19% of PM2.5) and non-exhaust emissions including brake wear (2%–6%) and resuspension of road dust (3%–4%). The traffic-related sources exhibited strong diurnal and spatial variabilities, whereas no spatial and temporal differences were observed for the largest PM2.5 contributors, oxidized organic aerosol and secondary sulphate. During morning rush hours, the overall contribution of traffic exhaust and non-exhaust emissions were elevated up to 35%–48% of total PM2.5 mass, which was found to be the largest PM2.5 source at the highway site and the second largest contributor in the downtown area. Furthermore, the contribution of traffic-related sources at the highway site was higher than at the downtown site by a factor of 2–3, suggesting that exposure to traffic-related emissions varies greatly in space and time. Nearly one-third of the traffic-related source contributions were associated with non-exhaust emissions from brake wear and road dust resuspension in the urban environment. Elevated levels of non-exhaust sources were correlated with the number of heavy-duty vehicles, rather than total traffic volume. Although the contribution of brake wear and road dust sources to total PM2.5 mass was relatively low, non-exhaust emissions contributed a substantial fraction of trace elements, especially for Ba (74–79%), Cu (66–71%), and Mn (53–65%) in the urban atmosphere. © 2018","Exhaust emissions; Non-exhaust emissions; Non-tailpipe; Source apportionment; Trace metal; Traffic-related PM2.5","Brakes; Dust; Exhaust systems (engine); Metals; Redox reactions; Roads and streets; Sulfur compounds; Wear of materials; Exhaust emission; Non-tailpipe; Source apportionment; Trace metal; Traffic-related; Trace elements; black carbon; ion; trace element; aerosol; black carbon; comparative study; concentration (composition); dust; exhaust emission; particulate matter; pollutant source; resuspension; road; source apportionment; spatial variation; temporal variation; trace metal; urban ecosystem; aerosol; air monitoring; Article; Canada; circadian rhythm; comparative study; controlled study; dust; exhaust gas; highway; mass; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; traffic; urban area; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055514109

It brings with it a number of negative consequences for human health, well-being, social and economic performance, and negative ecological impacts, including emissions, which contribute to climate change. Therefore, in order to improve urban quality of life and address the ""20-20-20 strategy"" of global objectives, we propose a series of pilot projects that introduce significant planning, managerial and technology initiatives combined to enhance cooperation between European citizens and experts. To increase the extent and health of urban cultivation and maximize the benefits of an urban canopy, cities need an integrated approach and innovations from city planners, engineers, and landscape architects, as well as citizen advocacy and participation along the lines of public-private partnerships. We presume that even if various actors share a common vision, it needs more knowledge for maximum benefits to develop. Our thesis is that urban cultivation can play a significant role as a catalyst for socio-economic sustainability. Comparing benefits from urban forest and agrarian functions, which in many places would compete for the same space, would be necessary. There is now an increasing body of knowledge that several measures of high urban density - including residential, retail, and service density, street-intersection density, and land-use diversity - might have important public health consequences. With more evidence, one can plan neighbourhoods that are more compact and more attractive (thanks to activity-influencing factors such as local services, public transport, leisure, agrarian activities and more), halt invasive sprawl, promote physical activity and social interaction, and shield from environmental and social negatives, such as pollution and feeling unsafe. In this project, the Nature-Based Solutions concept will be applied to improve the impact on quality of life. In this sense, CitAgra would leverage the EU agenda by making the project a form of pilot implementation. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Architecture; Climate change; Ecology; Economics; Health; Land use; Project management; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Economic performance; Integrated approach; Landscape architects; Pilot implementation; Public private partnerships; Social interactions; Street intersection; Urban quality of life; Cultivation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062386314

Development of effective SWM strategies should consider comprehensive SWM process choices and policy implications on system-level cost and environmental performance. This analysis evaluated cost and select environmental implications of SWM policies for Wake County, North Carolina using a life-cycle approach. A county-specific data set and scenarios were developed to evaluate alternatives for residential municipal SWM, which included combinations of a mixed waste material recovery facility (MRF), anaerobic digestion, and waste-to-energy combustion in addition to existing SWM infrastructure (composting, landfilling, single stream recycling). Multiple landfill diversion and budget levels were considered for each scenario. At maximum diversion, the greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation costs ranged from 30 to 900 $/MTCO 2 e; the lower values were when a mixed waste MRF was used, and the higher values when anaerobic digestion was used. Utilization of the mixed waste MRF was sensitive to the efficiency of material separation and operating cost. Maintaining the current separate collection scheme limited the potential for cost and GHG reductions. Municipalities seeking to cost-effectively increase landfill diversion while reducing GHGs should consider waste-to-energy, mixed waste separation, and changes to collection. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Anaerobic digestion; Artificial life; Budget control; Cost reduction; Environmental management; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Life cycle; Magnetorheological fluids; Public policy; Separation; Solid wastes; Storm sewers; Waste incineration; Efficiency of materials; Environmental implications; Environmental performance; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Life cycle approach; Material recovery facilities; Policy implications; Single-stream recycling; Cost benefit analysis; anaerobic digestion; cost analysis; data set; emission control; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; local government; performance assessment; pollution policy; recycling; solid waste; strategic approach; waste management; anaerobic digestion; Article; combustion; composting; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; landfill; solid waste management; waste-to-energy; city; greenhouse effect; human; North Carolina; solid waste; waste disposal; waste management; North Carolina; United States; Wake County; Cities; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Humans; North Carolina; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061874000

To reduce the uncertainty associated with a single parameter set, random sampling of the steady-state metabolite concentrations and the enzyme kinetic parameters was employed, resulting in millions of parameterized models which were analyzed for flux control and stability against perturbation.

Low substrate saturation and high product saturation of enzymes involved in highly interconnected reactions correlated with increased network stability. Flux control, that is the effect that a change in one reaction rate has on the other reactions in the network, was distributed and mostly exerted by energy supply (ATP), but also by cofactor supply (NADPH). Sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphatase/fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase, and transketolase had a weak but positive effect on overall network flux, in agreement with published observations. The identified flux control and relationships between metabolite concentrations and system stability can guide metabolic engineering. The kinetic model structure and parameterizing framework can be expanded for analysis of metabolic systems beyond the Calvin cycle. © 2018 The Author(s).","Calvin cycle; cyanobacteria; flux control; kinetic model; metabolic engineering; metabolic model; metabolome; parameter sampling; system stability","biological model; carbon cycle; kinetics; metabolome; photosynthesis; physiology; Synechocystis; Carbon Cycle; Kinetics; Metabolome; Models, Biological; Photosynthesis; Synechocystis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061144018

Fluxes were measured using closed incubation chambers connected to a CRDS analyzer. They were performed during low tide at light, in the dark, and in the dark after having removed the top 1–2 mm of soil, which may contain biofilm. CO2 and CH4 fluxes ranged from 31.34 to 187.48 mmol m−2 day− 1 and from 39.36 to 428.09 μmol m−2 day− 1, respectively. Both CO2 and CH4 emissions showed a strong seasonal variability with higher fluxes measured during the warm season, due to an enhanced production of these two gases within the soil. Furthermore, CO2 fluxes were higher in the dark than at light, evidencing photosynthetic processes at the soil surface and thus the role of biofilm in the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from mangrove soils. The mean δ13C-CO2 value of the CO2 fluxes measured was −19.76 ± 1.19‰ which was depleted compared to the one emitted by root respiration (−22.32 ± 1.06‰), leaf litter decomposition (−21.43 ± 1.89‰) and organic matter degradation (−22.33 ± 1.82‰). This result confirmed the use of the CO2 produced within the soil by the biofilm developing at its surface. After removing the top 1–2 mm of soil, both CO2 and CH4 fluxes increased. Enhancement of CH4 fluxes suggests that biofilm may act as a physical barrier to the transfer of GHG from the soil to the atmosphere. However, the δ13C-CO2 became more enriched, evidencing that the biofilm was not integrally removed, and that its partial removal resulted in physical disturbance that stimulated CO2 production. Therefore, this study provides useful information to understand the global implication of mangroves in climate change mitigation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biofilm; Blue carbon; Carbon stable isotopes; Greenhouse gas; Semi-arid mangrove; Soil fluxes","Biofilms; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Carbon stable isotopes; Climate change mitigation; Leaf litter decomposition; Organic matter degradations; Physical disturbance; Seasonal variability; Semi arid; Soil flux; Soils; carbon dioxide; methane; organic matter; carbon dioxide; methane; biofilm; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; climate change; emission inventory; forest soil; global perspective; greenhouse gas; mangrove; methane; photosynthesis; semiarid region; soil emission; stable isotope; temperature effect; Article; biofilm; carbon footprint; climate change; darkness; ebb tide; environmental temperature; greenhouse gas; leaf litter; litter decomposition; mangrove; New Caledonia; photosynthesis; priority journal; root respiration; seasonal variation; semiarid climate; thermoregulation; transport kinetics; air pollutant; analysis; environmental monitoring; physiology; Rhizophoraceae; season; soil; temperature; wetland; New Caledonia [Melanesia]; New Caledonia [New Caledonia (DPN)]; Rhizophora; Rhizophoraceae; Air Pollutants; Biofilms; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Methane; New Caledonia; Rhizophoraceae; Seasons; Soil; Temperature; Wetlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053111165

Studies into risk perceptions have acknowledged differences between public and expert knowledge. What is less known is how perceptions of climate change related health risk vary between the public and health experts and how these differentiated perceptions are shaped and modified by everyday complex climate change narratives from multiple actors, and contextual ecologies of social and physical spaces. A concurrent mixed-methods approach was used to elucidate climate change knowledge and awareness of climate-related health risks among health experts and the public. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected on community members (n = 927) and health experts (n = 99) in Savelugu-Nanton and Ada East Districts in Ghana. The results showed that both groups were likely to report climate change-related health concerns, of which disease was the top concern. However, differences exist in public and experts’ perceptions of climate change health linkage. Community members were less likely to link climate change to health risks compared with health experts (OR = 0.02, p ≤ 0.000). The contrasting climate change health risk perceptions between health experts and the public adds to the literature on the health dimensions of global environmental change. The findings from this study highlight limited knowledge about climate change health related risks among the public. Hence, in building sustainable communities in light of persistent climate change impacts, it is crucial to improve climate change adaptation by implementing climate change sensitization programs. In addition, health infrastructure, decision-making and management should be strengthened for effective response to emerging climate-health risks in Ghana and similar contexts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Climate change knowledge; Climate-induced health problems; Ghana; Health risk perception; Public health","climate change; conceptual framework; health risk; knowledge; public health; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; risk perception; adult; Article; climate change; demography; environmental health; environmental protection; female; Ghana; health education; health hazard; health personnel attitude; health practitioner; health promotion; human; information processing; learning environment; male; medical expert; middle aged; public opinion; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; social status; adolescent; aged; attitude to health; health care personnel; psychology; public health; qualitative research; risk assessment; young adult; Ghana; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Climate Change; Female; Ghana; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Public Health; Public Opinion; Qualitative Research; Risk Assessment; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060651240

So photocatalytic reduction of CO2 into chemical fuels is a promising strategy. Here, a Z-scheme porous g-C3N4/Sn2S3-diethylenetriamine (Pg-C3N4/Sn2S3-DETA) composite without an electron intermediary is designed. Photocatalytic performance of the as-fabricated samples is investigated on the basis of photocatalytic CO2 reduction (PCR) to form CH4 and CH3OH. We find that the Z-scheme heterostructure photocatalysts show a higher PCR performance than Pg-C3N4 and Sn2S3-DETA. An optimized Pg-C3N4/Sn2S3-DETA heterostructure sample displays high CH4 production rate of 4.84 μmol h−1 g−1 and CH3OH-production rate of 1.35 μmol h−1 g−1 with 5% Pg-C3N4 content. The superior PCR performance could be ascribed to the special structure of a direct Z-scheme Pg-C3N4/Sn2S3-DETA photocatalyst, which is beneficial to efficient separation of electron-hole pairs. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation further confirms the presence of direct Z-scheme mechanism. This Z-scheme heterostructure photocatalyst with superior performance may inaugurate the perspective on a new promising hierarchy of materials on CO2 photoreduction. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Diethylenetriamine; Photocatalytic CO2reduction; Porous g-C3N4; Sn2S3; Z-scheme","Carbon dioxide; Density functional theory; Global warming; Photocatalysts; Diethylenetriamine; Photo-catalytic; Porous g-C3N4; Sn2S3; Z-scheme; Tin compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054086969

The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) has developed remedial guidelines and a risk assessment framework for both ecological and human exposure to PHC. One of the assumptions used in the derivation of these guidelines is that plants are unable to take up PHC from contaminated soil and therefore subsequent exposure at higher trophic levels is not a concern. However, various studies suggest that plants are indeed able to take up PHC into their tissues. Consumption of plants is a potential exposure pathway in both ecological (e.g., herbivorous and omnivorous birds, and mammals) and human health risk assessments. If plants can uptake PHC, then the current approach for risk assessment of PHC may underestimate exposures to ecological and human receptors. The present review aims to assess whether or not plants are capable of PHC uptake and accumulation. Twenty-one articles were deemed relevant to the study objective and form the basis of this review. Of the 21 primary research articles, 19 reported detectable PHC and/or its constituents in plant tissues. All but five of the 21 articles were published after the publication of the CCME Canada-Wide Standards. Overall, the present literature review provides some evidence of uptake of PHC and its constituents into plant tissues. Various plant species, including some edible plants, were shown to take up PHC from contaminated soil and aqueous media in both laboratory and field studies. Based on the findings of this review, it is recommended that the soil-plant-wildlife/human pathway should be considered in risk assessments to avoid underestimating exposure and subsequent toxicological risks to humans and wildlife. The findings of this review indicate that the soil-plant-wildlife/human exposure pathway may be complete and as such, risk assessors may want to consider more fully this pathway in human and ecological risk assessments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Petroleum hydrocarbons; PHC; Phytoremediation; Plant uptake; Risk assessment","Bioremediation; Crude oil; Gasoline; Health risks; Histology; Hydrocarbons; Mammals; Soil pollution; Soils; Tissue; Canadian council of ministers of the environments; Human and ecological risk assessment; Human health risk assessment; Laboratory and field studies; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Phytoremediation; Plant uptake; Risk assessment framework; Risk assessment; petroleum derivative; hydrocarbon; petroleum; bioaccumulation; environmental risk; health risk; literature review; petroleum hydrocarbon; phytoremediation; pollution exposure; risk assessment; soil pollution; toxicology; aqueous solution; bioaccumulation; chemical composition; controlled study; edible plant; indicator organism; nonhuman; plant; plant tissue; Review; soil pollution; uptake assay; analysis; bioremediation; Canada; chemistry; ecology; human; metabolism; physiology; plant; pollution; soil; soil pollutant; transport at the cellular level; Canada; Aves; Mammalia; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biological Transport; Canada; Ecology; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Hydrocarbons; Petroleum; Plants; Soil; Soil Pollutants",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056628294

Here, we examine this choice by using an intermediate complexity climate model to compare the 1 % experiment to an idealized <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">CO2</span> pathway derived from a logistic function. The comparison shows three key differences in model output when forcing the model with the logistic experiment. (1) The model forced with the logistic experiment exhibits a transition of the land biosphere from a carbon sink to a carbon source, a feature absent when forcing the model with the 1 % experiment. (2) The ocean uptake of carbon comes to dominate the carbon cycle as emissions decline, a feature that cannot be captured when forcing a model with the 1 % experiment, as emissions always increase in that experiment. (3) The permafrost carbon feedback to climate change under the 1 % experiment forcing is less than half the strength of the feedback seen under logistic experiment forcing. Using the logistic experiment also allows smooth transition to zero or negative emissions states, allowing these states to be examined without sharp discontinuities in <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">CO2</span> emissions. The protocol for the CMIP6 iteration of C<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">4</span>MIP again sets the 1 % experiment as the benchmark experiment for model intercomparison; however, clever use of the Tier 2 experiments may alleviate some of the limitations outlined here.

However, little is known about how land conservation could help mitigate adverse water-sustainability impacts. In this paper, we utilized the InVEST tool and the Residual Trends method to assess the joint effects and relative contributions of climate change and land conservation on freshwater ecosystem services in the Portneuf River catchment in Idaho, USA. We developed five hypothesized scenarios regarding gain and loss in the enrollment of Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), the largest agricultural land-retirement program in the U.S., plus riparian buffer and assessed their interactions with climate change. Results suggest that the realized water yield in the Portneuf River catchment would possibly be 56% less due to climate change and 24% less due to the decline of CRP enrollment. On the contrary, if CRP enrollment is promoted by ~30% and riparian buffer protection is implemented, the water supply reduction in the year 2050 could be changed from 56% to 26%, the total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) export would be reduced by 10% and 11%, and the total suspended sediment (TSS) reduced by 17%. This study suggests that increasing implementation of the CRP would likely preserve key freshwater ecosystem services and assist proactive mitigation, especially for semiarid regions vulnerable to changing climate conditions. © 2018","Climate change mitigation; Conservation Reserve Program (CRP); Freshwater ecosystem services; Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST); Portneuf River; Scenario analysis","Arid regions; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Rivers; Runoff; Suspended sediments; Sustainable development; Water conservation; Water supply; Climate change mitigation; Conservation reserve program; Freshwater ecosystem; Scenario analysis; Valuation of ecosystem services; Climate change; nitrogen; phosphorus; rain; catchment; climate change; ecosystem service; environmental degradation; freshwater ecosystem; integrated approach; land use planning; scenario analysis; semiarid region; trade-off; air temperature; Article; catchment; climate change; cropland; environmental erosion; environmental protection; fertilizer application; flow rate; forest; freshwater ecosystem services degradation; freshwater environment; land conservation; particle resuspension; precipitation; priority journal; rangeland; runoff; semiarid climate; United States; water and water related phenomena; water management; water supply; water yield; agriculture; ecosystem; environmental protection; Idaho; procedures; river; theoretical model; water conservation; Idaho; Portneuf River; United States; Agriculture; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Conservation of Water Resources; Ecosystem; Idaho; Models, Theoretical; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054572957

However, a finer resolution and spatially continuous forest AGB map is inaccessible at national level in China. In this study, we developed forest type- and ecozone-specific allometric models based on 1607 field plots. The allometric models were applied to Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) data to calculate AGB at the footprint level. We then mapped a 30 m resolution national forest AGB by relating the GLAS footprint AGB to various variables derived from Landsat images and Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data. We estimated the average forest AGB to be 69.88 Mg/ha with a standard deviation of 35.38 Mg/ha and the total AGB carbon stock to be 5.44 PgC in China. Our AGB estimates corresponded reasonably well with AGB inventories from the top ten provinces in the forested area, and the coefficient of determination and root mean square error were 0.73 and 20.65 Mg/ha, respectively. We found that the main uncertainties for AGB estimation could be attributed to errors in allometric models and in height measurements by the GLAS. We also found that Landsat-derived variables outperform PALSAR-derived variables and that the textural features of PALSAR better support forest AGB estimates than backscattered intensity. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon storage; Forest aboveground biomass; ICESat/GLAS; PALSAR imagery","Aneroid altimeters; Biodiversity; Biomass; Climate change; Digital storage; Mean square error; Radio altimeters; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; Uncertainty analysis; Above ground biomass; Carbon storage; Climate change mitigation; Coefficient of determination; Geoscience laser altimeter systems; ICESat/GLAS; L-band synthetic aperture radars; PALSAR imagery; Forestry; aboveground biomass; allometry; carbon sequestration; forest; GLAS; ICESat; Landsat; model; PALSAR; remote sensing; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056866446

Herein, Fe-substituted Ba-hexaaluminates (BaFexAl12– xO19, denoted as BFxA-H, x = 1 and 2) prepared by a modified two-step method exhibited not only higher amount of converted oxygen (Ot) and CH4 conversion (77% and 81% vs. 17% and 75%) than those prepared by the traditional co-precipitation method (BFxA-C, x = 1 and 2) but also high CO2 selectivity above 92% during the nearly whole reduction from Fe3+ to Fe2+. Furthermore, the BFxA-H exhibited the excellent recyclability during 50 cycles. The better performance was ascribed to the markedly enhanced oxygen mobility which resulted from dominant occupancy of Fe cations in Al(5) sites (Fe5: 71% and 70% vs. 49% and 41%) in mirror planes of hexaaluminate leading to larger amount of lattice oxygen coordinated with Fe5 (O–Fe5) (0.45 and 0.85 mmol/g vs. 0.31 and 0.50 mmol/g).

In order to better understand the GHG emissions embodied in the abundant building material consumption of Shanghai's buildings and search for approaches to reduce GHG emissions, this study explores the building consumption and the embodied GHG emission in Shanghai's buildings through life cycle assessment. Novel and localized life cycle inventories are applied. Based on our findings, the average annual growth rate of new constructed area in Shanghai was around 10% since 2000 to 2016. Concrete, brick, sand, gravel and cement (non-concrete use) appear as the main materials used. High GHG emission burden materials per kg are revealed to be steel, lime, wood, glass and cement (non-concrete use). Accounting the annual material consumption in 2016, steel, cement (non-concrete use), concrete and brick are found have the highest contribution to embodied GHG emission in Shanghai. The decoupling analysis reveals Shanghai experienced a general trend from non-decoupling to relative decoupling between building material use and GDP in recent 17 years. Findings in this study indicate for the high GHG emission burden materials such as steel and lime, reducing the energy use and using less CO2-intensive energy sources during manufacturing are likely to be the most effective approaches. In terms of the highly consumed building materials such as concrete and brick, the focus should be on reducing consumption or looking for substitute materials with lower GHG burden per unit. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Building materials; Decoupling analysis; GHG; Life cycle assessment; Shanghai","Brick; Building materials; Buildings; Cements; Concretes; Life cycle; Lime; Average annual growth rates; Decoupling analysis; Effective approaches; General trends; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life Cycle Inventory; Material consumption; Shanghai; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057143766

Historical climate observations from the China Meteorological Administration and statistical agricultural records at the county level were utilized to evaluate the spatial and temporal effects of both climatic and socioeconomic factors on rice production between 1980 and 2010 in NEC by using a linear regression model. The results showed that a 1% increase in the rice accumulated temperature (RAT) significantly increases rice production by approximately 0.728%. Rising RAT over the past three decades increased rice production by 4.44% (equal to a relative contribution of 0.87% to production growth) in NEC, while the majority of rice production growth (79.6%) resulted from increased agricultural inputs. Furthermore, rice production has increased significantly since 2000, and its geographic centroid shifted over 320 km northeastward during the past 30 years. Historical statistical and simulated rice production data for each county were used to quantify the spatial relocation of rice production due to single climatic factors. During 1980-2010, temperature had a significant and coherent influence on moving rice production. The impact of growing season precipitation was not significant, while sunshine had a significant but less spatially coherent influence. Our findings highlight the response of the rice production system to external driving factors, both climate and socioeconomics, to target further research and provide important insights into how a rice cropping system is likely to adapt in a mid-high-latitude region in the future. © 2019 The Author(s).

California implements a Low Carbon Fuel Standard regulation to reduce the average carbon intensity of fuels by 10 percent, without specifying technologies to achieve the target. A carbon trading market is established to facilitate fuel producers making revenue by producing low carbon second-generation renewable fuels. There is a knowledge gap in understanding interactions between commodity and carbon trade markets under performance-based regulation. We propose a mathematical program with an equilibrium constraints model to find the equilibrium transportation energy portfolio under environmental protection policy. The model utilizes Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions to represent the profit maximization of fuel suppliers. Profit is counted in both the commodity market and the carbon trading market. Our results show that carbon credit encourages the production of second-generation biofuels, which plays a critical role in the success of the Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Carbon credit price is driven by compliance with carbon intensity regulations, which we prove through mathematical formulation and empirical data analysis. Reducing carbon intensity is the key to promote biobutanol underperformance based on the low carbon fuel policy. The proposed framework, with small adjustments, can be used to evaluate performance-based regulation in other fields. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuel policy; Carbon credit trading; Market competition; Mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints (MPEC)","Biofuels; Carbon; Climate change; Competition; Costs; Emission control; Financial markets; Mathematical programming; Profitability; Biofuel policies; Carbon credits; Equilibrium constraint; Karush Kuhn Tucker optimality condition; Market competition; Mathematical formulation; Mathematical programming with equilibrium constraints; Performance-based regulation; Environmental regulations; alternative fuel; biofuel; carbon; climate change; competition (economics); emissions trading; environmental management; equilibrium; mathematical analysis; pricing policy; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058406247

Taking into account the pyrolysis characteristics of lignin, in this study the saccharification residue was used as a raw material for the preparation of biochar (biochar-SR), a potential soil amendment. Biochar was prepared directly from rice straw (biochar-O) with a yield of 32.45 g/100 g rice straw, whereas 30.14 g biochar-SR and 30.46 g monosaccharides (including 20.46 g glucose, 9.11 g xylose, and 0.89 g arabinose) were obtained from 100 g of rice straw. When added to liquid soil extracts as a soil amendment, almost nothing was released from biochar-SR, whereas numerous dissolved solids (about 70 mg/L) were released from biochar-O. Adding a mixture of biochar-SR and autotrophic bacteria improved soil total organic carbon 1.8-fold and increased the transcription levels of cbbL and cbbM, which were 4.76 × 103 and 3.76 × 105 times those of the initial blank, respectively. By analyzing the soil microbial community, it was clear that the above mixture favored the growth of CO2-fixing bacteria such as Ochrobactrum.

This paper synthesizes results of published modeling studies that examined the groundwater system and hydrologic cycle under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario (CO 2 at 936-ppm level at year 2100). Natural replenishment of groundwater occurs predominantly from infiltration of precipitation and surface impoundments. Therefore, the first stage of the study was to review a changed hydrologic cycle under RCP 8.5 in terms of influence from (1) precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture; (2) surface water and its interaction with groundwater; (3) extreme hydrologic events, and (4) teleconnection patterns. The general pattern of climate impact on groundwater resources follows the precipitation pattern with depletion in tropical and/or subtropical regions and with increase in the high-latitude regions of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. However, regional variability also corresponds to the heterogenous impact of climate changes on regional distribution of precipitation and evapotranspiration, localized interaction between surface water and groundwater, and distances from the oceans with rising sea level. The decline of the water table in many areas may seriously reduce irrigated crop production and adversely impact groundwater-dependent ecosystems. Relatively fewer studies have been conducted on climate-change impacts on groundwater resources compared to surface-water systems, and the uncertainties on the recharge estimates are large. There appears to be an urgent need for including groundwater systems in climate impact assessment and in climate mitigation strategies. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Groundwater recharge/water budget; Hydrologic cycle; RCP 8.5; Water resources management","climate change; crop production; global warming; groundwater; hydrogeology; hydrological cycle; infiltration; precipitation (climatology); recharge; teleconnection; water budget; water management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053217670

Moreover, buildings are crucial to achieving the Union objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% by 2050 compared to 1990"" according to Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union, 2012. We have international objectives in Europe today, but not international regulations. Among other things, minimum energy requirements are defined at the national level and they are often not clear in case of existing buildings, including heritage buildings. The existing building stock in Norway has a great potential. Most of the buildings expected to be used in 2050, around 70-80%, are already built. A large part of them represents older buildings with a high value of cultural heritage. The use and re-use of them instead of demolition should be considered as important environmental protection. The current regulations in the Norwegian Planning and Building Act of 2010, PBL10/TEK17, are formulated for all buildings, including existing buildings. In general, in the event of modernization of any existing building, the investor must apply for an exception if the building does not meet the current requirements. Therefore, demolition is often preferred due to the lack of clear retrofitting regulations and requirements as well as uncertainty in terms of profitability for investors. However, buildings with the highest value of cultural heritage are protected by the Cultural Heritage Act of 1979, Kulturminneloven, before they meet the requirements set out in the Norwegian Planning and Building Act. This means that demolition or any changes to these buildings are not allowed or very difficult to carry out. In practice, revitalization of these heritage buildings, including upgrading them to current minimum energy requirements or higher energy standards, is a challenge. Can we effectively protect them without interrupting their revitalization? In this article, the current status of regulations and requirements for existing buildings with the highest value of cultural heritage protected by the Directorate for Cultural Heritage in Norway, Riksantikvaren, are analyzed. Conflicts and gaps in the current regulations, as well as ownership-related challenges that stop revitalization projects, are mapped. Today, the revitalization of protected buildings in Norway is challenging. Upgrading existing buildings and protecting buildings with the highest value of cultural heritage requires clear and separate regulations, requirements and guidelines that take into account to specific situation of protected buildings and cultural landscape that they create, and we can enjoy today, to preserve these unique values for future generations. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Mexico has shown a strong commitment to the environment and rational use of energy, as signed on the General Law for Climate Change (GLCC) and stating, in its second article, the goal of a 30% reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020. To add to this goal, the Hermosillo Institute of Technology is implementing a pilot energy saving program that mixes retrofitting of academic buildings and the implementation of automatic controls for lighting and heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC). The retrofitting is performed by replacing fluorescent T8 tubes with high efficiency LED T8 tubes in a new arrangement. To increase the energy saving obtained by the retrofitting, a building automation and control system (BACS) has been developed and installed. The BACS is implemented using two different networks, the first one communicates a central control unit with the building control node using a private Ethernet network. Inside the building, the control actions are transmitted using a ZigBee network. The energy savings have been estimated as 4864 kWh/year, representing a 36.42% saving, the environmental and health effects are calculated using emission parameters of the nearest power plant to our site, and the procedure presented in Harvard's Six Cities Study by Dockery. Results show a total CO2eq equivalent to 0.000409% of the national goal. The economic impacts of the carbon social cost and health benefits are $745.26 USD/year and $4017.71 USD/year while the direct billing savings are $3700.56 USD/year, and these results are based on only one building of the campus. © 2019 by the authors.","Energy saving; Environmental impacts; Retrofitting","air conditioning; automation; building; climate change; climate effect; control system; energy conservation; environmental impact; global warming; greenhouse gas; power plant; Hermosillo; Mexico [North America]; Sonora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061595529

An understudied movement among United States cities has demonstrated a strategy for greening freeways that remain in service: freeway cap parks, or decks with parks built in the air space directly above below-grade freeway sections that can help reintegrate communities, conceal traffic, reduce air pollution, and provide green space. We provide the first assessment of the design, function, and placement of freeway cap parks and assess the emerging sustainability discourse of cap park planning. We examine 18 completed and 9 proposed cap parks in 24 U.S. cities to identify four cap park development models that can be adapted worldwide to green below-grade freeway segments and reconnect communities. Given historic disparities in freeway placement, we examined the distribution of cap parks and found they are located in areas that could help address disparities in park access in freeways corridors. Our detailed case studies stress the struggle within the cap park sustainability discourse to balance economic, environmental, and equity concerns. Dallas’ Klyde Warren Park is an economic success story, but illustrates how developers use cap parks to sideline equity concerns. Denver's proposed I-70 cap park illustrates strategies to mitigate environmental justice impacts of freeway expansion projects, but equity concerns remain given continuing impacts of the expanded freeway system. Cap parks should be embraced as a vital component of green infrastructure that reconnects and greens cities divided by freeway construction, but planners should take strong steps to address housing affordability and gentrification concerns for adjacent communities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cap parks; Freeways; Green infrastructure; Planning; Sustainability","affordable housing; environmental justice; gentrification; infrastructure; motorway; park design; park management; sustainability; urban planning; Colorado; Dallas; Denver; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051554552

The PRISMA Flow Diagram resulted in the selection of 12 LEED for New Construction (LEED NC) credits for inclusion in the review. Following a preliminary scan of evidence supporting public health co-benefits of the LEED for Neighborhood Development rating system, queries were submitted in PubMed using National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings Terms. Queries identified links between LEED credit requirements and risk of exposure to extreme heat, environmental determinants of health, co-benefits to public health outcomes, and co-benefits to built environment outcomes. Public health co-benefits included reducing the risk of vulnerability to heat stress and reducing heat-related morbidity and mortality.

The new polylactic acid polymer liner is made from renewable feedstock such as carbon found in plant sugars. The energy use over the life of refrigerator and freezer is calculated using the Energy-Efficient Refrigerator Analysis program developed by the United States Department of Energy to estimate the energy savings potential of various technology option upgrades (cabinet and refrigeration system) for rulemaking purposes. The simulation results show that energy savings from implementing the Ingeo liner range from 818 to 1395 kWh (7.3–12.5% of total energy use) over a 15-year period. In addition to the energy savings, the slower increase in the thermal conductivity of the insulation could allow the compressor to run fewer hours per year compared with a case in which the foam thermal conductivity increases rapidly. This change could increase the life of the compressor and the refrigerators and freezers.

Local stakefolders have suggested that oligotrophication reduces pelagic productivity and moreover fishery production in coastal ecosystems, while oligotrophication with high transparency has recovered benthic macrophyte vegetation which have been depressed by phytoplankton derived from eutrophication. In particular, seagrass species is one of the most important coastal vegetation for climate change mitigation and adaptation, which has been welcomed by another stakefolders.

However, the targeted design of mixed-use and compact structures on the local and regional level is superimposed by societal and spatial trends that make large-scale mobility politically desirable or necessary. Against this background, the aforementioned hopes appear clearly exaggerated. Written from a German, at times also a wider European perspective, this paper develops the following argument. Land-use and transport are indeed interrelated, but the historical transport growth we face is mainly driven by other societal factors, such as economic growth, the spatial division of labour, large-scale societal integration, and gender equity. In addition, the effects of land-use on transport are uncertain due to limited knowledge on cause-impact relationships. Even in cases where cause and impact can be established, the impact of planning is limited. We conclude that the scope of integrated land-use and transport planning on the local level should not be overestimated so as to avoid false hopes and corresponding failures. This type of planning can hardly be justified by arguments related to the prevention of carbon dioxide emissions, but is useful in pursuing other urban development goals, such as ensuring accessibility without the use of cars, providing a healthy and livable environment, and – to a lesser extent – shifting travel to other modes and, indeed, reducing it overall. Local and regional land-use and transport planning should be justified by realistic and achievable goals, while at the same time highlighting that it has little effect on the general increase in distances travelled and associated greenhouse gas emissions. Conversely, we conclude that the necessary reduction of emissions within the transport sector must be tackled by interventions on the national and supranational levels, rather than expecting or demanding success from largely ineffective, more local interventions and the actors involved with them. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate protection; Land-use planning; Peak travel; Transport growth; Transport planning; Urban development","carbon emission; environmental protection; greenhouse gas; land use planning; transportation development; transportation planning; travel behavior; urban development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059330182

We ask whether new capacities for transformative climate governance are emerging in two cities that have experimented with urban climate governance: Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and New York City (NYC), United States. Transformative climate governance creates the conditions for developing integrated and innovative climate mitigation and adaptation policies and interventions that respond to and shape urban transformation dynamics and contribute to sustainability and resilience. The comparison of capacities for transformative climate governance in Rotterdam and NYC offers insights into the emerging features of urban climate governance vis-à-vis existing urban governance regimes: how urban climate governance is driven and delivered, what new governance conditions emerge, and whether these conditions enable transformative climate governance. In both cities, an integrated, experimental and inclusive approach to climate governance is emerging, which crosses multiple policy sectors and domains (e.g. transport, energy, health, justice), involves a variety of actors and facilitates innovative solutions. Envisioning, long-term goal and knowledge integration, experimentation and tapping into coalitions for change help to provide the basis (including guiding principles, urgency, actor networks, innovative solutions) for transformative climate governance. However, these transformative approaches tend to be still subordinate to business-as-usual interests and policy and planning approaches, which favour isolated, incremental and short-term responses. The challenge for strengthening transformative climate governance will be to develop rigorous institutional and organisational conditions that decisively stipulate a prioritisation of climate change across scales and sectors, provide action mandates and enable wider coordination, collaboration and learning. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agency; Cities; Governance capacity; Resilience; Sustainability transition; Urban climate governance","adaptive management; climate change; ecosystem resilience; governance approach; innovation; sustainability; urban area; urban climate; article; city; climate change; coordination; justice; learning; Netherlands; New York; city; Netherlands; New York; Netherlands; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; Rotterdam; South Holland; United States; Cities; Climate Change; Netherlands; New York City",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057141027

In order to ease this task, countries may use the experiences with the Technology Needs Assessment (TNA) program. In this paper, lessons with TNAs since 2001 are described, and it is analyzed how countries, with a focus on developing countries, may use these lessons in strengthening and implementing their successive NDCs. While some developing countries have already used the results of their TNA process in their NDC development, countries could benefit from following the TNA process, its stakeholder involvement, and the multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) methodology, to strengthen their NDCs. Countries face challenges in their NDC with regard to the embedding of the contribution into the national development strategy, getting from plans to implementation, and the mobilization of finance. Through the positive and negative experiences with TNAs, countries can overcome these challenges. It is argued that all countries can use the TNA or parts thereof in their NDC process. For developing countries (mainly Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States) the TNA is useful for capacity building, strategy development, and the preparation of projects for investment with international support. Emerging markets and newly-industrialized countries can use the TNA as a participatory approach for strategy development. Developed countries generally do not need the entire TNA process, but the participatory approaches and MCDA can be used to fine-tune modeled strategies.

The site is an open system pingo thought to be associated with the uplift of a former sea-floor pockmark in response to marked isostatic recovery of the coastline following local ice sheet loss over the last 10,000 years. We find that locally significant emissions of CH4 and (less so) CO2 to the atmosphere result from a seepage &lt;1 L s−1 that occurs all year. Hydrological and meteorological conditions strongly regulate the emissions, resulting in periodic outbursts of gas-rich fluids following ice fracture events in winter, and significant dilution of the fluids in early summer by meltwater. Evasion of both gases from a pond that forms during the 100 days summer (45.6 ± 10.0 gCH4-C m−2 and 768 ± 211 gCO2-C m−2) constitute between roughly 20 and 40% of the total annual emissions (223 gCH4-C m−2 a−1 and 2,040 gCO2-C m−2 a−1). Seasonal maximum dissolved CH4 concentrations (up to 14.5 mg L−1 CH4) are observed in the fluids that accumulate beneath the winter ice layer. However, seasonal maximum dissolved CO2 levels (up to 233 mg L−1) occur during late summer. Differences between the δ13C-CH4 composition of the winter samples [average 58.2 ± 8.01‰ (s.d.)] and the late summer samples [average 66.9 ± 5.75‰ (s.d.)] suggest minor oxidation during temporary storage beneath the winter ice lid, although a seasonal change in the methane source could also be responsible. However, this isotopic composition is strongly indicative of predominantly biogenic methane production in the marine sediments that lie beneath the thin coastal permafrost layer. Small hotpots of methane emission from sub-permafrost groundwater seepages therefore deserve careful monitoring for an understanding of seasonal methane emissions from permafrost landscapes. © 2019 Hodson, Nowak, Redeker, Holmlund, Christiansen and Turchyn.","Groundwater; Methane; Permafrost; Pingos; Svalbard","Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Gas emissions; Groundwater; Methane; Permafrost; Seepage; Submarine geology; Groundwater seepage; Isotopic composition; Meteorological condition; Methane production; Pingos; Seasonal dynamics; Svalbard; Temporary storage; Ice; annual variation; biogenic emission; carbon dioxide; groundwater; meltwater; methane; seasonal variation; seepage; Arctic; Svalbard; Svalbard and Jan Mayen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064189322

Many studies have investigated the impact of summer temperature on human health and have proposed mitigation strategies for summer heat waves. However, sub-tropical cities are still experiencing winter temperature variations. Increasing winter perceived temperature through the decades may soon affect city wellbeing, due to a larger temperature change between normal winter days and extreme cold events, which may cause higher health risk due to lack of adaptation and self-preparedness. Therefore, winter perceived temperature should also be considered and integrated in urban sustainable planning. This study has integrated the increasing winter perceived temperature as a factor for developing spatiotemporal protocols for mitigating the adverse impact of climate change. Land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite images and building data extracted from aerial photographs were used to simulate the adjusted wind chill equivalent temperature (AWCET) particularly for sub-tropical scenarios between 1990 and 2010 of the Kowloon Peninsula, Hong Kong. Compared with perceived temperature based on the representative station located at the headquarters of the Hong Kong Observatory, the temperature of half the study area in the Kowloon Peninsula has raised by 1.5◦C. The areas with less green space and less public open space in 2010 show higher relative temperatures. Socioeconomically deprived areas (e.g., areas with lower median monthly income) may suffer more from this scenario, but not all types of socioeconomic disparities are associated with poor sustainable planning. Based on our results and the “no-one left behind” guideline from the United Nations, climate change mitigation should be conducted by targeting socioeconomic neighborhoods more than just aging communities. © 2019 by the authors.

Background: Stenosis of the branch pulmonary arteries results in pulmonary blood flow maldistribution (PBFM). The resulting ventilation–perfusion mismatch is associated with an increased ventilatory response to exercise and decreased exercise capacity. It is unclear if technical success in relieving branch PAS translates to clinical improvement in exercise capacity and ventilatory response. Methods: Twenty patients with biventricular circulation and a minimum 10% PBFM who underwent transcatheter relief of PAS were enrolled in a multi-institutional prospective cohort study. Pre- and post-procedure assessment of the degree of PBFM, exercise capacity, ventilatory response to exercise, and subjective assessment of breathlessness were collected and analyzed. Results: Technical success was achieved in all patients with significant angiographic improvement in minimal lumen diameter (p = 0.001) and peak gradient (p = 0.001). Median PBFM improved (19.5% [range 12.0% to 31.0%] before vs. 7.0% [range 0% to 33.0%] after; p = 0.003). Exercise capacity was low at baseline and improved significantly post-intervention; percent predicted peak oxygen consumption improved from 70% (range 45% to 96%) to 83% (range 47% to 121%) (p = 0.02). Percent predicted oxygen pulse improved (p = 0.02). Ventilatory response to exercise improved; ventilatory equivalent of carbon dioxide slope post-intervention decreased to 29.3 versus 32.5 pre-intervention (p = 0.01). Subjective assessment of dyspnea improved. Five patients with minimal improvement in PBFM also showed minimal improvement in exercise parameters. Conclusions: Successful relief of unilateral branch PAS results in significant improvements in exercise capacity, ventilatory efficiency, and symptoms. © 2019 American College of Cardiology Foundation","angioplasty; exercise capacity; pulmonary artery stenosis","carbon dioxide; oxygen; adolescent; adult; aged; Alagille syndrome; Article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular parameters; child; clinical article; cohort analysis; dyspnea; exercise; exercise test; Fallot tetralogy; female; great vessels transposition; heart catheterization; heart hemodynamics; human; lung perfusion; male; middle aged; multicenter study; oxygen consumption; percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; priority journal; prospective study; pulmonary artery stenosis; reimplantation; school child; treadmill exercise; unilateral branch pulmonary artery stenosis; young adult; adverse event; clinical trial; complication; convalescence; devices; diagnostic imaging; dyspnea; exercise tolerance; lung ventilation; pathophysiology; percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; pulmonary artery; pulmonary artery stenosis; stent; time factor; treatment outcome; United States; vascular patency; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Angioplasty, Balloon; Child; Dyspnea; Exercise Tolerance; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Oxygen Consumption; Prospective Studies; Pulmonary Artery; Pulmonary Ventilation; Recovery of Function; Stenosis, Pulmonary Artery; Stents; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; United States; Vascular Patency; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060522080

Far less is known about the consequences of more frequent high-tide flooding. Empirical analysis of the disruption caused by high-tide floods, also called nuisance or sunny-day floods, is challenging due to the short duration of these floods and their impacts. Through a novel approach, we estimate the effects of high-tide flooding on local economic activity. High-tide flooding already measurably affects local economic activity in Annapolis, Maryland, reducing visits to the historic downtown by 1.7% (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 2.6%). With 3 and 12 inches of additional sea level rise, high-tide floods would reduce visits by 3.6% (3.2 to 4.0%) and 24% (19 to 28%), respectively. A more comprehensive understanding of the impacts of high-tide flooding can help to guide efficient responses from local adaptations to global mitigation of climate change.

The two nitrogenase-based reactions parallel the industrial Haber–Bosch and Fischer–Tropsch processes, yet they occur under ambient conditions. As such, understanding the enzymatic mechanism of nitrogenase is crucial for the future development of biomimetic strategies for energy-efficient production of valuable chemical commodities. Mechanistic investigations of nitrogenase has long been hampered by the difficulty to trap substrates and intermediates relevant to the nitrogenase reactions. Recently, we have successfully captured CO on the Azotobacter vinelandii V-nitrogenase via two approaches that alter the electron fluxes in a controlled manner: one approach utilizes an artificial electron donor to trap CO on the catalytic component of V-nitrogenase in the resting state; whereas the other employs a mismatched reductase component to reduce the electron flux through the system and consequently accumulate CO on the catalytic component of V-nitrogenase. Here we summarize the major outcome of these recent studies, which not only clarified the catalytic relevance of the one-CO (lo-CO) and multi-CO (hi-CO) bound states of nitrogenase, but also pointed to a potential competition between N 2 and CO for binding to the same pair of reactive Fe sites across the sulfur belt of the cofactor. Together, these results highlight the utility of these strategies in poising the cofactor at a well-defined state for substrate- or intermediate-trapping via controlled alteration of electron fluxes, which could prove beneficial for further elucidation of the mechanistic details of nitrogenase-catalyzed reactions. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper investigates new geothermal law and its implications for geothermal development in Indonesia by using comparable law article to discuss this development. All the data are obtained from literature studies based on the history and background, ownership and access, investment and risks, electricity market and re-policies, environmental regulations and community participation around the geothermal resources. Findings: Geothermal industries in Indonesia need assurance and clear legal basis to be developed. Geothermal investors, whether foreign or local, need policy assurance and good business structures that can create a secure investment environment. Furthermore, a good relationship with international cooperation agency needs to be improved to establish knowledge transfer regarding technologies and information about exploration, production and geothermal development. This is essential to further develop the geothermal utilization and prepare Indonesia to be the country with the biggest reduction in CO 2 emission in 2025. New geothermal regulation (Law No.21 Year 2014) has facilitated the geothermal activities. After the issuance of this regulation, the activities can be done at conserved, production and conservation forest. Moreover, the public service agency (BLU) or state-owned enterprise (BUMN) assignment scheme can boost the geothermal industries development. Originality/value: Indonesia has huge geothermal resources because of its geological condition that is located at volcanoes path, also known as “Ring of Fire”. According to 2017 ESDM data, Indonesia’s geothermal potentials are almost 30 GW and are distributed to 331 potential points. However, only 5 per cent of those potentials (1,643.5 MW) have been utilized to date. The huge potentials can be utilized optimally to support the Government’s plan in achieving the energy security. Therefore, policies that regulate geothermal utilization is strategically essential for Indonesia’s future. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Geothermal development; Geothermal management; Indonesia; New geothermal law",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063299707

A promising test of theoretical models is to constrain the distribution of material that is left unburned, carbon in particular. So far, most investigations have used line identification codes to detect carbon in the ejecta, a method that cannot be readily compared against model predictions because it requires assumed opacities and temperatures. Here, we instead use tomographic techniques to investigate the amount of carbon in the inner layers of SN?2011fe, starting from the previously published tomographic analysis of Mazzali et al. From the presence of the carbon feature in the optical at early epochs and its disappearance later on, we derive an average carbon mass fraction between 0.001 and 0.05 for velocities in the range 13,500 ? v ? 16,000 km s-1, and an upper limit of 0.005 inside that region. Based on our models and the assumed density profile, only small amounts of carbon should be in the neutral state, too little to be responsible for features seen in near-infrared spectra that were previously identified as due to neutral carbon. We discuss possible reasons for this discrepancy and compare our results against a suite of explosion models, although uncertainties in both the models and our simulations make it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. © 2019.

An emerging interest is the use of 252 Cf to calibrate neutron correlation counters for the verification and assay of Pu-items as part of the international effort to safeguard nuclear materials. Passive neutron correlation counting (PNCC) methods, combined with knowledge of the fission neutron multiplicity distribution, can be used as an absolute technique to determine the neutron emission rate of 252 Cf sources. This means that common equipment used by the safeguards community can, in principle, be used to self-certify, to high accuracy, the strength of physically small 252 Cf sealed sources for use in calibration. This is the first step in using 252 Cf in place of extensive Pu reference materials for experimental calibration by the safeguards community. The theoretical foundation is already clear but the present work presents the first systematic attempt at demonstrating the practical utility of the concept across a variety of typical instruments. We compare four emission rate estimators for four detector configurations on a common source previously certified by the MnSO 4 -bath technique. We find that the estimator based on the singles to doubles rate ratio provides consistent and precise results across all of the instruments and that these agree with the MnSO 4 -bath technique within combined uncertainties. This success suggests that the absolute PNCC method could become a technically defensible and commonly used, method capable of sub 1% accuracy for routine calibration work. © 2019 Not subject to copiright in the USA.

Recent research years has attributed reduced emissions over the past two decades to regulations enacted under these Amendments, but none have separated long-term daily impacts of individual regulatory programs on multiple source categories under a consistent framework. Using daily emissions and air quality measurements along with a detailed review of national and local regulations promulgated after the Amendments, we quantify daily changes in emissions and air quality attributable to regulations on electricity generating units and on-road mobile sources. To quantify daily changes, we develop nine sets of counterfactual emissions and ambient air pollution concentration time series for 10 pollutants that assume individual regulatory programs and combinations thereof were not implemented. In addition to daily impacts, we estimate uncertainties in these results. These counterfactual daily ambient concentrations reveal high seasonality and increasing effectiveness of most regulations between 1999 and 2013. Monthly average counterfactual concentrations in scenarios that assume no new regulations on electricity generating units and mobile sources are greater than observed concentrations for all pollutants except ozone, which has seen increased wintertime concentrations accompany summertime decreases. By the end of the period, electricity generating unit emissions reductions under the Acid Rain Program and Clean Air Interstate Rule and their respective related local programs led to similar PM2.5 concentration decreases. Of the mobile source regulations, rules on gasoline and diesel vehicles led to similar reductions in annual PM2.5, and gasoline programs led to double the summertime ozone reductions as diesel programs. The nine sets of daily time series and their uncertainties were designed for use in air pollution accountability health studies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","1990 Clean Air Act Amendments; Air pollution accountability; Mobile sources; Power plants; Regulation","Acid rain; Air quality; Air quality standards; Diesel engines; Electric power generation; Gasoline; Laws and legislation; Ozone; Power plants; Time series; Uncertainty analysis; Air quality measurements; Ambient air pollution; Ambient concentrations; Clean air act amendments; Clean air interstate rules; Mobile sources; On-road mobile sources; Regulation; Mobile power plants; diesel fuel; gasoline; ozone; ozone; accountability; air quality; concentration (composition); emission control; pollutant source; pollution policy; power plant; regulatory framework; uncertainty analysis; acid rain; air pollution; air quality; air quality accountability; ambient air; Article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; electricity; environmental management; environmental policy; geographic distribution; Georgia (U.S.); government regulation; motor vehicle; particulate matter; pollutant; priority journal; seasonal variation; social responsibility; time series analysis; air pollutant; analysis; electric power plant; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; human; legislation and jurisprudence; procedures; statistics and numerical data; uncertainty; United States; Atlanta; Georgia; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Gasoline; Georgia; Humans; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Power Plants; Social Responsibility; Uncertainty; United States; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059213716

It plays an important social and economic role in central Brazil. UR cropped area, however, has decreased by 70% in the last two decades, partly due to high drought risk. Here, we hypothesize that the UR breeding program's focus on direct grain selection for wide adaptation has led to an increase in yield potential but a reduction in the capacity of modern cultivars to maintain yield under drought stress. Using the ORYZAv3 rice crop model, we analyzed changes in relative and absolute drought impact for cultivars representative of three decades of breeding: 1980s (1986–1992), 1990s (1993–2002), and 2000s (2003–2013). We found a mean increase in relative drought impact of 12% (0.35% per year) between 1980s and 2000s. Most of the increase occurred during 1980s and 1990s (7%), where a major shift from landraces (i.e. Douradão) to modern cultivars (i.e. cv. BRS Primavera) occurred in the breeding program. Drought adaptation traits such as greater root length density, shorter cycle, and lower stomatal sensitivity to drought have been systematically bred out of the UR material in the period 1980–2013. We recommend the UR breeding program to be adjusted by better targeting to specific drought environments, and by taking into account drought stress profiles and environmental co-variables in statistical analyses for genotype selection. Moreover, physiological studies on tradeoffs between yield potential and drought tolerance should be performed for each target environment to dissect plant traits that confer both high yield potential and low drought sensitivity. These strategies will ultimately ensure that newly released cultivars are adapted to the environmental conditions of the study region, therefore reducing agro-climatic risk for UR farmers. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Breeding program; Crop modelling; Oryza sativa; Traditional and modern genotypes","adaptation; agricultural modeling; agrometeorology; crop yield; cultivar; drought; drought stress; environmental conditions; genotype; physiological response; plant breeding; rainfed agriculture; rice; savanna; upland region; Brazil; Brazil; Latin America; Mato Grosso; Tocantins; Bovine respiratory syncytial virus; Nia; Oryza sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057138972

Additionally, to reduce pollution from gas emissions, it is very important to study the economic and emission dispatch of integrated electrical and heating systems. Hence, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimization dispatch model for a microgrid (MG) with a combined heat and power (CHP) system. This CHP-based MG system consists of a CHP unit, a wind turbine, a PV system, a fuel cell, an electric boiler, an electric storage, and a heat storage. It can exchange electricity with the distribution network and exchange heat with the district heating network. Minimum economic cost and minimum environmental cost are considered as the two objectives for the operation of this CHP-based MG system.

Thus, based on a multiple linear regression (MLR) model in this study, the quantified impacts of six meteorological variables on PM2.5 (i.e., particle matter with diameter of 2.5 μm or less) and its major components were estimated over the Yangtze River Basin (YRB). The 38-year (1980-2017) daily PM2.5 and meteorological data were derived from the newly-released Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis and Research and Application, version 2 (MERRA-2) products. The MERRA-2 PM2.5 was underestimated compared with ground measurements, partly due to the bias in the MERRA-2 Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) assimilation. An over-increasing trend in each PM2.5 component occurred for the whole study period; however, this has been curbed since 2007. The MLR model suggested that meteorological variability could explain up to 67% of the PM2.5 changes. PM2.5 was robustly anti-correlated with surface wind speed, precipitation and boundary layer height (BLH), but was positively correlated with temperature throughout the YRB. The relationship of relative humidity (RH) and total cloud cover with PM2.5 showed regional dependencies, with negative correlation in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and positive correlation in the other areas. In particular, PM2.5 was most sensitive to surface wind speed, and the sensitivity was approximately -2.42 μg m-3 m-1 s. This study highlighted the impact of meteorological conditions on PM2.5 growth, although it was much smaller than the anthropogenic emissions impact. © 2019 by the authors.","MERRA-2; Meteorological variables; PM2.5; Yangtze River basin","Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Emission control; Linear regression; Meteorology; Rivers; Watersheds; Wind; Emission reduction policies; MERRA-2; Meteorological variability; Meteorological variables; Multiple linear regression models; PM2.5; Spatiotemporal distributions; Yangtze River basin; River pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062530906

In this paper, the Integrated Energy and Environment Policy Assessment Model for China (IPAC) modeling team analyzed the feasibility of this emission scenario for China, which is an important step in producing an effective action plan. We picked an ultra-large city to be a case study in order to understand the pathway to zero emissions by 2050 and to provide support for the national zero emissions scenario by 2050. Beijing is a growing city with rapid development in economic activities. This study evaluated the future development pattern for Beijing, and the possibility of it becoming a zero emissions city through a detailed analysis of its transport, building and industry sectors, as well as the space heating sector which is prominent in China's northern region. Key technology advances, such as the electric vehicle, zero-emissions space heating and carbon capture and storage (CCS) and so on, were studied to understand the feasibility of turning Beijing into a zero-emissions city by 2050, which is less than 35 years away. The IPAC model was used to quantify the emission scenario pathway for Beijing. The additional investment required by the energy industry was also obtained. Based on the results, zero carbon emissions in Beijing by 2050 is feasible. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,"action plan; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic activity; electricity industry; urban area; urban development; urban pollution; Beijing [China]; China",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056216356

However, here we show how the consideration of anomalies in annual temperatures at the global land-average scale, particularly during extremely hot years, tends to overestimate the perceived severity of extreme heat actually felt by local communities during these events. Thus, when global-mean temperatures are used as a proxy to infer the role of climate change on the likelihood of witnessing hot years, the component of extreme event risk attributed to human influence can also be overstated. This study suggests multiple alternative approaches to characterise extreme weather events which have complex spatial signatures, each of which improve the representation of perceived experiences from the event when compared with the default approach of using area-averaged time-series. However, as the definition of an extreme event becomes more specific to the observed characteristics witnessed, changes are needed in the way researchers discuss the likelihood of witnessing 'similar events' with future climate change. Using the example of the 2016 hot year, we propose an alternative framework, termed the 'Time of Maximum Similarity', to show that events like the record-breaking annual temperatures of 2016 are most likely to be witnessed between 2010-2037, with hot years thereafter becoming significantly more severe than the heat of 2016. © 2019 The Author(s).

The objectives of this survey were to delineate the lateral distribution of the hydrocarbon potential and to localize microtremor sources, which are associated with the hydrocarbon reservoir. The microtremor survey was conducted by microtremor signal recording, which was divided into two types, namely independent and simultaneous recording. Simultaneous recording is intended for conducting two-dimensional time reverse modeling (2D TRM), which is proposed to localize microtremor sources. In addition, a parameter test was performed to defne a reference for the microtremor responses in terms of amplitude spectrum anomalies of the vertical component, which is associated with the reservoir content. The parameter test was performed on the 10 wellbores, where seven productive wells showed amplitude spectrum anomalies with the increasing amplitude spectrum reaching its peak in the frequency range of 2-3 Hz and then decreasing to a frequency range of 3-4 Hz. Further, delineation of hydrocarbon potential distribution is based on the vertical-horizontal spectral ratio (VHSR) map, which is used to distinguish the amplitude spectrum anomalies stemming from the reservoir signal and horizontal noise. The VHSR map showed that the eastern part of the study area was identifed as a potential zone. In addition, by referring to the TRM result, the depth location of the microtremor source, which is associated with the hydrocarbon reservoir, was predicted to be in a depth range of 1062-1091 meters. © 2019 The Author(s).","Indonesia; Majalengka West Java; Microtremor survey; Parameter test; Time reverse modeling","algorithm; hydrocarbon exploration; hydrocarbon reservoir; integrated approach; microearthquake; seismic source; seismograph; signal-to-noise ratio; two-dimensional modeling; Indonesia; West Java",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065641981

Therefore, it is necessary to obtain local mobile source profiles of PM to support regional researches for vehicle emission control policy, source apportionment modeling, etc. In this study, PM2.5 and PM10 samples were collected from a highway tunnel in Xi’an in northwestern China. The chemical composition, specifically, the OC, EC, water-soluble ions, and elements, was analyzed in detail to (1) provide local PM profiles for a mixed vehicle fleet, (2) identify the origins of different elements in the tunnel environment, and (3) determine the associated factors influencing the profiles. The PM2.5 profiles in the tunnel were identified as OC (34.10%), EC (11.96%), water-soluble ions (18.22%), and elements (27.73%), while the PM10 profiles included OC (28.48%), EC (8.59%), water-soluble ions (14.17%), and elements (33.36%), respectively. The origins of the elements in the tunnel were classified into three categories by the receptor modeling approach: resuspended road dust and brake wear, vehicle exhaust and tire wear, and tailpipe emissions from diesel vehicles (DV). The mass fractions of OC, EC, and elements originating from resuspended road dust and brake wear were mainly affected by vehicle driving conditions (i.e., uphill/downhill and speed), whereas the mass content of bromine (Br) was influenced by the proportion of DV in the fleet. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","PM10; PM2.5; Road tunnel; Source profile; Traffic emissions","Brakes; Chemical analysis; Dust; Emission control; Fleet operations; Ions; Particulate emissions; Roads and streets; Vehicles; Wear of materials; PM10; PM2.5; Road tunnel; Source profiles; Traffic emissions; Particles (particulate matter); chemical composition; emission control; particulate matter; road; source apportionment; traffic emission; tunnel; China; Shaanxi; Xian",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064011318

Therefore, we attempt to identify the technology factors of China’s energy consumption change between 2007 and 2012, when China’s economy started slowing. This study proposes a new refined structural decomposition analysis (SDA) based on a hybrid multi-regional input–output (MRIO) model. The technology factors are expressed through the energy input level effect, energy composition effect, and non-energy input effect. We find that the energy level effect was the primary driver for energy reduction, saving 1205 million tonnes of standard coal equivalent (Mtce) of energy, while 520 Mtce was offset by energy composition and non-energy input effects. The sector analysis shows that the energy input level, energy composition, and non-energy input effects of electricity, the chemical industry, and metallurgy are noteworthy. In addition, the sector contribution to energy-use change, by province, related to the three effects, is also studied. From these results, we propose policy suggestions for further energy saving, in order to achieve China’s energy target through technology improvements by the higher priority contributors identified. © 2019 by the authors.","China; Energy composition; Energy saving; Hybrid MRIO; SDA","Carbonization; Chemical analysis; Chemical industry; Composition effects; Energy conservation; Global warming; China; Critical approach; Energy reduction; Hybrid MRIO; Policy suggestions; Structural decomposition analysis (SDA); Technology factors; Technology improvement; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061965334

In this size region, the CO2RR activity experiences a 2-fold enhancement, while HER activity remains similar across all tested samples.

Five factors were identified: coal usage for coke ovens, residential coal use, vehicular emission, biomass burning, and other emission sources. It was found that the PAH concentration in the ambient air in Seoul has been affected not only by domestic emissions but also by transported PAHs originating outside Korea, such as emissions from coal use in China and biomass burning in Northeast Asia. In addition, the impact from North Korea was verified for the PAHs emitted from biomass burning.

While much attention has been paid to production-side agricultural non-CO2 greenhouse gas (ANGHG) emissions, less is known about the emissions from the consumption-based perspective. This paper aims to explore the characteristics of agricultural CH4 and N2O emissions of global major economies by using the latest emission data from the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) and the recently available global multi-regional input-output model from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). The results show that in 2014, the 42 major economies together accounted for 60.7% and 65.0% of global total direct and embodied ANGHG emissions, respectively. The consumption-based ANGHG emissions in the US, Japan, and the EU were much higher than their production-based emissions, while the converse was true for Brazil, Australia, and India. The global-average embodied ANGHG emissions per capita was 0.7 t CO2-eq, but major developing countries such as China, India, Indonesia and Mexico were all below this average value. We find that the total transfer of embodied ANGHG emissions via international trade was 622.4 Mt CO2-eq, 11.9% of the global total. China was the largest exporter of embodied ANGHG emissions, while the US was the largest importer. Most developed economies were net importers of embodied emissions. Mexico-US, China-US, China-EU, China-Japan, China-Russia, Brazil-EU, India-EU and India-US formed the main bilateral trading pairs of embodied emission flows. Examining consumption-based inventories can be useful for understanding the impacts of final demand and international trade on agricultural GHG emissions and identifying appropriate mitigation potentials along global supply chains. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; CH4 and N2O emissions; Consumption-based accounting; International trade; Major economies; Multi-regional input-output analysis","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Gas emissions; International trade; Nitrogen oxides; Supply chains; Developed economies; Embodied emissions; Food and agriculture organizations; Global supply chain; Input output analysis; Input output model; Major economies; Statistical database; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057198158

In this province, the channel/barrier effect and three-dimensional climate play prominent roles and significantly influence the rice water requirement (ETc) and irrigation quota (IQ), while the research about the influence mechanism and results is lacking. We estimated the rice ETc and IQ of different hydrological years based on the experimental data from six areas of mid-season rice and the single crop efficient approach recommended by FAO-56. The contour maps were drawn with GIS, and the spatial distribution of the rice ETc and IQ under the influence of the channel/barrier effect and three-dimensional climate were analyzed. The results showed that high water ETc and IQ of rice were distributed in the hot, dry river valley area. The rice ETc was the smallest in northwestern Yunnan, and the IQ was the smallest in southern Yunnan. The ETc and IQ of rice were divided into several intervals by mountains and valleys, and varied largely among different channels and little within one channel. The three-dimensional climate results in the abrupt changes of ETc and IQ, The leading meteorological factors causing the abrupt changes were different, and there were also complex correlations between these meteorological factors. Taken together, temperature and rainfall were the most critical elements in the three-dimensional climate. The results of this study illustrated the regularity and inherent mechanism of the rice ETc and IQ under the influences of the channel/barrier effect and three-dimensional climate, providing certain references for the analyses and calculation of the rice ETc and IQ in similar circumstances. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Crop coefficient; Geographical information system; Spatial variability; Water balance equation; Water resources","Crops; Geographic information systems; Irrigation; Landforms; Complex correlation; Crop coefficient; Influence mechanism; Meteorological factors; Northwestern Yunnan; Spatial variability; Water balance equation; Water requirements; Water resources; agrometeorology; crop plant; GIS; irrigation system; plateau; rainfall; rice; spatial distribution; spatial variation; temperature effect; three-dimensional modeling; water budget; water resource; China; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053377306

Iron–steel production is one of the most significant sources of anthropogenic atmospheric mercury emission, while information on this source is scarce. Hourly gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) and particle bound mercury (PBM) were studied inside (IP) and at the boundary (BP) of a typical iron–steel plant in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China from September 2016 to August 2017. The GEM concentrations were 0.97–503.1 and 0.05–112.6 ng/m 3 at the IP and BP sites, respectively, while PBM concentrations were one to four orders of magnitude higher than urban and suburban ambient levels. Several lines of evidences indicated that PBM was mainly originated from the iron–steel manufacturing process, especially from sintering and coke-making processes in this iron–steel plant. However, a combined emission effect contributed to GEM variation. The receptor model of positive matrix factorization (PMF) showed that local direct emissions (coal combustion, industrial activity, vehicle exhaust, and secondary evaporation from polluted soil) contributed 51.3% of the total GEM concentration variation. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) and concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) models clearly showed that air masses moving from areas surrounding YRD had the highest concentrations of atmospheric mercury. These results provided evidence that iron–steel manufacturing emissions have a considerable effect on regional atmospheric mercury concentrations, especially PBM. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Iron–steel industry; Mercury; Potential source contribution function; Source apportionment; Yangtze River Delta (YRD)","anthropogenic source; concentration (composition); food chain; industrial emission; iron and steel industry; mercury (element); source apportionment; suburban area; China; Yangtze River; coal; coke; iron; mercury; steel; air pollutant; analysis; atmosphere; chemistry; China; environmental monitoring; metallurgy; river; Air Pollutants; Atmosphere; China; Coal; Coke; Environmental Monitoring; Iron; Mercury; Metallurgy; Rivers; Steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059589411

The protocol is further complemented with an electron counting scheme based on maximally localized Wannier functions, which allows one to identify the nominal charge state and the composition of the defect core unit. Here, we apply this approach to the study of hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen impurities in amorphous alumina (a-Al2O3), a highly relevant material for technological applications. Hydrogen is found to be amphoteric with a thermodynamic +1/-1 charge transition level lying at ∼4.6 eV above the valence band maximum, in qualitative agreement with results obtained with crystalline models, but at a substantially different energy level. Hydroxyl groups are further shown to lead to the same defect states as observed for hydrogen. Application of our procedure to carbon and nitrogen impurities leads to structural configurations that are found to depend on the total charge set in the simulation cell. Through the adopted electron counting rule, we assess that carbon and nitrogen impurities are only found in neutral and in singly positive charge states, respectively. This indicates that neither carbon nor nitrogen give charge transition levels in the band gap, in strong contrast with results achieved for crystalline models. In addition, the defect core units are shown to incorporate a varying number of oxygen atoms, by which their formation energy depends on the oxygen chemical potential μO. In oxygen-poor conditions, both the carbon and the nitrogen impurities favor bonding to Al atoms, while they tend to form single or double bonds with oxygen atoms as μO increases. Based on the band alignment of a-Al2O3 with three technologically relevant semiconductors (GaAs, GaN and α-Fe2O3), we discuss the possible role of point defects in degrading the performance of electronic devices and in favoring hole transport across the oxide in water-splitting setups. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,"Aluminum oxide; Atoms; Calculations; Carbon; Chemical bonds; Crystalline materials; Energy gap; Gallium arsenide; Gallium nitride; Hematite; III-V semiconductors; Molecular dynamics; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Point defects; Semiconducting aluminum compounds; Semiconducting gallium arsenide; Semiconducting gallium compounds; Wide band gap semiconductors; Ab initio molecular dynamics; Amorphous alumina; Carbon and nitrogen; Defect configurations; Formation energies; Structural configurations; Technological applications; Valence-band maximums; Alumina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062073491

However, because observed patterns may be spatially and historically contingent, interpretations of compositional responses to spatial differences in climate should ideally consider past climatic fluctuations, edaphic factors, nonlinear turnover rates and transition zones (ecotones) in environmental and geographic space. We tested whether drivers of plant community compositional turnover and transition zones are consistent, rather than spatially contingent, across spatially isolated and biologically contrasting (independent) ecosystems. We used four broad-scale transects in Australia, which are spatially isolated and climatically and ecologically diverse: NATT (Northern Territory); BATS (New South Wales); SWATT (Western Australia) and TREND (South Australia). We used Generalised Dissimilarity Modelling to ascertain the relative contributions of space (geographic distance) and environmental variables to compositional turnover. We mapped transition zones using modelled nonlinear responses. Purely spatial contributions were estimated using variance partitioning. Models explained 26–52% of deviance in compositional dissimilarity. Mean annual rainfall and geographic distance were the most important explanatory variables, although topographic relief outranked rainfall for the topographically complex BATS transect. Purely spatial structure accounted for only 7–12% of explained deviance, pointing to the shared prevalence of species sorting along spatially structured rainfall gradients. Zones of rapid compositional turnover across bioclimatic gradients were evident across the contrasting ecosystems. These transitions zones tended to occur at the arid extremes of rainfall gradients and as plains transitioned into complex topography. Responses to other variables were inconsistent among transects. Transition zones were spatially contingent, influenced by local topography, and generally occurred within different subintervals (value ranges) along gradients.

In light of the rapid urbanisation in many parts on the globe, it is crucial to understand the relationship between settlement size and CO2 emission efficiency of cities. Recent literature on urban scaling properties of emissions as a function of population size has led to contradictory results and more importantly, lacked an in-depth investigation of the essential factors and causes explaining such scaling properties. Therefore, in analogy to the well-established Kaya Identity, we develop a relation combining the involved exponents. We demonstrate that application of this Urban Kaya Relation will enable a comprehensive understanding about the intrinsic factors determining emission efficiencies in large cities by applying it to a global dataset of 61 cities. Contrary to traditional urban scaling studies which use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, we show that the Reduced Major Axis (RMA) is necessary when complex relations among scaling exponents are to be investigated. RMA is given by the geometric mean of the two OLS slopes obtained by interchanging the dependent and independent variable. We discuss the potential of the Urban Kaya Relation in mainstreaming local actions for climate change mitigation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Kaya Identity; Sustainable cities; Urban CO2 emissions; Urban Kaya relation; Urban scaling","Carbon dioxide; Efficiency; Large dataset; Population statistics; CO2 emissions; Kaya Identity; Sustainable cities; Urban Kaya relation; Urban scaling; Climate change; carbon emission; climate change; energy efficiency; mitigation; population size; scale effect; sustainable development; urban area; urbanization; Torreya nucifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057802386

New energy technologies in urban mobility are being introduced, as evidenced by the electric vehicle. We evaluated the positive environmental effects in terms of CO 2 emissions that would be produced by the replacement of conventional urban transport bus fleets by electric buses. The simulation of an electric urban bus conceptual model is presented as a case study. The model is validated using the speed and height profiles of the most representative route within the city of Madrid—the C1 line. We assumed that the vehicle fleet is charged using the electric grid at night, when energy demand is low, the cost of energy is low, and energy is produced with a large provision of renewable energy, principally wind power. For the results, we considered the percentage of fleet replacement and the Spanish electricity mix. The analysis shows that by gradually replacing the current fleet of buses by electric buses over 10 years (2020 to 2030), CO 2 emissions would be reduced by up to 92.6% compared to 2018 levels. © 2019 by the authors.","Automotive simulation; AVL Cruise; CO 2 emissions; Sustainable development; Urban electric buses","Carbon dioxide; Electric automobiles; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Sustainable development; Vehicle-to-grid; Wind power; Automotive simulation; AVL Cruise; CO2 emissions; Electric bus; Fleet replacement; New energy technologies; Renewable energies; Urban environments; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061912047

Box 217, Enschede, 7500 AE, Netherlands","Many global transport sector decarbonisation studies assert that it is difficult for the transport sector to decarbonise and to contribute its proportional share to the ambitious climate targets set by the Paris Agreement. We challenge this argument by establishing that deep decarbonisation is possible in the transport sector, through original research that is anchored in a global meta-analysis of long-term transport sector emission pathways from over 500 bottom-up modelling estimates from 81 countries, rather than relying on aggregated regional data and modelling efforts. First, we translate the aspirational 1.5-degree Celsius (1.5DS) target to an indicative 2050 transport sector emission target of 2 GtCO 2 , based on proportional downscaling of existing economy-wide 2DS studies to a transport-specific 1.5DS target. We then compare this with mitigation potential derived from the aggregation of bottom-up estimates for business-as-usual growth and low-carbon scenarios from individual country studies, which we aggregate at national and global levels. This analysis suggests that in the absence of additional action, transport sector emissions could outpace earlier projections and thus become a major roadblock to avoiding dangerous climate change. Yet, if countries collectively maximise efforts to implement comprehensive low-carbon measures, the sector could achieve reductions approaching a 1.5-degree scenario. Realising the full mitigation potential of transport will require balanced implementation of low-carbon mitigation policies that avoid (or reduce) the need for transport trips; promote a shift toward more efficient travel modes; and improve performance of vehicles and fuels. The chances that such a comprehensive approach is taken will increase if countries, cities and companies establish medium- to long-term commitments to transport decarbonisation and accelerate short-term implementation of market-ready low-carbon transport measures. Setting more ambitious low-carbon transport target with mid-term implementation milestones, and closely integrating these plans with sustainable development objectives, can help to spur mitigation action consistent with a 1.5DS target. To conclude, we discuss potential limitations of a transport sector-specific analysis of emission pathways, and we offer recommendations for further refining pathways for the transport sector to realise Paris Agreement targets. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; GHG emissions; Low-carbon scenarios; Mitigation; Transport","Carbon; Decarbonization; Greenhouse gases; Dangerous climate changes; GHG emission; Improve performance; Low carbon; Low carbon transport; Mitigation; Proportional-share; Transport; Climate change; climate change; emissions trading; greenhouse gas; meta-analysis; mitigation; traffic emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046644764

This paper describes a study of photovoltaics (PV) utilization for EV charging in two Scandinavian cities: Tromsø in Norway and Uppsala in Sweden, with the objective to evaluate self-sufficiency and self-consumption. The suitable areas for PV were determined using building area statistics and utilization factors. The PV yield was simulated for integration scenarios of 10%–100% of the suitable area. EV charging patterns were generated using a stochastic model based on travel survey data. The scenarios include EV penetration of 10%–100% of the personal vehicle fleet. The results show that the PV energy yield could cover the EV load in most of the scenarios, but that the temporal load match could be improved. The energy balance was positive for all seasons and EV levels if the PV integration was over 50%. The highest self-sufficiency was achieved in Tromsø during summer, due to the longer days. For high EV penetration and low PV integration, the self-sufficiency was higher in Uppsala, indicating that installed PV power is more important than yield profile above a certain number of EVs. © 2018","Electric vehicle charging; Self-consumption; Self-sufficiency; Solar potential","Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Integration; Solar energy; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Electric vehicle charging; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Personal vehicles; Renewable energy source; Self-consumption; Self-sufficiency; Solar potential; Utilization factor; Charging (batteries); alternative energy; electric vehicle; energy balance; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; photovoltaic system; scenario analysis; self sufficiency; solar power; urban area; Norway; Norway; Scandinavia; Sweden; Troms; Uppsala [Sweden]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059303500

While many advances have been realized in developed countries, the situation is contrastingly different in most tropical regions where we still lack information on potential discrepancies between measured and modeled climatic conditions. Consequently, water managers in these regions often rely on non-academic expertise to help them plan their future strategies. This issue is particularly alarming in tropical mountainous areas where water demand is increasing rapidly and climate change is expected to have severe impacts. In this article, we addressed this issue by evaluating the limitations and prospects in using regional climate models for evaluating the impact of climate change on water availability in a watershed that provides Quito, the capital of Ecuador, with about 30% of its current water needs. In particular, we quantified the temporal and spatial discrepancies between predicted and observed precipitation and temperature, and explored underlying mechanisms at play. Our results provide a strong critique of the inappropriate use of regional models to inform water planning with regard to adaptation strategies to face climate change. As a multidisciplinary group composed of hydrologists, ecologists and water managers, we then propose a framework to guide future climate change impact studies in tropical mountain watersheds where hydro-climatological data are scarce. © 2018","Climate change; Climatic model bias; Quito; Tropical mountains; Water availability; Water uses","Climate models; Landforms; Managers; Tropics; Water management; Watersheds; Climatic models; Quito; Tropical mountains; Water availability; Water use; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; spatiotemporal analysis; tropical environment; water availability; water management; water use; watershed; Article; climate change; controlled study; Ecuador; environmental impact; environmental planning; environmental temperature; evolutionary adaptation; precipitation; prediction; priority journal; spatiotemporal analysis; tropic climate; water availability; watershed; Ecuador; Pichincha; Quito",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054170234

The forces that drive forest protection do not necessarily oppose those that drive forest clearance for development. This decoupling, enhanced by the stronger economic forces compared to conservation, is detrimental for the social-ecological sustainability of forested tropical landscapes. This paper presents an integrated, and spatially-explicit, Agent-Based Model that examines the future impacts of land-use change scenarios on the sustainability of the Wet Tropics region of tropical Queensland, Australia. In particular, the model integrates Bayesian Belief Networks, Geographical Information Systems, empirical data and expert knowledge, under a land-sharing/land-sparing analysis, to study the impact of different landscape configurations on trade-offs and synergies among biodiversity and two ecosystem services (sugarcane production and carbon sequestration). Contrary to most tropical regions, model simulations show that Business As Usual is helping to reconcile these contrasting goals in the forested landscape of the Wet Tropics. The paper analyses which combination of governance and socio-economic factors is causing these positive results. This is an outstanding achievement for a tropical region, considering that most tropical areas are characterized for having stronger economic-land clearing forces compared to conservation forces, which reduce important ecosystem services for human wellbeing and the health of ecosystems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agent-based model; Bayesian belief network; Ecosystem services; Land-sharing and land-sparing; Social-ecological system; Sustainable land use","Bayesian analysis; biodiversity; climate change; conservation management; ecosystem service; forest clearance; GIS; land use change; sustainability; tropical region; achievement; article; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; controlled study; ecosystem; geographic information system; human; land use; landscape; nonhuman; Queensland; simulation; socioeconomics; sugarcane; tropics; wellbeing; Australia; Bayes theorem; environmental protection; forest; Australia; Queensland; Australia; Bayes Theorem; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forests; Humans; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057165344

In a local urban context, however, extreme climate events, mainly floods and droughts, have had less attention but concrete adverse effects on many urban areas, particularly on the most vulnerable communities (population and infrastructure) and on climatedependent basic services and economic activities. This chapter describes the current policies and initiatives taken regarding climate change at an urban level. We can identify the birth of a new institutional framework, which is creating a methodology to create a dialogue with the main changes in Territorial and Urban Planning at an international level. The chapter also focuses on the main case studies in the capital city, Montevideo, in particular the Urban Plans for Streams and Basins, which dialogue with Local Plans for urban renewal, including climate change issues. In addition to this, a focus on the Metropolitan Plan on Climate Change shows how from a methodological point of view an innovative participatory methodology has been developed considering the necessary actor's network to be established toward the implementation of the adaptation measures. Finally, some important considerations are made, thinking critically about how to include all the new strategies to deal with climate change, resilience, and sustainable development from a long-term perspective on a multi-level scale, national, metropolitan, and local. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

These states are some of the most vulnerable to climate stress because of their large coastlines, vulnerability to rising sea levels, weak access to reliable surface water, and limited food production capacity for handling increased groundwater scarcity. Impacts of climate stressed groundwater resources brought on by irrigation and growing urban demand in SIDS continue to receive widespread attention by both scientists and policymakers. Policies that limit pumping to protect aquifer sustainability reduce short-term economic welfare by unknown amounts that would otherwise be secured by both urban and irrigation water users. Yet, little scholarly research has addressed economic impacts of climate-water stress for the special needs of SIDS for which urban and irrigation pumping compete hydrologically and economically over long time periods. The original contribution of this work is to address that gap by employing downscaled data on precipitation from Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) climate scenarios. Its novel contribution is to conceptualize, develop, apply, and interpret an integrated hydro-economic framework to understand interconnected physical and economic linkages from managing an unconfined regional aquifer system under each of three climate and two policy scenarios. The application is to Barbados, a SIDS, for which current and future irrigation and urban demands compete for water. The framework integrates groundwater hydrology, climate scenarios, economics, land use, and groundwater management, with the intent to mitigate impacts of climate stress on current economic values of water as well as protecting future aquifer sustainability. Results provide a framework to guide water management for SIDS vulnerable to climate stress for which water of the right quantity, quality, timing, location, and price are essential elements of economic development. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Groundwater; Management abstraction policy; Pricing; RCPs; Water demand","Aquifers; Climate change; Costs; Economic and social effects; Economics; Food supply; Groundwater; Irrigation; Land use; Landforms; Sea level; Surface waters; Sustainable development; Water management; Economic development; Economic sustainability; Essential elements; Ground-water hydrology; Groundwater management; RCPs; Small island developing state; Water demand; Groundwater resources; aquifer; climate change; food production; food security; groundwater; irrigation system; policy making; pricing policy; small island state; sustainability; vulnerability; water demand; water management; Barbados",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058617737

This reduction in precipitation in turn can lead to reduced economic outputs, primarily through smaller agricultural yields. By bringing together estimates of (a) the impact of sulphate aerosols on precipitation and (b) the observed relationship between monsoon rainfall and GDP, we present a methodology to estimate the possible financial cost of this effect on the Indian economy and on its agricultural sector. Our preliminary estimate is that the derived benefits could be large enough that around 50% of India's SO 2 emissions could be economically mitigated at no cost or net benefit, although it should be noted that the large uncertainties in the underlying relationships mean that the overall uncertainty is also large. Comparison of the 1952-1981 and 1982-2011 periods indicates that the Indian economy may now be more resilient to variability of the monsoon rainfall. As such, a case could be made for action to reduce SO 2 emissions, particularly in the crucial monsoon period. This would have a significant, positive effect on a crucial and large sector in India's economy and the effects would be visible almost instantly. The recent growth in renewable energy sources in India and the consequent, reduced increase in coal burning means that further financial costs have already been avoided. This impact should be further investigated so that it can be included in cost-benefit analyses of different fuel types in the region. The significant uncertainties associated with these calculations are discussed. © 2019 by the authors.","Agriculture; Economic impact; Indian monsoon; Precipitation; Sulphate aerosol","Aerosols; Agriculture; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Precipitation (chemical); Rain; Renewable energy resources; Sulfur compounds; Uncertainty analysis; Agricultural sector; Agricultural yields; Asian summer monsoons; Economic impacts; Electricity sector; Indian monsoon; Renewable energy source; Sulphate aerosol; Economic and social effects; aerosol; economic impact; emission control; environmental economics; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; sulfur dioxide; sulfur emission; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061295127

The growing trend of framing biodiversity and protected area values in terms of ecosystem services and human well-being may not always lead to biodiversity conservation. Although globalization is often spoken about in terms of its adverse effects to the environment and biodiversity, it also heralds unprecedented and previously inaccessible opportunities linked to ecosystem services. Biodiversity and related ecosystem services are amongst the common goods hardest hit by globalization. Yet, interconnectedness between people, institutions, and governments offers a great chance for globalization to play a role in ameliorating some of the negative impacts. Employing a polycentric governance approach to overcome the free-rider problem of unsustainable use of common goods, we argue here that REDD+, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) climate change mitigation scheme, could be harnessed to boost biodiversity conservation in the face of increasing globalization, both within classic and novel protected areas. We believe this offers a timely example of how an increasingly globalized world connects hitherto isolated peoples, with the ability to channel feelings and forces for biodiversity conservation. Through the global voluntary carbon market, REDD+ can enable and empower, on the one hand, rural communities in developing countries contribute to mitigation of a global problem, and on the other, individuals or societies in the West to help save species they may never see, yet feel emotionally connected to. © 2019 by the authors.

It is shown that there is a decrease in HbCO concentration in the blood under the influence of the transcutaneous laser irradiation. Three maxima (at 525, 600 and 850 nm) in the spectral range are observed, wherein the decrease in the HbCO concentration exceeds 50 %. The maximum value of the photodissociation of HbCO is observed at the 850 nm region. The obtained data correlate with the processes of light propagation in biological tissue. Irradiating HbCO at the spectra maximum, we measured a considerably high photodissociation yield of nearly 75%, which ensures high efficiency of photodecomposition of the HbCO in the blood.

We tested the effects of moss-crusted versus uncrusted soils on seed germination dynamics in a temperate pine barren ecosystem. We conducted a 35-day laboratory assay of seed germination on moss-crusted soils versus uncrusted soils from the Albany (NY) Pine Bush Preserve. We compared total seed germination and the number of days to 50% of total germination of two herbaceous perennial forb species in each soil type. Three and five times more seeds germinated on uncrusted soil than on crusted soil for bush clover (Lespedeza capitata) and wild lupine (Lupinus perennis), respectively. Seeds of both species also germinated approximately 10 days earlier on uncrusted soil than on crusted soil. This study, and others in similar habitats, show that BSCs in mesic climates can influence germination and other early life-history stages of plants. We hope that further study of the interactions between BSCs and vascular plants in mesic climates will contribute to our understanding of the ecology of BSCs outside the arid and semiarid climates where they are more extensively studied. © 2019 Gilbert, Corbin.

However, there are still concerns regarding the emissions of refuse collection vehicles in cities, because in some cases they may use engines designed for long haulage trucks. For this reason, we tested a diesel Euro VI (step C) refuse collection heavy-duty vehicle, both in the laboratory on a chassis dynamometer and on the road, similar to the regulated in-service conformity cycle, but also with actual refuse collection cycles. Particle number (PN) and gaseous pollutants (NOx, CO, HC) were measured using a Portable Emissions Measurement System (PEMS). Additionally, in the laboratory we used laboratory grade gaseous, particle number, and FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy) systems to assess the PEMS. For short periods, where the exhaust gas temperature was low for the aftertreatment devices (cold start, some city conditions), the NOx emissions reached 2000 mg/km.

Concurrently, climate change has also been a major challenge for countries around the world. Energy systems are dominant emission sources of both PM2.5 and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). This study investigates cost-efficient energy system transitions for individual or dual targets of climate change mitigation and PM2.5 concentration reduction by a global energy systems model. We set two levels of mitigation efforts for each of the CO 2 and PM2.5 emissions, whose stringent one corresponds to the long-term target of the Paris agreement and current national air quality standards, respectively. For PM2.5 reduction, a combination of moderate improvement in energy efficiency and a transition from coal to gas and renewable energies and a significant deployment of end-of-pipe measures for scrubbing air pollutants is shown to be among the most cost-efficient strategy. For CO 2 reduction, drastic improvement in energy efficiency and a rapid transition from coal to gas, renewable and nuclear energies is the most cost-efficient strategy, in contrast. There is a larger co-benefit on PM2.5 concentration reduction from CO 2 reduction measures than the converse, and the co-benefit varies regionally. Developing countries such as India have a huge potential of co-benefits, and energy efficiency improvement and fuel switching are key measures to bring them. The simultaneous achievement costs of the dual targets are smaller than the sum of individual achievement costs, and the cost reduction varies significantly depending on the level of each mitigation target. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Climate change mitigation; Co-benefit; Cost-efficient measures; Energy systems; PM2.5 concentration reduction","air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; climate change; concentration (composition); cost analysis; cost-benefit analysis; developing world; emission control; energy efficiency; particulate matter; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044755446

Spin-lattice relaxation rate (1/T1) of side chain carbon nuclei were remarkably high, because those nuclei possess higher degree of motional freedom. Chemical shift anisotropy parameters of eight chemically different carbon nuclei were determined by 2DPASS-MAS-NMR experiment. Large value of chemical shift anisotropy was observed for carbonyl group carbon (C7) nuclei, because of electrostatic effect, hydrogen bonding and molecular magnetic susceptibility. 13C relaxation mechanism is mainly governed by chemical shift anisotropy interaction, especially at high value of external magnetic field (11.74 T). Thus, the correlation time at different carbon sites were also calculated by using the spin-lattice relaxation times and chemical shift anisotropy values.

With the help of the Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET), the measurement of the aerosol optical and radiative properties were carried out over seven sites in the Middle East during 2013. The analysis of the optical properties of aerosols like Single Scattering Albedo (SSA), Angstrom Exponent (AE), Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), and Asymmetry parameter (ASY) were carried out during the study period. During spring and summer, high values of AOD and low values of AE were found in all sites except CUT-TEPAK (Limassol, Cyprus), which specified the existence of coarse mode particles and dust storms in these seasons. The AE maximum values were found in the summer and fall over CUT-TEPAK and IMS-METU-ERDEMLI(Erdemli, Turkey), whereas in other sites IASBS (Zanjan, Iran), KAUST Campus (Thuwal, Saudi Arabia), Masdar Institute (Masdar, United Arab Emirates), Mezaira (Mezaira, United Arab Emirates) and Solar Village (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) the peak values of AE occurred in the fall and winter.

The (NH4)2TcCl6 salt was dissolved in 2 M KHCO3. The resulting purple solution was analyzed by XAFS and UV-Visible spectroscopy. The UV-Visible spectra exhibits a band centered at 515 nm. The XAFS results were consistent with the presence of polymeric species containing the [Tc2(μ-O)2]4+ core coordinated to carbonate ligand. Concerning the electrochemical methods, the pertechnetate anion was electrochemically reduced in concentrated carbonate solution [(CO3 2-)=5 M and (HCO3 -)=0.5 M]. For the radiolytic reduction, the speciation of Tc under Helium ions particle beam and γ radiation was examined by UV-Visible and XAFS spectroscopy in high concentrated carbonate media. In concentrated carbonate solutions, pertechnetate as Tc(VII), was not reduced under irradiation due to the formation of carbonate radical which is a strong oxidant. Then, the solution proposed was the addition of formate to the solution which can scavenge hydroxyl radical 10 times faster than carbonate and prevent re-oxidation of reduced technetium. The XANES and EXAFS spectroscopies, approved by theoretical methods, revealed that the final product of the radiolytic reduction of pertechnetate is in the +IV oxidation state. The final structure of the reduced product by He2+ radiolysis was the same as electrochemical reduction.

CFB reactors are excellent candidates for chemical looping of solid sorbents for CO2 capture and sorbent regeneration processes because they ensure a continuous carbon dioxide removal process in a relatively compact unit. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provides an excellent approach to model the carbonator and regenerator reactors and the entire CFB loop design in a systematic and computationally feasible way. The simulation of individual parts of the system was recently performed and provided a qualitative estimation of the system behavior. In order to use CFD to perform simulations of the CO2 capture regenerative process, a model based on the multiphase flow equations taking into account the sorption/regeneration is needed. Therefore, in this work, a CFD approach was developed and applied to simulate gas and solid flows and CO2 sorption and regeneration in the entire CFB loop. The CFB's geometry used in this study is the same as National Energy Technology Laboratory‘s experimental setup. Our calculations showed that the CFB hydrodynamic behavior reached to a statistical steady state after about 10 s in a three-dimensional domain. The time to reach statistical steady state strongly depends on the initial condition of the simulations, and the geometry and the size of the system. Three-dimensional CFD simulations demand significantly high computational time; thus, we used only the three-dimensional domain for understanding the hydrodynamics of the system and to verify the dynamics of the same system in a two-dimensional CFD domain (no reaction was included in the three-dimensional domain). The two-dimensional domain requires considerably less computational time and allowed us to ultimately add two heterogeneous reactions to the circulating fluidized bed's CFD simulation for carbonation and regeneration of MgO-based solid sorbents. The results of our simulation showed the excellent capability of our CFD approach in describing the CO2 conversion profiles and flow behavior in a reacting CFB system that includes the entire range of solid volume fraction from very dilute (i.e., riser) to very dense (i.e., standpipe) ranges.

We generated time-series transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles during differentiation of mouse multipotent bone marrow stromal cell line (ST2) toward adipocytes and osteoblasts. Using our novel approach we constructed time-resolved GRNs for both lineages and identifed the shared TFs involved in both differentiation processes. To take an alternative approach to prioritize the identified shared regulators, we mapped dynamic super-enhancers in both lineages and associated them to target genes with correlated expression profiles. The combination of the two approaches identified aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and Glis family zinc finger 1 (GLIS1) as mesenchymal key TFs controlled by dynamic cell type-specific super-enhancers that become repressed in both lineages.

To counteract these social consistency pressures, we developed a cognitive consistency intervention for climate skeptics. We first demonstrated that most people share substantial faith in a variety of scientific findings, across disciplines ranging from medicine to astronomy. Next, we showed that conservative participants who first acknowledged several general contributions of science subsequently reported significantly stronger beliefs in climate science (as compared to conservatives who were asked only about their climate science beliefs).

However, excessive flaring can emit large quantities of VOCs and NOx into the atmosphere, which will cause transient and localized ozone pollution events in the presence of sunlight. The objective of this study was to quantify the impact to regional air-quality due to flare emissions from chemical plant start-up operations through the coupling of dynamic process simulations via Aspen Plus and air-quality simulations via CAMx. Simulation results from case studies have indicated that the corresponding ozone increments can vary significantly from 0.2 ppb to 17.8 ppb under different temporal and spatial factors, including the start-up starting hour, starting day, and plant location.

The results from this study have delivered a cost-effective air-quality control practice for plant start-ups with a minimum air-quality impact through selecting the optimal starting time within the allowable ranges.

People relied on naked flames for heating, cooking, and lighting and for most industrial processes. This article suggests that a combination of interconnected factors explains Paris’s good fortune and differentiated it from other cities. It enjoyed a climate that reduced the likelihood of bad fires and provided abundant water, assisted by a geology that also offered fire-resistant building materials. These factors helped its inhabitants fight fires with surprising success, even before the creation of a permanent fire service. The nature of the city’s economy also helped, because there were few concentrations of highly combustible products, and its various institutions of government collaborated to make both preventive measures and fire control more effective. © 2019 Duke University Press.

In those countries with smaller land areas and high-technology manufacturing, such as Japan and Korea, agriculture is now being viewed as technology-driven food factories of the future. Meanwhile, for countries with a significant base population and increasing growth rates, such as China, India and Indonesia, agriculture seems to dominate the development debate. The comparative evaluation analyses the issues regarding institutional and organizational reforms focusing on the legal and organizational framework structure including water users' associations (WUAs) for water supply services, participatory irrigation management (PIM) and management transfer, and public–private partnership (PPP) towards sustainable irrigation and drainage (I&D) and agricultural water management (AWM). Despite the diverse geography and institutional frameworks, food security remains a major concern in all the countries and regions reviewed in this paper.

The profiles of [O( 3 P)] and [H] were calculated from OH airglow emissions measured at 2.0 μm by the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiography (SABER) instrument on board NASA's Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite. The two target species were used to initialize the OH airglow model, which was empirically adjusted to fit four different OH airglow emissions observed by the satellite/instrument configuration TIMED/SABER at 2.0 μm and at 1.6 μm as well as measurements by the Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) instrument on board the Environmental Satellite (ENVISAT) of the transitions OH(6-2) and OH(3-1). Comparisons between the ""best-fit model"" obtained here and the satellite measurements suggest that deactivation of vibrationally excited OH(v) via OH(v ≥ 7)+O 2 might favour relaxation to OH(v′ ≤ 5)CO 2 by multi-quantum quenching. It is further indicated that the deactivation pathway to OH(v′ =v-5)+O 2 dominates. The results also provide general support of the recently proposed mechanism OH(v)+O( 3 P)→OH(0 ≤ v′ v ≤-5)+O( 1 D) but suggest slower rates of OH(v = 8;7;6; 5)+O( 3 P), partly disagreeing with laboratory experiments. Additionally, deactivation to OH(v′ = v-5)+O( 1 D) might be preferred. The profiles of [O( 3 P)] and [H] derived here are plausible between 80 and 95 km but should be regarded as an upper limit. The values of [O( 3 P)] obtained in this study agree with the corresponding TIMED/SABER values between 80 and 85 km but are larger from 85 to 95 km due to different relaxation assumptions of OH(v)+O( 3 P). The [H] profile found here is generally larger than TIMED/SABER [H] by about 50% from 80 to 95 km, which is primarily attributed to our faster OH(v = 8)+O 2 rate. © Author(s) 2019.",,"airglow; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric modeling; hydrogen isotope; hydroxyl radical; mesopause; oxygen isotope; wavelength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061428944

We propose emission factors for ammonia (NH3, 158 mg/km), nitrous oxide (N2O, 322 mg/km) and molecular hydrogen (H2, 72 mg/km) for vehicles equipped with three-way catalytic converter (TWC). Our experimental conditions were similar to those prevailing on vehicles during catalyst light-off and transient urban driving cycle. NH3 and H2 emission factors reported in this work are quantitatively similar to those reported from vehicles. However, for N2O our results are almost 6 times higher than the average reported from vehicles during catalyst light-off. It is possible that the emission factor of N2O from light-duty vehicles reported during catalyst light-off is underestimated because the time (8.4 min) for recollecting the N2O emission contained in the exhaust gases is largest than the time (4 min) required to produce the main emission of N2O on the three way catalyst. The methodology represents one of the first attempts to predict emission factors from a micro-reactor. Besides, our proposal has the advantage that the main parameters involved in the formation of NH3, N2O and H2 can be controlled. Our method also complements the experimental strategies to estimate emissions, which are difficult to observe during the measurements of these compounds on vehicles. © 2019, Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

Alloying nanostructured Pt with lanthanides is a promising approach to enhance its catalytic ORR activity, whereby the development of a simple synthetic route turned out to be a nontrivial endeavor. Herein, for the first time, we present a successful single-step, scalable top-down synthetic route for Pt-lanthanide alloy nanoparticles, as witnessed by the example of Pr-alloyed Pt nanoparticles. The catalyst was characterized by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and photoelectron spectroscopy, and its electrocatalytic oxygen reduction activity was investigated using a rotating disk electrode technique. Pt x Pr/C showed ∼3.5 times higher [1.96 mA/cm 2 Pt , 0.9 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)] specific activity and ∼1.7 times higher (0.7 A/mg Pt , 0.9 V vs RHE) mass activity compared to commercial Pt/C catalysts. On the basis of previous findings and characterization of the Pt x Pr/C catalyst, the activity improvement over commercial Pt/C originates from a lattice strain introduced by the alloying process. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","cathodic corrosion; electrocatalysis; fuel cell; lanthanides; oxygen reduction; platinum alloys; top-down synthesis","Air engines; Alloying; Catalyst activity; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Energy conversion; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fuel cells; Fuel storage; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrogen; Nanocatalysts; Nanometals; Nanoparticles; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Powertrains; Praseodymium alloys; Rare earth elements; Rotating disks; Alloy nanoparticle; Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction; Fuel cell application; Oxygen Reduction; Oxygen reduction reaction; Reversible hydrogen electrodes; Rotating disk electrodes; Topdown; Platinum alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060829124

The landscapes of such regions are commonly characterized by extensive, seasonally-variable vegetation coverage that can cause low temporal coherence and limit the detection capabilities of SAR imagery as acquired, for instance, by previous ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT missions. In this work, we exploited the enhanced resolution in space and time of the recently deployed Sentinel-1A/B SAR satellites to detect and monitor ground motions occurring in two study areas in the Republic of Ireland. The first, is a ~1800 km 2 area spanning the upland karst of the Clare Burren and the adjacent mantled lowland karst of east Galway. The second, is an area of 100 km 2 in Co. Meath spanning an active mine site. The available datasets, consisting of more than 100 images acquired in both ascending and descending orbits from April 2015 to March 2018, were processed by using the Permanent Scatterer approach. The obtained results highlight the presence of small-scale ground motions in both urban and natural environments with displacement rates along the satellite line of sight up to -17 mm/year. Localized subsidence was detected in recently built areas, along the infrastructure (both roads and railways), and over the mine site, while zones of subsidence, uplift, or both, have been recorded in a number of peatland areas. Furthermore, several measured target points indicate the presence of unstable areas along the coastline. Many of the detected movements were previously unknown. These results demonstrate the feasibility of adopting multi-temporal interferometry based on Sentinel-1 data for the detection and monitoring of mm-scale ground movements even over small areas (&lt; 100 m 2 ) in environments influenced by temperate oceanic climate. © 2019 by the authors.","InSAR; Ireland; Peatland; Permanent Scatterer; Sentinel-1; Temperate oceanic climate","Geodetic satellites; Interferometry; Motion analysis; Orbits; Small satellites; Subsidence; Wetlands; InSAR; Ireland; Peatland; Permanent scatterers; Sentinel-1; Temperate oceanic climate; Space-based radar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061353818

AWD involves periodic drainage of rice paddies in order to inhibit methane (CH 4 ) emissions. To date, studies evaluating this practice have been limited in their scope and resolution. Our study evaluates the mitigation potential of AWD from a life cycle perspective using high-resolution CH 4 modeling to more accurately estimate the mitigation potential of this practice. We simulated California rice production under continuous flooding and under five AWD schedules ranging in the severity and frequency of dry-downs. Production models were coupled with the Peatland Ecosystem Photosynthesis Respiration and Methane Transport (PEPRMT) model to simulate CH 4 fluxes at daily intervals. We then evaluated the GHG mitigation potential of AWD using life cycle assessment models. Frequent or severe dry-downs reduced simulated grain yields, which negated some of the benefits of AWD when assessed on a yield-scaled basis. We also found AWD-induced mitigation of CH 4 emissions modeled with PEPRMT to be roughly half the magnitude reported from up-scaling of chamber measurements, highlighting the importance of high resolution field data to better characterize GHGs in rice systems. Reduced yields and conservative CH 4 mitigation in our model lessened the overall mitigation potential of AWD. When the entire rice life cycle was considered, mitigation of overall global warming potential (GWP) was further reduced by the presence of additional GHG sources, which comprised roughly half of life cycle GWP. Our simulations resulted in ≤12% reductions in GWP kg −1 across all AWD scenarios and saw an increase in GWP when yields were severely reduced. Our results highlight the importance of constraining uncertainties in CH 4 emissions and considering a life cycle perspective expressed on a yield-scaled basis in characterizing the mitigation potential of AWD. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","AWD; Flooded rice; GHG emissions; Global warming potential; LCA; Methane","Floods; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Wetting; Flooded rice; GHG emission; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle perspectives; Peatland ecosystems; Production models; WETTING AND DRYING; Life cycle; methane; nitrous oxide; methane; global warming; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; methane; paddy field; wetting-drying cycle; alternate wetting and drying; Article; carbon footprint; downstream processing; environmental impact; evaluation study; field emission; flooding; grain yield; greenhouse effect; life cycle assessment; magnitude estimation method; nonhuman; priority journal; process model; rice; scale up; water management; water stress; agriculture; analysis; chemistry; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; Oryza; pollution; procedures; theoretical model; California; United States; Agriculture; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Global Warming; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Models, Theoretical; Oryza",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056255056

Although several intervention programs oriented towards the reduction of bullying and cyberbullying have been developed and implemented, significant disparities have been found regarding their efficacy. In most of the cases, the lack of the implementation of interventions involving all of the school community could be on the basis of this limited efficacy. The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the TEI Program, an intervention based on peer tutoring, in the reduction of bullying and cyberbullying, and in the improvement of school climate. The design of the study was quasi-experimental, in which 2057 Spanish students (aged 11 to 16 years) participated from 22 schools, and were randomly assigned to the experimental group (10 schools, 987 students) or the control group (12 schools, 1070 students). The obtained results showed a significant reduction in bullying behavior, peer victimization, fighting, cyberbullying and cybervictimization in the experimental group after the intervention implementation. Similarly, a significant improvement in factors of school climate was found only in this group. The obtained results demonstrated that the TEI program is effective in reducing bully and cyberbully behavior, and at the same time, improving the school climate. © 2019 by the authors.

Notable examples include the iron-molybdenum cofactor of the molybdenum-dependent nitrogenases, which catalyze N 2 fixation, and the NiFe 4 S 4 cluster and the Mo(O)SCu site in various carbon monoxide dehydrogenases. The prevailing proposed reaction mechanisms for these multimetallic cofactors relies on a cooperative pathway, in which the oxidation state changes are distributed over the aggregate coupled with orbital overlap between the substrate and more than one metal ion within the cluster. Such cooperativity has also been proposed for chemical transformations at the surfaces of heterogeneous catalysts. However, the design details that afford cooperative effects and allow such reactivity to be harnessed effectively in homogeneous synthetic systems remain unclear. Relatedly, hydride donors ligated to these metal cluster cofactors are suggested as precursors to the state that reacts with substrates; here too, however, the reactivity of hydride-decorated clusters supported by weak-field ligands is underexplored.Inspired by the reactivity potential of multimetallic assemblies evidenced in biological systems, approaches to design, synthesize, and evaluate reactivity of polynuclear metal compounds have been actively explored. In a similar vein to the templating function afforded by enzyme active sites, a carefully engineered organic ligand can be employed to control metal nuclearity of the complex and the local coordination environment of each metal center. This Account presents our efforts within this field, beginning with ligand design considerations followed by a survey of observed small molecule activation by trimetallic cyclophanates. We highlight the distinct reactivity outcomes accessed by multimetallic compounds as compared to aggregates that assemble in reaction mixtures from monometallic precursors. Contributing to the opportunity for programmed cooperativity in these designed multimetallic compounds, the cyclophane also dictates the orientation of substrate binding and metal-substrate interactions, which has a prominent influence on reactivity. For example, the dinitrogen-tricopper(I) cyclophanate reacts with dioxygen with markedly different results as compared to monocopper compounds. As an unexpected outcome, one series of tricopper compounds were discovered to be competent catalysts for carbon dioxide reduction to oxalate-a formally one-electron process-hinting at an inherently broader reaction scope for weak-field clusters at lowering the barrier for one-electron pathways as well as multielectron redox transformations. Further reflecting the role of the ligand in tuning reactivity, the trimetallic trihydride cluster compounds, [M 3 (μ-H) 3 ] 3+ (M = Fe II , Co II , Zn II ), demonstrate substrate specificity for CO 2 over various other unsaturated molecules and surprising stability toward water. This series reflects the role of the local environment of a shallow ligand pocket to control substrate access. Summed together, the systems described here evidence the anticipated cooperative reactivity accessed in designed multimetallic species vs self-assembled monometallic systems (e.g., O 2 activation and O atom transfer) as well as control of substrate access by seemingly subtle structural effects. Indeed, future efforts aim to interrogate the limits of cooperativity in these systems as well as the role of ligand dynamics and sterics on reactivity.

In this study, we use satellite column SO2 data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and SO42− wet deposition data from the NADP (National Atmospheric Deposition Program) to investigate the temporal and spatial relationship between trends in SO2 emissions and the downward sulfate wet deposition over the eastern U.S. from 2005 to 2015. To establish the relationship between SO2 emission sources and receptor sites, we conducted a Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) analysis using HYSPLIT back trajectories for five selected Air Quality System (AQS) sites - (Hackney, OH, Akron, OH, South Fayette, PA, Wilmington, DE, and Beltsville, MD) - in close proximity to NADP sites with large downward SO42− trends since 2005. Back trajectories were run for three summers (JJA) and three winters (DJF) and used to generate seasonal climatology PSCFs for each site. The OMI SO2 and interpolated NADP sulfate deposition trends were normalized and overlapped with the PSCF, to identify the areas that had the highest contribution to the observed drop. The results suggest that emission reductions along the Ohio River Valley have led to decreases in sulfate deposition in eastern OH and western PA (Hackney, Akron and South Fayette). Farther to the east, emission reductions in southeast PA resulted in improvements in sulfate deposition at Wilmington, DE, while for Beltsville, reductions in both the Ohio River Valley and nearby favorably impacted sulfate deposition. For Beltsville, sources closer than 300 km from the site contribute roughly 56% observed deposition trends in winter, and 82% in summer, reflecting seasonal changes in transport pattern as well as faster oxidation and washout of sulfur in summer. This suggests that emissions and wet deposition are linked through not only the location of sources relative to the observing sites, but also to photochemistry and the weather patterns characteristic to the region, as evidenced by a west to east shift in the contribution between winter and summer. The method developed here is applicable to other regions with significant trends such as China and India, and can be used to estimate the potential benefits of emission reduction in those areas. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Deposition; HYSPLIT; OMI; PSCF; Sulfur","Air quality; Emission control; Meteorological problems; Quality control; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Trajectories; Ultraviolet spectrometers; Environmental concerns; HYSPLIT; National atmospheric deposition programs; Ozone monitoring instruments; Potential source contribution function; PSCF; Sulfur dioxide emissions; Temporal and spatial; Deposition; sulfate; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; carbon emission; emission; emission control; instrumentation; observational method; oxidation; photochemistry; pollutant source; satellite data; seasonal variation; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; trajectory; wet deposition; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; China; climate; India; Ohio; oxidation; photochemistry; priority journal; river; seasonal variation; summer; surface property; United States; wet deposition; winter; Akron [Ohio]; Beltsville; China; India; Maryland; Ohio; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056879695

However, the light rail system is interrupted by disruptions frequently, which reduces its attraction to passengers. Therefore, how to provide a quick replacement service during disruptions is of vital importance to avoid passengers change to other higher emission vehicles. The purpose of this paper is to focus on the decision analysis of the replacement tool for disruption recovery service in urban public light rail systems from the perspective of environmental effect. Design/methodology/approach: The traditional approach – bus replacement service – and the new approach – taxi replacement service – which has been recently adopted by several cities, are examined individually and compared. The benefit of the light rail company is formulated by balancing between carbon emission and financial cost. The involving parties’ decision functions taking the passengers’ behaviors as well as numerous other important factors into account are formulated. Findings: Both theoretical and numerical sensitivity analyses are conducted to shed light for light rail systems to better coping with disruptions, increasing service level, and attracting more passengers to the environmental transit system to reduce carbon emission. Originality/value: It is worth mentioning that this research is a successful application for disruption recovery in a public transit system considering the environmental effect.

First, the coupling equations of the diffusion–adsorption–seepage–heat transfer fields of gas are established. The displacement processes under different pressures and temperatures are simulated by COMSOL. Finally, the displacement effects, a comparison of the CO2 storage capacity with the CH4 output and the effective influencing radius of CO2 injection are analyzed and discussed. The results show that (1) the displacement pressure and temperature are two key factors influencing the CH4 output and the CO2 storage capacity, and the increase in the CO2 storage capacity is more sensitive to temperature and pressure than the CH4 output. (2) The gas flow direction is from the injection hole to the discharge hole during the displacement process, and the regions with high velocity are concentrated at the injection hole and the discharge hole. (3) A reduction in the CH4 concentration and an increase in the CO2 concentration are obvious during the displacement process. (4) The effective influencing radius of injecting CO2 with heat increases with the increase in time and pressure. The relationship between the effective influencing radius and the injection time of CO2 has a power exponential function, and there is a linear relationship between the functional coefficient and the injection pressure of CO2.

In recent years, China has been facing growing international pressure because of its large energy consumption and elevated greenhouse gas emissions. As the capital of China, Beijing is central to the study of carbon emission reduction since its carbon emissions have ranked at the forefront nationwide. The existing literature mainly revolves around carbon emissions of a few specific years, and there is a lack of trend study of multiple years in Beijing. This paper, based on the input-output method, calculates carbon emissions in Beijing by carbon footprints; the changing trend analysis was carried out by researching available statistical data of three years, 2002, 2007, and 2012, from the perspective of the entire city of Beijing and from that of urban and rural residents’ consumption. The reasons for the changing trends of total carbon emission in Beijing have also been analysed using the Structural Decomposition Analysis (SDA) model. Results show that the total direct carbon footprint as well as the urban and rural direct carbon footprints of residents’ consumption in Beijing is all increasing gradually. The direct carbon footprint of urban residents’ consumption is mainly produced by electricity, gasoline, and heating power, while that of rural residents’ consumption is mainly produced by raw coal and electricity. The indirect carbon footprint of residents’ consumption in Beijing is increasing gradually, and that of urban areas is higher than that of rural areas. The compositions of indirect carbon footprints of rural and urban residents’ consumption are consistent, and both come mainly from the transportation and communication industry, housing, food, culture, education, entertainment, etc. The SDA results show that the per capita consumption level is the main driving factor for the increase of the indirect carbon footprint of Beijing residents’ consumption, and the intensity of CO 2 emission is the main inhibiting factor. Finally, suggestions for reducing carbon emissions from urban and rural perspectives have been put forward. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Beijing City; Direct carbon footprint; Indirect carbon footprint; Input-output method; Residents’ consumption","carbon emission; carbon footprint; consumption behavior; data interpretation; emission inventory; energy intensity; greenhouse gas; input-output analysis; resident population; rural-urban comparison; statistical data; trend analysis; Beijing [China]; China; carbon; coal; gasoline; analysis; carbon footprint; China; electricity; greenhouse gas; industry; Beijing; Carbon; Carbon Footprint; Coal; Electricity; Gasoline; Greenhouse Gases; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058670469

This study examines the dynamic behavior of carbon prices from the visibility graph network point of view, notably introducing the Jaccard coefficient to measure the similarity. By mapping daily carbon trading prices onto visibility graph networks, we analyze the characteristics of the carbon prices by topological measures of the networks. For the next step, we evaluate the similarity between pilots by the Jaccard similarity coefficient of the constructed visibility graph networks. Consequently, we cluster the pilots based on topology measures of the networks. Results show that the seven carbon markets in China have different patterns of similarity in visibility network properties: They are all small-world networks and are scale-free except for Chongqing pilot. Only Hubei and Shenzhen pilots are assortative, indicating a weak degree of market efficiency. At the same time, the two pilots have the highest value of Jaccard similarity coefficients and Shenzhen pilot presents the highest similarity to the supposed integrated market. According to the structure measures of the networks, the pilots are clustered into four groups which can be seen as sub-markets.

Different from previous studies focused on direct effect, this paper investigated the impact of urbanization and real estate investment on China's carbon emissions with considering of the provincial contribution and spatial spillover effect. Using the multiplicative logarithmic mean Divisia index (M- LMDI) model, spatial panel data model and panel data of 30 provinces in China over the period 1997–2015, the results suggested that the contributions to carbon emissions and their driving mechanisms were significantly different across provinces. The top five provinces in China that contributed the most to the growths of carbon emissions in China were Shandong, Guangdong, Hebei, Jiangsu, and Henan, with cumulative effects of 10.28%, 10.28%, 5.44%, 5.19%, and 5.09% respectively. The direct impact of urbanization on carbon emissions was significantly negative, but its spatial spillover effect was significantly positive, which suggested that the effect of urbanization on carbon emissions shows significant “pollution transfer effect” after introducing the spillover effect. Due to the characteristics of non-movability and long investment period, the impact of real estate investment on carbon emissions was fixed in the local region, and there was no spillover effect to the adjacent regions. Because of the existence of mutual promotion mechanism between urbanization and real estate investment, the interaction between the two had significant positive direct and spillover effects on carbon emissions, which indicated that the interaction between the two created a reduction effect on both local and adjacent regions. The research can effectively identified the provinces that contribute a lot to China's carbon emissions, and made the decomposition and implementation of the national carbon emission reduction targets more targeted. At the same time, urbanization policies should be combined with real estate policies in the process of carbon emission reduction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; LMDI; Real estate investment; Spatial panel data; Urbanization","Carbon; Emission control; Urban growth; Carbon emissions; LMDI; Panel data; Real estate investment; Urbanization; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055646411

Accurate quantification of the change in SOC stocks at regional or national scales, which depends heavily on reliable spatiotemporal carbon (C) input data, remains a big challenge. Here we use the process-based RothC model to estimate change in SOC stocks across Canada for 1971 to 2015, based on calculated annual C flows between cropland and livestock sectors. Total C input to 0–20 cm soils from crops, manure, and biosolids in Canada increased by 81% from 1971 to 2015, which shifted Canadian agricultural lands from a CO2 source before 1990 (−1.1 Tg C yr−1) to a small sink during 1990–2005 (4.6 Tg C yr−1), and a larger sink thereafter (10.6 Tg C yr−1). The increasing trend of SOC stocks is mainly driven by the increases in crop yield; the enhanced C sink since 2005 reflects increasing C input largely driven by the increasing area and yield of canola. SOC sequestration showed a potential to offset ~34% or more of agricultural GHG emission since 1990. Increasing crop yields and adopting crop mixes that input proportionately more below-ground C, such as canola and oat, showed potential additional opportunity to sequester SOC, estimated at 1.7 Tg C yr−1 for 2016–2030 in Canada. This study illustrates that SOC sequestration is driven largely by plant C inputs, and shows that agronomic measures which augment C input through crop choices and yield-enhancing practices can profoundly benefit climate mitigation strategies. © 2018","Agriculture; Canola; Carbon balance; Carbon input; Climate change mitigation; High root crops","Agriculture; Crops; Fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; Organic carbon; Soils; Accurate quantifications; Canola; Carbon balance; Climate change mitigation; Climate mitigations; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Root crops; Soil organic carbon; Climate change; adaptive management; agricultural land; agriculture; canola; carbon balance; carbon sink; climate change; crop yield; model; organic carbon; root; soil carbon; stock assessment; Canada; Brassica napus var. napus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052754814

Urban greenery is capable of mitigating the UHI by creating microclimates that are lower in temperature than their surroundings, which are known as urban cooling islands (UCI). Previous studies have proved the effectiveness of UCI from different perspectives. However, a specific optimal level of landscape patch size at a regional scale that can be implemented by urban planners has not been identified. In this study, we estimated the optimal patch size in seven selected hot-humid Asian cities with the help of Google Cloud Computing, Python Programming, as well as spatial and statistical analysis. A two-tier (two optimal patch sizes) distribution of the threshold value of efficiency (TVoE) of urban trees in this region was found. Eight landscape-level indexes were used to explore the variance of TVoE. The percentage of landscape (PLAND), edge density (ED), mean landscape shape index (Shape_MN), mean fractal dimension (FRAC_MN), largest patch index (LPI), and mean Euclidian nearest-neighbor distance (ENN_MN) were found to have no significant correlation with TVoE. While the average normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI_MN) and average background temperature (BGT_MN) were found to be highly associated with the variance in TVoE. Further, a concept model that can simulate the effects of NDVI_MN and BGT_MN was also proposed. These findings extend the understanding of the UCI effect of urban trees as well as providing a basis for scientific climate adaption planning in this region. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Hot-humid city; Landscape indexes; Threshold value of efficiency; Urban cooling island effect; Urban planning; Urban tree","computer simulation; cooling; correlation; greenspace; heat island; high temperature; humid tropics; index method; landscape; low temperature; microclimate; mitigation; NDVI; optimization; patch size; rural area; size distribution; spatial analysis; threshold; urban area; urban planning; Asia; Euclidia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057875005

Alternative and sustainable agricultural practices are important, as they may help minimize the carbon footprint from agriculture. We developed a framework to account for the carbon footprint (C-footprint), i.e., cumulative greenhouse gas generation of various stages in the cultivation of the crop rotation system of corn-soybean-oats. We obtained real-farm data for this analysis from a biological farming and management company (referred to as bio-farming), and benchmarked this footprint against a conventional farm baseline. The analysis included process modeling i.e., the upstream manufacture of fertilizers and crop applications, local mixing and transport of solid fertilizers (in the bio-farming scenario), on-farm fuel use by farm machinery, as well as agricultural modeling of on-farm soil interactions using the soil &amp; water assessment tool (SWAT). Results varied based on individual crops, and showed that bio-farming practices generated a 44% lower C-footprint for corn, 69% lower footprint for soy and 70% lower footprint for oats compared to conventional farming on a kgCO2e/bushel basis. The on-field (N2O) emissions contributed most significantly to the total carbon footprint at 70%, 96%, and 89% of the total emissions in corn, soy and oats, respectively. C-footprint results of all crops showed a high dependence on the yield of the respective crop. Sensitivity analyses showed that the application of lime and lack of cover crop increased C-footprint. We identified strategies to reduce emissions from the bio-farming scenario further by implementing management strategies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biological farming; Carbon footprint; Corn-soy-oats; Crop rotation; Greenhouse gases; Soil & water assessment tool (SWAT)","Agronomy; Crops; Cultivation; Emission control; Fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; Lime; Machinery; Sensitivity analysis; Soils; Agricultural soils; Biological farming; Corn-soy-oats; Crop rotation; Crop rotation system; Management strategies; Sustainable agricultural; Water assessment; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057163324

Box 6079, Succ, Centre-ville, Montréal, Québec  H3C 3A7, Canada","The deployment of smart technologies such as storage systems is a requirement for the integration of renewable energy sources (RES) in today's grids. The increase in the share of renewable energy, mainly wind and solar power relies on the grid operators’ capacity to offset intermittency and enhance the grids’ flexibility, for which the most recommended solution is the deployment of energy storage systems (ESS). However, this type of addition to the grid will have consequences on current power sources operation and lead to changes in their environmental impacts. It is no longer possible to rely on temporally aggregated data, linear impact allocation assumptions or averaged emission factors to evaluate the ESS use phase. A more robust environmental assessment tool is therefore required. In light of this limitation, we propose an optimized consequential life cycle assessment (O-C-LCA) methodology applied to the Norman grid (France) for the year 2017. We optimally simulate the operation of lithium-ion batteries as an ESS within the grid by means of an optimization algorithm. The cost of electricity production, including greenhouse gas emissions through a price on carbon, is minimized, and the various generation sources are managed. A near-real ESS operation pattern is obtained as well. Afterward, we assess the environmental impacts of electricity generation using a retrospective consequential LCA. The results highlight the importance of time-variant data in the identification of the system's temporal hotspots. The life cycle optimization analysis illustrates the generation patterns and periods that are most altered by (i) the minimization of electricity generation costs including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and (ii) the addition of an ESS. For this case, on average, 53% GHG emissions abatement results from the grid optimized operation and deployment of ESS, along with a total marginal operating costs reduction of 28%. Temporally-differentiated region-specific emission factors (EFs) are also recommended for enhanced assessment results. By including time-variant data and temporally-differentiated EFs, the developed method leads to an appropriate representation and a more accurate evaluation of the ESS use phase. It is therefore considered an effective tool for policy and decision makers regarding the impacts of ESS operation on the environmental profiles of power grids. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Lithium-ion batteries; Operating costs; Solar energy; Consequential life-cycle assessment; Cost of electricity productions; Electricity generation cost; Environmental assessment tool; Integration of renewable energies; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Marginal operating costs; Optimization algorithms; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059330907

The potential role of under-ice phytoplankton blooms on DIC and pCO2sw has not often been considered. In this study we examined the inorganic carbon system beneath landfast sea ice starting midway through a bottom ice algae bloom and concluding in the early stages of an under-ice phytoplankton bloom. During most of the ice algae bloom we observed a slight increase in DIC/pCO2sw in surface waters, as opposed to the expected reduction. Biomass calculations confirm that the role of ice algae on DIC/pCO2sw in the study region were minor and that this null result may be widely applicable. During snow melt, we observed an under-ice phytoplankton bloom (to 10 mg/m3 Chl a) that did reduce DIC and pCO2sw. We conclude that under-ice phytoplankton blooms are an important biological mechanism that may predispose some Arctic seas to act as a CO2 sink at the time of ice breakup. We also found that pCO2sw was undersaturated at the study location even at the beginning of our sampling period, consistent with several other studies that have measured under-ice pCO2sw in late winter or early spring. Finally, we present the first measurements of carbonate saturation states for this region, which may be useful for assessing the vulnerability of a local soft-shelled clam fishery to ocean acidification. ©2019.

The chemical structures of all synthesized compounds were illustrated on the basis of spectral data (IR, 1H NMR and 13C NMR). This was followed by photophysical properties-based absorption and emission studies of the target compounds in solutions of different solvent polarities. The microenvironment-sensitive fluorescent pyrazolines labeled with pyrene exhibited valuable fluorescence properties with emission in the range of 600–700 nm with a marked response to change in the environmental polarities. A significant and pronounced red shift was observed in the emission spectrum of 5-(aryl)-1-phenyl-3-(pyren-1yl)-2-pyrazolines Δλ ∼ 50 nm compared to the absorption spectrum Δλ ∼ 10 nm upon increasing the solvent polarity. This indicated the presence of higher dipole moment in the excited state than in the ground state and the transition involved are π-π* transition through the charge transfer phenomena. The fundamental understanding of solvatochromic properties were analyzed through Lippert-Mataga and Reichardts correlations in order to estimate the change in dipole moments (Δμ) which suggested the emissive state of designed fluorescent 2-pyrazoline derivatives is of strong ICT character. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","2-Pyrazolines; Eco-friendly; Fluorophores; MCM-SO3H; Pyrene; Solvatochromic properties",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057280467

Agricultural residues coming from permanent crops, such as apple orchards, can support local actions to combat climate change. However, the amount of pruned biomass possible to be harvested from apple orchards and, thus, the energy output, depend mainly on their proper preparation and management. The managing actions are important because they influence the energy balance, the productivity, and the economy of the harvesting process and the potential benefits from the biomass marketing. In this study, two different variants of pruning management in an apple orchard during biomass harvesting applying baling technology were analyzed. The first variant considered the biomass collection in the orchard with scattered prunings. In the second one, the prunings were windrowed in the middle of the inter-rows. The theoretical potential amounted to 2.5 t (fresh mass) FM·ha − 1 . In the case of scattered pruning in the orchard, the harvesting losses were 69.3% and the energy balance was only 0.76 GJ·ha − 1 . It resulted in a low biomass yield and a negative economic balance. In turn, for the orchard with windrowed pruning, the harvesting losses were 19.1% and the energy balance was 20.74 GJ·ha − 1 . Assuming a biomass price of €90 t − 1 dry mass (DM), the net benefit excluding transportation of pruned bales was €32.1 ha − 1 . Other calculated energetic factors, such as energy input share, energy return on the investment, productivity, and pruning intensity, confirmed additionally that proper management of the apple orchard increases its energetic potential to be used in the local market. Baling technology can be also competitive with mulching and chipping processes if a market analysis is carried out and the pruned bale sales are guaranteed. © 2019 by the author.","Agricultural residues; Bales; Biomass harvesting; Energy; Production cost; Pruning","Agricultural wastes; Biomass; Climate change; Commerce; Energy balance; Fruits; Harvesting; Mass transportation; Orchards; Productivity; Bales; Biomass harvesting; Energy; Production cost; Pruning; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061983297

We also simulated the background concentrations in the absence of US anthropogenic emissions. The 1.5-dimensional volatility basis set scheme was used to represent formation of primary and secondary OA (POA and SOA). The path-integral method for source apportionment was successfully extended to OA formation using the same numerical approach previously used for ozone and then applied to apportion the anthropogenic increment of OA and ozone to six emission source categories. The anthropogenic increment is the difference between the 2013 or 2028 simulation and the background simulation. Averaged over 21 air monitoring sites in Houston, point sources make the largest contribution to monthly average SOA and OA (25%–37%, depending on year) and to monthly maximum 8-h ozone (21%–26%). Onroad and then nonroad sources are the next most important in 2013, but their contributions diminish by 2028. The sources’ contributions to SOA correlate much more strongly with their NOx emissions than with their emissions of organic precursor species. Anthropogenic emissions enhance OA formation from biogenic emissions, and this enhancement is 46% and 48% of the total OA concentration in Houston in 2013 and 2028, respectively. Point sources make the largest contribution to the enhancement.

EPA, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the EPA has the authority to regulate greenhouse gases (GHGs) under the Clean Air Act and that the EPA may not refuse to regulate once it has made a finding of endangerment. In December 2009, the EPA released its “Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases under Section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act,” known informally as the Endangerment Finding (EF). The EF found that six long-lived GHGs, in combination, should be defined as “air pollution” under the Clean Air Act and may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the health and welfare of current and future generations. The EF is an essential element of the legal basis for regulating GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act. It provides foundational support for important aspects of U.S. climate policy, including vehicle mileage standards for cars and light trucks and the emissions standards for electricity generation known as the “Clean Power Plan.” The EF was rooted in careful evaluation of observed and projected effects of GHGs, with assessments from the U.S. Global Change Research Program, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and the U.S. National Research Council providing primary evidence. The EF was clear that, although many aspects of climate change were still uncertain, the evidence available in 2009 was strong. Since the original EF, scientific information about the causes, historical impacts, and future risks of climate change has continued to accumulate. This Review assesses that new information in the context of the EF. © 2019 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Indeed, aerosol particles constitute a highly variable atmospheric component characterized by a large number of parameters describing particle sizes, morphologies (including shape and internal structure), absorption and scattering properties, amounts, horizontal and vertical distribution, etc. Reliable monitoring of all these parameters is very challenging, and therefore the aerosol effects on climate and environment are considered to be among the most uncertain factors in climate and environmental research. In this regard, observations that provide both the angular distribution of the scattered atmospheric radiation as well as its polarization state at multiple wavelengths covering the UV–SWIR spectral range carry substantial implicit information on the atmospheric composition. Therefore, high expectations in improving aerosol characterization are associated with detailed passive photopolarimetric observations. The critical need to use space-borne polarimetry for global accurate monitoring of detailed aerosol properties was first articulated in the late 1980s and early 1990s. By now, several orbital instruments have already provided polarization observations from space, and a number of advanced missions are scheduled for launch in the coming years by international and national space agencies. The first and most extensive record of polarimetric imagery was provided by POLDER-I, POLDER-II, and POLDER/PARASOL multi-angle multi-spectral polarization sensors. Polarimetric observations with the POLDER-like design intended for collecting extensive multi-angular multi-spectral measurements will be provided by several instruments, such as the MAI/TG-2, CAPI/TanSat, and DPC/GF-5 sensors recently launched by the Chinese Space Agency. Instruments such as the 3MI/MetOp-SG, MAIA, SpexOne and HARP2 on PACE, POSP, SMAC, PCF, DPC–Lidar, ScanPol and MSIP/Aerosol-UA, MAP/Copernicus CO2 Monitoring, etc. are planned to be launched by different space agencies in the coming decade. The concepts of these future instruments, their technical designs, and the accompanying algorithm development have been tested intensively and analyzed using diverse airborne prototypes. Certain polarimetric capabilities have also been implemented in such satellite sensors as GOME-2/MetOp and SGLI/GCOM-C. A number of aerosol retrieval products have been developed based on the available measurements and successfully used for different scientific applications. However, the completeness and accuracy of aerosol data operationally derived from polarimetry do not yet appear to have reached the accuracy levels implied by theoretical sensitivity studies that analyzed the potential information content of satellite polarimetry. As a result, the dataset provided by MODIS is still most frequently used by the scientific community, yet this sensor has neither polarimetric nor multi-angular capabilities. Admittedly polarimetric multi-angular observations are highly complex and have extra sensitivities to aerosol particle morphology, vertical variability of aerosol properties, polarization of surface reflectance, etc. As such, they necessitate state-of-the-art forward modeling based on first-principles physics which remains rare, and conventional retrieval approaches based on look-up tables turn out to be unsuitable to fully exploit the information implicit in the measurements. Several new-generation retrieval approaches have recently been proposed to address these challenges. These methods use improved forward modeling of atmospheric (polarized) radiances and implement a search in the continuous space of solutions using rigorous statistically optimized inversions. Such techniques provide more accurate retrievals of the main aerosol parameters such as aerosol optical thickness and yield additional parameters such as aerosol absorption. However, the operational implementation of advanced retrieval approaches generally requires a significant extra effort, and the forward-modeling part of such retrievals still needs to be substantially improved. Ground-based passive polarimetric measurements have also been evolving over the past decade. Although polarimetry helps improve aerosol characterization, especially of the fine aerosol mode, the operators of major observational networks such as AERONET remain reluctant to include polarimetric measurements as part of routine retrievals owing to their high complexity and notable increase in effort required to acquire and interpret polarization data. In addition to remote-sensing observations, polarimetric characteristics of aerosol scattering have been measured in situ as well as in the laboratory using polar nephelometers. Such measurements constitute direct observations of single scattering with no contributions from multiple scattering effects and therefore provide unique data for the validation of aerosol optical models and retrieval concepts. This article overviews the above-mentioned polarimetric observations, their history and expected developments, and the state of resulting aerosol products. It also discusses the main achievements and challenges in the exploitation of polarimetry for the improved characterization of atmospheric aerosols. © 2018 The Authors","Aerosols; Polarimetry; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Retrieval algorithms","Aerosols; Angular distribution; Atmospheric composition; Atmospheric radiation; Atmospheric structure; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Complex networks; Ellipsometry; Nanosatellites; Optical radar; Orbits; Particle size; Polarimeters; Polarization; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Space optics; Table lookup; Uncertainty analysis; Absorption and scatterings; Multi-angular capabilities; Multiple scattering effect; Polarimetric capabilities; Polarimetric measurements; Polarimetric remote sensing; Polarization observations; Retrieval algorithms; Atmospheric aerosols; AERONET; aerosol; algorithm; monitoring; parameterization; polarization; radiative transfer; remote sensing",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058149597

In this paper, we develop an integrated literature-survey framework by combining the typical content analysis with a simple statistical analysis to systematically examine the developing trends of IAM-based multi-model studies and explore the model-robust climate policy findings; we also conduct an extended analysis to identify the role of a multi-model approach in global warming and other global change research by employing co-citation network analysis. The results reveal that multi-model comparison and ensemble are effective methods to explore reliable scientific findings and yield robust policy conclusions. The current multi-model studies are sparse as a whole, especially for IAM-based climate economic and policy research; future multi-model works, at both the global and regional levels, are therefore promising. We observe that the developed countries (the EU and the US) dominate the current multi-model study, which could be proved by the number of primary IAMs developed, frequency of models adopted, and number of works published. Addressing the risks of global warming relies on reliable scientific research and robust climate policy design, particularly for the developing large emitters, which heavily depends on consistent efforts toward primary model development and comprehensive cooperation with state-of-the-art model teams all over the world. © 2019 The Author(s).

This study is based on a Nissan Leaf EV. In the electrical system, the powertrain has various components including a battery pack, a battery management system, a dc/dc converter, a dc/ac inverter, a permanent magnet synchronous motor, and a control system. In the mechanical system, it consists of power transmissions, axial shaft, and vehicle wheels. Furthermore, the driving performance of the Nissan Leaf is studied through the real-world driving tests and simulation tests in MATLAB/Simulink. In the analytical model, the vehicular dynamics is evaluated against changes in the vehicle velocity and acceleration, state of charge of the battery, and the motor power. Finally, a number of EVs involved in the power dispatch is studied. The greenhouse gas emissions of the EV are analyzed according to various energy power and driving features, and compared with the conventional internal combustion engine vehicle. In this case, Nissan Leaf is a pure EV.

Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is the dominant contributor to urban organic aerosol. Experiments were conducted at the California Air Resources Board Haagen-Smit Laboratory to characterize exhaust organics from 20 gasoline vehicles recruited from the California in-use fleet. The vehicles spanned a wide range of emission certification standards. We comprehensively characterized intermediate volatility and semivolatile organic compound emissions using thermal desorption two-dimensional gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry with electron impact (GC × GC-EI-MS) and vacuum-ultraviolet (GC × GC-VUV-MS) ionization. Single-ring aromatic compounds with unsaturated C4 and C5 substituents contribute a large fraction of the intermediate volatility organic compound (IVOC) emissions in gasoline vehicle exhaust. The analyses of quartz filters used in GC × GC-VUV-MS show that primary organic aerosol emissions were dominated by motor oil. We combined our new emissions data with published SOA yield parametrizations to estimate SOA formation potential. After 24 h of oxidation, IVOC emissions contributed 45% of SOA formation; BTEX compounds (benzene, toluene, xylenes, and ethylbenzene), 40%; other VOC aromatics, 15%. The composition of IVOC emissions was consistent across the test fleet, suggesting that future reductions in vehicular emissions will continue to reduce SOA formation and ambient particulate mass levels.

The increasing concentration of greenhouse gases (GHGs) is most responsible for the climate change phenomenon. The increasing temperature of the environment affects agricultural production systems and the production potential of natural resources. Among the GHGs, carbon dioxide (CO2) gas plays a vital role in ecosystem sustainability and maintaining ecological functioning. Agricultural systems hold great potential in terms of CO2 sequestration and transformation for mitigating the adverse effects of climate change. Plant dynamics and soil processes are affected by increasing temperature and CO2 concentration. In temperature-limited regions, crops yields have increased, but tropical regions have been adversely affected. The processes of respiration and photosynthesis are mediated by climate change. Soil ecosystem services are also being disturbed as demonstrated by modifications in soil microbial populations and diversity. Among ecosystems, the agricultural ecosystem is most affected by fractional changes in temperature and CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Climate mitigation options are needed, and forceful implementation and monitoring of environmental laws and regulations can help to minimize GHG emissions. Increasing the size of the green carpet, or afforestation, is an integral part of climate change mitigation options across the globe. Awareness among people regarding GHG emissions and their adverse effect on agricultural productivity is also a present demand. In this chapter, we will discuss various issues related to carbon sequestration, factors as well as climate change mitigation strategies, factors and CO2 potential and mitigation strategies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

Hence, it is essential to be able to determine the age of weathering profiles and quantify how fast they form. Uranium-series isotopes allow for such quantification. However, isotope compositions are generally measured in bulk regolith, which represents a complex mixture of mineral and organic phases of different origins that can impact the reliability of the information derived from U-series isotopes. Thus, in this study, we assess whether sequential extraction and mineral separation could provide more reliable estimates of weathering ages and rates. We focus on a granitic profile developed under temperate climate in southeastern Australia, a tectonically quiescent environment. Regolith production rates have been independently estimated in the region using cosmogenic isotopes. As expected, the mineralogy and geochemistry of the bulk regolith show that biotite and feldspar are the main phases lost during weathering, progressively replaced by clay minerals. There is no evidence for significant input of element from external sources, such as via aerosol deposition. While sequential extraction does not seem to affect major mineral phases and element concentrations, it is suspected of producing artificial radioactive disequilibrium. Biotite separates show very large accumulation of U and Th, which increases with decreasing depth. Regolith production rates and mineral dissolution rates calculated with weathering rates estimated using the bulk saprolite and quartz separate compositions yield values comparable to independent estimates. Conversely, weathering ages derived from the compositions of saprolite leached experimentally or biotite separates underestimate regolith production rates and mineral dissolution rates. Thus, sequential extraction or biotite separation are not recommended methods to derive reliable rates of regolith production and mineral dissolution. Despite the potential complexity of the composition of bulk regolith, the use of regolith without any pre-treatment seems to yield satisfying estimates of regolith production and mineral dissolution rates. The composition of quartz separates yields rates similar to those derived from bulk compositions. This provides an alternative method, potentially allowing reliable results to be obtained from a single mineral phase rather than a complex mixture of weathering products. © 2018","Chemical weathering; Regolith; Soil; Soil production rate; Uranium-series isotopes; Weathering age; Weathering rate","chemical weathering; geochronology; isotopic composition; pedogenesis; regolith; soil analysis; uranium isotope; uranium series dating; weathering profile; weathering rate; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058022434

Three scenarios were considered: first, the current practice of open dumping; second, the sole usage of sanitary landfilling; and third, comprising material recovery through recycling and biological treatment by composting or anaerobic digestion, and the usage of sanitary landfilling. The highest GHG emissions were observed in the second scenario with a released amount of 260,621 t of CO 2 -eq/year, followed by the current scenario with 201,112 t of CO 2 -eq/year. Both variants of the third scenario showed negative net emissions of −296,008 t of CO 2 -eq/year and −223,925 t of CO 2 -eq/year, due to the combination of GHG avoiding alternatives such as composting and biogas production as well as recycling. The cost assessment pointed towards the second scenario being the highest cost-saving scenario, requiring less than US$ 1 million/year and the current scenario as the most cost-intensive scenario, requiring around US$ 27 million/year—with a contribution from the cost of inaction of US$ 24 million/year. In addition, sensitivity analysis was performed by changing the waste compositing in relation to different income levels, which have verified the consistency of results. It also showed that with income increase in the future, GHG emissions will increase in the current and for the second scenario, while for the third scenario, the GHG emissions will reduce and the portion of recyclables will significantly increase. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Costs; Greenhouse gas emissions; Municipal solid waste; Treatment and final disposal","anaerobic digestion; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cost analysis; greenhouse gas; landfill; municipal solid waste; recycling; urban area; waste disposal; waste treatment; Maputo [Maputo (PRV)]; Maputo [Mozambique]; Mozambique",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030083967

The transect-quadrat sampling method was applied to sample the plant species and functional diversity and the aboveground plant biomass. Statistical package F-diversity v. 2011 was used to calculate the functional diversity index. OriginPro 9.0 drawing software was used to diagram 3-dimensional (longitudinal, latitudinal, and altitudinal) distribution patterns of plant diversity, plant biomass and environmental factors. Correlations among plant biomass, species diversity, functional diversity, and environmental factors were analyzed by using SPSS16.0. The results indicated that alpine steppe was the major vegetation type in high-altitude areas of the southwestern region of the AMNR, alpine wet meadow and alpine steppe were the major vegetation types in low altitude areas of the northeastern region of the AMNR. The vegetation types in mid-altitude areas of the northwestern region and low altitude areas of the southeastern region of the AMNR were primarily alpine desert. Plant species diversity and biomass did not vary significantly along latitudinal, longitudinal, and altitudinal gradients. Plant species diversity was positively correlated with soil total nitrogen, total carbon, organic carbon, and moisture. The functional diversity of the plant community was positively correlated with precipitation and soil moisture. Vegetation biomass was positively correlated with soil total nitrogen, organic carbon, and soil moisture, whereas it was negatively correlated with soil bulk density. Plant species diversity was positively correlated with the functional diversity of the plant community. The integrated effects of geographic factors, soil factors, and meteorological conditions contributed to the spatial heterogeneity of species biodiversity and vegetation biomass of the plant communities in the AMNR, whereas the effects of soil and climatic factors were much stronger than those of geographical factors. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Alpine Desert Nature Reserve; Impacting factors; Plant biomass; Plant functional diversity; Plant species diversity","Biodiversity; Landforms; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Soil moisture; Vegetation; Impacting factor; Nature reserves; Plant biomass; Plant functional diversities; Plant species diversity; Biomass; aboveground biomass; alpine environment; climate conditions; desert; environmental factor; geographical variation; plant community; software; soil property; species diversity; statistical analysis; vegetation type; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056816393

Since 2013 China implemented carbon emission trading scheme (ETS) in seven provinces or cities. The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether the implementation of ETS can result in the Porter effect. Based on the Porter hypothesis theory, this study employs the difference-in-difference (DID) method and the improved DEA model to analyze whether ETS can bring economic dividend and environmental dividend. The empirical results specify that in the short term, ETS can significantly reduce carbon emissions in the pilot provinces, but fail to increase GDP. Therefore, ETS does not realize the Porter effect in the short term. Nevertheless, in terms of the empirical results we can find ETS plays a significant role in emission reduction. In the long term, ETS can stimulate sustainable economic dividend and environmental dividend, and achieve the Porter effect. From the test results, we can find ETS has good economic and emission reduction functions. ETS achieves the Porter effect in the long term but not in the short term. In order to achieve the Porter effect from ETS successfully, a sound carbon emission trading scheme must be established to ensure efficient carbon emission trading market. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","DEA; Difference-in-difference (DID); Emission trading scheme; Porter effect","Carbon; Emission control; International law; Carbon emission trading; Carbon emissions; Difference-in-differences; Emission reduction; Emission trading scheme; Porter effect; Porter hypothesis; Sustainable economics; Commerce; carbon emission; emissions trading; empirical analysis; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; Kyoto Protocol; pollution tax; Article; carbon emission trading scheme; China; ecological procedures; environmental parameters; environmental protection; government regulation; greenhouse effect; gross national product; market; policy; pollution monitoring; Porter effect; priority journal; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056170190

In this work, regional simulations with the fully coupled NPF-explicit WRF-Chem model link NPF to cloud properties and to changes in both meteorology and air quality in the U.S. Midwest during summer 2008. Simulations that include NPF have higher concentrations of condensation nuclei, as anticipated from the particle production associated with nucleation, leading to enhanced concentrations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) at high supersaturations. However, the online-coupled model develops a number of unexpected features that can be traced to a feedback loop involving aqueous (in-cloud) oxidation of sulfur combined with boundary layer NPF. Simulations with NPF (relative to simulations without) exhibit reduced PM2.5 sulfate mass, cloud dimming (reductions in the cloud frequency, CCN concentration at a low supersaturation, cloud optical depth, and cloud droplet number concentration), and enhanced surface-reaching shortwave radiation. This effect of NPF on the PM2.5 mass is mostly absent for other constituents of PM2.5. The implications of this feedback loop, which is not considered in most climate and air quality modeling, are discussed. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Aerosol cloud interaction; Air quality; Indirect climate effect; Meteorology; New particle formation; Sulfate; WRF-Chem","Aerosols; Boundary layers; Condensation; Feedback; Meteorology; Nucleation; Sulfur compounds; Supersaturation; Aerosol-cloud interaction; Climate effects; New particle formation; Sulfate; WRF-Chem; Air quality; aerosol composition; air quality; boundary layer; cloud cover; concentration (composition); nucleation; oxidation; particle size; particulate matter; sulfur compound; supersaturation; troposphere; Midwest; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064010332

More specifically, it aims to achieve a balanced network of pick-up and drop-off stations in urban areas with the help of the users, thus reducing the dedicated management trucks that redistribute bikes among stations. The proposal aims to persuade users to choose different routes from the shortest route between a start and an end location. This persuasion is carried out when it is not possible to park the bike in the desired station due to the lack of parking slots, or when the user is highly influenceable. Differently to other works, instead of employing a single criteria to recommend alternative stations, the proposed system can incorporate a variety of criteria. This result is achieved by providing a defeasible logic-based persuasion engine that is capable of aggregating the results from multiple recommendation rules.

Only small efforts have been made so far to assess the biomass and soil carbon sequestration at micro-level. This study was carried out to obtain sufficient information about the carbon stock potential of Gerba-Dima forest in south-western Ethiopia. A total of 90 sample plots were laid by employing stratified random sampling. Nested plots were used to collect data of the four carbon pools. For trees with a diameter range of 5 cm &lt; diameter &lt; 20 cm, the carbon stock was assessed from a plot size of 49 m 2 (7 m∗7 m). For trees with a diameter range of 20 cm &lt; diameter &lt; 50 cm, the carbon stock was assessed from a plot size of 625 m 2 (25 m∗25 m). For trees &gt; 50 cm diameter, an additional larger sample of 35∗35 m 2 was used. Litter, herb and soil data were collected from 1 m 2 subplot established at the center of each nested plot. To compute the above ground biomass carbon stock of trees and shrubs with DBH &gt; 5 cm, their DBH and height were measured. The biomass carbon assessment of woody species having DBH &lt; 5 cm, litter and herb were conducted by measuring their fresh weight in the field and dry weight in the laboratory. Results: The mean total carbon stock density of Gerba-Dima forest was found to be 508.9 tons carbon ha -1 , out of which 243.8, 45.97, 0.03 and 219.1 tons carbon ha -1 were stored in the above ground biomass, below ground biomass, litter biomass and soil organic carbon, respectively. Conclusions: The existence of high carbon stock in the study forest shows the potential of the area for climate change mitigation. Thus, all stakeholders at the local and national level should work together to implement effective conservation measures and get benefit from the biocarbon fund. © 2019 The Author(s).","Carbon; Ethiopia; Forest; Gerba-Dima","aboveground biomass; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; developing world; herb; montane forest; soil carbon; soil organic matter; stakeholder; woody plant; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061002077

The spatially explicit study combines a life cycle analysis (LCA) for biodiversity impact assessment with a global high resolution economic land use model. Both impacts of domestic land use and impacts through imports were included for estimating the biodiversity footprint of the member states of the (EU28). The analyzed scenarios assumed similar biomass demand until 2020 but differed thereafter, from keeping the growth of demand for bioenergy constant (CONST), to a strong increase of bioenergy in line with the EU target of decreasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 80% by 2050 (EMIRED) and with the baseline (BASE) scenario falling between the other two. As a general trend, the increasing demand for biomass was found to have substantial impact on biodiversity in all scenarios, while the differences between the scenarios were found to be modest. The share caused by imports was 15% of the overall biodiversity impacts detected in this study in the year 2000, and progressively increased to 24% to 26% in 2050, depending on the scenario. The most prominent future change in domestic land use in all scenarios was the expansion of perennial cultivations for energy. In the EMIRED scenario, there is a larger expansion of perennial cultivations and a smaller expansion of cropland in the EU than in the other two scenarios. As the biodiversity damage is smaller for land used for perennial cultivations than for cropland, this development decreases the internal biodiversity damage per unit of land. At the same time, however, the EMIRED scenario also features the largest outsourcing of damage, due to increased import of cropland products from outside the EU for satisfying the EU food demand. These two opposite effects even out each other, resulting in the total biodiversity damage for the EMIRED scenario being only slightly higher than the other two scenarios. The results of this study indicate that increasing cultivation of perennials for bioenergy and the consequent decrease in the availability of cropland for food production in the EU may lead to outsourcing of agricultural products supply to other regions. This development is associated with a leakage of biodiversity damages to species-rich and vulnerable regions outside the EU. In the case of a future increase in bioenergy demand, the combination of biomass supply from sustainable forest management in the EU, combined with imported wood pellets and cultivation of perennial energy crops, appears to be less detrimental to biodiversity than expansion of energy crops in the EU. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity damage; Bioenergy; EU footprint; Forestry; Land use; Perennial energy crops; Trade","Agricultural products; Biodiversity; Biomass; Chemical contamination; Commerce; Crops; Cultivation; Expansion; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Life cycle; Outsourcing; Bio-energy; Bioenergy policies; Energy crops; Impact assessments; Life cycle analysis; Spatially explicit; Sustainable forest management; Vulnerable regions; International trade; biodiversity; bioenergy; ecological footprint; energy crop; energy policy; environmental impact assessment; European Union; forestry; land use change; life cycle analysis; policy implementation; spatial analysis; trade-environment relations; article; biodiversity; bioenergy; biomass; carbon footprint; cropland; energy crop; European Union; food industry; forest management; life cycle; nonhuman; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053935941

While alternative energies (e.g., biofuels) extracted from feedstock (e.g., micro-algae) represent a promising role, their production requires reliably modeled photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). PAR models predict energy parameters (e.g., algal carbon fixation) to aid in decision-making at PAR sites. Here, we model very short-term (5-min scale), sub-tropical region's PAR with an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System model with a Centroid-Mean (ANFIS-CM) trained with a non-climate input (i.e., only the solar angle, θ Z ). Accuracy is benchmarked against genetic programming (GP), M5Tree, Random Forest (RF), and multiple linear regression (MLR). ANFIS-CM integrates fuzzy and neural network algorithms, whereas GP adopts an evolutionary approach, M5Tree employs binary decision, RF employs a bootstrapped ensemble, and MLR uses statistical tools to link PAR with θ Z . To design the ANFIS-CM model, 5-min θ Z (01–31 December 2012; 0500H–1900H) for sub-tropical, Toowoomba are utilized to extract predictive features, and the testing accuracy (i.e., differences between measurements and forecasts) is evaluated with correlation (r), root-mean-square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), Willmott (WI), Nash–Sutcliffe (E NS ), and Legates &amp; McCabes (E LM ) Index. ANFIS-CM and GP are equivalent for 5-min forecasts, yielding the lowest RMSE (233.45 and 233.01μ mol m −2 s −1 ) and MAE (186.59 and 186.23 μmol m −2 s −1 ). In contrast, MLR, M5Tree, and RF yields higher RMSE and MAE [(RMSE = 322.25 μmol m −2 s −1 , MAE = 275.32 μmol m −2 s −1 ), (RMSE = 287.70 μmol m −2 s −1 , MAE = 234.78 μmol m −2 s −1 ), and (RMSE = 359.91 μmol m −2 s −1 , MAE = 324.52 μmol m −2 s −1 )]. Based on normalized error, ANFIS-CM is considerably superior (MAE = 17.18% versus 19.78%, 34.37%, 26.39%, and 30.60% for GP, MLR, M5Tree, and RF models, respectively). For hourly forecasts, ANFIS-CM outperforms all other methods (WI = 0.964 vs. 0.942, 0.955, 0.933 &amp; 0.893, and E LM  = 0.741 versus 0.701, 0.728, 0.619 &amp; 0.490 for GP, MLR, M5Tree, and RF, respectively).

Invasive species can alter ecosystem structure over time, further complicating interactions between invasive species and invaded communities in response to additional stressors. Few studies have considered how cumulative impacts of species invasion and global change on the structure of invaded ecosystems may influence persistence and population growth of introduced species. Here, we present an empirically based population model for an invasive epiphytic bryozoan that can dramatically alter the structure of its invaded kelp bed ecosystems. We use this model to predict the response of invasive species to climate change and associated changes in the invaded community. Population growth of the bryozoan increased under near-future projections of increasing ocean temperature; however, the magnitude of population growth depended on the community composition of invaded kelp beds. Our results suggest that, in some cases, indirect effects of climate change mediated through changes to the structure of the invaded habitat can modulate direct effects of climate change on invasive species, with consequences for their long-term ecological impact. Our findings have important implications for management of invasive species, as modifying invaded habitats at local to regional scales may be more logistically feasible than addressing stressors related to global climate change. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bryozoan; Kelp beds; Population dynamics; Population model; Temperature","bryozoan; climate change; community composition; demography; ecological impact; ecosystem structure; global change; global climate; introduced species; invasive species; population dynamics; population growth; population modeling; temperature effect; Bryozoa; climate change; ecosystem; introduced species; kelp; population growth; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Introduced Species; Kelp; Population Growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059518572

In T. sebifera's native range, soil sterilization could increase its performance by suppression of soil pathogens. However, the interactive effects among these factors on photosynthetic characteristics of both native and invasive T. sebifera are still not understood. Here, we conducted a pot-experiment with both native and invasive populations of T. sebifera to test how N deposition, UV-B radiation and soil sterilization affect T. sebifera performance with respect to biomass and photosynthetic ability. Total biomass and the effective quantum yield of photosystem II (Y(II), correlates to plant CO2 assimilation) of invasive populations were higher, but the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm, a stress indicator) was lower than that of the native populations in sterilized soil. Leaf biomass and leaf area of invasive populations were higher than that of the native populations. Leaf area of both native and invasive populations, total biomass of native populations and relative chlorophyll content of invasive populations were increased by N deposition. Leaf area of invasive populations was increased but that of the native populations was not affected by N deposition in sterilized soil. Y(II) was reduced by UV-B radiation and soil sterilization. These results suggest invasive T. sebifera populations were higher in CO2 assimilation rate and lower in resistance to environmental stress. The stronger performance of T. sebifera from the invasive range could have been facilitated by N deposition via increased leaf area in sterilized soil even though no significant differences were observed by N deposition in active soil.

In many countries with tropical forests however, a variety of REDD+ projects continue to develop on the ground. This paper fills in some of the gaps in our understanding of the dynamic relation between global policymaking and implementation of REDD+ on the ground. Using the introduction of REDD+ in Southwest Ghana as an example, we apply a practice-based approach to analyze the different roles that local actors and global-local intermediaries played in the introduction of REDD+. Our results show a more balanced picture than polarized debates at the global levels suggest. The logic of practice explains how REDD+ was translated to the local situation. Global actors took a lead but depended on local actors to make REDD+ work. Together, they integrated elements of existing practices that helped REDD+ 'land' locally but also transformed REDD+ globally to resemble such local practices. REDD+ initiatives absorbed elements from established community-based conservation, forest restoration, and sustainable agro-forestry practices.

Additionally, animal bones and freshwater bivalve shells (Unio sp.) were collected from Bronze Age archaeological excavations around Lake Balaton and their stable C and O isotope compositions were measured in order to investigate climate changes and lake evolution processes during this period. The data indicate warm and humid conditions with elevated summer precipitation around 3.7 cal ka BP (Before Present, where present is 1950 CE), followed by a short-term deterioration in environmental conditions at about 3.5 cal ka BP. The environment became humid and cold with winter precipitation dominance around 3.5 to 3.4 cal ka BP, then gradually changed to drier conditions at ∼3.2 cal ka BP. Significant cultural changes have been inferred for this period on the basis of observations during archaeological excavations. The most straightforward consequences of environmental variations have been found in changes of settlement structure.

We combined in situ sampling and gas chromatography with geostatistical and remote sensing approaches to estimate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of a large hydropower reservoir. We used remote sensing data to estimate the water surface and geospatial interpolation to calculate total emissions as a function of reservoir surface area. The CH4 and CO2 gas concentrations were linearly correlated to sampling time, confirming the adequacy of the in situ sampling method to measure GHG diffusive fluxes from reservoir water surfaces. The combination of high purity (99.99%) ISO-norm gas standards with a gas chromatograph, enabled us to achieve low measurement detection limits of 0.16 and 0.60 μmol mol−1, respectively, for CH4 (using a flame ionization or FID detector) and CO2 (using a thermal conductivity or TCD detector). Our results show that CO2 emissions are significantly (an order of 5.102–103) higher than those of CH4 in both the spatial and temporal domain for this reservoir. The total diffusive GHG emissions over a year (June 2011 to May 2012) of the Tucuruí hydropower reservoir being in operation, in units of tons of carbon, added up to 6.82 × 103 for CH4 and 1.19 × 106 for CO2. We show that in situ GHG sampling using small floating gas chambers and high precision gas chromatography can be combined with geospatial interpolation techniques and remote sensing data to obtain estimates of diffusive GHG emissions from large water bodies with fluctuating water surfaces such as hydropower reservoirs. We recommend that more measurements and observations on these emissions are pursued in order to support and better quantify the ongoing discussions on estimates and mitigation of GHG emissions from reservoirs in the Amazon region and elsewhere in the world. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Amazon; Diffusive emissions; GHG fluxes; Spatial interpolation; Tucuruí","Carbon dioxide; Gas chromatography; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Hydroelectric power; Interpolation; Ionization of gases; Remote sensing; Surface waters; Thermal conductivity of gases; Amazon; Geo-spatial analysis; Geospatial interpolations; GHG flux; Hydroelectric reservoirs; Hydropower reservoirs; Remote sensing approaches; Spatial interpolation; Greenhouse gases; chlorophyll a; air sampling; carbon emission; carbon flux; gas chromatography; greenhouse gas; hydroelectric power plant; in situ measurement; interpolation; remote sensing; spatial analysis; air analysis; air quality; Amazonas (Brazil); Article; carbon footprint; chlorophyll content; concentration (parameters); controlled study; environmental impact; flame ionization detection; gas analysis; gas chromatography; geospatial analysis; geostatistical analysis; hydropower; limit of detection; priority journal; remote sensing; spatial analysis; thermal conductivity; water supply; water temperature; Amazonia; Brazil; Para [Brazil]; Tucurui Lake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052944950

For example, while cover crops are promoted for their conservation benefits, their impact on N2O emissions varies considerably. Subsurface banding of animal manures is promoted to reduce nitrogen losses through ammonia volatilization, but the impact on soil N2O emissions is uncertain. To assess the interactive effects of cover crops and subsurface banded poultry litter (SSB PL), we measured annual N2O emissions for three years in a field trial of corn (Zea mays L.) in Beltsville, MD, following either winter fallow or mulched cover crops (cereal rye [Secale cereale L.], hairy vetch [Vicia villosa Roth.], or a mixture of both species), with four rates of SSB PL (9276 kg plant available N (PAN) ha-1) and selected contrasts with surface banded urea-ammonium nitrate (UAN, 150 kg N ha-1) or broadcast incorporated PL (67 kg PAN ha-1). N2O emissions increased exponentially with total N input from organic sources (SSB PL + cover crop residue). This relationship differed by cover crop treatment, with lowest emissions following cereal rye, and highest emissions following hairy vetch. The model intercept ranged from 0.3061.371 kg N2O-N ha-1 (cereal rye &lt; bare ground = mixture &lt; hairy vetch; p = 0.03, 0.24, 0.01), and the exponential coefficient ranged from 0.003000.00603 kg N2O-N kg-1 N (hairy vetch &lt; cereal rye = bare ground = mixture; p = 0.02, p &gt; 0.10). Corn grain yield was similar (mean, 13.8 Mg ha−1) for all cover crops when PL was applied at 135 kg PAN ha−1. SSB PL increased N2O emissions relative to tillage-incorporated PL at an equivalent rate following hairy vetch or cover crop mixture (by 76% or 60%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001) while increasing corn yield by 32% or 16%, respectively. SSB PL decreased emissions relative to surface banded UAN at an equivalent rate following the cover crop mixture, but increased emissions following bare ground (by 34% and 45%, respectively; p = 0.002) while having no influence on corn grain yield, which averaged 13.7 Mg ha−1. Our results indicate that grass:legume cover crop mixtures with SSB PL can lower N2O emissions compared to legume monoculture with SSB PL while maintaining comparable N inputs and corn grain yields. © 2018","Cereal rye; Cover crop mixture; Hairy vetch; Nitrous oxide; Pelletized poultry litter; Subsurface banding","best management practice; cereal; cover crop; crop yield; emission; grass; legume; litter; maize; nitrous oxide; organic nitrogen; poultry; Beltsville; Maryland; United States; Animalia; Secale cereale; Vicia villosa; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057455023

A simple model is proposed that assumes equal proton activities in the catalyst film and the near-surface electrolyte. Equations are derived that describe the limitations relating to proton transport mediated by fluxes of molecular ""buffer bases"" in the electrolyte. The model explains (1) the need for buffer bases in near-neutral OER and (2) the pH dependence of the catalytic current at high overpotentials. The latter is determined by the concentration of unprotonated buffer bases times an effective diffusion constant, which can be estimated for simple cell geometries from tabulated diffusion coefficients. The model predicts (3) a macroscopic region of increased pH close to the OER electrode and at intermediate overpotentials, (4) a Tafel slope that depends on the reciprocal buffer capacity; both predictions are awaiting experimental verification. The suggested first-order model captures and predicts major trends of OER in the near-neutral pH, without accounting for proton-transport limitations at the catalyst-electrolyte interface and within the catalyst material, but the full quantitative agreement may require refinements. The suggested model also may be applicable to further electrocatalytic processes. © 2019 by the authors.","Electrocatalysis; Mass transport limitation; OER; Oxygen-evolution reaction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062151745

The environmental samples studied were oily seawater and soil samples, that had been bioaugmented with natural materials rich in hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria. This molecular approach revealed much more diverse bacterial taxa than the culture-dependent method we had used in an earlier study for the analysis of the same samples. The study described the dynamics of bacterial communities during bioremediation. The main limitation associated with this molecular approach, namely of not distinguishing hydrocarbonoclastic taxa from others, was overcome by consulting the literature for the hydrocarbonoclastic potential of taxa related to those identified in this study. By doing so, it was concluded that the hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial taxa were much more diverse than those captured by the culture-dependent approach. The molecular analysis also revealed the frequent occurrence of nifH-genes in the total genomic DNA extracts of all the studied environmental samples, which reflects a nitrogen-fixation potential. Nitrogen fertilization is long known to enhance microbial oil-bioremediation. The study revealed that bioaugmentation using plant rhizospheres or soil with long history of oil-pollution was more effective in oil-removal in the desert soil than in seawater microcosms. © 2018 The Authors.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of different shading methods and the use of calcium particle films on the conilon coffee ecophysiological parameters in the coastal flatland the State of Sergipe, Brazil. The field experiment was carried out as randomized block design with four treatments: i) Natural shading (intercropping coffee and banana plants), ii) Artificial shading with 10% w/v CaCO3 particle films; iii) Artificial shading with 20% w/v CaO particle films; and iv) and control (without shading), and four replicates. Measurements were performed 7, 21 and 35 days after film application at 9:00 h and 12:00 h. Individual parameters, gas exchange efficiency, chlorophyll a fluorescence and maintenance of film coverage on leaves were evaluated. Artificial shading with particle films promoted greater physiological stability of the coffee plants during diurnal meteorological oscillations as compared to the control, resulting in higher rates of liquid photosynthesis (A), better control on stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration (E). Improvement was also observed in the plant water use efficiency (WUE and IWUE) and in the reduction of leaf temperature. Calcium particle films were more efficient in providing protection to the photosystems and improving photochemical efficiency and energy conversion for photophosphorylation than natural shading. However, the results were more pronounced at 21 days after film application and more persistent for treatment with 20% CaO film. Therefore, calcium particle films are useful tools to alleviate coffee plants stress under adverse climate conditions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Brazil; Calcium carbonate; Calcium oxide; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Coffee stress; Gas exchange","calcium carbonate; chlorophyll; coffee; ecophysiology; environmental stress; film; fluorescence; gas exchange; lime; photosynthesis; shading; solar radiation; stomatal conductance; temperature; transpiration; water use efficiency; Brazil; Sergipe; Coffea canephora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054921139

Collins, CO, United States","Water shortages are responsible for the greatest crop losses around the world and are expected to worsen. In arid areas where agriculture is dependent on irrigation, various forms of deficit irrigation management have been suggested to achieve high yields with less water used by the crop (i.e. evapotranspiration, ET). This study of maize evaluated twelve treatments with varying levels of deficit irrigation during late vegetative and maturation (grain filling) growth stages in semi-arid Northern Colorado. In particular, application of greater deficit during the late vegetative state with full or nearly full ET during the rest of the season consistently resulted in yield similar to full ET treatments while saving approximately 15–17% of ET. Maize given 40% of full ET during the late vegetative period had slightly reduced leaf area index (LAI) with significant leaf curling, thus reduced light interception during vegetative growth. However, when plants were fully watered during anthesis, all treatments had full canopy cover with no differences in light interception. The efficiency of photosystem II (quantum yield) declined with water stress but recovered with re-watering. The ability of photosystem II and light interception to recover after stress when well-watered suggests that reductions in biomass and yield resulted from stomatal closure, reduced photochemistry, or loss of xylem conductance that was temporary. With little indication of permanent decline in carbon assimilation after reducing ET in vegetative stages, maize appears able to achieve high grain yield if soil water is readily available during the reproductive and maturation stages. However, plants given full or nearly full irrigation during the entire vegetative period followed by stress later on during the maturation period, had dramatically greater yield loss than ET savings. Thus, while strategic deficit irrigation might maintain yield with less water, it may be especially important for buffering crops against yield losses due to end of season water shortfalls in water limited environments. © 2018","DI; Evapotranspiration; Limited irrigation; SDI; Water productivity; WP","Crops; Evapotranspiration; Irrigation; Plant shutdowns; Plants (botany); Productivity; Soil moisture; Water management; Water supply; Carbon assimilation; Deficit irrigation; Light interception; Limited irrigations; Maturation periods; Vegetative growth; Vegetative periods; Water productivity; Grain (agricultural product); biomass; crop plant; crop yield; evapotranspiration; growth; interception; irrigation system; leaf area index; maize; maturation; semiarid region; soil water; water stress; yield response; Colorado; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053813984

Unfortunately, the Brazilian coffee production is threatened by high temperatures projected by climate change models. We evaluated three schemes of low levels of shade, which avoid the loss of production, as a strategy to adapt coffee to possible climate change. Additionally, as field measurements are expensive and often difficult to implement, we used numerical simulation to complement the evaluation. The microclimate simulator software Envi-met is a computer program often used to simulate urban environments, and we tested it on agriculture design. We verified that the shaded schemes assessed in the field decreased the air temperature in 0.6 °C in the studied period and reduced other possible climate stressors such as wind speed, radiation and raised air humidity in the dry period. Envi-met described the studied meteorological variable cycle very well, showing that combining numerical modelling and field research may be an important tool for planning the adaptation of the coffee sector to possible climate change, allowing growers choose a proper technique for their regions and environmental conditions. Finally, we highlighted the importance of planning the shade scheme on coffee areas in an interdisciplinary approach, including local climate evaluation to achieve a balance between temperature attenuation and production. © 2019 The Authors","Agriculture; Environmental science",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062095743

Shifting biomass allocation is a plastic response of species to altered resource availability, and optimal allocation theory predicts plants should increase allocation to roots when water is limiting to growth. However, optimal allocation could be influenced by other factors, such as plant nutrient status and the seasonality of precipitation. Here, we evaluated the allocation response of eight common shrub species (four deciduous, four evergreen) from the Mediterranean climate region of Southern California to experimental manipulation of nitrogen and water availability, as well as seasonal drought. Evergreen species increased allocation to roots in response to low water availability to a greater degree than deciduous species, and also showed less of a decline in total biomass with water limitation, consistent with the predictions of optimal allocation theory. Deciduous species were more limited by nitrogen than evergreen species, requiring them to maintain high allocation below-ground regardless of water availability. Evergreen species were also able to equalize root allocation in response to early- versus late-season drought, while deciduous species responded non-optimally, reducing allocation to roots when early-season soil moisture was plentiful, resulting in the most strongly reduced growth by late-season drought. These experiments demonstrate how optimal allocation theory can be used to predict species responses to environmental changes in semi-arid systems, but should account for patterns of co-limitation and seasonality of resources. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Allocation; Deciduous; Evergreen; Mediterranean-type ecosystem; Nitrogen; Roots","biomass; biomass allocation; deciduous tree; drought; evergreen tree; growth; nitrogen; precipitation (climatology); resource allocation; resource availability; root system; semiarid region; shrub; water availability; California; Mediterranean Region; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047960722

Indeed, investigators in household air pollution (HAP) and water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH), working in poor parts of the world, rarely interact despite having similar training and using similar methods to evaluate interventions in the same vulnerable populations. Disappointing results from recent trials of improved cookstoves and traditional approaches to WaSH suggest the need for alternative approaches. OBJECTIVES: We argue that bringing these two areas together would improve the effectiveness and efficiency of interventions to reduce the massive disease burden associated with HAP and poor WaSH, including pneumonia and diarrhea, the leading killers of young children in low-income countries. RESULTS: HAP and WaSH face similar challenges in designing, implementing, and securing the sustained and exclusive use of scalable interventions such as clean fuel and water. DISCUSSION: Research can advance greater coordination of these areas by demonstrating their interactions and wider impacts on well-being as well as the potential for programmatic synergies. Integrated solutions to clean households and communities can benefit from the contribution in multiple disciplines, including economics and policy analysis; business and finance; engineering and technology; lab sciences, environmental health, and biomedical sciences; and behavioral and implementation sciences. CONCLUSION: There are compelling reasons to overcome the artificial and unproductive segregation of HAP and WaSH. Researchers should encourage integration by expanding the scope of their collaborations and projects. Policy makers, funders, and implementers can help by supporting compre-hensive solutions, encouraging innovation, and requiring rigorous evaluations of their effects. © 2019, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

However, electrodes for electrophysiology are typically made from metals, which cause significant susceptibility artifacts on MR images. Previous work has demonstrated that insulated carbon fiber bundle electrodes reduce the volume of magnetic susceptibility artifacts and can be used to record local field potentials (LFP), but the relatively large diameter of the probes make them unsuitable for multi- and single-unit recordings. Although single carbon fiber electrodes have recently been used to record single-unit activity, these probes require modifications in order to aid insertion and the use of these probes in fMRI has yet to be validated. Therefore, there is a need for a single-carbon fiber electrode design that (1) minimizes the volume of the susceptibility artifact, (2) can record from a wide frequency band that includes LFP and multi- and single-unit recording, and (3) is practical to insert without additional modifications. Here, we demonstrate that carbon-fiber electrodes made from single carbon monofilaments (35 μm in diameter) meet all of these criteria. Carbon monofilament electrodes modified with the conductive polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) have lower impedances and higher signal-to-noise ratio recordings than platinum-iridium electrodes, a current gold standard for chronic single-unit recording. Furthermore, these probes distort a significantly smaller volume of voxels compared to tungsten and platinum-iridium electrodes in agarose phantom and in vivo MR images, leading to higher contrast-to-noise ratio in regions proximal to the electrode implantation site during fMRI. Collectively, this work establishes that carbon monofilaments are a practical choice for combined electrophysiology-fMRI experiments. © 2018","Carbon monofilament; Electrode; fMRI; PEDOT; Single-unit recording","iridium; poly(3,4 ethylenedioxythiophene); polymer; tungsten; unclassified drug; carbon fiber; fused heterocyclic rings; poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene); polymer; algorithm; animal tissue; Article; brain blood volume; carbon monofilament electrode; contrast to noise ratio; controlled study; electrophysiology; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; gold standard; image quality; in vivo study; local field potential; nonhuman; primary somatosensory cortex; priority journal; rat; signal noise ratio; validation process; animal; brain cortex; devices; electrode implant; electroencephalography; electrophysiology; equipment design; functional neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic; Carbon Fiber; Cerebral Cortex; Electrodes, Implanted; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiological Phenomena; Equipment Design; Female; Functional Neuroimaging; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Polymers; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058623345

In this study, a method for estimating future intensity–depth–frequency (IDF) curves in Korea is proposed using a simple scale-invariance assumption associated with trend analysis of future extreme rainfall data. First, the scale characteristics of hourly rainfall data observed at 60 meteorological stations operated by Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) are examined, and scale parameters of IDF curves are estimated from observed scale-invariance characteristics. Second, the future daily annual maximum rainfall data provided by KMA-RCM is bias-corrected. Various methods are used for the correction of biases of rainfall depths. The third is trend analysis, which is used to determine the mean and the coefficient of variance of future daily annual maximum rainfall time series in future years.

To detect the technical ineffectiveness in the coal-fired power generation industry and the effects of carbon emission reductions, this study developed energy congestion models using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Energy congestion is classified into undesirable energy congestion (UEC) and desirable energy congestion (DEC) under natural disposability and managerial disposability. The UEC and DEC models were used to identify energy congestion, measure the amounts of UEC and DEC, and analyze the sources of inefficiency for regional coal-fired generation industry in China from 2004 to 2013. Our empirical analysis revealed: i) The UEC of coal-fired generation industry has occurred in many regions, most of which are less-developed areas. This indicates that energy is wasted in coal-fired generation industry due to congestion inefficiency. ii) DEC has occurred in a few regions and did not occur in 2013. These provinces where DEC occurred may have a high potential for eco-technology innovation. The method of energy congestion measurement proposed in this study and the research conclusion have reference effect on regional energy conservation and eco-technology innovation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Desirable energy congestion; Energy congestion; Managerial disposability; Natural disposability; Undesirable energy congestion","Carbon; Coal; Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Engineering research; Managers; Carbon emission reductions; Coal fired generation; Coal-fired power generation; Congestion models; Desirable energy congestion; Empirical analysis; Energy congestion; Undesirable energy; Coal industry; coal-fired power plant; data envelopment analysis; electricity generation; empirical analysis; energy planning; energy resource; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056172063

However, the interactive effects of rice roots and soil microbes on CH 4 emissions in paddy fields are not clearly understood. We conducted two field experiments over three years. Soil CH 4 fluxes and cumulative CH 4 emissions, rice root traits, and microbial communities and activities in soil were measured using three mid-season japonica rice cultivars (Wuyujing 3, Zhendao 88, and Huaidao 5) that have the same growth durations and similar aboveground traits before heading. The CH 4 emissions during the mid-growing period (from panicle initiation to heading) contributed 39.0–49.7% of the total emissions during the entire growing season and differed significantly among the rice cultivars. The root morphological and physiological traits (i.e. root dry weight, root length, root oxidation activity, and root radial oxygen loss) were negatively correlated with CH 4 fluxes. Compared to the zero-N control, application rates of N fertilizer at 54 and 108 kg ha −1 increased root biomass of cultivar Zhendao 88 by 10.1% and 17.3%, respectively, leading to corresponding decreases in CH 4 emissions by 12.7% and 22.9%. The root exudates (malic acid, succinic acid, and citric acid) promoted the abundance and activity of methanotrophs, which was the primary factors underlying the low CH 4 emissions in the paddy fields. Our findings suggested that stronger root systems, higher oxygen delivered by roots available for methanotrophs and suitable root exudates interacted in the rhizosphere, established a favourable habitat for microbial populations, and reduced CH 4 emissions in paddy fields. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Methane emission; Methanogen and methanotroph; Rhizosphere soil; Rice; Root exudate; Root traits","Climate change; Cultivation; Methane; Microorganisms; Oxygen; Physiology; Methane emissions; Methanotrophs; Rhizosphere soils; Rice; Root exudates; Root traits; Soils; abundance; agricultural emission; biomass; cultivar; exudation; flux measurement; methane; methanogenic bacterium; methanotrophy; microbial activity; microbial community; morphology; paddy field; physiology; rhizosphere; rice; root; Japonica; Oryza sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059299712

However, there still exists interest in reducing emissions, especially from some members of Congress, and there are a number of federal policy options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions if Congress (or a new administration in 2021) so chooses. In this paper, we show that a federal economy-wide carbon tax on US carbon dioxide emissions could significantly contribute to the reductions necessary to fulfill the US international climate commitments. Using a detailed multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, we predict the carbon price paths that would be necessary to meet the 28% emissions target and show the economic costs of such carbon-pricing policies. We then demonstrate how both the price paths and associated costs change if action is delayed. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Carbon tax; climate; computable general equilibrium model; emissions targets",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058337984

They determine how large surface air temperature will increase under CO 2 forcing ultimately, which is essential for carbon reduction policies to achieve a specific warming target. In this study, these metrics are analyzed in a climate system model newly developed by the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS-CSM) and compared with multi-model results from the Coupled Model Comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). Based on two idealized CO 2 forcing scenarios, i.e., abruptly quadrupled CO 2 and CO 2 increasing 1% per year, the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) and transient climate response (TCR) in CAMS-CSM are estimated to be about 2.27 and 1.88 K, respectively. The ECS is near the lower bound of CMIP5 models whereas the TCR is closer to the multi-model ensemble mean (MME) of CMIP5 due to compensation of a relatively low ocean heat uptake (OHU) efficiency. The low ECS is caused by an unusually negative climate feedback in CAMS-CSM, which is attributed to cloud shortwave feedback (λ SWCL ) over the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean. The CMIP5 ensemble shows that more negative λ SWCL is related to larger increase in low-level (925–700 hPa) cloud over the tropical Indo-Pacific under warming, which can explain about 90% of λ SWCL in CAMS-CSM. Static stability of planetary boundary layer in the pre-industrial simulation is a critical factor controlling the low-cloud response and λ SWCL across the CMIP5 models and CAMS-CSM. Evidently, weak stability in CAMS-CSM favors lowcloud formation under warming due to increased low-level convergence and relative humidity, with the help of enhanced evaporation from the warming tropical Pacific. Consequently, cloud liquid water increases, amplifying cloud albedo, and eventually contributing to the unusually negative λ SWCL and low ECS in CAMS-CSM. Moreover, the OHU may influence climate feedbacks and then the ECS by modulating regional sea surface temperature responses. © 2019, The Chinese Meteorological Society and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","climate feedback; climate sensitivity; cloud shortwave feedback; Coupled Model Comparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5); the Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences climate system model (CAMS-CSM)","air temperature; carbon dioxide; climate feedback; climate forcing; climate modeling; CMIP; comparative study; sea surface temperature; sensitivity analysis; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (Tropical); Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Tropical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061185748

Grassland regulation and sustainability in this region require an accurate assessment of the effects of these two factors on grasslands. Based on the abrupt change analysis, linear regression analysis and net primary productivity (NPP), the spatiotemporal patterns of grassland ecosystems in Central Asia during 1982–2015 were studied. Further, the potential NPP (NPP P ) was estimated using the Thornthwaite Memorial model and the human-induced NPP (NPP H ), which was the difference between NPP P and actual NPP, were used to differentiate the effects of climate change and human activities on the grassland ecosystems, respectively. The grassland NPP showed a slight upward trend during 1982–2015, while two obvious decreasing periods were found before and after the mutation year 1999. Additionally, the main driving forces of the grassland NPP variation for the two periods were different. During 1982–1999, climate change was the main factor controlling grassland NPP increase or decrease, and 84.7% of grasslands experienced NPP reduction, while the regions experiencing an increase represented only 15.3% of the total area. During 1999–2015, the areas of increasing and decreasing grassland NPP represented 41.6% and 58.4% of the total area, respectively. After 1999, human activities became the main driving force of the NPP reduction, whereas climate change facilitated grassland restoration. The five Central Asian countries showed widely divergent relative impacts of climate change and human activities on NPP changes. In Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, anthropogenic decreases in grassland NPP intensified during 1982–2015, while the negative anthropogenic effects on grassland NPP in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan moderated. Further analysis identified precipitation as the major climatic factor affecting grassland variation in most areas of Central Asia and overgrazing as the main form of human activity accelerating grassland degradation. This study improves the understanding of the relative impacts of climate change and human activities on grasslands in Central Asia. © 2018","Arid and semiarid grassland ecosystems; Change-year detection; Climate change; Human activities; NPP","Climate models; Ecosystems; Regression analysis; Vegetation; Anthropogenic effects; Grassland degradation; Grassland ecosystems; Grassland restorations; Human activities; Net primary productivity; Semi-arid grasslands; Spatiotemporal patterns; Climate change; arid region; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem response; grassland; human activity; net primary production; semiarid region; article; climate change; grassland; human; Kyrgyzstan; mutation; precipitation; productivity; Tajikistan; Turkmenistan; Uzbekistan; Asia; environmental monitoring; statistical model; Central Asia; Kyrgyzstan; Tajikistan; rain; Asia; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Grassland; Linear Models; Rain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056218407

While transboundary carbon footprints of cities have been recently highlighted, we still have limited understanding of how carbon emission linkages between sectors are reshaping urban carbon footprints through time. In this study, we propose an integrated input-output approach to trace the dynamics of various types of carbon emission linkages associated with a city. This approach quantifies full linkages in the urban carbon system from both production- and consumption-based perspectives. We assess the dynamic roles that economic sectors and activities play in manipulating multiscale linkages induced by local, domestic, and international inputs. Using Beijing as a case study, we find that imports from domestic and foreign markets have an increasing impact on the city's carbon footprint with more distant linkages during the period from 1990 to 2012. The manufacturing-related carbon emission linkages have been increasingly transferred outside the urban boundary since 2005, while the linkages from the energy sector to services sectors remain important in Beijing's local economy. Applying systems thinking to input-output linkage analysis provides important details on when and how carbon emission linkages evolved in cities, whereby sector-oriented and activity-oriented carbon mitigation policies can be formulated. ©2019.

A full understanding of how carbon footprint is driven by socioeconomic factors in local, domestic and international economies is essential. Herein, we develop a cross-boundary carbon tracking approach based on input-output analysis, network control analysis and structural decomposition analysis. Using Beijing as a case study, we quantify both urban embodied and controlled carbon footprints over 1985–2012, and look into how they are impacted by socio-economic factors in local, domestic and foreign regions. We find that the carbon controlled by urban economy from inside accounts for 60% of the total footprint over 1985–2000, while this proportion decreased to 45% in 2012 due to externalization of production supply chains. Carbon intensity and urban consumption strongly compete with each other and together determine the variation trend of the city's consumption-based and controlled carbon footprint. Compared to a consumption-based perspective, this control approach reveals a higher impact of production structure transition on urban carbon footprint, and clearly tracks how carbon emissions are increasingly manipulated by other regions.

The results showed that 1) the peak value of CO 2 emissions in China declined over the period; 2) the overall inequality presented a decreasing trend, whereas intragroup inequality presented a slightly increasing trend over the period; and 3) generally, the potential energy intensity effect contributed to the decrease in CO 2 emissions in developed provinces, whereas the potential carbon factor effect accounted for the decrease in CO 2 emissions in less-developed provinces.

In some circumstances, natural ventilation can provide a higher ventilation rate compared to mechanical ventilation, thus improving the air quality of indoor space, resulting in lower indoor carbon dioxide and volatile organic compound concentrations. However, this increased ventilation rate also raises the issue of increased indoor pollutant concentration from outdoor sources, which has been proven to significantly affect occupant health. In this paper, we investigate the influence of three major outdoor air pollutants, PM2.5, PM10, and ozone, on natural ventilation usage across 12 major US cities and their corresponding climate zones utilizing the outdoor air pollutant records from the US Environmental Protection Agency. Firstly, a descriptive statistics study presents a general description of air pollutant records in these investigated cities and climate zones. Then two natural ventilation operation scenarios (considering outdoor air pollutants vs. not) are developed and compared to explicitly show the expected natural ventilation reduction in these areas. The investigation results indicate that the most polluted area for natural ventilation is Los Angeles (with a projected 70% reduction), followed by Chicago (approximately 40% reduction), and then Atlanta and San Francisco (20–30% reduction for each). The natural ventilation reduction caused by outdoor air pollutants ranges from 5% to 20% in all other tested cities. Among the three pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, and ozone) we investigated, the influence of PM2.5 consistently emerges as the most critical to consider, while the impact of PM10 is typically trivial. The influence of ozone is not obvious in most cases. Nevertheless, in certain cases, its influence is non-negligible when natural ventilation is utilized. This study aims to provide a general guideline for decision makers to consider the influence of outdoor air quality on natural ventilation usage when adopting natural ventilation in different US locations. The results also confirmed the outdoor air pollutants, especially PM2.5, as a significant factor to consider in the natural ventilation design to shield the occupant from excessive air pollutant exposure. © 2018","Air pollutant control; Commercial building; Natural ventilation; Outdoor air quality; Ozone; Particulate Matter","Air pollution control; Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Environmental Protection Agency; Indoor air pollution; Intelligent buildings; Office buildings; Ozone; Sustainable development; Volatile organic compounds; Air pollutants; Commercial building; Natural ventilation; Outdoor air qualities; Particulate Matter; Ventilation; air quality; atmospheric pollution; building; ozone; particulate matter; pollution control; ventilation; Atlanta; California; Chicago; Georgia; Illinois; Los Angeles [California]; San Francisco [California]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056737759

This work aims to evaluate the impacts of the coal substitution policy (“coal-to-gas” and “coal-to-electricity”) on building energy demand and emissions for Beijing, Tianjin, and other twenty-six cities along the “air pollution transmission channel” which has not been fully studied before and could assist city policy makers in coping with this drastic energy transformation by weighing potential social costs and benefits. To this end, a systematic method to downscale building energy consumption from provincial/regional level to grid level (0.1° × 0.1°) is developed using openly available data and information to establish high resolution emission projections of CO2 and major air pollutants (SO2, NOx and PM2.5) for these cities. This framework provides a convenient way to simulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of future emissions by sector for multiple cities. Combined with three coal substitution scenarios designed in this study, some policy suggestions on alternative energy and social welfare improvement were made by investigating city scale effects on energy accessibility, affordability, as well as health and environmental benefits. © 2018","Building sector; City; Coal-to-electricity; Coal-to-gas; Emission reductions","Air quality; Buildings; Climate change; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Health risks; Nitrogen oxides; Building energy consumption; Building energy demands; Building sectors; City; Emission reduction; High-resolution emission; Primary energy consumption; Spatio-temporal dynamics; Coal; alternative energy; atmospheric pollution; building; coal; downscaling; electricity; emission control; environmental impact assessment; residential energy; simulation; spatiotemporal analysis; urban area; Beijing [China]; China; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058499175

Karst ecosystems are widespread in the world, and play a key role in regulating the global climate, however, the patterns of and mechanisms underlying microbial resource limitation in karst ecosystems remain poorly known. Here we investigated the microbial resource limitation in a karst region, by selecting four main land-use types, i.e. cropland, grassland, shrubland and secondary forest, in areas underlain by two lithology types, i.e. dolomite and limestone, in southwest China. Ecoenzymatic stoichiometry was used as an indicator of microbial resource limitation. Overall, soil microbes in karst ecosystems were more limited by carbon and phosphorus, rather than by nitrogen. Further analyses revealed that the patterns of carbon and phosphorus limitation were different among land-use or lithology types. Microbial carbon limitation was greatest in cropland and forest but lowest in grassland, and was greater under dolomite than under limestone. Microbial phosphorus limitation decreased from secondary forest to cropland under dolomite areas, but showed no difference among ecosystem types under limestone areas, indicating that lithology controls the pattern of microbial phosphorus limitation along the post-agriculture succession. Our study describes a general pattern of microbial resource limitation in karst ecosystems, and we suggest that lithology may provide a new mechanism for explaining the variations of microbial resource limitation along the post-agriculture succession in different regions. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon limitation; Ecoenzymatic stoichiometry; Karst; Land use; Lithology; Nutrient limitation","Bacteria; Carbon; Forestry; Land use; Landforms; Lime; Limestone; Lithology; Phosphorus; Soils; Stoichiometry; Carbon limitation; Ecosystem functions; Ecosystem response; Karst; Microbial phosphorus; Nutrient limitations; Phosphorus limitation; Resource limitations; Ecosystems; carbon; dolomite; inorganic compound; limestone; nitrogen; phosphorus; unclassified drug; carbon; ecosystem function; karst; land use; lithology; nutrient limitation; phosphorus; soil microorganism; stoichiometry; agriculture; Article; China; community succession; controlled study; cropland; forest; grassland; karst; land use; nonhuman; nutrient limitation; priority journal; rock; scrub; soil microflora; stoichiometry; ecosystem; metabolism; microbiology; China; Carbon; China; Ecosystem; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052975452

This is especially true for China because it has a long coastline, busy shipping routes and many large ports. To fill this gap, this study applied the SMOKE/WRF/CMAQ modeling system to quantifying the impacts of ships on PM2.5 compositions, annual and seasonal contribution to PM2.5 as well as the wet and dry deposition of nitrogen and sulfur compounds over the land areas in YRD region for 2014. The results showed that 4.0% of annual PM2.5 concentrations over the land areas could be explained by ship emissions and the largest contribution could reach up to 35.0% in port areas. Temporally, the contribution to PM2.5 exhibited an obviously seasonal variation. The highest contribution was predicted in autumn (6.2%), followed by summer (5.4%), spring (3.6%) and winter (1.2%) for the land areas. Spatially, the contribution reached up to 13.6% along the coastline and dropped to 2.1% 300 km inland. As for the impacts on PM2.5 components, the primary components were relatively small and increased mainly along the shipping routes and the Yangtze River, whereas the secondary components played a more important role in both water and land areas. The sulfur deposition due to ship emissions was occurred generally along the shipping routes and was dominated by the dry SO2 deposition. The nitrogen depositions, on the contrary, was observed not only along the shipping routes but also extend to wide land areas. Further investigation revealed that ship emissions have caused an evident increase of dry nitrogen deposition in NO2 and HNO3, while a slight decrease in NH3 over YRD region. These results indicated that comprehensive regulations of ship emissions are required considering their adverse effects on the ambient concentration of PM2.5 and the deposition of sulfur and nitrogen. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Depositions; PM2.5; Ship emissions; WRF/CMAQ; Yangtze River Delta","Air quality; Ammonia; Deposition; Deterioration; Rivers; Sulfur compounds; Ambient concentrations; Deposition of sulfurs; Nitrogen deposition; PM2.5; Secondary components; Ship emissions; WRF/CMAQ; Yangtze river delta; Ships; ammonia; nitrate; nitric acid; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; nitrous acid; sulfate; sulfur; air quality; atmospheric deposition; coastal zone; concentration (composition); exhaust emission; nitrogen; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; port; shipping; sulfur; air quality; Article; atmospheric deposition; autumn; China; concentration (parameters); controlled study; dry deposition; environmental impact; particulate matter; priority journal; river; sea; seashore; seasonal variation; ship; shipping; simulation; spatiotemporal analysis; spring; summer; wet deposition; winter; China; Yangtze Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052916616

While some studies have examined the effectiveness of speed reduction on emissions and mammal preservation, few have analyzed the effects of reduced ship speed on vessel safety. Those few studies have not yet measured the relationship between vessel speed and accidents by using real accident data. To fill this gap in the literature, this study estimates the impact of vessel speed reduction on vessel damages, casualties and frequency of vessel accidents. Accidents in RSZ ports were compared to non-RSZ ports by using U.S. Coast Guard data to capture the speed reduction effects. The results show that speed reduction influenced accident frequency as a result of two factors, the fuel price and the RSZ designation. Every $10 increase in the fuel price led to a 10.3% decrease in the number of accidents, and the RSZ designation reduced vessel accidents by 47.9%.

The glassy structure was confirmed by X-rays diffraction patterns and Raman spectra. A detailed analysis of the Raman Spectra showed that these samples are mainly constituted by amorphous Cd2V2O7 and PO4 units. By optical absorption, band gap (Eg) values in the 2.44–2.63 eV range were determined, depending on the Er3+ concentration. Upon 980 nm diode laser excitation, the up-conversion spectra displayed the well-known erbium (4S3/2,2H11/2) → 4I15/2 and 4F9/2 → 4I15/2 transitions in the 510–575 and 640–690 nm range, whereas the down-shifting emission spectra in the near infrared (NIR) region showed a broad band extending from 1440 to 1650 nm, attributed to the Er3+: 4I13/2 → 4I15/2 transition. Both spectra reached the highest intensity at 2.5 mol% of Er3+. For higher Er3+ concentrations, the emission intensities were gradually reduced, which is associated with non-radiative and cross relaxation processes. This fact was verified by the shortening of the green and NIR emission decays recorded under 488 and 980 nm pulsed laser excitation. The mechanism involved in the cross relaxation of the NIR emission, was analyzed by fitting the emission decays with the Inokuti-Hirayama model, which revealed that dipole-dipole electric interactions might dominate the cross-relaxation processes within Er-Er clusters. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","Er-doped glasses; IR; Photoluminescence; Up and down-shifting; Vanadates","Binary alloys; Emission spectroscopy; Energy gap; Erbium alloys; Glass; Infrared devices; Iridium; Laser excitation; Light absorption; Photoluminescence; Pulsed lasers; Raman scattering; Relaxation processes; Vanadium pentoxide; Cross-relaxation process; Electric interaction; Er-doped glass; Inokuti-Hirayama model; Melt quenching method; Near infrared region; Up and down-shifting; Vanadates; Cadmium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054660262

In this study, we investigated the use of a novel animated material, swellable organically-modified silica (SOMS), as a catalyst scaffold for HDC of trichloroethylene (TCE) to develop a catalytic system resistant to carbon formation. The state of aggregation of adsorbed TCE on Pd/SOMS was characterized. It was found that the unique nature of SOMS scaffold caused condensation of adsorbents in the SOMS matrix. This is of particular importance considering the fact that the increase of local concentration of reactants due to condensation may enhance the kinetics of catalytic reactions. To determine the resistance to the formation of carbonaceous materials under reaction conditions, in-situ vibrational spectroscopy experiments (diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) and laser Raman spectroscopy) were undertaken over Pd-incorporated SOMS in the absence and presence of water vapor in the reactant stream. The commonly used HDC catalyst Pd/Al2O3 was also studied for comparison purposes. Formation of carbonaceous deposits of different nature were observed over Pd/Al2O3 whereas no detectable carbon formation was observed over Pd/SOMS. It was confirmed that surface hydroxyl groups which are in basic character act as coking agents. The carbon formation resistant behavior of Pd/SOMS is closely related to the nature and low concentration of surface hydroxyl groups. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","carbonaceous materials; Coke; DRIFTS; FTIR; Groundwater remediation; Hydrodechlorination; Laser Raman spectroscopy; Palladium; Pd/Al2O3; Swellable organically-modified silica (SOMS); Trichloroethylene","Anesthetics; Carbon; Catalysis; Catalyst deactivation; Coke; Condensation; Deposits; Groundwater; Palladium; Raman spectroscopy; Remediation; Scaffolds; Silica; Trichloroethylene; Vibrational spectroscopy; Carbonaceous materials; DRIFTS; FTIR; Ground water remediation; Hydrodechlorination; Laser Raman spectroscopy; Organically modified silica; Pd/Al2O3; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046715978

This marks one of the latest forms of transnational business governance, whereby state actors share the regulation of environmental and social externalities with private authority. This paper responds to the call for more contextual research into the complex policy ecosystems in which zero deforestation commitments are implemented and how transnational private authority is interacting with, and possibly being reconfigured by, domestic governance and territory. Combining policy analysis, field work on cocoa farms, focus groups, and over 45 interviews, this paper provides empirical evidence to explain how business commitments to zero deforestation cocoa interact with domestic political processes to reduce deforestation in key cocoa-producing countries. The focus is on three top cocoa producer countries in West Africa, where smallholder cocoa farming causes environmental degradation due to deforestation, and socioeconomic progress for smallholders is difficult to achieve. In these countries, the private sector's commitment to reduce deforestation is situated in government-led programs to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The findings show that a codependent relationship is evolving between corporate and state-led efforts to reduce deforestation, where the success of zero deforestation cocoa relies on synergistic public–private interaction. Cocoa intensification without expansion, supply chain traceability, and jurisdictional commodity sourcing are the three main areas of future collaboration identified. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","private governance; REDD+; transnational business governance; zero deforestation supply chains","cocoa; deforestation; environmental degradation; governance approach; political process; public-private partnership; West Africa; Theobroma cacao",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060785522

These practices typically focus on reducing air exchange rates between the building interior and the outdoor environment to minimize energy loss, the health effects of which are not well characterized. This study aims to evaluate the relationship between air exchange rates and respiratory health in a multi-ethnic population living in low-income, urban homes. Methods: The Colorado Home Energy Efficiency and Respiratory Health (CHEER) study is a cross-sectional study that enrolled 302 people in 216 non-smoking, low-income single-family homes, duplexes and town-homes from Colorado's Northern Front Range. A blower door test was conducted and the annual average air exchange rate (AAER) was estimated for each home. Respiratory health was assessed using a structured questionnaire based on standard instruments. We estimated the association between AAER and respiratory symptoms, adjusting for relevant confounders. Results: Air exchange rates in many homes were high compared to prior studies (median 0.54 air changes per hour, range 0.10, 2.17). Residents in homes with higher AAER were more likely to report chronic cough, asthma and asthma-like symptoms, including taking medication for wheeze, wheeze that limited activities and dry cough at night. Allergic symptoms were not associated with AAER in any models. The association between AAER and asthma-like symptoms was stronger for households located in areas with high potential exposure to traffic related pollutants, but this was not consistent across all health outcomes. Conclusions: While prior studies have highlighted the potential hazards of low ventilation rates in residences, this study suggests high ventilation rates in single-family homes, duplexes and town-homes in urban areas may also have negative impacts on respiratory health, possibly due to the infiltration of outdoor pollutants. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Air exchange rate; Asthma; Respiratory health; Urban health; Ventilation","allergy; architectural design; asthma; climate change; exchange rate; public health; questionnaire survey; respiratory disease; symptom; urban population; ventilation; adult; air conditioning; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; artificial ventilation; asthma; chronic cough; cross-sectional study; energy expenditure; female; home environment; home visit; household; household income; human; lowest income group; lung gas exchange; lung ventilation; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; urban area; urban health; wheezing; air conditioning; air pollutant; city; Colorado; health; indoor air pollution; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Cities; Colorado; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health; Ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057150333

This “bomb peak” has been used to calculate turnover rates of organic carbon in soils and other recent sedimentary deposits. Some speleothems contain precise and independently dated records of radiocarbon activity. These records can be used to understand, through inverse modeling, the processes and rates of turnover of subsurface organic carbon in karst regions. This approach is complicated, however, by the contribution of radioactively “dead” carbon to the stalagmite by the dissolution of host-rock limestone and/or by the respiration of relatively old soil organic matter. Previously published inverse models of the radiocarbon bomb peak in speleothems constrain the dead carbon proportion (DCP, in percent) by comparing measurements of speleothem radiocarbon activity from before the onset of the bomb peak to measurements of coeval atmospheric radiocarbon. This approach precludes modeling of speleothems that began growing after the onset of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing in 1955. Here, we advance the inverse modeling framework to calculate DCP using the entire length of the speleothem record, allowing for the modeling of speleothems that began growing after the initiation of atmospheric nuclear weapons testing. We test the sensitivity and resolution of this model and find that it can precisely resolve the turnover times and relative contributions of subsurface organic matter pools with residence times of less than a decade. The model fails to resolve turnover times or relative contributions of organic matter pools on millennial or greater timescales. These results also hold for the previously published models from which the current model is derived. We find that imprecise estimates of slow-turnover carbon add significant uncertainty to the calculated average age of respired carbon, which is a common metric of subsurface carbon cycling. The high precision and resolution attainable between sub-decadal carbon pools will allow researchers to differentiate the (sub-)annual pool, which is likely dominated by root/rhizosphere respiration, from the 2- to 10-year pools, which are likely dominated by microbial decomposition of labile organic carbon. The high precision attainable in fast-turnover pools also suggests that when there are multiple viable chronological interpretations for the same speleothem, bomb peak models could be used to help select which chronology is most likely to be accurate. This is important for high-resolution (sub-annual) speleothem climate records, where even single-year chronological offsets can result in misleading calibrations to the instrumental record. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bomb peak; Carbon cycle; Radiocarbon; Speleothems","carbon cycle; inverse analysis; karst; organic carbon; organic matter; radioactivity; radiocarbon dating; soil carbon; speleothem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058807159

The amount and type of coverage, along with the specific land use and land use change in a given area, determines whether carbon is stored or released into the atmosphere. The aim of this study was to evaluate the traditional silvopastoral systems (TSPS) through quantitative analysis of biomass and soil carbon storage whilst simultaneously qualitatively determining the ecological structure in terms of tree richness and diversity. The study was carried out in Matiguás, a sub-humid tropical region of Nicaragua, on five land use types: shrubland; intervened secondary forest; pasture with high tree density; pasture with low tree density and degraded pasture. Biomass carbon was estimated by allometric equations and soil organic carbon was evaluated at four depths (0–10, 10–20, 20–40 and 40–100 cm). Of the land uses studied, shrubland had the highest diversity. The biomass carbon ranged from 1.9 to 13.2 t C ha −1 for degraded pasture and intervened secondary forest, respectively. The highest soil organic carbon (SOC) storage at 1 m depth was for intervened secondary forest (163 t C ha −1 ), whereas degraded pastures had the lowest value (76 t C ha −1 ). Since SOC was the largest pool of total carbon in all cases, it should be evaluated down to a depth of at least 1 m. Increasing tree coverage in degraded and low-tree density pastures can contribute not only to enhance carbon sequestration but also to restore degraded lands in livestock landscapes. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Carbon sequestration; Land use change; Pastures; Soil organic carbon; Sub humid tropical conditions","agroforestry; biomass; carbon fixation; carbon sequestration; ecosystem service; ecosystem structure; land use change; landscape; organic carbon; pasture; secondary forest; shrubland; soil carbon; tropical region; Nicaragua",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061185657

Many studies have linked this process to soil nutrient mobilization. Yet, it remains unresolved how exudation is controlled and how exactly and under what circumstances plants benefit from exudation. The majority of root exudates including primary metabolites (sugars, amino acids, and organic acids) are believed to be passively lost from the root and used by rhizosphere-dwelling microbes. In this review, we synthetize recent advances in ecology and plant biology to explain and propose mechanisms by which root exudation of primary metabolites is controlled, and what role their exudation plays in plant nutrient acquisition strategies. Specifically, we propose a novel conceptual framework for root exudates. This framework is built upon two main concepts: (1) root exudation of primary metabolites is driven by diffusion, with plants and microbes both modulating concentration gradients and therefore diffusion rates to soil depending on their nutritional status; (2) exuded metabolite concentrations can be sensed at the root tip and signals are translated to modify root architecture. The flux of primary metabolites through root exudation is mostly located at the root tip, where the lack of cell differentiation favors diffusion of metabolites to the soil. We show examples of how the root tip senses concentration changes of exuded metabolites and translates that into signals to modify root growth. Plants can modify the concentration of metabolites either by controlling source/sink processes or by expressing and regulating efflux carriers, therefore challenging the idea of root exudation as a purely unregulated passive process. Through root exudate flux, plants can locally enhance concentrations of many common metabolites, which can serve as sensors and integrators of the plant nutritional status and of the nutrient availability in the surrounding environment. Plant-associated micro-organisms also constitute a strong sink for plant carbon, thereby increasing concentration gradients of metabolites and affecting root exudation. Understanding the mechanisms of and the effects that environmental stimuli have on the magnitude and type of root exudation will ultimately improve our knowledge of processes determining soil CO 2 emissions, ecosystem functioning, and how to improve the sustainability of agricultural production. © 2019 Canarini, Kaiser, Merchant, Richter and Wanek.","Mycorrhiza; Nutrient sensing; Priming effect; Root architecture; Root exudates; Soil micro-organisms",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064216894

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of different bleaching sequences on the removal of chromophore groups, especially carbonyls, which are suspected to cause brightness reversion. The bleaching sequences analyzed comprise the stages: chlorine dioxide, acid hydrolysis at high temperature, alkaline extraction with hydrogen peroxide, pressurized hydrogen peroxide, and hydrogen peroxide. After bleaching an oxygen-delignified eucalypt kraft pulp with these sequences, the pulps were analyzed for their final brightness, brightness reversion, and pulp viscosity; the bleached pulps were also analyzed using ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy in the infrared region. The infrared analysis indicated that bleaching stages that used hydrogen peroxide, such as pressurized hydrogen peroxide or hydrogen peroxide, in the terminal position reduced the amount of carbonyl groups in the bleached pulp as measured by the absorption band intensity. This study observed that the inclusion of a hot acid hydrolysis stage in the bleach sequence improved the final brightness and brightness stability of the bleached eucalyptus pulp.

GCAM is a market equilibrium model, is global in scope, and operates from 1990 to 2100 in 5-year time steps. It can be used to examine, for example, how changes in population, income, or technology cost might alter crop production, energy demand, or water withdrawals, or how changes in one region's demand for energy affect energy, water, and land in other regions. This paper describes the model, including its assumptions, inputs, and outputs. We then use 11 scenarios, varying the socioeconomic and climate policy assumptions, to illustrate the results from the model. The resulting scenarios demonstrate a wide range of potential future energy, water, and land uses. We compare the results from GCAM v5.1 to historical data and to future scenario simulations from earlier versions of GCAM and from other models. Finally, we provide information on how to obtain the model. © Author(s) 2019.",,"economic conditions; environmental policy; global perspective; input-output analysis; market conditions; socioeconomic conditions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061926693

Here, we demonstrate that engineering the gas–liquid–solid contact interface on the electrode surface could tailor the selectivity of CO2 reduction and meanwhile suppress H2 production through regulated reaction kinetics. Specifically, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) was utilized to modify a Cu nanoarray electrode as an example, which is able to change the electrode surface from aerophobic to aerophilic state. The enriched nano-tunnels of the Cu nanoarray electrode can facilitate CO2 transportation and pin gaseous products on the electrode surface. The latter is believed to be the reason that boosts the Faradaic efficiency of liquid products by 67% and limits the H2 production to less than half of before. This interface engineering strategy also lowered H2O (proton) affinity, therefore promoting CO and HCOOH production. Engineering the electrode contact interface controls the reaction kinetics and the selectivity of products, which should be inspiring for other electrochemical reactions.

A semi-mechanistic emission model was developed based on mass balance of pollen grain fluxes in the surroundings of allergenic plants. The emission model considers direct emission and resuspension and accounts for influences of temperature, wind velocity, and relative humidity. Modules of this emission model have been developed and parameterized with multiple years of pollen count observations to provide pollen season onset and duration, hourly flowering likelihood, and vegetation coverage for oak and ragweed, as two examples. The simulated spatiotemporal pattern of pollen emissions generally follows the corresponding pattern of area coverage of allergenic plants and diurnal pattern of hourly flowering likelihood. It is found that oak pollen emissions start from the Southern part of the Contiguous United States (CONUS) in March and then shift gradually toward the Northern CONUS, with a maximum emission flux of 5.8 × 10 6 pollen/(m 2 h). On the other hand, ragweed pollen emissions start from the Northern CONUS in August and then shift gradually toward the Southern CONUS. The mean ragweed emission flux during August to September can increase up to 2.4 × 10 6 pollen/(m 2 h). This emission model is robust with respect to the input parameters for oak and ragweed. Qualitative evaluations of the model performance indicated that the simulated pollen emission is strongly correlated with the plant coverages and observed pollen counts. This model could also be applied to other pollen species given the relevant parameters. © 2018","Allergy; Distribution; Emission; Model; Pollen; Sensitivity analysis","Allergies; Models; Neutron emission; Sensitivity analysis; Distribution; Maximum emissions; Model performance; Pollen; Qualitative evaluations; Spatiotemporal distributions; Spatiotemporal patterns; Vegetation coverage; Plants (botany); allergen; allergen; allergy; model; pollen; sensitivity analysis; spatial distribution; temporal distribution; air pollution; air temperature; airborne particle; Article; flowering; humidity; meteorology; nonbiological model; nonhuman; oak; particle resuspension; priority journal; ragweed; semi mechanistic pollen emission model; vegetation; wind speed; air pollutant; analysis; environmental monitoring; immunology; pollen; procedures; spatiotemporal analysis; theoretical model; United States; Ambrosia; Air Pollutants; Allergens; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Theoretical; Pollen; Spatio-Temporal Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056166000

Although their monitoring is crucial in times of increased pressure on water resources by both climate change and human interventions, publically available datasets of lake and reservoir levels and volumes are scarce. Within this study, a time series of variation in lake and reservoir volume between 1984 and 2015 were analysed for 137 lakes over all continents by combining the JRC Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset and the satellite altimetry database DAHITI. The GSW dataset is a highly accurate surface water dataset at 30 m resolution compromising the whole L1T Landsat 5, 7 and 8 archive, which allowed for detailed lake area calculations globally over a very long time period using Google Earth Engine. Therefore, the estimates in water volume fluctuations using the GSW dataset are expected to improve compared to current techniques as they are not constrained by complex and computationally intensive classification procedures. Lake areas and water levels were combined in a regression to derive the hypsometry relationship (dh dA) for all lakes. Nearly all lakes showed a linear regression, and 42 % of the lakes showed a strong linear relationship with a R 2 &gt; 0.8, an average R 2 of 0.91 and a standard deviation of 0.05. For these lakes and for lakes with a nearly constant lake area (coefficient of variation &lt; 0.008), volume variations were calculated. Lakes with a poor linear relationship were not considered. Reasons for low R 2 values were found to be (1) a nearly constant lake area, (2) winter ice coverage and (3) a predominant lack of data within the GSW dataset for those lakes. Lake volume estimates were validated for 18 lakes in the US, Spain, Australia and Africa using in situ volume time series, and gave an excellent Pearson correlation coefficient of on average 0.97 with a standard deviation of 0.041, and a normalized RMSE of 7.42 %. These results show a high potential for measuring lake volume dynamics using a pre-classified GSW dataset, which easily allows the method to be scaled up to an extensive global volumetric dataset. This dataset will not only provide a historical lake and reservoir volume variation record, but will also help to improve our understanding of the behaviour of lakes and reservoirs and their representation in (large-scale) hydrological models. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Aneroid altimeters; Classification (of information); Climate change; Correlation methods; Lakes; Large dataset; Satellites; Time series; Water levels; Classification procedure; Coefficient of variation; Hydrological models; Lake sand reservoirs; Linear relationships; Pearson correlation coefficients; Satellite altimetry; Volumetric dataset; Reservoirs (water); data set; hydrological modeling; lake water; monitoring; reservoir; satellite altimetry; surface water; Africa; Australia; Spain; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061303697

Upper Cretaceous terrestrial climate proxies have been interpreted as evidence for “equable” climates with reduced seasonal variations in temperature. However, climate models have largely failed to reproduce these reconstructions unless parameters such as atmospheric CO2 concentrations are set to unreasonable values. To help resolve such model-proxy disagreements, we reconstruct mean annual range in temperature (MART) for the Campanian (~75 Ma) Kaiparowits (south-central Utah) and Two Medicine (northwest Montana) Formations using warmest mean monthly temperature reconstructions from the clumped isotope composition of paleosol carbonate nodules, and reconstructions of local mean annual air temperatures from other methods. An evaluation of the applicability of bulk elemental soil geochemistry temperature proxies in these deposits supports the use of previous leaf physiognomy-based estimates of mean annual temperature for our MART reconstructions. We test the validity of several common assumptions made in reconstructing MART in two novel ways. First, MART is commonly calculated as twice the difference between local mean annual air temperature and warmest mean monthly temperature, and we validate this method by estimating modern MART for a range of environments using climate reanalysis data. Second, we constrain the effect of radiative soil heating on our soil carbonate temperature estimates by showing that for most environments likely to be preserved in the geologic record, summer soil temperatures are &lt;3 °C higher than air temperatures. Our findings suggest that warmest mean monthly temperatures were 30 to 35 ± 4 °C at the two study sites, and that MART was 21 to 29 °C for the Kaiparowits Formation, and 21 to 27 °C for the Two Medicine Formation. Mid-latitude Late Cretaceous MARTs were similar to modern ranges in mid-latitude seasonal temperature, and much (&gt;9 °C) larger than previous proxy reconstructions of Late Cretaceous MART. These results add to a growing body of literature showing that terrestrial MART during ancient greenhouse periods was not significantly different from modern seasonal temperature variations. Finally, the similarity in MART between the Kaiparowits and Two Medicine formations suggests that latitudinal changes in MART did not contribute to the faunal provincialism that has been proposed by some paleontologists. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Dinosaur provincialism; Equability; Historical biogeography; Seasonality; Stable isotopes; Terrestrial paleoclimatology","air temperature; biogeography; Campanian; carbon dioxide; climate change; Cretaceous; geological record; heating; isotopic composition; latitudinal gradient; paleoclimate; paleosol; proxy climate record; reconstruction; seasonal variation; seasonality; stable isotope; United States; Utah; Western Interior; Dinosauria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058231683

The scale of the problem of unsafe scaffolding can be indirectly analysed on the basis of individual accident reports and statistics. However, the total number, types, purposes, sizes, and condition of scaffoldings used in the practice of Polish construction sites have not been assessed do far. The authors intend to fill this gap by conducting regular observation of scaffoldings erected in selected Polish urban areas. This paper presents the methodology of data collection and compares scaffoldings observed in two big cities, Warsaw and Poznań. Although the method misses scaffoldings out of sight of the assessor and, due to urban locations, focuses on building and not industrial or infrastructure projects, it gives a good idea of the qualities of scaffoldings in use, and enables estimating changes in the number of scaffoldings over the year. As comes from the analysis, frame scaffoldings are the most popular type used in Polish construction. Users commonly choose the narrowest option (less than 70 cm of usable width of the platform) and apply them to a variety of works, be it placing concrete, cladding walls with ETICS or even heavy stone elements, or providing access to roofs. Modular scaffoldings are second most popular, whereas the tube and fitting type is used in extremely rare cases. Small projects (individual housing, small-scale repairs) frequently rely on combination of elements of systems scaffoldings and are often incomplete. Interestingly, ""bad scaffoldings"" do not appear only in remote suburbs.

These changes will significantly alter marine ecosystem structure and function with associated socio-economic impacts on ecosystem services, marine fisheries, and fishery-dependent societies. Yet how these changes may play out among ocean basins over the 21st century remains unclear, with most projections coming from single ecosystem models that do not adequately capture the range of model uncertainty. We address this by using six marine ecosystem models within the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (Fish-MIP) to analyze responses of marine animal biomass in all major ocean basins to contrasting climate change scenarios. Under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5), total marine animal biomass declined by an ensemble mean of 15%–30% (±12%–17%) in the North and South Atlantic and Pacific, and the Indian Ocean by 2100, whereas polar ocean basins experienced a 20%–80% (±35%–200%) increase. Uncertainty and model disagreement were greatest in the Arctic and smallest in the South Pacific Ocean. Projected changes were reduced under a low (RCP2.6) emissions scenario. Under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, biomass projections were highly correlated with changes in net primary production and negatively correlated with projected sea surface temperature increases across all ocean basins except the polar oceans. Ecosystem structure was projected to shift as animal biomass concentrated in different size-classes across ocean basins and emissions scenarios. We highlight that climate change mitigation measures could moderate the impacts on marine animal biomass by reducing biomass declines in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean basins. The range of individual model projections emphasizes the importance of using an ensemble approach in assessing uncertainty of future change. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change; ensemble modeling; future projection; marine animal biomass; marine ecosystem models; model intercomparison; ocean basins; uncertainty","biomass; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem structure; ensemble forecasting; marine ecosystem; modeling; ocean basin; twenty first century; uncertainty analysis; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Atlantic Ocean (South); Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (South); Animalia; animal; aquatic species; biological model; biomass; body size; climate change; ecosystem; physiology; sea; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Biomass; Body Size; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Oceans and Seas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057880649

Theoretically, local and global pollutants can either be substitutes or complements in production. A firm's response to local pollution regulation can lead greenhouse gas emissions to decrease if the firm switches energy source from oil to natural gas, or to increase if it reduces the temperature of a natural gas-fired boiler, which causes NOx emissions to fall but CO2 emissions to rise. Consequently, local pollution regulation may either intensify or reduce global warming concerns. We exploit new data on US GHG emissions and variation in local pollution regulation across US counties to estimate this relationship. We find no evidence that more stringent local pollution regulation changes GHG emissions from the non-energy sectors. The lack of a statistically detectable effect cannot be explained by a decrease in production or by firms switching production to less regulated countries, and it is true on aggregate as well as for individual polluting industries, though in some instances the coefficients are not precisely estimated. Therefore, local pollution regulation is unlikely to suffice to address global warming. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Clean Air Act Amendments; Climate change; Co-benefits; Environmental regulation; Local pollutants","Climate change; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Global warming; Natural gas; Pollution control; Clean air act amendments; Co benefits; Emission sources; Energy source; Global pollutants; Local pollutants; Local pollutions; NOx emissions; Greenhouse gases; climate change; emission control; environmental legislation; greenhouse gas; policy reform; pollution policy; United States; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057052529

Though many models exist to evaluate the cooling impacts of GBI, their complexity and computational demand leaves most of them largely inaccessible to those without specialist expertise and computing facilities. Here a new model called The Air-temperature Response to Green/blue-infrastructure Evaluation Tool (TARGET) is presented. TARGET is designed to be efficient and easy to use, with fewer user-defined parameters and less model input data required than other urban climate models. TARGET can be used to model average street-level air temperature at canyon-to-block scales (e.g. 100 m resolution), meaning it can be used to assess temperature impacts of suburb-to-city-scale GBI proposals. The model aims to balance realistic representation of physical processes and computation efficiency. An evaluation against two different datasets shows that TARGET can reproduce the magnitude and patterns of both air temperature and surface temperature within suburban environments. To demonstrate the utility of the model for planners and policymakers, the results from two precinct-scale heat mitigation scenarios are presented. TARGET is available to the public, and ongoing development, including a graphical user interface, is planned for future work. © 2019 Author(s).",,"air temperature; climate modeling; computer; cooling; global climate; heating; infrastructure planning; surface temperature; urban climate; urban planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062065976

Stronger collaborative approaches are urgently needed. At the same time, there is little research and hardly any empirical evidence on what inspires adaptation engagement in different citizen groups. Against this background, this paper examines the external/material (e.g., resources, hazards, public support) and internal aspects (e.g., values and worldviews) that shape people's engagement in and for adaptation. Based on a survey of Swedish citizens at risk from severe climate events, we show that engagement is a gendered process, which is mediated by personal values, worldviews and place—aspects rarely considered in public adaptation. While a high level of diverse citizen action is often related to past experiences of hazards, motivation to adapt goes beyond the idea of acting out of rational self-interest. Economic considerations (e.g., low cost) are not the only motivation to adapt; the potential of an adaptation action to contribute to green, thriving surroundings and mitigate global climate change was found nearly as (and among female respondents, more) motivating. Women were also found to be more motivated to engage in adaptation if this supports other community members at risk. At the same time, past adaptation action could not be linked to motivation to adapt, and was found to be negatively correlated with communitarian and ecological values or worldviews. This confirms that motivation to adapt does not automatically translate into action, and indicates a ‘mitigation–adaptation gap’ in people's climate awareness, which can lead to ineffective climate responses. Given these findings, we discuss alternative approaches to support increased citizen engagement and more effective and transformative climate action. We end with a call for public adaptation and risk communication that takes greater account of inner/subjective dimensions. © 2018 The Authors","Citizen participation; Climate change adaptation; Disaster risk reduction; Ecosystem-based adaptation; Inner dimensions; Willingness to adapt","Costs; Ecology; Hazards; Motivation; Surveys; Citizen participation; Climate change adaptation; Disaster risk reductions; Inner dimensions; Willingness to adapt; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057173195

Three simulations utilizing the HTAPv2, REASv2 and MACCity anthropogenic emission inventories are conducted and compared with satellite and ground-based measurements to assess the sensitivity of the model predictions to anthropogenic emissions. Model-predicted surface meteorological fields are overall in good agreement with surface observations. However, the model tends to overestimate maximum surface wind speed, a feature also found in previous WRF-Chem modelling studies. Large discrepancies between the three emission inventories are found, specifically in the spatial distribution and the magnitude of the emissions (e.g. over 98%, 86% and 85% differences in some regions for carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NO) and organic carbon (OC) emissions, respectively). As a result, we find large differences between the simulations. When compared to satellite and surface observations, the HTAPv2-and REASv2-based simulations better reproduce the magnitude and spatial patterns of CO total columns and NO2 tropospheric columns derived from MOPITTv6 and GOME2 satellite observations, respectively. The simulations satisfactorily reproduce the air pollution characteristics in January 2010 as observed at surface monitoring stations in Beijing and Shanghai. The HTAPv2-based simulation better captures the pollution episode that occurred in Beijing in mid-January 2010, which is found to be related to a combination of different meteorological factors that led to the build-up of pollution. The high photochemical activity and convective turbulence in July 2010, in addition to differences in the emissions used, led to more pronounced differences between the simulations and lower statistical skills in particular for trace gases. This study shows that a considerable part of uncertainties in air quality model predictions for China can be attributed to uncertainties in current anthropogenic emission inventories. It highlights the need for more accurate and highly resolved emissions in order to improve the accuracy of model predictions. However, this study reveals that in some cases, model-observation discrepancies cannot be attributed only to inaccuracies in the emissions. For example, we found that regardless of the adopted emissions, all of the simulations fail to capture the temporal variability of particulate matter in Guangzhou during January 2010, indicating that factors other than emissions have a considerable influence on the atmospheric composition in this region. This work shows that inaccuracies in the predicted meteorological parameters (e.g. wind speed/direction, relative humidity, etc.) significantly affect the model performance, as found for example in the model predictions for Shanghai for July 2010, which show high and abrupt increases of NOx and particulates due to rapid decreases in wind speed in the model. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality modelling; Anthropogenic emissions; Ozone; PM2.5; WRF-Chem","Air quality; Atmospheric composition; Atmospheric humidity; Carbon monoxide; Forecasting; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); Satellites; Air quality modelling; Anthropogenic emissions; Chemistry transport model; Ground based measurement; Meteorological parameters; Photochemical activity; PM2.5; WRF-Chem; Wind; carbon monoxide; nitrogen oxide; organic carbon; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; GOME; ground-based measurement; metropolitan area; ozone; particulate matter; satellite altimetry; simulation; summer; trace gas; troposphere; weather forecasting; winter; air pollution; air quality; anthropogenic emission; Article; boundary layer; China; environmental monitoring; humidity; meteorological phenomena; meteorology; particulate matter; photochemistry; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; simulation; summer; surface property; wind speed; winter; Beijing [China]; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056182642

The goal is to discover what constitutes the main priorities for road planners, how these priorities are ranked when it comes to alignment selection, and how they are related to guiding factors identified in official planning documents and government transport plans throughout the life cycle of a road. This is done through a comprehensive literature and data search, involving published academic research in the road alignment design field, and by exploring Norwegian road planning documents and guidelines. Examples from a recently implemented road project are also included as a way to illustrate alignment priorities in theory versus how alignment decisions are made in practice. Particular attention is paid to how key factors influence environmental and social dimensions and how much importance these dimensions are given in the overall decision-making process. The focus on the Norwegian case is relevant in that it will identify which knowledge gaps need to be filled based on actual practices in the Norwegian road sector. The results of this study found that the dominating factors in road planning and alignment selection are the user cost and the environmental and socio-economic as they are directly related to the main national transport strategy of developing a carbon-neutral and resilient transport system. These results can be used to reinforce and amplify existing road planning strategies and to understand where challenges for environmental and social responsible road planning and alignment selection are found. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Decision making; Life cycle; Roads and streets; Urban planning; Academic research; Alignment decisions; Decision making process; Dominating factors; Selection criteria; Social dimensions; Transport strategies; Transport systems; Highway planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062773849

According to theoretical predictions, gene flow can inhibit these range edge populations if it disrupts adaptation to local conditions. Alternatively, if range edge populations are small or isolated, gene flow can provide beneficial genetic variation and may facilitate adaptation to environmental change. We tested these competing predictions in the annual wildflower Clarkia pulchella using greenhouse crosses to simulate gene flow from sources across the geographic range into two populations at the northern range margin. We planted these between-population hybrids in common gardens at the range edge and evaluated how genetic differentiation and climatic differences between edge populations and gene flow sources affected lifetime fitness. During an anomalously warm study year, gene flow from populations occupying historically warm sites improved fitness at the range edge and plants with one or both parents from warm populations performed best. The effects of the temperature provenance of gene flow sources were most apparent at early life history stages, but precipitation provenance also affected reproduction. We also found benefits of gene flow that were independent of climate: after climate was controlled for, plants with parents from different populations performed better at later lifestages than those with parents from the same population, indicating that gene flow may improve fitness via relieving homozygosity. Further supporting this result, we found that increasing genetic differentiation of parental populations had positive effects on fitness of hybrid seeds. Gene flow from warmer populations, when it occurs, is likely to contribute adaptive genetic variation to populations at the northern range edge as the climate warms. On heterogeneous landscapes, climate of origin may be a better predictor of gene flow effects than geographic proximity. © 2018 The Author(s).

However, estimating and understanding forest carbon and its spatiotemporal variations requires diverse knowledge from multiple research domains, none of which currently offer a complete understanding of forest carbon dynamics. New large-area forest information products derived from remotely sensed data provide unprecedented spatial and temporal information about our forests, which is information that is currently underutilized in forest carbon models. Our goal in this communication is to articulate the information needs of next-generation forest carbon models in order to enable the remote sensing community to realize the best and most useful application of its science, and perhaps also inspire increased collaboration across these research fields. While remote sensing science currently provides important contributions to large-scale forest carbon models, more coordinated efforts to integrate remotely sensed data into carbon models can aid in alleviating some of the main limitations of these models; namely, low sample sizes and poor spatial representation of field data, incomplete population sampling (i.e., managed forests exclusively), and an inadequate understanding of the processes that influence forest carbon accumulation and fluxes across spatiotemporal scales. By articulating the information needs of next-generation forest carbon models, we hope to bridge the knowledge gap between remote sensing experts and forest carbon modelers, and enable advances in large-area forest carbon modeling that will ultimately improve estimates of carbon stocks and fluxes. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon; Forest modeling; Forests",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062555267

The research was carried out on the fleet of urban buses operating within the Krakow metropolitan area. The levels and amounts of the 16 substances were evaluated using the CORINAIR methodology. The scenarios were determined based on the data measured between 2010 and 2015 and according to the plans created by Krakow's carriers. An analysis of the plans for the urban bus fleet modernization in Krakow shows that it will have a positive influence on the reduction in particulate matter and gas emissions into the air. The implementation of the projected scenarios, which involves the replacement of old buses with modern, low or zero emission vehicles, will reduce the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx) by more than 60%, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by more than 82%, carbon monoxide (CO) by nearly 52%, and particulate matter from fuel combustion (PMex) by more than 77% by 2025. Research also shows an increase N2O emissions (by almost 43%) as a result of modernization. This phenomenon is characteristic for modern engines. Moreover, introducing electric buses into a fleet contributes to the gradual reduction of benzo(a)pyrene emissions.

However, barriers such as end-user awareness and participation in policy and business model design prohibit the pace of rural electrification. A case of Rwanda is analyzed, pointing to the potential of the imihigo (performance contracts) framework. Given the adoption of household-level performance contracts, which can include energy access, it is proposed they could drive local participation among off-grid communities. Results of a survey with 218 users of Solar Home Systems in North-Western Rwanda and from five focus groups show that village-level energy targets impact on the prioritization of energy target setting among households. Including off-grid energy options in the imihigo booklets distributed to households could influence awareness raising and allow private sector providers to act in a more targeted way, prioritizing areas with most prevalent energy targets. Additionally, community meetings (umuganda) tied to imihigo offer participatory spaces for information and feedback sharing. These will assist in the design of energy planning and business models, which best fit local needs and respond to the challenges faced by the energy poor.

In case of Late Carboniferous-Early Permian Unayzah A sandstones from eastern Saudi Arabia, illite cement is widespread, but its distribution is laterally and vertically heterogeneous. For the present study, core mineralogy and formation-water hydrochemistry from the Unayzah Group were evaluated to identify processes controlling the formation of illite cement during burial. Hydrothermal experiments and geochemical modeling were performed to reconstruct the formation of secondary minerals under various burial scenarios. Mineral reactions potentially relevant to illite formation were evaluated by comparing cementation and diagenesis of a shallow field (6000 ft) with those in a deeply buried field (15,000-16,000 ft). Similar depositional environments ensure that sediment composition at the time of deposition was similar between both fields. The shallow field is characterized by tangential (smectitic) infiltrated clay coats and kaolinite cement, while the deep field is dominated by diagenetic illite grain coats and illite matrix. During burial of the deep field, illitization of kaolinite was driven by potassium liberated during feldspar dissolution. K-Ar dating suggests an age of 91.8-108.3 Ma for illite cement coats in the deep field. Grain-coating illite cement is locally lacking in the upper part of the deep field, which may be explainable by the absence of feldspar at the time of deposition, early exhaustion of K-feldspar as a result of kaolinitization of feldspar during early diagenesis, or illitization of smectitic grain coats consuming available potassium during deep-burial diagenesis. The poor development of diagenetic illite coats locally had a strong effect on reservoir quality, as these sandstones experienced pervasive quartz cementation. Geochemical modeling with SOLMINEQ.88 suggests oversaturated conditions for muscovite (as illite proxy) for shallow and deep field scenarios, whereas hydrothermal experiments with present-day formation water and sandstone core material encountered incipient illite crystallization on kaolinite grains at 1508C and 450 bar. Temperature is proven to be a major controlling parameter on illite precipitation, but local grain mineralogy (such as the presence of feldspar), early diagenetic clay assemblage (kaolinite and smectite), or grain-surface substrate may control grain-coating illite cement distribution on a field scale. This study suggests that moderate grain coverage of smectitic infiltrated clays may not always be improved by the later formation of diagenetic illite coats during deep burial if there is insufficient potassium for illitization. © 2019, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology)",,"Cementing (shafts); Cements; Coatings; Deposition; Feldspar; Hydrochemistry; Kaolinite; Mica; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Potassium; Potassium compounds; Produced Water; Quartz; Sandstone; Sedimentology; Available potassiums; Controlling parameters; Depositional environment; Feldspar dissolution; Geochemical modeling; Hydrothermal experiments; Sediment composition; Sedimentary formation; Oil bearing formations; cementation; depositional environment; diagenesis; experimental study; feldspar; illite; mineralogy; numerical model; potassium-argon dating; sandstone; Saudi Arabia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062808333

This takes advantage of catalytic enhancements found using bimetallic catalysts relative to monometallic analogues, as well as the advantages of heterogeneous catalysts over homogeneous catalysts. To achieve this, two organometallic cations with different metal centers, oxidation states, and coligands, [Rh(N,N′)(CO) 2 ] + and [Ir(N,N′)Cp∗Cl] + (N,N′ = pyrazolyltriazolylmethane ligands), were simultaneously immobilized onto the surface of carbon materials (carbon black and reduced graphene oxide). The relative concentration of the rhodium and iridium cations in the synthetic media was varied allowing for different metal ratios on the carbon surfaces. The composition of the complexes bound to the surfaces was confirmed using XPS which revealed the relative ratios of the iridium and the rhodium species on the surface, agreeing well with the values obtained by MP-AES. The materials were further characterized by N 2 absorption. The qualitative distribution of rhodium and iridium ions on the carbon surfaces was determined by STEM-EDX, revealing a uniform distribution of both complexes on the carbon surfaces. The efficiency of the materials as catalysts for intramolecular hydroamination was investigated. The data acquired demonstrated that the optimized ratio of rhodium and iridium on the carbon black material led to more effective catalysts than their monometallic counterparts. Having both complexes on the same carbon black surface presented an improvement in the catalytic activity compared to the complexes immobilized on separate particles. © Copyright 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon black; Catalyst activity; Graphene; Organometallics; Positive ions; Heterogeneous catalyst; Homogeneous catalyst; Intramolecular hydroamination; Organo-metallic complexes; Qualitative distribution; Reduced graphene oxides; Relative concentration; Uniform distribution; Iridium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062186815

Extreme weather events, the need for improved reliability, demand charge reduction, improved power quality, energy arbitrage, fuel diversity, greenhouse gases (GHG) reduction, etc. has spurred and renewed interest in microgrids at the customer, community, and utility level. To achieve seamless/bump-less/transient-free transitions between the islanded and grid-connected modes of operation, most commercially available microgrids either operate in or switch into the isochronous control mode to synchronize generation resources and to maintain phase, frequency, and voltage prior to reconnecting the microgrid with the grid. This method of using a centralized microgrid controller and communicating with every DER fails when considering large geographically dispersed microgrids with numerous DERs such as utility-scale microgrids, community microgrids, etc., as centralized control and real-time communication become infeasible. This paper proposes a novel approach using an Island Interconnection Device (IID) for the bump-less connection of multiple islanded microgrids to form a networked microgrid, and reconnect with the grid in a truly decentralized fashion. © 2019 IEEE.","bump-less connection; Distributed energy resources; island interconnection device; microgrids; networked microgrids; seamless transitions","Greenhouse gases; bump-less connection; Distributed Energy Resources; Interconnection devices; Micro grid; Seamless transition; Energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070349677

These lakes form a transect from the tundra to the boreal forest. The retrieved cores span from ∼12,000 cal yr BP to the present, with age control provided by radiometric dates and tephra deposits, some of which are newly identified. Results indicate that deglaciation occurred before 12,000 cal yr BP and that by that time, the lakes were deep, productive, and surrounded by shrub tundra. The lake with the highest sampling resolution indicates a brief climatic reversal ∼11,500 cal yr BP with decreased diatom-inferred lake level and lowered lake productivity, and reduced shrub presence. During the early to middle Holocene, all of the sedimentary records provide evidence of climatic amelioration with tree expansion and productive lakes. A middle to late Holocene climatic deterioration with reduced trees and a shallower, less productive lake is also indicated. In addition, the prominent Watana tephra at ∼4,000 cal yr BP likely reduced lake productivity and affected the vegetation. Even though the region was relatively productive soon after deglaciation, people did not occupy the region until ∼11,000 cal yr BP, about 1000 years later, and then only sparsely. By the middle and late Holocene, the region was more densely populated and this shift in human occupancy presumably reflects changes in resource abundance, especially caribou. Whether the Watana ashfall influenced caribou abundance and thus people, is still under investigation, but given the tephra’s effect on vegetation and lake productivity, it seems likely. © 2019 Bigelow, Reuther, Wallace, Saulnier-Talbot, Mulliken and Wooller.","Central Alaska; Diatoms; Human paleoenvironments; Isotopes; Pollen; Tephra","Deterioration; Forestry; Isotopes; Landforms; Phytoplankton; Productivity; Vegetation; Central Alaska; Diatoms; Paleoenvironments; Pollen; Tephra; Lakes; deer; Holocene; human activity; late glacial; paleoecology; paleoenvironment; tephra; Alaska; Susitna Valley; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064227968

The intermediate data of the field variables have been recorded at suitable intervals of time from ignition to convergence. Enhanced soot volume due to more residence time at lower gravity increases the radiative heat loss causing shrinkage of high temperature borne zone. Both soot volume and soot number register a build up and then a decay till steady state. The corresponding periods increase with the reduction of gravity. At microgravity, both the soot volume and soot particle number reach the peak at the same time and also almost stabilize concomitantly, unlike in other two gravity levels. The peak value of soot volume fraction, under 0.5 G and microgravity at steady state, become as high as 3.5 and 7 times respectively of the values at normal gravity due to surface growth. The soot number density, however, increases only 1.2 and 1.35 times respectively.

The gas transport mechanism through aerenchyma pore spaces of rice cultivars was studied to explore the plant mediated CH4 emission. Seven rice cultivars, based on the life cycle duration (LCD), were tested in tropical eastern India. Three LCD groups were, (a) Kalinga 1 and CR Dhan 204 (LCD: 110–120 days); (b) Lalat, Pooja and CR 1014 (LCD: 130–150 days); and (c) Durga and Varshadhan (LCD: 160–170 days). Rate of CH4emission, root exudates, root oxidase activities and shoot aerenchyma pore spaces were analyzed to study the mechanism of plant mediated emission from rice. Aerenchyma pore space was quantified in the hypothesis that it regulates the CH4 transportation from soil to atmosphere. The ratio of pore space area to total space was lowest in Kalinga 1 cultivar (0.29) and highest was in Varshadhan (0.43). Significant variations in the methane emission were observed among the cultivars with an average emission rate ranged from 0.86 mg m−2 h−1 to 4.96 mg m−2 h−1. The CH4 emission rates were lowest in short duration cultivars followed by medium and long duration ones. The greenhouse gas intensity considering average CH4 emission rate per unit grain yield was also lowest (0.35) in Kalinga 1 and relatively less in short and medium duration cultivars. Root exudation was higher at panicle initiation (PI) than maximum tillering (MT) stage. Lowest exudation was noticed in (197.2 mg C plant−1 day−1) Kalinga 1 and highest in Varsadhan (231.7 mg C plant−1 day−1). So we can say, the rate of CH4 emission was controlled by aerenchyma orientation, root exudation and biomass production rate which are the key specific traits of a cultivar. Identified traits were closely associated with duration and adaptability to cultivars grown in specific ecology. Therefore, there is possibility to breed rice cultivars depending on ecology, duration and having less CH4 emission potential, which could be effectively used in greenhouse gas mitigation strategies. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Aerenchyma pore space; Methane emission; Rice cultivars; Root oxidase activities","Greenhouse gases; Methane; Particulate emissions; Soils; Tropics; Average emission rate; Biomass production rate; Gas transport mechanisms; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Methane emissions; Oxidase activity; Pore space; Rice cultivars; Plants (botany); methane; oxidoreductase; methane; cultivar; emission; enzyme activity; lowland environment; methane; pore space; rice; root; tropical region; aerenchyma; Article; biomass; enzyme activity; geographic and geological phenomena; grain yield; greenhouse gas; India; life cycle; methanogen; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; plant growth; priority journal; rice; root exudate; shoot; soil acidity; total organic carbon; tropical lowland rice; air pollutant; anatomy and histology; enzymology; genetics; metabolism; Oryza; plant root; tropic climate; India; Air Pollutants; India; Methane; Oryza; Plant Roots; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053400687

Due to temporal dynamics in climate and vegetation activity, there are significant regional variations in carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes between the biosphere and atmosphere in forests that are affecting the global C cycle. Current forest CO2 flux dynamics are controlled by instantaneous climate, soil, and vegetation conditions, which carry legacy effects from disturbances and extreme climate events. Our level of understanding from the legacies of these processes on net CO2 fluxes is still limited due to their complexities and their long-term effects. Here, we combined remote sensing, climate, and eddy-covariance flux data to study net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) at 185 forest sites globally. Instead of commonly used non-dynamic statistical methods, we employed a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), called Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM) that captures information from the vegetation and climate’s temporal dynamics. The resulting data-driven model integrates interannual and seasonal variations of climate and vegetation by using Landsat and climate data at each site. The presented LSTM algorithm was able to effectively describe the overall seasonal variability (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE = 0.66) and across-site (NSE = 0.42) variations in NEE, while it had less success in predicting specific seasonal and interannual anomalies (NSE = 0.07). This analysis demonstrated that an LSTM approach with embedded climate and vegetation memory effects outperformed a non-dynamic statistical model (i.e. Random Forest) for estimating NEE. Additionally, it is shown that the vegetation mean seasonal cycle embeds most of the information content to realistically explain the spatial and seasonal variations in NEE. These findings show the relevance of capturing memory effects from both climate and vegetation in quantifying spatio-temporal variations in forest NEE. © This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Finding alternative cements while maintaining or improving current performance standards is scientist's effort. In particular, calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cements represent a very promising alternative compared to ordinary Portland cement (OPC) because of their high early strength, excellent durability, good performance in aggressive conditions, low energy consumption as well as reduced CO2 emissions. This paper presents the results of several experimental tests, planned in order to characterize the thermo-hygro-mechanical behaviour of CSA-based concrete since first minutes after casting. Twelve different tests were carried out: compressive strength and indirect tensile tests, stress-strain curve plot, rheology (creep and shrinkage) tests, water porosity, semi-adiabatic temperature evolution during hardening, fatigue test. Different curing periods were selected in order to analyse changes in strength. Experimental results show that CSA-based cements can be formulated to produce durable concrete with physical properties comparable to those of common classes of Portland cement concrete. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In the second phase, we transform the qualitative map into a system dynamic model which evaluates the effect of the SEAP on social, economic and environmental indicators. This methodology was applied to the case of Cascina Municipality (Italy). Through scenario analysis, we show that some indirect feedback can harm the achievement of the 20% emission reduction target. This process allows the local authority and stakeholders to evaluate the impact of emission reduction policies on CO2 emissions and local development, thereby generating collective learning on the systemic implications of the plan. We show that this method can enhance the ambition of emission mitigation efforts by small towns. © 2019, © 2019 Newcastle University.","collective learning; local development; sustainable energy plan; system dynamics","action plan; alternative energy; collective action; emission control; learning; local participation; stakeholder; sustainable development; Cascina; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061030511

This stipulation aims at promoting social equity, a key element of sustainable development. We draw on the stakeholder theory to examine the local stakeholder participatory process in CDM in four Latin American countries – Brazil, Honduras, Mexico, and Peru. We analyze 625 projects using cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling. The results confirm that in countries that have put in place national procedures for stakeholder consultation, such as Brazil and Peru, the role of national institutions is highlighted. Conversely, in countries with no national government guidelines on local stakeholder participation, such as Honduras and Mexico, private companies dominate the local stakeholder consultation process. In all the four countries, we identify a lack of community involvement in discussions and deliberations on the potential benefits of CDM projects, and a lack of participatory decision-making mechanisms. The projects we analyzed demonstrate that companies use stakeholder participation concept merely as a rhetoric tool to legitimate company activities, ostensibly to create value for all involved, but in practice providing almost no participation to the local communities. The findings also suggest the importance of national legal requirements in ensuring broad engagement at the local level. The stakeholder model established for CDM can be improved in the new market mechanism under the Paris Agreement by empowering local authorities and by formulating guidelines in domestic legal provisions for participatory processes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); Climate Policy; Consultation; Governance; Kyoto Protocol; Latin America; Participation; Stakeholder Theory; Sustainable Development","clean development mechanism; environmental policy; governance approach; Kyoto Protocol; participatory approach; stakeholder; sustainable development; Brazil; Honduras; Mexico [North America]; Peru",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055252471

However, their capacity to deliver multiple ecosystem services (ES) as parts of agricultural systems is surprisingly understudied compared to other production systems. We undertook a comprehensive overview of ES provided by natural and semi-natural grasslands, using southern Africa (SA) and northwest Europe as case studies, respectively. We show that these grasslands can supply additional non-agricultural services, such as water supply and flow regulation, carbon storage, erosion control, climate mitigation, pollination, and cultural ES. While demand for ecosystems services seems to balance supply in natural grasslands of SA, the smaller areas of semi-natural grasslands in Europe appear to not meet the demand for many services. We identified three bundles of related ES from grasslands: water ES including fodder production, cultural ES connected to livestock production, and population-based regulating services (e.g., pollination and biological control), which also linked to biodiversity. Greenhouse gas emission mitigation seemed unrelated to the three bundles. The similarities among the bundles in SA and northwestern Europe suggest that there are generalities in ES relations among natural and semi-natural grassland areas. We assessed trade-offs and synergies among services in relation to management practices and found that although some trade-offs are inevitable, appropriate management may create synergies and avoid trade-offs among many services. We argue that ecosystem service and food security research and policy should give higher priority to how grasslands can be managed for fodder and meat production alongside other ES. By integrating grasslands into agricultural production systems and land-use decisions locally and regionally, their potential to contribute to functional landscapes and to food security and sustainable livelihoods can be greatly enhanced. © 2019 The Authors.","biodiversity; Europe; food security and agricultural production systems; grassland biome; semi-natural grasslands; South Africa",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062706426

An expanding body of scholarship examines the evolving discursive space in which issues facing Indigenous peoples are treated, with a predominant focus on decision outcomes of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (UNFCCC). To understand the opportunities and constraints for meaningful participation of Indigenous peoples in international climate policy making, this article examines the experiences of Indigenous participants in the UNFCCC. We present findings from semistructured interviews with key informants, showing that material constraints and the designation of Indigenous peoples as nonstate observers continue to pose challenges for participants. Tokenism and a lack of meaningful recognition further constrain participation. Nevertheless, networks of resource sharing, coordination, and support organized among Indigenous delegates alleviate some of the impacts of constraints. Additionally, multistakeholder alliances and access to presidencies and high-level state delegates provide opportunities for international and national agenda-setting. The space available for Indigenous participation in the UNFCCC is larger than formal rules dictate but depends on personal relationships and political will. As the Local Communities and Indigenous Peoples Platform established by the Paris Agreement formalizes a distinct space for Indigenous participants in the UNFCCC, this article outlines existing opportunities and constraints and considers potential interactions between the evolving platform and existing mechanisms for participation. © 2019 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"climate change; environmental policy; indigenous population; policy making; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062192434

Locating geographic areas and stratigraphic sections with high natural fracture density and optimizing well locations and perforations to connect these fractures can enhance well performance and asset value. There is substantial production variation in the Cretaceous stacked carbonate play in East Texas, despite similarities in well completion and perforated intervals. Petrophysical property models did not explain the significant variation in well production; therefore, we have developed a multidisciplinary workflow combining seismic and log data with the goal of identifying faulting and natural fractures and understanding their effect on production. We used seismic discontinuity to map faults as the main indicator of presence of fractures. We calibrated triple combo logs with an image log to generate an indicator curve to identify natural fractures. The fracture indicator curve provided a good prediction of where natural fractures may occur, and discontinuity maps revealed a good correlation to well production. Furthermore, we concluded that drilling too closely to large faults negatively impacted production and correlated with increased water production. The workflow developed here can be used to optimize well placement in the stacked carbonate play of Madison County, Texas, and it can be applied to other fractured carbonate reservoirs. © 2019 Society of Exploration Geophysicists and American Association of Petroleum Geologists.","faulting; natural fractures; production variability; seismic attributes; stacked play; tight carbonate","carbonate rock; faulting; fracture zone; hydrocarbon reservoir; stacking; well logging; Madison County [Texas]; Texas; United States; Indicator indicator",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114727595

Researchers focusing on the gap between consumption-based and production-based emissions have concluded that developed countries are systematically outsourcing emissions to developing countries. However, asymmetries in emissions embodied in trade may emerge due to differences in carbon intensity of energy and production between different countries, and need not be evidence of outsourcing. This study investigates if previous results concerning emission in –and outsourcing of developed and developing countries hold when emission flows are adjusted for technological differences. Two striking results are demonstrated: first, the magnitude of outsourcing is significantly smaller than previous studies have suggested, and, second, there is no clear divide between developing and developed countries. Large developed Anglophone countries (US, UK, Canada and Australia) were increasingly outsourcing emissions between 1995 and 2009 by shifting toward more carbon-intensive goods in their imports and less carbon intensive goods in exports, whereas other developed countries (i.e. the Nordics, advanced Asia and even the aggregate EU-27) maintained a positive emission trade balance. Among major developing countries, China is a major insourcer of emissions, while other emerging economies show no consistent pattern (e.g. India, Turkey and Brazil) or marginal outsourcing (e.g. Indonesia and Mexico). These results contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the impact of international trade on global carbon emissions. © 2018 The Authors","Carbon leakage; Climate mitigation; Consumption-based accounting; Emission outsourcing; Emissions embodied in trade; Input-output analysis","Article; Asia; Australia; Brazil; Canada; carbon footprint; China; commercial phenomena; Denmark; developed country; developing country; economic aspect; global climate; Greece; India; Indonesia; Japan; Korea; Netherlands; priority journal; Russian Federation; Spain; specialization; Sweden; Taiwan; technology; trade union; Turkey (republic); United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058134158

In this article, the long-term climatology of seasonal, global distribution of PBL is presented by using global positioning system radio occultation (GPSRO) based payloads such as Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC), Communication/Navigation Outage Forecast System (C/NOFS), TerraSAR-X, and The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) from the year 2006–2015. We used Wavelet Covariance Transform (WCT) technique for precise PBL top identification. The derived PBL top from GPSRO data is rigorously evaluated with GPS radiosonde data over Gadanki. Significant seasonal variation is noticed in both radiosonde and GPSRO observations. Further, we compared the PBL obtained GPS RO with global radiosonde network and observed very good correlation. The number of occultations reaching down to 500 m and retrieval rate of PBL top from WCT method is very high in mid-latitudes compared to tropical latitudes. The global distribution of PBL top shows significant seasonal variation with higher during summer followed by spring, fall, and minimum in winter. In the vicinity of Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), the PBL top is high over eastern Pacific compared to other regions. The ERA-Interim reanalysis data underestimate the PBL top compared to GPS RO observations due to different measurement techniques. The seasonal variation of global averaged PBL top over land and ocean shows contrasting features at different latitude bands. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","COSMIC; GPSRO; PBL; Radiosonde; Refractivity; Temperature","boundary layer; climate prediction; climatology; covariance analysis; GPS; observational method; radiosonde; transform; weather forecasting; Gadanki; India; Tamil Nadu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047366892

Successful implementation requires rapidly expanding renewable energy development, which has a large land footprint and can conflict with maintaining natural lands. To quantify the potential to mediate this land conflict, we converted emission reduction commitments submitted as part of the Paris agreement into actionable energy targets, and assessed whether they can be met by developing renewables on converted lands and waters of lower biodiversity and carbon value. The world has 19 times the required energy targets on converted lands, and most countries, including the top ten emitters, can meet the Paris agreement goals. Furthermore, regions (e.g. Africa) that will experience substantial population growth and that currently have limited energy infrastructure can meet their Paris agreement and future energy targets by developing renewable energy on already converted lands. Guiding renewable energy development to converted lands presents opportunities for sustainable development, but also requires incentives and proactive planning to ensure expansion does not exacerbate other environmental challenges. © 2019 The Author(s).

Urban parks can greatly help to increase the urban environmental quality by providing fundamental ecosystem services, such as local climate regulation, recreation and sense of place. Urban parks are, therefore, key elements for urban sustainability. This is particularly important in urban settings where investment in green spaces is deficient. In this work, we monitor the relationships between socio-economic features and the provision of local climate regulation. To look at the potential mitigation of air temperatures we analysed a sample of seven parks and their surroundings in Santiago de Chile. Three physical variables were measured: land surface temperature (LST) as a proxy of air temperature, and vegetation cover and soil imperviousness as predictors. These variables were obtained from calculations based on Landsat imagery (2015), using the thermal bands, and estimated through normalised differences of vegetation (NDVI) and built-up (NDBI) indices. We used socio-economic as another predictor variable. Data used classifies households in five groups according to the family income and education level. The socio-economic data was obtained at census track level and served to explore the relationship between physical variables (LST, NDVI and NDBI) relate to socio-economic data. In addition, we measure air temperature using 8 in-situ sensors inside and outside of each park measuring each 150 seconds during two days of high temperatures (over 25°C). Results showed that LST correlated significantly with vegetation cover and imperviousness (r spearman = -0.706 and 0.645, respectively). Socio-economic variables correlated with the same variables, where wealthier neighbourhoods correlated negatively to LST and NDBI but positively to NDVI, while poorer neighbourhoods had higher values of LST and NDBI and correlated negatively to NDVI. Differences between air temperature inside and outside parks were higher in poorer than in wealthier neighbourhoods with an average difference of 2.5°C with a maximum observed difference of 7.1°C. Our results highlight the importance of implementing urban parks in deprived urban settings, to contribute to reduce shortages and inequalities in the access to ecosystem services. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Economics; Environmental regulations; Land surface temperature; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Vegetation; Ecosystem services; Environmental conditions; Physical variables; Predictor variables; Social inequalities; Socio-economic data; Urban environmental quality; Urban sustainability; Ecosystems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062416254

Collections include samples of plant tissue to enable investigations of genetics, plot-based observations of incidence and cover of native and non-native species, observations of plant functional traits, archived vouchers of plants, and remote sensing airborne observations. Spatially integrating many ecological observations allows a description of the relationship of plant diversity to climate, land use, organisms, and substrates.

In this study, we report the selective formation of formaldehyde in photochemical carbon dioxide reduction using a reduced polyoxometalate (POM) based catalyst. By simply tuning the redox state of the metal centre in the POM, we can obtain the more reduced product formaldehyde from carbon dioxide. As a result of the high MoV/MoVI ratio in the cluster, formaldehyde is obtained as the major product as opposed to formic acid. Since the catalyst POM 1 itself readily absorbs light, no external photosensitizer is used. In the reduction process of carbon dioxide, water acts as the electron donor and is oxidized to oxygen rendering the whole process viable and green.

The increased number of cities’ population has a significant impact on the produced volume of household waste, which must be collected and recycled in time. The collection of household waste, especially in downtown areas, has a wide range of challenges; the collection system must be reliable, flexible, cost efficient, and green. Within the frame of this paper, the authors describe the application possibilities of Industry 4.0 technologies in waste collection solutions and the optimization potential in their processes. After a systematic literature review, this paper introduces the waste collection process of downtowns as a cyber-physical system. A mathematical model of this waste collection process is described, which incorporates routing, assignment, and scheduling problems. The objectives of the model are the followings: (1) optimal assignment of waste sources to garbage trucks; (2) scheduling of the waste collection through routing of each garbage truck to minimize the total operation cost, increase reliability while comprehensive environmental indicators that have great impact on public health are to be taken into consideration. Next, a binary bat algorithm is described, whose performance is validated with different benchmark functions. The scenario analysis validates the model and then evaluates its performance to increase the cost-efficiency and warrant environmental awareness of waste collection process. © 2019 by the authors.

This was achieved by detaching the two regions by an adjustable offset distance aiming to control the effects of the various interacted heat transfer mechanisms between the two remoted regions. The validation of this technique was experimentally examined for three offset distances of 13, 26 and 52 mm by comparing its performance with the conventional approach at 1 and 2 kW. The axial temperature distributions were measured versus time for wide ranges of stable and unstable operating conditions. Almost-constant temperature zone was created in the gap between the two regions. The stability limits range was improved by an excess air ratio of 0.2 at 1 kW and 52 mm. At 2 kW, the entire stability diagram was shifted down by an excess air ratio of 0.1 into hotter regime.

These large reservoirs of ice and their near-surface structure provide a rich record for understanding the planet's climate and history of global volatile exchange over the past billion years. LDA, LVF, and CCF are also potential sites for future robotic and human missions but the accessibility of glacial ice for direct sampling and in situ resource utilization depends largely on the geotechnical properties of the surface debris (“supraglacial debris”), including its thickness, grain sizes, and density structure. The physical properties of this supraglacial debris layer have been poorly constrained. We use images of morphology, digital elevation models, thermal inertia data, and radar sounding data to probe the near surface of LDA, LVF, and CCF in Deuteronilus Mensae in order to place constraints on the sources, grain sizes, thickness, and stratigraphy of supraglacial debris. We find evidence for at least a two-layer stratigraphy. Layered mantle consisting of atmospherically emplaced dust and ice superposes boulder-rich sediment sourced by rockfalls glacially transported downslope. High thermal inertia, boulder-rich termini and debris bands reminiscent of medial moraines are found throughout the study region, supporting a rockfall origin for at least a fraction of the debris exposed at the surface. This supraglacial debris layer would have thickened with time from sublimation of glacial ice and liberation of englacial sediment and dust. At present, the entire supraglacial debris package is a minimum of a few meters in thickness and is likely tens of meters in thickness in many locations, possibly thinning regionally at lower latitudes and locally thinning toward the headwalls. The lack of terracing or interior structures in craters formed within LDA, LVF, and CCF and the absence of near-surface reflectors in SHARAD radar data further suggest that no strong contrasts in permittivity or strength occur at the interface of the layers. © 2018","Cratering; Geological processes; Ices; Mars; Radar observations; Surface",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054008369

For the power sector, the NDC states that the government expects renewable energy (RE) to meet 25% of peak electricity demand by 2030. However, due to high initial cost of RE technologies, the government plans to maintain a coal-based power system in the future. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine Botswana’s national plan from an economic perspective, using scenario and cost analysis, to explore the possibility of the power sector’s low carbon transition in the light of Botswana’s NDC. Five scenarios are designed to reflect a range of investment cost changes of RE technologies. While most scenarios only achieve 19% (P3, P4 and P5) and 54% (P6) of the NDC’s power sector target, the P7 scenario far exceeds the goal by achieving 188% of the NDC target. Furthermore, as the difference of levelized cost of electricity among the scenarios is minimal, the P7 scenario is the most attractive pathway for the government. Even for other scenarios, the government should still deploy the suggested capacity of solar photovoltaic (PV) as it is both economically and socially beneficial in the long term. However, in these cases, the government’s political will to meet the NDC’s power sector target and to promote the solar PV industry will be critical in designing future power sector policies. Key policy insights Model results show coal as the cheapest resource for electricity generation in Botswana up to 2030, but the cost competitiveness of solar photovoltaic (PV) against coal will continue to increase over time. It is economically and socially beneficial to adjust the current national plan and substitute some share of coal with solar PV in the future energy mix. Government support is critical in achieving the power sector’s NDC target, as cost reduction of solar PV alone does not guarantee success. Encouraging independent power producers (IPP) with financial support mechanisms would be a suitable business model for developing the renewable energy industry. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Botswana; electricity demand forecasting; LCOE; low carbon scenarios; NDC; power sector","alternative energy; carbon emission; cost analysis; demand analysis; electricity generation; electricity industry; emission control; energy policy; environmental economics; forecasting method; national planning; technological change; Botswana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049138416

Significant operational resources are applied to control the proliferation of aquatic macrophytes and filamentous algal mats in these conventional stormwater retention basins to meet the aesthetic expectations of surrounding residents. Recent urban developments in the city of Winnipeg have used constructed wetlands to handle stormwater as opposed to conventional basins. We examined the differences in water quality, greenhouse gas emissions and cumulative greenhouse gas fluxes between conventional stormwater retention basins and urban constructed wetlands. Additionally, we examined how water quality and greenhouse gas emissions were impacted by the removal of submersed aquatic vegetation in conventional stormwater retention basins. Our results indicate large phytoplankton blooms were consistently reduced both pre and post treatment in the urban constructed wetlands (chlorophyll-a = 13 µg l−1 and 33 µg l−1) relative to the untreated conventional stormwater retention basins (chlorophyll-a = 56 µg l−1 and 128 µg l−1) and treated conventional stormwater retention basins (chlorophyll-a = 58 µg l−1 and 405 µg l−1). Mean daily greenhouse gas fluxes were lower pre and post treatment in the urban constructed wetlands (CO2eq = 26.5 kg ha−1 d− 1 and 53.1 kg ha−1 d− 1) relative to the untreated (CO2eq = 85.5 kg ha−1 d− 1 and 89.0 kg ha−1 d− 1) and treated conventional stormwater retention basins (CO2eq = 98.5 kg ha−1 d− 1 and 129.8 kg ha−1 d− 1). Over the 22 week period, mean total basin cumulative CO2eq flux was lowest in the urban constructed wetlands (6,447 g ha−1 d− 1) compared to the untreated (12,631 g ha−1 d− 1) and treated (17,633 g ha−1 d− 1) conventional stormwater retention basins. The combined treatments (herbicides and harvesting) applied to the conventional stormwater retention basins to remove aquatic vegetation result in poorer water quality and appear to stimulate methane emissions resulting in noticeably higher cumulative fluxes of greenhouse gases from these basins. The use of urban constructed wetlands in new residential areas should result in enhanced water quality and reduced cumulative greenhouse gas fluxes, while avoiding the cost associated with macrophyte removal. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Aquatic vegetation removal; Greenhouse gas emissions; Stormwater retention basin; Urban constructed wetland; Water quality","Chlorophyll; Greenhouse gases; Storms; Urban growth; Vegetation; Water quality; Wetlands; Aquatic macrophytes; Aquatic vegetation; Constructed wetlands; Greenhouse gas fluxes; Phytoplankton bloom; Storm water regulations; Stormwater retention; Submerged macrophyte; Gas emissions; comparative study; constructed wetland; emission; greenhouse gas; macrophyte; pollutant removal; stormwater; submerged vegetation; water management; water quality; algae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058028757

The case study plant was equipped with a micro-gas turbine co-generator. Several upgrading systems of different sizes were considered, to determine the most suitable configuration from a thermodynamic and economic point of view. For this purpose, a model of the whole plant that included digesters, a micro-gas turbine, a sludge line, heat transfer loops, and heat exchangers was developed. A steady-state simulation was performed by using the daily average conditions for the one-year long operation of the plant. The results highlighted that the feasibility depended on the amount of bio-methane produced, as this affected the performance of the cogeneration system and the balance between the costs and revenues. When large amounts of biogas are upgraded to bio-methane, the heat provided by the micro-gas turbine during the winter season is not sufficient to keep the digesters at the desired temperature and, therefore, natural gas integration is necessary. In addition, by increasing the upgrading unit size, the amount of electric energy purchased by the grid increases accordingly. An economic analysis showed that the optimal upgrading system size was strongly dependent on the bio-methane selling price. © 2019 by the authors.","Anaerobic digestion; Bio-methane; Biogas; Cogeneration; Micro-gas turbine; Upgrading system","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Gas turbines; Gases; Heat exchangers; Heat transfer; Methane; Natural gasoline plants; Cogeneration; Cogeneration systems; Electric energies; Feasibility analysis; Methane production; Micro gas turbines; Steady-state simulations; Upgrading system; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060873422

However, its sustainability is currently being challenged by the depletion of natural resources necessary to produce it (mainly due to the mining of aggregates) and the use of landfill space for its final disposition after service use. At the same time, the need for faster construction has encouraged the utilization of precast concrete structures, including pre-stressed elements. Recycled concrete aggregates could make the fabrication of concrete more sustainable; several studies demonstrate the technical feasibility of recycled concrete aggregates in Portland cement concrete for structural use. However, the sustainability of recycled concrete aggregates needs more reliable methodologies to assess it. This paper presents a stochastic simulation model of the precast fabrication process that considers obtaining materials, materials transportation, and precast elements production to evaluate the use of water, generation of CO2 emissions, and costs incurred when using natural coarse aggregates versus recycled concrete coarse aggregates from several sources. The model is based on data from companies in the United States, Canada, and Chile. The results show that replacing natural coarse aggregates with recycled concrete coarse aggregates reduces CO2 emissions and costs for the production of precast concrete elements, compared with the conventional system. However, water consumption is increased when recycled concrete coarse aggregates is used. Therefore, this research shows that the use of recycled concrete coarse aggregates for precast plants can be beneficial in terms of CO2 emissions and cost in contexts where water is not a scarce resource. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Precast recycled waste; Recycled concrete coarse aggregate; Recycled demolition waste; Stochastic simulation model","Aggregates; Carbon dioxide; Demolition; Industrial plants; Materials handling; Portland cement; Precast concrete; Recycling; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Demolition wastes; Portland cement concretes; Pre-cast; Recycled coarse aggregate; Recycled concrete aggregates; Recycled concrete coarse aggregate; Stochastic simulation model; Stochastic simulations; Concrete aggregates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056884966

Firstly, we performed a climate zoning of the island based on altitude, solar irradiation and dry bulb temperature. Secondly, we developed a bioclimatic analysis based on temperature and humidity levels. The results show that ASHRAE adaptive comfort model is the best model for both cities because it can tolerate higher humidity limits of up to 80% or more. The natural comfort potential varies from 22 in Antananarivo to 45% in Toamasina. Results can be used to create informative bioclimatic analysis visualisations to better assess climate and determine thermal comfort models for other cities in hot-humid climates.

Based on previous studies, niche differentiation could exist between nirK- and nirS-nitrite reducers and nosZI- and nosZII-N2O reducers, and nosZII-bacteria would have a key role for N2O reduction in soils. Most previous studies have been performed for agricultural systems but never in the moist savanna zone which covers half a million km2 in West Africa and whose soils are among the poorest in nitrogen (N) on earth. Here, we quantified potential gross and net N2O production rates along with the abundances of nirK-, nirS-, nosZI- and nosZII-harbouring bacteria for soils under six agricultural practices with maize rotations (slash-and-burn, chemical fertilization, mulching with or without inclusion of crop legumes, and without any input) after 4 and 5 crop cycles at nine sites in Ivory Coast. Sites and practices influenced denitrifier abundances and activities, the ratio of total abundances of nitrite-to-N2O reducers being highest and lowest for the mulching + green soya and slash-and-burn practices, respectively. Using structural equation modelling, we showed that nirS- and nosZI-bacteria both strongly depended on nitrate availability whereas nirK- and nosZII-bacteria were related to soil organic carbon and pH. Furthermore, potential gross and net N2O production rates depended strongly and only on the abundances of nirS- and nosZI-bacteria. Our results support the view of a clear niche differentiation between these four microbial groups but invalidate the assumption of a prominent functional role of soil nosZII-N2O reducers. © 2018","Denitrification; nirK; nirS; nosZ; Soil nitrate; Soil organic carbon","Crops; Cultivation; Denitrification; Greenhouse gases; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Soils; Agricultural practices; Agricultural system; Niche differentiation; nirK; nirS; nosZ; Soil organic carbon; Structural equation modelling; Bacteria; agricultural management; community composition; crop rotation; legume; maize; niche partitioning; nitrifying bacterium; nitrous oxide; reduction; savanna; soil microorganism; soybean; Cote d'Ivoire; Bacteria (microorganisms); Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057195719

Major anthropogenic sources of Hg emission include gold mining and the burning of fossil fuels. Once deposited in aquatic environments, Hg can undergo redox reactions, form complexes with ligands, and adsorb onto particles. It can also be methylated by microorganisms. Mercury, especially its methylated form methylmercury, can be taken up by organisms, where it bioaccumulates and biomagnifies in the food chain, leading to detrimental effects on ecosystem and human health. In support of the recently enforced Minamata Convention on Mercury, a legally binding international convention aimed at reducing the anthropogenic emission of - and human exposure to - Hg, its global biogeochemical cycle must be understood. Thus, a detailed understanding of the molecular-level interactions of Hg is crucial.The ongoing rapid development of hardware and methods has brought computational chemistry to a point that it can usefully inform environmental science. This is particularly true for Hg, which is difficult to handle experimentally due to its ultratrace concentrations in the environment and its toxicity. The current account provides a synopsis of the application of computational chemistry to filling several major knowledge gaps in environmental Hg chemistry that have not been adequately addressed experimentally.Environmental Hg chemistry requires defining the factors that determine the relative affinities of different ligands for Hg species, as they are critical for understanding its speciation, transformation and bioaccumulation in the environment. Formation constants and the nature of bonding have been determined computationally for environmentally relevant Hg(II) complexes such as chlorides, hydroxides, sulfides and selenides, in various physical phases. Quantum chemistry has been used to determine the driving forces behind the speciation of Hg with hydrochalcogenide and halide ligands. Of particular importance is the detailed characterization of solvation effects. Indeed, the aqueous phase reverses trends in affinities found computationally in the gas phase. Computation has also been used to investigate complexes of methylmercury with (seleno)amino acids, providing a molecular-level understanding of the toxicological antagonism between Hg and selenium (Se). Furthermore, evidence is emerging that ice surfaces play an important role in Hg transport and transformation in polar and alpine regions. Therefore, the diffusion of Hg and its ions through an idealized ice surface has been characterized.Microorganisms are major players in environmental mercury cycling. Some methylate inorganic Hg species, whereas others demethylate methylmercury. Quantum chemistry has been used to investigate catalytic mechanisms of enzymatic Hg methylation and demethylation. The complex interplay between the myriad chemical reactions and transport properties both in and outside microbial cells determines net biogeochemical cycling. Prospects for scaling up molecular work to obtain a mechanistic understanding of Hg cycling with comprehensive multiscale biogeochemical modeling are also discussed. © Copyright 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"mercury; methyltransferase; oxidoreductase; water; chemistry; computer simulation; diffusion; methylation; molecular model; pollutant; procedures; thermodynamics; Computational Chemistry; Computer Simulation; Diffusion; Environmental Pollutants; Mercury; Methylation; Methyltransferases; Models, Molecular; Oxidoreductases; Thermodynamics; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061871470

In this study, we evaluated the above and belowground carbon storage potential of a silvopastoral system and compared to a conventional open pasture system in two sites of Chiapas, Mexico. We established a total of 20 carbon monitoring plots, 10 plots for each system. All the trees of ≥ 2.5 cm DBH were measured within the plots of 1000 m 2 . Allometric equations were used to calculate biomass carbon stocks. Grass biomass, ground litter, and soil samples were collected from four random locations within the plot. We also calculated tree diversity and other ecological indices of the silvopastoral systems. The aboveground biomass carbon stocks in dispersed tree silvopastoral systems varied between 11.53 ± 1.80 to 14.63 ± 5.50 Mg C ha −1 . Soil organic carbon concentrations were higher in silvopastoral systems while soil bulk density was higher in open pasture systems, both affecting the soil organic carbon storage. A total of 29 tree species were registered in the dispersed tree silvopastoral systems. The Sorenson’s similarity index showed that the two study sites significantly differed in terms of their tree community compositions. Such differences were also observed in soil properties and carbon storage. We showed that there was a positive correlation between aboveground biomass and soil organic carbon concentrations. Further research is required to better understand the contributions of fine root and litter turnover on soil organic carbon storage in these systems. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon pools; Dispersed tree silvopasture; Greenhouse gas mitigacion; Soil organic carbon; Southern Mexico; Tree diversity; Tropical livestock systems","allometry; biodiversity; biomass; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; greenhouse gas; pastoralism; pasture; silviculture; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil property; tropical environment; Chiapas; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055726086

Dupont’s lark is an extremely elusive and scarce species, distributed across a reduced and strongly fragmented range, showing a metapopulational structure with unknown dispersive and connective mechanisms. We used maximum entropy modelling (Maxent) on nearly 15,000 Dupont’s lark observations (1985–2015) to assess the probability of presence at a 1 km resolution across its European range. Moreover, we tested the probability of extinction by comparing pre- and post-2000 observations by means of a GLM over a subset of cells with presence-absence data. We obtained strong model fitting (AUC = 0.919), in which species occurrence was explained by low values of plant productivity (NDVI), climate (high temperature range and medium annual precipitation), land use (increasing with sclerophyllous scrubland), flat topography and human disturbance (associated with low human population density). The species also tolerates dry farming, but not other farm types or forest cover. The probability map identified two main regions known as the species’ core areas: the steppes of the Iberian System and the Ebro Valley. The North Plateau is characterised by a dispersed structure of small and very fragmented patches of suitable habitat, while a succession of discontinuous probability patches form an Eastern Corridor connecting the central core areas to the southernmost populations. Finally, the model identified small and isolated patches of high probability of presence along the eastern coastline. The species tends to occur in the best available areas but, at the same time, the model revealed a large area of suitable but unoccupied habitat. Our results correct the previous estimation of occupation area from 1,480 to 1,010.78 km2, a reduction of 26.22%. The current distribution of Dupont’s lark is almost completely covered by Important Bird Areas (IBAs), highlighting their importance for bird conservation, but only 44.89% is included in Natura 2000 Special Protection Areas (SPAs). A comparison of pre- and post-2000 periods revealed a range contraction of 44%. Probability of extinction increased with higher temperature range and lower annual precipitation, and with decreases in population density, which suggests that this species is extremely vulnerable to both climate change and rural abandonment, due to its dependence on traditional grazing. These results suggest the need for a re-evaluation of the conservation status of Dupont’s lark in Spain. They urge the preservation of not only current extant populations, but also the unoccupied suitable areas that could be critical for metapopulation structure, and the development of policies addressing the preservation of traditional grazing.

This study reports analysis that was carried out as part of a project responding to that challenge. Using recently developed methods for regional integrated assessment of agricultural systems, this study evaluates the economic and environmental performance of dryland farming systems in the United States of America (U.S). Pacific Northwest, a major wheat (Triticum aestivum) production region, under greenhouse gas mitigation and policy scenarios consistent with the 1.5 °C goal. A novel feature of this study is to combine bio-physical and economic models with site-specific life cycle analysis to evaluate both the economic performance of current and possible alternative farming systems. The analysis shows that these farming systems could be adapted through changes in management to reduce soil emissions of greenhouse gases and incorporation of new biofuel crops, and could be affected by changes in prices and costs of production associated with greenhouse gas mitigation policies. These changes could result in a win-win outcome for those farms in the Pacific Northwest region where site-specific conditions are suited to these adaptations, providing both higher farm incomes and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions reductions. A key implication for mitigation and adaptation strategies is the need to coordinate climate policy design and development of technologies needed to achieve policy goals. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Climate policy; Economic and environmental performance; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Life-cycle analysis; Pacific Northwest; Wheat","adaptive management; cost analysis; dryland farming; economic conditions; emission control; environmental economics; environmental policy; farming system; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; strategic approach; United Nations; wheat; Pacific Northwest; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044186451

Study findings indicate that building renovations have significant potential for the mitigation of urban-related emissions and achieving the sustainability goals set. However, these measures should be adapted to different climate conditions and different segments of the building stock.

We argue that, paradoxically, access to formal international institutions and linkages with domestic priorities are key factors for participation in voluntary carbon markets, reducing asymmetries in information, capacity, and interest in developing contexts. Our statistical analysis finds that institutions such as the Clean Development Mechanism and targeted foreign aid, as well as domestic concerns such as climate vulnerability and advancing renewable energy, shape in important ways the variable engagement in VCO projects.

Understanding how vegetation and soil recover after returning marginal cultivated land to its native state is important since soil plays a key role not only in food production but also in regulating global climate change. Soil samples were taken from two sites, a mixedgrass and a dry mixedgrass prairie, which have different climates and plant species composition. Each study site included one undisturbed native plot (CK) and two cultivated treatments that were abandoned in 2008 after being cultivated for more than ten years prior to this study, one with continuous wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and the other with wheat-fallow rotations. Soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and labile organic fraction content were measured in 2016, while plant coverage and species diversity were investigated in 2017. In both study sites, grass and sedge coverage in the previously cultivated treatments were lower than, with shrub and forb coverage similar to, the CK. The highest invasive species coverage appeared in the previously cultivated treatments. Species richness was higher with CK in the mixedgrass prairie but no differences were found in the more arid dry mixedgrass prairie. No differences were found among all treatments for species evenness, Simpson's index and Shannon–Wiener index. On average, in the 0–15 cm depth, SOC and TN contents with the previous cultivated treatments were still 20% and 16% lower than CK, respectively, whereas in the 15–30 cm depth, SOC and TN contents did not differ among all treatments except for SOC content in the mixedgrass prairie. Relative to CK, previously cultivated treatments had similar active carbon (AC), microbial respiration-carbon and NH4 +-N contents but the mixedgrass prairie had lower water extractable-organic carbon and water extractable-nitrogen. In contrast, in the dry mixedgrass prairie all labile organic fraction contents, except for AC, were the same among all treatments. Negative relationships were found between plant diversity and surface soil carbon and nitrogen storage. Our results indicate that for short-term disturbed rangeland, 9 years is likely sufficient for the recovery of soil labile organic fractions and plant diversity but a longer time will be needed for the recovery of SOC and TN. © 2018","Active carbon; Land use change; Soil recovery; Water extractable organic carbon; Water extractable organic nitrogen","abandoned land; activated carbon; extraction method; grass; land use change; organic carbon; organic nitrogen; soil organic matter; vegetation dynamics; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055559554

CO2 injection is considerably influenced by the interfacial interactions, capillary forces and viscous forces. Any change in the subsurface conditions of pressure, temperature, and salinity is likely to have an impact on the interfacial interactions, capillary forces and viscous forces, which, in turn, will have an influence on the injection, migration, displacement, and CO2 storage capacity. In this study, unsteady-state immiscible experimental investigations have been performed to explore the impact of fluid pressure, temperature, salinity (brine concentration and valency) and injection rate on the dynamic pressure evolution and displacement efficiency when CO2 as a liquid phase is injected into a water-saturated sandstone core sample. This study also highlights the impact of capillary forces and viscous forces on the two-phase flow properties and shows when capillary forces or viscous forces are dominant. The results reveal a moderate to considerable impact for the fluid pressure, temperature, injection rate, and salinity on the differential pressure profile, water recovery (WR), endpoint CO2 relative permeability (KrCO2), and cumulative produced volumes. Overall, increasing fluid pressure, CO2 injection rate and salinity (brine concentration and valency) cause an increase in the differential pressure profile; the highest increase occurred with the injection rate. In general, increasing temperature caused a reduction in the differential pressure profile. The WR is in range of around 61.6–69.3% while the KrCO2 is in range of 0.112–0.203, depending on the parameters investigated. Increasing fluid pressure and injection rate caused an increase in the WR; the highest increase occurred with the injection rate. On the other hand, increasing temperature and salinity caused a decrease in the WR; the highest reduction occurred with salinity. Nevertheless, the increase in fluid pressure, temperature, injection rate and salinity led to a reduction in the KrCO2; the highest reduction occurred with increasing temperature whilst the lowest occurred with increasing fluid pressure. The cumulative produced volumes decreased with fluid pressure and salinity but showed no noticeable change with temperature and injection rate. The capillary forces have less impact on the differential pressure profiles than viscous forces when fluid pressure, temperature and injection rate increase but the capillary forces show more impact as salinity increase. © 2018",,"Aquifers; Core samples; Geothermal energy; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogeology; Pressure; Sandstone; Temperature; Two phase flow; Differential pressures; Displacement efficiency; Experimental investigations; Hydrocarbon production; Increasing temperatures; Interfacial interaction; Relative permeability; Water-saturated sandstones; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059173599

But such enthusiasm largely overlooks that most of the Paris Agreement’s provisions represent continuity with existing climate policy, not a break with the past. This forum argues that the Paris Agreement is a dangerous form of incrementalism in two ways. First, it repackages existing rules that have already proven inadequate to reduce emissions and improve resilience. Second, state and nonstate actors celebrate the Agreement as a solution, conferring legitimacy on its rules; I suggest that, beyond the strong desire to avoid failure, developing countries and nongovernmental organizations accepted the Paris Agreement to secure the participation of the United States and to uphold previous agreements. Given the reification of existing rules, the ratchet-up mechanism and nonstate actors offer the last remaining hopes in global efforts to catalyze climate action on a scale necessary to safeguard the climate. © 2019 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"climate change; developing world; emission control; environmental policy; global perspective; nongovernmental organization; policy making; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062175325

MR products (MRPs) are common components of processed foods, mainly as a result of heating, especially in the Western diet. MRPs are classified as into three stages: initial, intermediate, and final stages, indicative of increased complexity and size, incurring different flavor, aroma, and texture. MRPs presence is known to reduce the nutritional quality of foods, particularly by reducing protein digestibility. Early reports have linked MRPs, especially advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) present in high concentration in the typical Western diet, to health conditions and diseases. However conflicting data has since been reported, and only a few (acrylamide, heterocyclic amines and 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural) MRPs have documented potential toxic or carcinogenic effects. High molecular weight MRPs are not available for direct absorption in the higher gastrointestinal tract, and are thus mostly metabolized by resident colonic microbes. MRPs have been the subject of sparse research interest in comparison with other non-digestible dietary elements. In this review, we outline the state of knowledge on MRPs in nutrition and health, and highlight the need to develop the limited knowledge on their impact on the gut microbiota and which metabolites derive from MRPs fermentation. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Advanced glycation end-products; gut microbiota; Maillard reaction products; metabolomics","Amides; Amines; Digestive system; Glycosylation; Reaction products; Textures; Thermal processing (foods); 5 hydroxymethyl furfurals; Advanced glycation end products; Gastrointestinal tract; Gut microbiota; High molecular weight; Maillard reaction products; Metabolomics; Protein digestibility; Nutrition; acrylamide; advanced glycation end product; cardiovascular disease; chemically induced; chemistry; digestive system; drug effect; food; food analysis; food handling; glycation; health status; heat; human; intestine flora; metabolic disorder; metabolism; nutritional status; nutritional value; protein intake; Western diet; Acrylamide; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diet, Western; Dietary Proteins; Digestive System; Food; Food Analysis; Food Handling; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Glycation End Products, Advanced; Health Status; Hot Temperature; Humans; Maillard Reaction; Metabolic Diseases; Nutritional Status; Nutritive Value",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063894588

But they also contribute heavily to the climate change through their choice of energy. Mostly prefer source is the fossil fuel for electricity generation despite the growing awareness of the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by embracing renewable energy technologies across the globe. Meanwhile, MSEs accounts for a large proportion of businesses in Lagos State, Nigeria and the situation is not different. Hence, this study investigated the factors influencing willingness to adopt renewable energy technologies among the MSEs. The study surveyed 385 MSEs between January and March, 2017 in Lagos State, Nigeria but found 223 suitable for the analysis. Using logit regression, the results showed that creating awareness and knowledge about renewable energy, adequate government policies, trust, peer-effect, development of renewable energy markets and technology acceptance factors (if it makes life easier, simple to use and improve the quality of work) are all positive and statistically significant in influencing the willingness to adopt renewable energy technologies among the MSEs.

Low energy consumption, renewable energy, and carbon footprints reduction are prime targets of a smart city. A smart city needs to be energy efficient and technology driven. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) helps to improve system efficiency and creates a way for the end consumer to communicate with utilities and the network service provider. The two-way communication model of a smart grid makes possible reliable, stable and efficient communication between utility and consumer by using ICT. The major issue in smart energy system is the lack of necessary interoperability and integration of communication standards, which hampers the effective deployment of communication networks. In this paper, we present a hierarchical architecture to resolve this issue, which will support smart energy system infrastructure and services in smart cities for provisioning of ubiquitous communication. It consists of two computing zones (fog computing and cloud computing) along with two implementation phases (initial and final). Fog computing will help to offer low latency response to anomalous and hazardous events in real time while reducing a burden on the cloud for computing as well as storage. To provide ubiquitous communication in smart energy system for data acquisition, a network selection algorithm has been proposed. TOPSIS MADM technique is employed for network selection in a heterogeneous environment at HAN/NAN (Bluetooth, Zigbee, Z-Wave, WLAN, LoRaWAN) and WAN (GPRS, UMTS, LTE, and WiMAX) levels of smart energy system's multilayer communication infrastructure. Coverage area, data rate, power consumption and security level attributes are employed for network selection. The results revealed that WLAN performed better in case of HAN/NAN environment, whereas LTE worked best at WAN level. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","HAN; ICT; IoT; NAN; Smart cities; Smart grid; Smart meter; WAN","Carbon footprint; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fog computing; Interoperability; Smart city; Smart meters; Smart power grids; Ubiquitous computing; Wide area networks; Wireless local area networks (WLAN); Wireless telecommunication systems; Communication infrastructure; Efficient communications; Heterogeneous environments; Hierarchical architectures; Information and Communication Technologies; Network service providers; Smart grid; Ubiquitous communication; Data communication systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058168852

This study aimed at investigating the effects of different operational parameters such as pH, salinity and types of ions on wettability alteration (WA) during low salinity brine injection as a tertiary recovery process. In the present study, using the electrostatic double-layer concept and molecular behavior, along with a good view of the past studies, led to the justification of the obtained results. The studied reservoir is one of the Middle East carbonate reservoirs which is considered for low salinity brine injection plan. Although the concept of ζ potential is ill-defined in electrostatic or/and electrokinetic topics, nonetheless, to the extent possible, has been tried to use this concept to illustrate and justify underlying mechanism during low salinity process beneficially. Resultant findings have shown that pH value directly affects carbonate rock powder ζ potential and determine the type of surrounding ions that form Stern layer and ion distribution in diffuse layer as well. A close examination at two temperatures of 25 °C and 80 °C, showed that active ions in WA e.g. Ca2+ and Mg2+ and SO4 2− as an agent facilitator to access active ions to the rock powder surface, have profound impacts on the Stern layer. The obtained optimal ions concentrations, (i.e., 1000 ppm sulfate + 1000 ppm magnesium @ 80 °C) and (500 ppm calcium and 800 ppm sulfate @ 25 °C) have changed the ζ potential of oil wet rock powder in Seawater form −23.6 mV to −6.71 mW and −8.7 mV respectively, using a new designed procedure. In the present study, influence of ion valence on the electrostatic double layer variation of an oil-wet rock powder has been led to directly link this alteration to the wettability state changes. Therefore, this approach could be very helpful to monitor the wettability state of the rock powder in molecular scale. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbonate rock; Electrostatic double layer; Ion concentration; Low salinity; Wettability alteration; ζ potential alteration index","Carbonates; Carbonation; Electrostatics; Ions; Magnesium powder; Molecules; Sedimentary rocks; Sulfur compounds; Wetting; Zeta potential; Alteration indices; Carbonate rock; Electrostatic double layer; Ion concentrations; Low salinity; Wettability alteration; Calcium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057329987

In this study, data for the rice production of 34 provinces in Indonesia at year of 2015 were gathered from the Indonesian statistical data on area cultivation, productivity, fertilizer application, diesel, and irrigated water. The CF of indirect and direct carbon emissions which were correlated with those agricultural intakes was calculated with reported emission factors. The result demonstrated the CFs mean in 34 provinces during dry and rainy season in Indonesia was 1,900,341.48 kg CO eq/ha and 1,892,825.68 kg CO eq/ha, respectively. The data also showed that the highest of CF production during dry and rainy seasons obtained by Belitung Islands and East Nusa Tenggara province, respectively. Meanwhile the lowest of CF production for both dry and rainy season belonged to Yogyakarta province.

We found that significant GHG mitigation is possible when substituting soybean oil for on-farm energy use, however, often the food market has higher economic value.

The environmental implications of these pumps are often overlooked and very rarely addressed in the IGP. Few studies in the past have estimated the amount of diesel consumed by irrigation pumps in the IGP or other proxy variables to estimate the amount of emissions. A considerable amount of uncertainty remains in calculating emission factors (EF) using real-time measurements. We measured pollutants from nine diesel irrigation pumps in the southern 'Terai' belt of Nepal. Fuel-based EF were then estimated using the carbon mass balance method. The average EF for fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), CO 2 , CO and black carbon (BC) were found to be 22.11 - 3.71, 2218.10 - 26.8, 275 - 17.18 and 2.54 - 0.71 g/L, respectively. Depending upon the pump characteristics (age, design, make, hours used, etc.) and fuel mixtures, the EF of PM 2.5 , BC and CO had larger inter-variability. This study provides estimates for an under-represented source of ambient air pollution which will assist in the development of better emission inventories and informed policy making. © 2019 by the authors.","Black carbon; Diesel irrigation pump; Emission factor; Particulate matter","Air pollution; Carbon; Irrigation; Uncertainty analysis; Ambient air pollution; Black carbon; Emission factors; Environmental implications; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Indo-Gangetic Plains; Particulate Matter; Real time measurements; Pumps; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; diesel; emission; Gangetic Plain; Nepal; Tarai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061286763

The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has a significant potential to not only reduce carbon emissions, but also to provide needed energy storage to contribute to the adoption of distributed renewable generation. This paper focuses on a design model and methodology for increasing EV adoption through automated swapping of battery packs at battery sharing stations (BShS) as a part of a battery sharing network (BShN), which would become integral to the smart grid. Current battery swapping methodologies are reviewed and a new practical approach is proposed considering both the technical and socio-economic impacts. The proposed BShS/BShN provides novel solutions to some of the most preeminent challenges that EV adoption faces today such as range anxiety, grid reliability, and cost. Challenges and advancements specific to this solution are also discussed. © 2019 by the authors.","Battery energy control module (BECM) electric vehicle (EV); Battery energy storage system (BESS); Battery sharing network (BShN); Battery sharing station (BShS); Battery swapping station (BSS); Direct current fast charging (DCFC); State of charge (SOC); State of health (SOH); Universal battery pack (UBP); Zero emission vehicle (ZEV)","Autonomous vehicles; Battery Pack; Carbon; Charging (batteries); Data storage equipment; Direct carbon fuel cells (DCFC); Electric automobiles; Energy storage; Battery energy storage systems; Battery sharing station (BShS); Battery swapping; Control module; Fast charging; Sharing network; State of charge; State of health; Universal battery pack (UBP); Zero emission vehicles; Battery management systems",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061992276

CO was measured by two Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometers (IASI-A and IASI-B), NH3 by IASI-A, IASIB, and the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), and NO2 by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Daily emission rates were calculated from the satellite measurements using fire hotspot information from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and wind information from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis, combined with assumptions on lifetimes and the altitude range of the plume. Sensitivity tests were performed and it was found that uncertainties of emission estimates are more sensitive to the plume shape for CO and to the lifetime for NH3 and NOx . The satellite-derived emission rates were 50-300 kt d1 for CO, 1-7 kt d1 for NH3, and 0.5-2 kt d1 for NOx (expressed as NO) during the most active fire periods. The daily satellite-derived emission estimates were found to correlate fairly well (R 0:4-0.7) with daily output from the ECMWF Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) and the Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) FireWork models, with agreement within a factor of 2 for most comparisons. Emission ratios of NH3=CO, NOx=CO, and NOx=NH3 were calculated and compared against enhancement ratios of surface concentrations measured at permanent surface air monitoring stations and by the Alberta Environment and Parks Mobile Air Monitoring Laboratory (MAML). For NH3=CO, the satellite emission ratios of 0.02 are within a factor of 2 of the model emission ratios and surface enhancement ratios. For NOx=CO satellite-measured emission ratios of 0:01 are lower than the modelled emission ratios of 0.033 for GFAS and 0.014 for FireWork, but are larger than the surface enhancement ratios of 0:003, which may have been affected by the short lifetime of NOx . Total emissions from the Horse River fire for May 2016 were calculated and compared against total annual anthropogenic emissions for the province of Alberta in 2016 from the ECCC Air Pollutant Emissions Inventory (APEI). Satellite-measured emissions of CO are 1500 kt for the Horse River fire and exceed the total annual Alberta anthropogenic CO emissions of 992.6 kt for 2016. The satellite-measured emissions during the Horse River fire of 30 kt of NH3 and 7 kt of NOx (expressed as NO) are approximately 20% and 1% of the magnitude of total annual Alberta anthropogenic emissions, respectively. © 2019.

The principal component analysis and variations of benthic foraminifera in the core divided the recent bottom sediments of the lagoon into three intervals. The basal interval (below 110 cm) composed of low organic carbon, high carbonate, white-grey, bioclastic sandy mud enriched in oligotrophic, clear water, hypersaline symbiont-bearing species indicating deposition under unpolluted, natural lagoonal conditions with clear, high salinity waters. The middle interval (45 cm thick) showed a very rapid environmental change with deposition under unpolluted, natural lagoonal conditions as well but in a normal Red Sea salinity water due to a rapid overturn as evidenced by the decrease of hypersaline symbiont-bearing species.

An imbalance between harmful and protective gut bacteria, termed dysbiosis, has been linked to many diseases and has most often been attributed to high-fat dietary intake. However, we recently clarified that the type of fat, not calories, were important in the development of murine colitis. To further understand the host-microbe dynamic in response to dietary lipids, we fed mice isocaloric high-fat diets containing either milk fat, corn oil or olive oil and performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the colon microbiome and mass spectrometry-based relative quantification of the colonic metaproteome. The corn oil diet, rich in omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, increased the potential for pathobiont survival and invasion in an inflamed, oxidized and damaged gut while saturated fatty acids promoted compensatory inflammatory responses involved in tissue healing. We conclude that various lipids uniquely alter the host-microbe interaction in the gut. While high-fat consumption has a distinct impact on the gut microbiota, the type of fatty acids alters the relative microbial abundances and predicted functions. These results support that the type of fat are key to understanding the biological effects of high-fat diets on gut health. © 2019 by the authors.

Single-photon sources based on solid state emitters such as quantum dots are very advantageous for integrated photonic circuits, but they can suffer from a high two-photon emission probability, which in cases of noncryogenic environment cannot be spectrally filtered. Here we propose two temporal purification-by-heralding methods for using a two-photon emission process to yield highly pure and efficient single-photon emission, bypassing the inherent problem of spectrally overlapping biphoton emission at elevated temperatures. We experimentally emulate their feasibility on the emission from a single nanocrystal quantum dot at room temperature, exhibiting single-photon purities exceeding 99.5%, without a significant loss of single-photon efficiency. By utilizing these methods with commercially available components, nanocrystal quantum dots can be made realistic high-quality room-temperature sources for single photons. These approaches can also be applied for any indeterministic source of spectrally broadband photon pairs. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","heralded single photons; nanocrystal quantum dots; nanophotonics; semiconductor nanocrystals; single photon purification; single photon source","Elementary particle sources; Nanocrystals; Nanophotonics; Particle beams; Photons; Purification; Heralded single photons; Nanocrystal quantum dots; Semiconductor nanocrystals; Single photons; Single-photon source; Semiconductor quantum dots",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061526142

We target maximum net operating revenue, by generating forecasts of power plant load and CO2 capture rate, and while subject to the dual operational and environmental constraints. Four different hypothetical Australian Carbon Credit Unit (ACCU) prices ($AU 5, 15, 25 and 50/tonne CO2) are evaluated, through a single objective multi-constrained optimisation algorithm, for a 7-year contract period between 2016 and 2020 and with a 7.1 MT CO2 of emission baseline. The results indicate that at ACCU price of $AU 25/tonne CO2 (Scenario 3), represents a feasible solution for future deployment of PCC technology under ERF project settings. Across the contract period, PCC plant captures 90% CO2 from the power plant emissions with total plant net operating revenue at approximately $AU 1,765 million. The gross revenue gains from ERF incentive and selling of electricity are at 25% and 75% respectively. These findings point to the value of this computational approach for power plant operators in Australia considering low emissions technologies (viz. PCC) as ERF projects, aiding in their short and medium-term planning.

WTE is rarely implemented in developing countries, mostly due to the lack of knowledge and experience under their specific local conditions. The present research investigates the feasibility of WTE strategies in middle income developing countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Multiple waste management scenarios, involving incineration and anaerobic digestion, were evaluated based on energy, economic, and environmental parameters. A multi-criteria assessment was conducted for the Governorate of Kafr El-Sheikh (Egypt); a 3.2-million rural-urban agro-industrial population with socio-economic and demographic features similar to those of the selected MENA countries. The actual waste generation rates and characteristics of Kafr El-Sheikh were measured through a comprehensive field study. It was found that anaerobic digestion with recycling is the optimum strategy for Kafr El-Sheikh, with annual energy potential of 1170-kWh per ton of waste and net economic savings of 6.5 million USD. This optimum waste management scenario was extended to the selected MENA countries to investigate potential benefits of shifting to WTE-based waste management strategies.
